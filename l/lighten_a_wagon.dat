50|$|It {{is common}} among some artistic {{painters}} to darken a paint color by adding black paint—producing colors called shades—or to <b>lighten</b> <b>a</b> color by adding white—producing colors called tints. However, {{this is not}} always the best way for representational painting, since an unfortunate result is for colors to also shift in their hues. For instance, darkening a color by adding black can cause colors such as yellows, reds and oranges, to shift toward the greenish or bluish part of the spectrum. <b>Lightening</b> <b>a</b> color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue when mixed with reds and oranges. Another practice when darkening a color is to use its opposite, or complementary, color (e.g. violet-purple added to yellowish-green) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue, and darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color. When <b>lightening</b> <b>a</b> color this hue shift can be corrected {{with the addition of a}} small amount of an adjacent color to bring the hue of the mixture back in line with the parent color (e.g. adding a small amount of orange to a mixture of red and white will correct the tendency of this mixture to shift slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum).|$|R
