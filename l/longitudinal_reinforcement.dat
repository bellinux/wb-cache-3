40|$|An {{experimental}} study on diagonal shear cracks of concrete beams without stirrups was carried out. A total of twenty four reinforced concrete beams, consisted of twelve beams reinforced with GFRP bars and twelve beams reinforced with conventional steel bars, were tested up to failure. Test variables {{in this study}} were: (1) concrete compressive strength; (2) <b>longitudinal</b> <b>reinforcement</b> ratio; and (3) shear span-effective depth ratio. Beam capacities, slope of the diagonal shear cracks, strains at the maximum concrete compression fiber and selected position of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>reinforcement</b> were observed during the test. The diagonal shear cracking loads obtained from the test were compared to that calculated using empirical equations available in ACI code and Eurocode 2. The test results showed that shear strength of beams reinforced with GFRP bars was {{lower than that of}} the beams with conventional steel bars. It was found that the ratio of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>reinforcement</b> significantly influences the failure type and crack pattern in the shear span zone.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple closed-form {{approximation}} of the axial force-bending moment interaction diagram for solid and hollow circular reinforced concrete (RC) cross-sections with an arbitrary number of layers of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The implemented nonlinear material models {{are those of}} the European building code.

On the other hand, the elastic-perfectly plastic behavior is assumed for the reinforcing steel bars. The proposed semi-exact closed-form approximation involves one parameter only, which is calibrated by means of a numerical optimization procedure taking into account a large database of cross-sections. Moreover, an efficient procedure is developed for the design of the outer layer of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in solid or hollow circular RC cross-sections under combined axial force and bending moment (the mechanical ratio of any other layers of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is considered as known function of the mechanical ratio of the outer layer of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>reinforcement).</b> Finally, several numerical examples are included to demonstrate the accuracy of the approximated axial force-bending moment interaction diagram and the effectiveness of the derived design procedure...|$|E

30|$|Eccentrically loaded {{reinforced}} concrete columns are commonly exist in practice {{due to the}} existence of some bending moments. The eccentricity of the supported beams as well as the unavoidable imperfections of construction are the main sources of the developed bending moments in the columns under gravity loads.

Therefore, the strength of the columns is controlled by the compressive strength of concrete, the tensile strength of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>reinforcements</b> and the geometry of the column’ cross-section (Park and Paulay 1975; Nilson 2004; McCormac 1998; Yalcin and Saatcioglu 2000; MacGregor and Wight 2009).
