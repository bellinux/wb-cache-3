5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in ยง 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in ยง 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, we {{are forced}} to testify that Bourguiba's Tunisia could no more be called secular than Ben Ali's or the rest of the Arab Muslim states, for more than a {{neutrality}} of orientation and the religious freedom of the state, secularism implies the autonomy of public and religious institutions. The reality is that the institutional presence of Islam in Tunisia, although strictly circumscribed, is truly a constant reference, implicit or explicit, legitimizing the regime's direction. Certainly, Tunisian public services are accessible to all without distinction of creed and the constitution guarantees religious freedom, so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not threaten public order, but Islam remains the state religion, {{to the extent that it}} is said it is obligatory for the president of the republic to be able to assert it.|$|E
25|$|MEG is {{also being}} used to better {{localize}} responses in the brain. The openness of the MEG setup allows external auditory and visual stimuli to be easily introduced. Some movement by the subject is also possible as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not jar the subject's head. The responses in the brain before, during, and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with EEG. Psychologists are also taking advantage of MEG neuroimaging to better understand relationships between brain function and behavior. For example, {{a number of studies}} have been done comparing the MEG responses of patients with psychological troubles to control patients. There has been great success isolating unique responses in patients with schizophrenia, such as auditory gating deficits to human voices. MEG {{is also being}} used to correlate standard psychological responses, such as the emotional dependence of language comprehension.|$|E
25|$|The second, {{and older}} {{hallmark}} of the employment contract is that employees are bound to follow their employersโ instructions while at work, so long as that does not contravene statute or their agreed terms. Every employment relation leaves the employer with a residue of discretion, historically expressed as the โmaster-servantโ relationship. Today, in practice, this leaves the employer {{with the ability to}} vary the way work is done in accordance with business need. The courts have allowed this to continue, so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not contradict a contractโs express terms, which always require an employeeโs consent, or renegotiation of a collective agreement. The status of โflexibility clausesโ, purporting to allow employers the discretion to vary any contract term has been contested, as it will often enable abuse of power that the common law controls. The limits of the courtsโ tolerance for such practices are evident if they touch procedures for accessing justice, or potentially if they would contravene the duty of mutual trust and confidence.|$|E

Military postage rates are equivalent to U.S. domestic postage rates because the Services pay the second destination transportation (SDT) costs to, from, and between MPOs.

25|$|The 1906 Water Law (Ley general de aguas) {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of Bolivia's 20th Century water resources policy.

The definition of water rights is vague, โthe water passing through the land belongs to the land owner as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not affect others.โ No provision is included for neither groundwater property rights nor water tariffs. The Water Law was minimally modified on 1945, to specify that โno water right includes the right to deny access to water to downstream water users.โ In 1988, the Senate prepared a draft to modify the Water Law to include provisions such as groundwater as public domain, and to establish a water fee for farmers based on the area benefited with improved irrigation infrastructure. Similar attempts occurred in 1995 and 1999, when the government together with the World Bank and GTZ drafted a Water Law including some fundamental principles included in the 1988 version plus provisions on institutional framework and concessions of water rights. None of the three drafts turned into a new Water Law.|$|E
