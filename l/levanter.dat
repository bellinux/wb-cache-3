5|$|Gibraltar {{has three}} marinas: Marina Bay, Ocean Village Marina, and Queensway Quay Marina. Ocean Village Marina {{is located on}} Gibraltar's Westside, outside the {{northern}} end of Gibraltar Harbour, in the Bay of Gibraltar, next to the airport runway. It is adjacent to Marina Bay which is just to its north. The marina forms part of the Ocean Village Project or Ocean Village Marina Complex, often referred to as just Ocean Village. Ocean Village Marina is the former Sheppard's Marina or Sheppard's Yard. Both Marina Bay and Ocean Village Marina have been incorporated into Ocean Village, between the North Mole and the airport runway. The strategic location of the marina offers protection from moisture-laden <b>Levanter</b> winds.|$|E
25|$|The {{streets are}} fairly wide and straight, {{and many of}} the houses {{belonging}} to aristocratic families, descendants of those expelled from Al-Andalus by the Spanish Reconquista, possess marble fountains and have groves planted with orange trees. Within the houses the ceilings are often exquisitely carved and painted in Hispano-Moresque designs, such as are found in the Alhambra of Granada, and the tile-work for which Tetuan is known may be seen on floors, pillars and dados. The traditional industries are tilework, inlaying with silver wire, and the manufacture of thick-soled yellow slippers, much-esteemed flintlocks, and artistic towels used as cape and skirt by Arabic girls in rural areas. The Jews lived in a mellah, separated {{from the rest of the}} town by gates which were closed at night. The harbour of Tetuan was obstructed by a bar, over which only small vessels can pass, and the roadstead, sheltered to the north, Northwest and south, is exposed to the east, and is at times unsafe in consequence of the strong <b>Levanter.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{feeling the}} draft of wind in the tunnel on that <b>Levanter</b> day in December 1997, the Gibraltar Caving Group had pushed aside some {{corrugated}} metal sheets, and found a bricked-in area of the wall. Carefully removing some bricks, they soon revealed a doorway behind the bricked-in area of the tunnel. In addition to the observations posts, including a concrete slab for that on the west, the men found {{the remains of a}} bicycle. They also located the tubing which sheathed the aerial rod along the stairs. Cork tiles on the floor provided insulation for purposes of both warmth and sound. They were in two patterns and shapes: square tiles arranged around the periphery of the room, presumably to indicate storage areas, and narrow tiles in a herringbone pattern in the main area of the room centrally. During the course of a 28-minute documentary that was filmed and produced in 1998, the team turned on the brass tap over the wash pit supplied by the 10,000 gallon water tank. The water, while initially black, soon ran clear. The men kept the location of the cave a secret for three months while they researched it. The documentary, Operation Tracer – Stay Behind Cave, was published in April 2012 (link to documentary below).|$|E

500|$|In 1879 {{the growing}} threat of ultra-heavy naval {{artillery}} {{led to the}} installation of two giant RML 17.72 inch guns, dubbed the [...] "100 ton guns" [...] – the biggest, heaviest and among the last muzzle-loading artillery pieces ever made. They were never used in anger and were not particularly reliable, suffering from a rate of fire of only one shot every four minutes. They were soon replaced by more reliable and powerful breech-loading guns {{and the process of}} pulling back the guns to retired sites continued until it reached its logical end point of situating the principal batteries on the very peak of the Rock, [...] above sea level. At this height, weather and communications became serious problems. Gibraltar is prone to a weather formation called the <b>Levanter</b> cloud, which often obscures the top of the Rock. Telegraphic cables were installed criss-crossing the Rock to allow the batteries to communicate with observation posts situated lower down. The observers would plot the movement of enemy targets and transmit the coordinates to the batteries high above.|$|E

6000|$|... "Just the {{difference}} between smooth water and rough--you ruffle {{the surface of a}} canal with a lazy oar, while I run the channel of Piombino in a mistral, shoot the Faro of Messina in a white squall, double Santa Maria di Leuca in a breathing <b>Levanter,</b> and come skimming up the Adriatic before a sirocco that is hot enough to cook my maccaroni, and which sets the whole sea boiling worse than the caldrons of Scylla." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are two things, Signor Roderigo, {{on which}} I value myself, but always, I hope, with Christian moderation. As a mariner of the coast, in mistral or sirocco, <b>levanter</b> or zephyr, few can claim more practice; and for knowing an {{acquaintance}} in a carnival, I believe {{the father of}} evil himself could not be so disguised that eye of mine should not see his foot! For anticipating a gale, or looking behind a mask, Signor Roderigo, I know not my own equal among men of small learning." ...|$|E
60|$|After lying {{several weeks}} at Almeria, the ship {{got under way}} for England again. We had fresh {{westerly}} gales, and beat to and fro, between Europe and Africa, for some time, when we got a <b>Levanter</b> that shoved us out into the Atlantic at a furious rate. In the Straits we passed a squadron of Portuguese frigates, that was cruising against the Algerines. It was the practice of these ships to lie at the Rock until it blew strong enough from the eastward to carry vessels through the Gut, when they weighed and kept in the offing until the wind shifted. This was blockading the Atlantic against their enemies, and the Mediterranean against their own ships.|$|E
60|$|Thus, seeming {{as much to}} {{bear the}} {{elemental}} commission of Nature, as the military warrant of Congress, swarthy Paul darted hither and thither; hovering like a thundercloud off the crowded harbors; then, beaten off by an adverse wind, discharging his lightnings on uncompanioned vessels, whose solitude made them a more conspicuous and easier mark, like lonely trees on the heath. Yet all this while the land was full of garrisons, the embayed waters full of fleets. With the impunity of a <b>Levanter,</b> Paul skimmed his craft in the land-locked heart of the supreme naval power of earth; a torpedo-eel, unknowingly swallowed by Britain in a draught of old ocean, and making sad havoc with her vitals.|$|E
60|$|Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the <b>Levanter</b> and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod's circumnavigating wake.|$|E
6000|$|... "They do {{not love}} the blockading service, {{and it is}} little wonder, since neither money nor honour is to be gained at it. You can {{remember}} how {{it was in the}} winter months before Toulon, Stone, when we had neither firing, wine, beef, pork, nor flour aboard the ships, nor a spare piece of rope, canvas, or twine. We braced the old hulks with our spare cables, and God knows there was never a <b>Levanter</b> that I did not expect it to send us to the bottom. But we held our grip all the same. Yet I fear that we do not get much credit for it here in England, Stone, where they light the windows for a great battle, but they do not understand that it is easier for us to fight the Nile six times over, than to keep our station all winter in the blockade. But I pray God that we may meet this new fleet of theirs and settle the matter by a pell-mell battle." ...|$|E

Khadir Ghaïlan had mounted a major attack on the city in 1657, forcing the governor and garrison to appeal to Portugal for assistance.|$|E
50|$|Gibraltar has {{a typical}} Mediterranean climate, moderated {{by the sea}} that almost {{surrounds}} the peninsula. Summers are warm and dry, while winters are cool and wet.Temperatures range from 13.4 °C to 24.2 °C (56.1 °F to 75.6 °F).Annual rainfall is about 768 mm.The <b>Levanter</b> clouds provide condensation that keeps the vegetation green even in the dry season.These clouds form when moisture-laden easterly winds are forced upward by the cliffs of Gibraltar, and often form a cap over the Rock.|$|E
50|$|Gales {{from between}} north-north-east and {{east-north-east}} {{are the most}} important gales of the east coast of Spain. They are known locally as llevantades (in Catalan) and are an intense form of the llevant or <b>levanter,</b> i.e., north-easterly winds of long fetch, as opposed to diurnal coastal breezes. These gales are most frequent and dangerous in spring and autumn (February to May and October to December), and are generally associated with slow-moving depressions crossing the Mediterranean between France and Algeria.|$|E
50|$|Levant Battery is an {{artillery}} battery in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. It {{is located on}} Windmill Hill, {{at the southern end}} of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, below observation post Fire Control South. It was named after the <b>Levanter</b> cloud, below which it perched, giving it an unobstructed view. Construction started in 1901 and, by 1903, a 9.2-inch Mark X breech-loading gun had been mounted. The battery was decommissioned in the 1970s and the gun was later removed, to rest in a scrap yard. A community group has been formed to garner support for the gun's recovery and restoration.|$|E
50|$|Example flows {{include the}} surface winds blowing through the Strait of Gibraltar - {{one of the}} strongest winds in this region is called <b>Levanter.</b> Similar winds occur at other gaps in {{mountain}} ranges, such as the tehuantepecer and the jochwinde, and in long channels, such as the Strait of Juan de Fuca between the Olympic Mountains of Washington and Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Hinlopen Strait near Spitsbergen. In the Columbia River Gorge on the border of Washington and Oregon, the high frequency of gap winds has led to the installation of wind farms, and the large amount of wind surfing that takes place on the Columbia River.|$|E

The site of the previous brewery and later barracks is now open ground which is utilised by the military for target practice. While the reservoir had been thought to fill with water that drains along the fractures of the nearby Beefsteak Fault, recent investigation has led researchers to believe that it fills with a combination of rain, street flushing, and sea spray, particularly during <b>levanter</b> winds.|$|E

50|$|The wind {{rises in}} the central Mediterranean or around the Balearic Islands and blows westwards {{reaching}} its greatest intensity through the Strait of Gibraltar. The winds are moist carrying fog and precipitation in {{the eastern side of}} the Strait, but dry in the western side, as the moisture rains on the mountains between Algeciras and Tarifa. The winds are well known for creating a particular cloud formation above the Rock of Gibraltar; In Almería, the winds are well known for making the temperatures rise as the wind blows across the desert interior of the province. The <b>Levanter</b> winds can occur at any time in the year, but are most common from May to October.|$|E
50|$|Levant Battery is in Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory at the {{southern}} end of the Iberian Peninsula. The artillery battery is located at {{the southern}} end of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, on Windmill Hill, east of Jews' Gate Cemetery and south of Mediterranean Road (links to maps below). It is positioned below the observation post Fire Control South. Levant Battery was in what was referred to as the Middle South Section. The other emplacements in that section included Edward VII Battery, Genista Battery, Jews' (Gate) Cemetery Battery, Engineer Battery, and Europa Advance Battery. The battery received its name from its position below the <b>Levanter</b> cloud, which afforded it an unobstructed field of view when other, higher batteries were limited by reduced visibility.|$|E

5000|$|Alfonso now faced {{a severe}} dilemma. A {{persistent}} <b>Levanter</b> wind had prevented his resupply ships {{from entering the}} bay and his army now had only a day's rations left. He reluctantly agreed to his nobles' insistence {{that they had to}} withdraw to Castilian territory, abandoning the men left on the Rock, who were to [...] "take their stand on whatever God might wish to give them." [...] However, the situation changed again only a few miles into the retreat from their base at Carteia. Accounts differ as to what happened; some say that Alfonso persuaded his nobles that it would be dishonorable to abandon the trapped men, while others say that the winds changed at the last minute and permitted the resupply vessels to enter the bay after all. Whichever happened, it is evident that the Castilians marched back to their original position to resume the assault on Gibraltar.|$|E
5000|$|Near the surface, the <b>levanter</b> is moist, but is unsaturated. As {{the moist}} air, {{which must be}} capped to be stable and so unable to rise by convection, is forced to rise over the Rock, the {{moisture}} condenses to form a cloud which streams away west from its top. If wind speeds are too low and stability high in the near-surface layer, the cloud does not form and condensation is also sensitive to small changes in moisture content, such that when the wind across the Rock veers into the southeast, the flow becomes too dry for the cloud to form, bringing drier air from North Africa. When the wind speed is too low, the air is blocked and unable to rise to form the cloud. At high wind speeds, the turbulent mixing to the lee of the Rock distributes the moisture through a comparatively deep layer and the cloud is, at best, very broken. Often it dissolves immediately west of the Rock in these turbulent windy conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{streets are}} fairly wide and straight, {{and many of}} the houses {{belonging}} to aristocratic families, descendants of those expelled from Al-Andalus by the Spanish Reconquista, possess marble fountains and have groves planted with orange trees. Within the houses the ceilings are often exquisitely carved and painted in Hispano-Moresque designs, such as are found in the Alhambra of Granada, and the tile-work for which Tetuan is known may be seen on floors, pillars and dados. The traditional industries are tilework, inlaying with silver wire, and the manufacture of thick-soled yellow slippers, much-esteemed flintlocks, and artistic towels used as cape and skirt by Arabic girls in rural areas. The Jews lived in a mellah, separated {{from the rest of the}} town by gates which were closed at night.
