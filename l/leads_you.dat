500|$|Flower was {{developed}} as a spiritual successor to Flow, a 2006 Flash game created by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark while the two were students at the University of Southern California. Flow was later developed into a PlayStation 3 game by Thatgamecompany in 2007 and a PlayStation Portable game by SuperVillain Studios in 2008. Flower was Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game outside the safety net of academia". It was first announced at the Tokyo Game Show on September 24, 2007, and was released on the PlayStation Network on February 12, 2009. Flower was intended primarily to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as [...] "an emotional shelter". Six to nine people were involved at varying stages of development. Chen, who co-founded Thatgamecompany with game producer Kellee Santiago, was the creative director {{in charge of the}} game, while Clark was the lead designer. Chen described the game as [...] "an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature". He decided on the [...] "nature" [...] theme early in the development process, saying that he [...] "had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal in your living room, it <b>leads</b> <b>you</b> to somewhere else.

[...] Chen designed the game around the idea that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. To make Flower have the [...] "emotional spectrum" [...] that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a [...] "fun" [...] game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. In 2008, during Flowers development, Chen was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 {{as one of the top}} 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.|$|E

500|$|Audition {{has been}} {{described}} as an influence on [...] "torture porn". The term was invented by David Edelstein to describe films such as Saw, The Devil's Rejects and Wolf Creek that offer [...] "titillating and shocking" [...] scenes that push the audience to the margins of depravity for them to [...] "feel something". Audition influenced American directors such as Eli Roth. Roth stated that Audition influenced him to make his film Hostel, with Miike even making a cameo as a satisfied customer of the kidnappers who let customers torture their victims. Richard Corliss, writing in Time, opined that Audition was different from torture porn films as: [...] "unlike Saw and its imitators in the genre of torture porn, Audition doesn't go for gore-ific money shots. Miike's films live inside their characters, taking the temperature of their longings, the ridiculous ambitions they chase so obsessively and their need to experience the extreme to prove they're alive". Audition was listed by twin directors Jen and Sylvia Soska as one of their favourite horror films, and with the sisters saying that it was an influence on their film American Mary. The directors noted the character of Asami, stating that an audience generally sees: [...] "female characters in a horror film as the helpless victim. This film <b>leads</b> <b>you</b> in one direction, skillfully hinting at a darker storyline for the otherwise meek and slight Asami until the final 15 minutes where we are introduced to a merciless monster. A perfect personification of the irrational rage of a woman scorned". Director Quentin Tarantino included Audition in his list of top 20 films released since 1992 (the year he became a director). Audition was among the films included in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors regarding public opinion about illegal immigration is the level of unemployment; anti-illegal immigrant sentiment is highest where unemployment is highest and vice versa. In general, some say that illegal immigrants are taking away jobs from Americans; however businesses and agricultural groups disagree and say that migrant workers are needed to fill unattractive jobs. This is further supported by a May 2006 New York Times/CBS News Poll report that 53 percent of Americans felt [...] "illegal immigrants mostly take the jobs Americans don't want". However, there are others who say that illegal immigration helps to [...] "decimate the bargaining leverage of the American worker. If you use a form of labor recruitment that bids down the cost of labor, that <b>leads</b> <b>you</b> to a society where a small number are very, very rich, there's nobody in the middle, and everyone is left scrambling for crumbs at the bottom. Yet there are still others who say that the U.S. [...] "has an economy that depends on illegal immigration" [...] and [...] "without illegal immigration labor, it would almost certainly not be possible to produce the same volume of food in the country." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what <b>leads</b> <b>you</b> to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{noting that}} Lungu's Băieți de gașcă stories {{inherently}} fail to explore [...] "a more profound vision", Crețu argues: [...] "Dan Lungu [...] manages to render this shortcoming relative through irresistible comedy: {{not one of}} word play , but one of situation." [...] The volume's eponymous story thus alternates between the apparent seriousness of gang culture and the obstacles they face as individuals, with episodes such as one gang member's frustrations over his girlfriend's nymphomania. Other sections of the volume strike a different note, and include a fictionalized account {{the life of a}} young Englishwoman who decides to settle in Romania. Focusing on Lungu's ability to surprise his readers, Teodorescu commented: [...] "Once in a while, if one does not want to let himself be conquered by his tricks, one may have reactions of mistrust [...] Dan Lungu anticipates this reaction as well and builds up complicity for what he does, like a prestidigitator who, {{at the same time as}} jokingly letting you in on how he has made you believe that he was able to cut himself in two, <b>leads</b> <b>you</b> into the fog of the next trick [...] Whoever carefully reads Dan Lungu gets a free lesson in the manipulation techniques to which all those who wish to have us convinced of the truth in non-literary fiction will expose us without warning and at times successfully." [...] Cristea-Enache, who praised Băieți de gașcă for displaying [...] "natural breathing", [...] "stylistic mobility" [...] and [...] "dexterity", also argued: [...] "When the young prose author will manage to inject more substance into both his stories and novels, we shall have in him a leading exponent of this new-old literature." ...|$|E
