40|$|A rapid {{non-destructive}} Image Analysis (IA) {{technique was}} developed for the determination of maize kernel endosperm vitreousness. Kernels were analysed using a Leica Q-Win Q 500 IW-DX Image Analyser fitted with <b>Leica</b> <b>Q-Win</b> <b>software</b> and connected to a Sony XC- 75 CCD camera. Kernel translucency measurements were optimised by using a light system that involved positioning whole kernels {{on top of a}} mask containing round illuminated areas (circles), smaller than the projected areas of the kernels, allowing light to shine through the kernels only. Correction factors allowing for constant illumination of kernels were developed to adjust for kernel size variation in relation to constant light area. Similarly, a correction factor for the effect of kernel thickness on detected translucency values were developed. Significant correlations were found between corrected translucency values and vitreous and opaque endosperm yields as determined by hand dissection. These were: translucency {{as a percentage of the}} whole kernel and vitreous endosperm (mass%) (Translucency 1), r = 0. 77, p 3. 9 mm was 0. 67, p< 0. 001. The IA technique permits the non-destructive analysis of maize endosperm translucency on large samples of single kernels. It is suitable for rapid quantification of maize endosperm contents and predicting dry maize milling performance, as kernel translucency was significantly correlated with vitreousness in all instances. With further development of specific hardware and software, the technique has potential as an on¬line maize kernel classification system in industrial mills. As the method is non¬destructive, it is also suitable for classification of maize seed breeding material. It is also a potential method for the measurement of maize opacity as used by the wet milling industry, where opacity (the opposite of vitreousness) is related to maize starch yield.
