500|$|On March 5, Martínez {{testified against}} Cisneros {{and told the}} jury that she ordered Fischer's murder. Martínez said that Cisneros told her to keep the plan a secret and that she wanted him [...] "good and dead". Speaking in Spanish through an interpreter, Martínez <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> her seat and pointed at Cisneros, saying she told her exactly that. Defense {{attorneys}} tried to discredit Martínez' testimony and show the jury {{that she was a}} con-woman. They presented letters from several of her former clients who had paid around US$600 for love potions. One woman from San Antonio said that Martínez consulted her after she began having problems with her boyfriend and did not see positive results. Martínez denied knowing who the writers were, but changed her mind when the defense read the letters to her and the jury. She admitted that she used herbs, oils, and holy water in her sessions, and that she kept a human skull in her shop. She did not call herself a curandera (fortune teller) because she did not study for to earn the title. Martínez was then asked to read her cards for one of the attorney's in the courtroom to show the jury how she worked.|$|E
2500|$|Nicknamed [...] "The Leaning Tower of Depeiaza" [...] {{because of}} the way he <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> his {{defensive}} shots, Depeiaza worked as a customs clerk. He moved to England and played league and Minor Counties cricket in the 1960s and 1970s. He died in 1995 at Manchester, England.|$|E

60|$|The silver, {{sparkling}} figure above {{seems to}} <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> the laurels and, confident of escape, {{listens to the}} little figure below.|$|R
60|$|They {{are back}} in their old seats, and Mr. Don <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> gleeful anticipation. Probably Dick is leaning <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> the same way, and this old father is merely copying him.|$|R

60|$|David <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> his chair. His {{eyes were}} bright, his tone eager.|$|E
60|$|The yellow lights {{danced in}} his eyes, he <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> real rage.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} chorus of assent. Fenn <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> his place.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Truefitt rumpled {{his hair}} irritably {{and for some}} time sat silent. Then he <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> and, <b>in</b> a voice {{trembling}} with excitement, whispered in the lady’s ear.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You villain!' cried a voice, {{and there}} was Sibylle {{standing}} in {{the opening of the}} curtains at one of the windows. Her face was pale with anger and her eyes shining with scorn; the parting curtains framed her tall, slim figure, which <b>leaned</b> <b>forwards</b> <b>in</b> her fury of passion. She had forgotten the Emperor, the Empress, everything, in her revulsion of feeling against this craven whom she had loved.|$|R
60|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{and whispered}} <b>in</b> the comedian's ear. The latter nodded {{and turned to}} the rival bidder.|$|R

60|$|Wyllard sat silent {{a moment}} or two, and then <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> his chair.|$|E
50|$|Epiglottitis is {{inflammation}} of the epiglottis—the flap {{at the base of}} the tongue that keeps food from going into the trachea (windpipe). Symptoms are usually rapid in onset and include trouble swallowing which can result in drooling, changes to the voice, fever, and an increased breathing rate. As the epiglottis is in the upper airway, swelling can interfere with breathing. People may <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> an effort to open the airway. As the condition worsens stridor and bluish skin may occur.|$|R
60|$|Deyes <b>leaned</b> {{suddenly}} <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> his chair. He {{felt that}} his intervention dissipated a dramatic interest, {{of which he}} was keenly conscious, but he could not keep silence any longer.|$|R
60|$|Her {{words were}} so softly spoken {{that they seemed}} to melt away. She <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> to look <b>in</b> his face.|$|R

25|$|When the {{shooting}} began, the terrorists told their hostages to <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> the theater seats and cover their heads behind the seats. Hostages reported {{that some people}} in the audience fell asleep, and some of the gunmen put on respirators. As the terrorists and hostages alike began to fall unconscious, several of the female terrorists made a dash for the balcony but passed out before they reached the stairs. They were later found shot dead. Two of the Alpha Group were also overcome by the gas.|$|R
50|$|For a {{horizontal}} Leica-type FP shutter, {{the image is}} stretched if the object moves {{in the same direction}} as the shutter curtains, and compressed if travelling in the opposite direction of them. For a downward firing vertical Square-type FP shutter, the top of the image <b>leans</b> <b>forward.</b> <b>In</b> fact, the use of leaning to give the impression of speed in illustration is a caricature of the distortion caused by the slow wiping vertical FP shutters of large format cameras from the first half of the 20th century.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. White <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> {{her chair}} with an anxious smile {{designed}} to throw oil upon the troubled waters.|$|E
60|$|The smile maddened her. She {{had meant}} to be subtle. She became flamboyant. She <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> her chair.|$|E
60|$|There was a moment's intense silence. The {{woman was}} still fanning herself lazily. Francis <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> his place.|$|E
