5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe {{made clear to}} Ramsey that he {{wanted him to do}} so, but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E
5|$|Hunter recalls being pleasantly {{surprised}} to learn that Russ Tamblyn and Richard Beymer had been cast as regular characters in the series, having enjoyed the early work of both actors during the 1950s and 1960s. Tamblyn improvised elements of his performance, including a magic trick involving two golf balls, which was something he had learned and wished to include during his role in the episode. The character of Gordon Cole, first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call, was conceived as being hard of hearing; this was because Lynch <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> delivering his lines in a loud voice, and worked backwards to establish a reason for this. Engels wrote most of Cole's dialogue over the series, having had experience with his own mother being similarly hard of hearing.|$|E
5|$|Other enemies {{were created}} to add more variety. Large, indestructible Hulks, {{inspired}} by an enemy in Berzerk, were added to kill the humans on the stage. Though they cannot be destroyed, the developers decided to have the protagonist's projectiles slow the Hulk's movement {{as a way to}} help the player. Levitating Enforcers were added as enemies that could shoot back at the main character; Jarvis and DeMar <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a floating robot and felt {{it would be easier to}} animate. A projectile algorithm was devised for Enforcers to simulate enemy artificial intelligence. The developers felt a simple algorithm of shooting directly at the protagonist would be ineffective because the character's constant motion would always result in a miss. Random elements were added to make the projectile more unpredictable; the Enforcer aims at a random location in a ten pixel radius around the character, and random acceleration curves the trajectory. To further differentiate Enforcers, Jarvis devised the Spheroid enemy as a robot that continually generated Enforcers, rather than have them already on the screen like other enemies. Brains were conceived as robots that could capture humans and brainwash them into enemies called Progs. DeMar devised the final enemies as a way to further increase the game's difficulty; Tanks that fire projectiles which bounce around the screen, and Quarks as a tank-producing robot.|$|E

25|$|Without {{a church}} in place yet, the parish held Masses in a town hall. One parishioner, J.J. Harrington, {{expressed}} great interest in an outdoor church that he had recently seen. Father Brophy <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an indoor church for year-round parishioners and an outdoor church for the summer and visitors. The outdoor church could {{also be seen as}} a way to attract tourists for the area.|$|E
25|$|Since {{neither of}} the {{brothers}} <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a torn empire, the two sons sought the throne. Huáscar, born of Huayna Capac's sister in Cusco, was the legitimate heir. Atahualpa, born in Quito according to Ecuadorian historiography, and in Cusco according to the Peruvian, was the usurper. The brothers battled for six years, killing many men and weakening the empire. Finally in 1532 near Chimborazo, Atahualpa with aid of two of his father's generals defeated his brother. Huáscar was captured and put in prison. Atahualpa became emperor of a severely weakened empire only to face the Spanish conquistadors' arrival in 1532.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} officially {{unveiled}} on November 20, when Activision {{announced it was}} not going to be a direct adaptation of the film, but a stand-alone story which takes place after the events of the film. The 360° combat system was also demonstrated for the first time. The game was next shown at E3 in May 2002, where the Rage system was revealed. On May 23, IGN published a full preview. Writer Jeremy Dunham <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the 360° combat system but found it difficult to get used to, and especially difficult to switch from one target to another. He also found the camera system to have faults, often getting caught behind walls and doors. However, he praised the game for capturing the spirit of the film well (something which he felt the first game had failed to do) and admitted he was looking forward to the final build.|$|E

25|$|The Council itself {{decided that}} episcopal {{conferences}} were practical and useful bodies which should carry on in an institutionalised way. It was {{also clear that}} the Holy See, which traditionally had {{had to deal with}} individual dioceses, <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> sharing some of the burden of labour and responsibility with these much larger units. After long discussions and several attempts at formulating practical guidelines, the Council could finally lay down a framework for such conferences in its Decree Christus Dominus (about the Pastoral Responsibility of Bishops), promulgated on October 28, 1965. This framework was followed by a more detailed set of rulings in the Papal motu proprio Ecclesiae Sanctae of August 6, 1966. Although there was now a set of guidelines common to all bishops' conferences, each is obliged to work out its own statutes, which, however, need the subsequent approval of the Holy See.|$|E
25|$|The Ronnie Johns Half Hour {{was created}} after representatives from Channel 10 saw a {{performance}} of The Third Degree's stage show, and were impressed by the cast and characters. They offered the group the chance to film a pilot. Originally, the cast {{was going to call}} the show The 3rd Degree, after the name of their performance group. Channel 10, however, <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Ronnie Johns being the host, so they asked if the show could be renamed after him. In response, The 3rd Degree came up with a title that they felt was ridiculously long, The Ronnie Johns Good Times Campfire Jamboree Half Hour Show (Now on Television). The network shortened it to The Ronnie Johns Half Hour. Despite this, the writers, cast and prop designers try to sneak in The 3rd Degree's logo as much as possible in sketches. For example, football jerseys will have The 3rd Degree as their sponsor.|$|E
25|$|At Backlash, the {{original}} main event match was between Chris Benoit and Shawn Michaels for the World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H {{appeared to be}} out of the picture, as the annual WWE Draft took place eight days after WrestleMania and he was drafted to SmackDown. Almost immediately after the draft, the dethroned champion was traded back to Raw, and on March 29 he demanded that the intended match at Backlash be changed to Benoit and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the match, but concluded with adding that he made a promise to Michaels for granting him a World title match at Backlash. To solve this, Bischoff booked a return Triple Threat match to serve as the main event for Backlash. Benoit emerged victorious by submission for the second consecutive pay-per-view, this time forcing Michaels to submit to a Sharpshooter. Benoit went on to hold the title until August 2004, losing it to Randy Orton at SummerSlam.|$|E

25|$|Throughout production, CBS {{executives}} {{objected to}} the violent nature of the episode. They asked Guggenheim to make it less violent, but Guggenheim refused when possible. The executives also {{expressed concern about the}} overall plot of the episode. They felt that it would be too early in the series to show Charlie's emotional reaction to the violence. The executives expressed concern about Charlie's emotional state during a scene set in the Eppes family garage where Charlie recalled the violence. Heuton and Falacci agreed to remove the scene as they felt that the scene did not suit the plot. Citing the convention that the protagonist in a crime drama does not lose his or her gun, the network executives also felt that the loss of Don's gun was inappropriate for the series. Heuton and Falacci insisted on keeping it in the script, and series regular Rob Morrow also <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Don losing his gun. Heuton and Falacci assured the executives that Don would have an emotional reward {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
500|$|... "Give It 2 Me" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna and Pharrell Williams as a self-empowerment song. Ingrid Sischy from Interview {{magazine}} asked Madonna whether the song {{had the ability to}} become a party anthem in Ibiza. Madonna responded that she <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> everybody dancing to [...] "Give It 2 Me", treating it as a party anthem. When asked about the inspiration behind the song, Madonna said, ...|$|E

[...] Moore and Miller met when Moore guest starred on Miller's previous series Chuck. [...] Both Miller and Fiorentino, a personal friend of Moore's, discussed the pilot and the role with Moore. [...] Moore <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Lucas providing comedic moments to the series. [...] For Lucas' personality, Miller asked Moore to include several of his own personality traits when portraying Lucas.|$|E

500|$|Sherri Stoner created Slappy the Squirrel {{when another}} writer {{and friend of}} Stoner, John McCann, made fun of Stoner's career in TV movies playing troubled {{teenagers}}. When McCann joked that Sherri would be playing troubled teenagers when she was fifty years old, the latter developed the idea of Slappy's characteristics as an older person acting like a teenager. Stoner <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an aged cartoon character because an aged cartoon star would know the secrets of other cartoons and [...] "have the dirt on [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Six {{months into}} the second American tour, Chaplin was {{invited to join the}} New York Motion Picture Company. A {{representative}} who had seen his performances thought he could replace Fred Mace, a star of their Keystone Studios who intended to leave. Chaplin thought the Keystone comedies [...] "a crude mélange of rough and rumble", but <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> working in films and rationalised: [...] "Besides, it would mean a new life." [...] He met with the company and signed a $150-per-week ($ in [...] dollars) contract in September 1913.|$|E
500|$|After the {{extensive}} filming process, Raimi had a [...] "mountain of footage" [...] {{that he had}} to put together. He chose a Detroit editing association, where he met Edna Paul, to cut the film. Paul's assistant was Joel Coen of the Coen brothers, who helped with the film's editing. Paul edited a majority of the film, although Coen notably edited the shed sequence. Coen had been inspired by Raimi's Within the Woods and <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> producing a prototype film to help build the interest of investors. Joel used the concept to help make Blood Simple with his brother Ethan, and he and Raimi became friends following the editing process.|$|E

500|$|Barnes {{was made}} captain of New South Wales for the 1946–47 Australian season, though he only managed to play three matches {{for the state}} team. One of those was the match against the touring MCC team, and Barnes was {{approached}} during the match about becoming an opening batsman for the forthcoming Test series. He wrote in his autobiography: [...] "I had never opened before and was a little dubious. I had, however, struck new balls at different periods of innings and was not afraid of that." [...] He also <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> batting ahead of Bradman in the batting order: [...] "Much better, I thought, to get in before him than to come later, like flat beer after champagne." ...|$|E
500|$|Like many {{contemporary}} alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa. Hüsker Dü's seminal album Zen Arcade demonstrated {{to the band}} how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare, and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central {{to the pursuit of}} his grand musical ambitions. Corgan said he <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> creating his own alternative universe through sound that essentially tells the listener, [...] "Welcome to Pumpkin Land, this is what it sounds like on Planet Pumpkin." [...] This emphasis on atmosphere carried through to Adore (described as [...] "arcane night music" [...] in prerelease promotion) and the Machina albums (concept records that tell the story of a fictional rock band).|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after moving}} to California, Hepburn began a {{relationship}} with her agent, Leland Hayward, although they were both married. Hayward proposed to the actress once they had each divorced but she declined, later explaining, [...] "I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> being my own single self." [...] They were involved for four years. In 1936, while she was touring Jane Eyre, Hepburn began a relationship with entrepreneur Howard Hughes. She had been introduced to him a year earlier by their mutual friend Cary Grant. Hughes wished to marry her, and the tabloids reported their impending nuptials, but Hepburn was too focused on resurrecting her failing career. They separated in 1938, when Hepburn left Hollywood after being labeled [...] "box office poison".|$|E
