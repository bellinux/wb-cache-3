Experimental cuts on 10 mm thick specimen with rake angles 31 ° and 42 ° were made, and the chip thickness varied between 0, 1 mm and 0, 3 mm. Using the ﬁnite element method, we modelled a representative chip segment of varying length and thicknesses. We varied the load at the chip segment and calculated, for each case, stress intensity at the crack tip and compressive stress in hypothetical chip. On presumption that the crack propagates during tissue separation only when the stress intensity at the crack tip equals the critical stress intensity and the compressive stress rises in chip formation process up to the limit strength, we can calculate the critical stress intensity factor by knowing the chip segment length and compressive strength in longitudinal direction. Speciﬁcally, the crack propagates until the compressive stress reaches the strength, which occurs at the place of chip break. Critical stress intensity factor calculated from representative 0. 3 mm thick chip segment length agrees well with values obtained with classical fracture tests. The results obtained from thinner chip segments deviates to a lesser extent, which is most probably a consequence of highly unsymmetrical specimen. The method has been undoubtedly shown as effective and reliable, {{which is the most}} important. The method is very simple and fast, enabling us to determine the fracture properties practically with a single oblique cut. It has to be emphasized, that the specimen preparation is also undemanding, for the only thing we {{have to pay attention to}} is the tissue orientation. ...|$|E

The advent of Galileo, the European satellite navigation project, will allow a deeper impact in the quality of services supplied to the users, and consequently, into diffusion and development of mass market receivers. Obviously, in order to respond to mobility demands, an important aim will be to guarantee continuous outdoor and indoor location availability. The main challenging problem for indoor location is to find a solution between low signal to noise ratios characteristic of indoor scenario, and low complexity of user terminals. In a noise limited situation like this, to ensure a good synchronization, it is necessary to integrate over a longer period, with inevitable increase of complexity. The analysis done in this paper is based on acquisition of Galileo pilot signal in L 1 band, L 1 -C signal, that is a hierarchical code, constituted by a repetition <b>of</b> a 4092 <b>chips</b> primary code, modulated by a long duration secondary code <b>of</b> 25 <b>chips.</b> The resulting code has a total <b>length</b> <b>of</b> 102300 <b>chips</b> [1].

40|$|In the mid- 1990 s, {{a pickup}} in {{measured}} productivity {{growth for the}} semiconductor industry coincided with an economy-wide acceleration in labor productivity growth. The pickup in semiconductor markets reflected {{an increase in the}} growth of real output that was generated by what Dale Jorgenson (2001) called an “inflection point” in the price indexes for the semiconductor industry. Jorgenson hypothesized that the inflection point reflected increases in the rate of product innovation made possible by an increase in Moore’s Law, a stylized description of technology that currently states that the number of electrical components on a chip will double every eighteen months. Within semiconductors, microprocessors (MPUs) produced by Intel—the world’s largest producer <b>of</b> the <b>chips</b> that serve as a computer’s central processing unit—were the primary contributor to the inflection point in the semiconductor index. The inflection point in the price index coincided with two changes in the price contours for Intel’s chips. First, price contours for Intel’s chips became steeper around 1995. Because most price index formulae boil down to functions of weighted averages of price change, steeper price contours translate directly into more rapidly declining price indexes. At the same time, the product lifecycle for MPUs—the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time <b>chips</b> are sold in the market—shortened and Intel began to introduce chips more frequently. What caused these changes in pricing and product cycles? This paper provides a simple framework to help gain some intuition on these issues. The model provides a set of conditions under which an increase in Moore’s Law is consistent with both of these stylized facts. In the model, an increase in Moore’s Law raises the quality <b>of</b> future <b>chips</b> relative to today’s chips. If consumers view these chips as substitutes, then increases in the quality <b>of</b> tomorrow’s <b>chips</b> push down the prices for today’s chips and can, under certain conditions, generate an inflection point in the price index. However, the framework also suggests that changes in the attributes of contemporaneous substitutes can have the same effects. Thus, the model suggests that increases in the quality <b>of</b> competitor’s <b>chips</b> can generate an inflection point through the same channel. This is an important possibility to consider because Intel faced increasing competition from AMD beginning in the mid- 1990 s, about when the inflection point occurred.

This analysis divided the process <b>of</b> 3 -D <b>chip</b> development into different stages based on the deformation mechanism and characteristics, i. e. chip forming stage, chip curling stage, chip breaking stage, and the kinematical characters according to whether the curled chip, after leaving the rake face, hits the backwall of breaker/groove, or/and workpiece, or/and backface of tool, or/and extends along the chip breaker. Then new basic chip curling forms, up-curling, side-curling and twisting, are proposed based on the continuum mechanics theory. It reveals that a 3 -D curling chip body m a y undergo longitudinal bending, transversal bending and torsional deformations. The analysis provides the fundament for the theoretical modelling of the 3 -D chip curling and breaking. Secondly, a general geometric model <b>of</b> 3 -D <b>chip</b> curling generated by typical chip breakers is developed by introducing the three-dimensional deformation state <b>of</b> the <b>chip</b> curling. The model, so developed, can be used to predict the 3 -D chip curling forms. The prediction includes a group of criteria for the effects of ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηo on the chip forms/shapes. The varying tendency <b>of</b> the <b>chip</b> radius and chip pitch with varying ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηO is further discussed based on a sensitivity analysis the results of which are summarised graphically. The sensitivity analysis provides a quantitative assessment of the significance <b>of</b> three basic <b>chip</b> curling forms, namely up-curling, side-curling and twisting to the general helical chip form. Thirdly, a set of 3 -D mechanics models <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> curling with chip breaker for the internal resisting forces is developed for the 4 basic <b>chip</b> deformation cases <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> curling process based on the structural mechanics theory, These internal forces, in particular the bending moments and torques are expressed as variations along the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the curled <b>chip.</b> The set <b>of</b> models considers a spatial force system including the longitudinal bending moment, transversal bending moment and the torsional torque. Then the distribution of the bending moments and torques along the chip body are discussed based on graphically presented calculated results. The models reveal, in theory, new insights into the chip breaking mechanisms. More importantly it provides a new approach to theoretically asses the curling chip breakability. Notably it is shown that the bending moment and torque are the main causes <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> breaking. Furthermore the bending moment and torque in the chip body are caused by the chip breaker and the obstacle the curling chip contacts. Finally, a computer animation system for 3 -D chip curling in machining process is developed based on the 3 -D chip curling developing process, geometry model and mechanics models <b>of</b> 3 -D <b>chip</b> curling presented in the research work. The 3 -D chip animation integrates the chip flow equation, chip curling patterns, chip geometrical features and mathematical expressions for the 3 -D helix surface. Based on the input conditions (namely chip breaker parameters and cutting conditions), a computer program is developed to convert the parametric prediction into a series of dynamic graphs demonstrating the chip formation process. Then the animation results are analysed and compared with the experimental observations. The methodology presented will provide assistance for machine operators to select machining conditions or for process planning designers to confidently and thoroughly plan the cutting process, control chip breakage and evaluate the chip control effect...|$|R

This work presents a hybrid model based on the ratio <b>of</b> broken <b>chip</b> radius to the initial radius <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> to predict the type <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> regarding the characteristics <b>of</b> a <b>chip</b> breaker geometry and cutting parameters. An analytical geometrical model was developed to calculate the initial radius <b>of</b> <b>chip.</b> After running experimental tests for four types <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> breaker geometries and calculation <b>of</b> their <b>chip</b> ratio, type <b>of</b> <b>chips</b> and tool–chip contact were selected as two criteria for classifying chip ratio into three limits representing usable, acceptable, and unacceptable chips.

40|$|We {{consider}} the following (solitary) game: each node of a directed graph contains a pile <b>of</b> <b>chips.</b> A move consists of selecting a node with at least as many chips as its outdegree, and sending one chip along each outgoing edge to its neighbors. We extend to directed graphs several results on the undirected version obtained earlier by the authors, P. Shor, and G. Tardos, and we discuss some new topics such as periodicity, reachability and probabilistic aspects. Among the new results specifically concerning digraphs, we relate the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the shortest period of an infinite game to the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the longest terminating game, and also to the access time of random walks on the same graph. These questions involve {{a study of the}} Laplace operator for directed graphs. We show that for many graphs, in particular for undirected graphs, the problem whether a given position <b>of</b> the <b>chips</b> can be reached from the initial position is polynomial time solvable. Finally, we show how the basic properties of the “probabilistic abacus” can be derived from our results...|$|R
