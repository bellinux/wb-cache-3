5|$|Over the years, several {{films about}} Anne Frank appeared. Her life and {{writings}} have inspired {{a diverse group}} of artists and social commentators to make reference to her in literature, popular music, television, and other media. These include The Anne Frank Ballet by Adam Darius, first performed in 1959, and the choral work Annelies, first performed in 2005. The only known footage of the real Anne Frank comes from a 1941 silent film recorded for her newlywed next-door neighbour. She is seen <b>leaning</b> <b>out</b> of a second-floor window in an attempt to better view the bride and groom. The couple, who survived the war, gave the film to the Anne Frank House.|$|E
25|$|No. 76 {{appeared}} late in {{this year}} with a totally enclosed top deck, there being no bulkheads. This car had no service number holders and the number “3” was painted {{at each end of}} the upper deck. These enclosed ends were not popular with the conductors for, when <b>leaning</b> <b>out</b> of the rather narrow end sliding windows to see that all passengers had boarded or alighted, their hats were knocked off unless they had taken the precaution to remove them first.|$|E
25|$|Born in Iași, the Moldavian capital, Vasile Jr was {{selected}} for the most modern forms of education available to Moldavians living in the 1840s. He first attended the liberal arts' school of Frenchman Malgoverné, and, in addition to discovering an interest in literature, became a skilled amateur draftsman. In October 1849, young Pogor took the stagecoach ride to Kraków, and then the train to Paris, accompanied by the boyar heirs Heraclide, Porfiriu, Miclescu and Teodor Veisa, and chaperoned by Malgoverné himself. The scene of their departure from Iași is preserved in a sketch drawing by Veisa, which shows the enthusiastic adolescents <b>leaning</b> <b>out</b> the carriage doors.|$|E

500|$|According to Price, Insomniac {{wanted to}} [...] "break {{the rules of}} shooters". He felt that the last {{generation}} of shooters had established a formula of staying behind cover for defense, and <b>leaning</b> <b>out</b> from it to attack. He wanted to change that pattern with Sunset Overdrive by encouraging players to attack in an aggressive manner and to focus on momentum. To accomplish this, the team developed a city that supported parkour and fast movements. They also hoped that {{with the introduction of}} a new generation of video game consoles, they could establish a new standard for the genre which would [...] "retrain" [...] shooter fans playing the game.|$|E
500|$|On 27 June 1914, {{one person}} was killed and 20 were injured in a {{collision}} and subsequent derailment at Cannon Street. A train departing for [...] was in a side-long collision with a train arriving, across its path, from [...] and, although the collision occurred at low speed, part of the Plumstead service was derailed {{and one of its}} carriages overturned. The driver of the Plumstead service was blamed for a failure to observe, and a misreading of, signals which took his train into the path of the Hastings-bound service. An investigation found the man who died was likely <b>leaning</b> <b>out</b> of the window at the moment his carriage overturned, and he might have avoided serious injury had he been seated.|$|E
500|$|Due to misting and exhaust obstructing the driver's {{view through}} the window, the driver drove <b>leaning</b> <b>out</b> {{of the cab}} {{for much of the}} time. A side effect of this was that it made hearing the AWS sounder harder, as well as {{observation}} of a flashing light fitted in the cab to remind a driver of an AWS warning. Approaching signal SN43, there was a temporary speed restriction of , which was warned of by a temporary AWS magnet in advance of the restriction, and indicated by a sign {{at the start of the}} temporary speed restriction. The train approached signal SN43 at [...] and passed over the temporary AWS magnet. The driver failed to react to the warning given within the time allowed and the brakes were applied. Because the AWS isolating cock was out of reach of the driver, he instructed the fireman to open it for him. The train's speed had reduced by about [...] when the brakes were released. The rules require that the train is brought to a stand and the signaller contacted in the event of an AWS brake application. Additionally the driver must inform the signaller whenever the AWS is isolated;"Driver: If it becomes necessary to isolate the AWS, you must: ...|$|E

500|$|On January 6, {{after the}} Americans had spent {{several days of}} waiting and {{shouting}} basic Huaorani phrases into the jungle, the first Huaorani visitors arrived. [...] A young man and two women emerged on the opposite river bank around 11:15a.m., and soon joined the missionaries at their encampment. The younger of the two women had come against the wishes of her family, and the man, named Nankiwi, who was romantically interested in her, followed. The older woman (about thirty years old) acted as a self-appointed chaperone. The men gave them several gifts, including a model plane, and the visitors soon relaxed and began conversing freely, apparently not realizing that the men's language skills were weak. Nankiwi, whom the missionaries nicknamed [...] "George", showed interest in their aircraft, so Saint took off with him aboard. They first completed a circuit around the camp, but Nankiwi appeared eager for a second trip, so they flew toward Terminal City. Upon reaching a familiar clearing, Nankiwi recognized his neighbors, and <b>leaning</b> <b>out</b> of the plane, wildly waved and shouted to them. Later that afternoon, the younger woman became restless, and though the missionaries offered their visitors sleeping quarters, Nankiwi and the young woman left the beach with little explanation. The older woman apparently had more interest in conversing with the missionaries, and remained there most of the night.|$|E

50|$|Maurice Bunau-Varilla (1856 - 1 August 1944) was a French press magnate, and {{proprietor}} of the newspaper Le Matin. During the Second World War, he made the newspaper's editorial line pro-German and pro-collaborationist, and it ceased publication 16 days after his death. Bunau-Varilla admired Adolf Hitler more out of his anti-Communist <b>leanings</b> than <b>out</b> of Nazi conviction.|$|R

60|$|Then Jerry, {{whose name}} is Geraldine only in the family Bible, talked to her about the weather. Jerry can talk {{interestingly}} about anything. In five minutes she had performed a miracle--she had made Miss Ponsonby laugh. In five minutes more she was <b>leaning</b> half <b>out</b> of the window showing Miss Ponsonby a new, white, fluffy, frivolous, chiffony waist of hers, and Miss Ponsonby was <b>leaning</b> halfway <b>out</b> of hers looking at it eagerly. At {{the end of a}} quarter of an hour they were exchanging confidences about their favourite books. Jerry was a confirmed Kiplingomaniac, but Miss Ponsonby adored Laura Jean Libbey. She said sorrowfully she supposed she ought not to read novels at all since her father disapproved. We found out later on that Mr. Ponsonby's way of expressing disapproval was to burn any he got hold of, and storm at his daughter about them like the confirmed old crank he was. Poor Miss Ponsonby had to keep her Laura Jeans locked up in her trunk, and it wasn't often she got a new one.|$|R
