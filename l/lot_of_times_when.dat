Since the size of the reduced-order model is usually much smaller than n, simulation can be conducted within a much shorter and more reasonable time period.|$|R

30|$|It is {{necessary}} to optimize {{the composition of the}} culture medium to further enhance ascomycin production. However, in traditional ‘one-factor-at-a-time’ experiments, the effects of various factors can only be investigated one at a time, and this approach fails to evaluate multifactorial interactions among all components, thereby leading to inefficient and time-consuming work (Lee 2018). Response surface methodology (RSM) includes factorial designs and regression analysis for construction of empirical models, making it an excellent statistical tool for increasing the production of valuable metabolites (Chaudhary et al. 2017; Fu et al. 2016). RSM can evaluate all the factors simultaneously and determine the optimal culture conditions for microbes. Compared with traditional optimization, it can save a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> employing RSM to obtain the desirable fermentation medium for ascomycin production.|$|R

McMahon, along with six other retired professional football players, filed a class action lawsuit against the NFL in August 2011, citing the league's negligence and misconduct in its handling of concussion-related injuries; the suit followed lawsuits filed shortly before by 75 other NFL retirees making similar claims as well as asserting that the NFL knew about the dangers concussions posed to NFL athletes {{as far back as the}} 1920s and actively withheld the information from the affected and the general public until the summer of 2010.

40|$|Processing {{noise data}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} fields on mining data streams. To address this problem, we consider a Density Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, which takes advantage of filtering noise data to handle noise data in data streams. Many experiments show that DBSCAN algorithm will cost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the database is large. Therefore we improve DBSCAN and propose a new algorithm called FDBSCAN (Fast-DBSCAN), which reduces running time greatly by means of decreasing objects that needs checked in database. In this paper, we propose a classification algorithm, which filters noise data by FDBSCAN and detects concept drifting through MSE (Mean Square Error). The experimental results show that this classification algorithm can improve classification accuracy on mining noisy data streams compared with the popular data streams classification algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Level Set Algorithm (LSA) {{is one of}} the {{efficient}} tools of edge detection and contour extraction, which has been applied to radar, medical, and other images processing successfully. However, the procedure using LSA will cost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> applied to high-resolution images. This paper provides two novel approaches that can enhance the detection speed. In the first method, the moving step enlarges when the contour is far from the real boundary of specific targets, while reduces when the contour is near the real boundary in the images. In the second method, reducing resolution make the coarse boundary be obtained by LSA in low resolution image. Then, the contour is processed finely by LSA in high resolution image based of the coarse boundary. Experimental results using Radarsat ScanSAR images show the effectiveness of these new methods and verify the improved velocity in contour detection compared with the standard LSA...|$|R

Pop later went to a Los Angeles studio to show the song to Mark Pitts, who later gave it to Usher for him to perform.

5000|$|Stewart also {{discussed}} how short-selling was {{detrimental to the}} markets and investors. Cramer admitted to Stewart that short-selling was detrimental, stated his opposition to it, and claimed {{that he had never}} engaged in it, which contradicts earlier statements in which he described going short while managing a hedge fund. In a December 2006 interview from TheStreet.com's [...] "Wall Street Confidential" [...] webcast Cramer said, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> I was short at my hedge fund. ...

[...] However, Stewart played several video clips from 2006 where Cramer discussed the spreading of false rumors to drive down stock prices and encouraged short-selling by hedge funds as a means to generate returns. At one point in a clip from December 22, 2006, he said, [...] "I would encourage anyone in a hedge fund to do it." [...] He called it a very quick way to make money and very satisfying. He continued, [...] "By the way, {{no one else in the}} world would ever admit that, but I don't care, and again, I'm not gonna say it on TV." [...] Stewart responded, [...] "I want the Jim Cramer on CNBC to protect me from that Jim Cramer." [...] Cramer again admitted that he can do better, and that he should try to change. The interview ended when Stewart pointedly suggested: [...] "Maybe we can remove the 'financial expert' and the 'In Cramer We Trust' and start getting back to fundamentals on the reporting, as well, and I can go back to making fart noises and funny faces."

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{construct}} two verifiable attribute-based encryption (VABE) schemes. One is with {{a single}} authority, {{and the other is}} with multi authorities. Not only our schemes are proved secure as the previous ABE schemes, they also provide a verification property. Adding the verification property has a few advantages: first, it allows the user to immediately check the correctness of the keys, if not, he only needs the authority to resend the corresponding shares, especially, in multi-authority case, if the key does not pass the check, the user only needs to ask the particular authority to resend its own part, without need to go to all the authorities, this saves a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> error appears; second, if the keys pass the verification but the user still does not rightly decrypt out the message, something might be wrong with the attributes or ciphertexts, then, the user has to contact with the encryptor. We formalize the notion of VABE and prove our schemes in our model. 1...|$|R
