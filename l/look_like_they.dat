5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{decided to}} publish a photo story for their January 15, 1951 edition, which would document {{the results of the}} competition and feature a photograph of the protesters. Life initially wanted to photograph the painters {{on the steps of the}} Metropolitan, with their paintings. They refused on the grounds that it would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were trying to enter the museum, but were being rebuffed. The magazine capitulated; art editor for Life, Dorothy Seiberling, sent photographer Nina Leen to photograph them at a studio on 44th Street. They assembled there on November 24. Only three of the original signatories were absent: Weldon Kees, Hans Hofmann, and Fritz Bultman. Pollock made a special trip with James Brooks for the session.|$|E
5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are wearing armor, {{as they have}} two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a photo album.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves are}} {{significantly}} flattened, sometimes even <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are pressed, as in A. sibirica.|$|R

25|$|In {{this season}} Andrew {{seemed to be}} quite {{protective}} of his mother, it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had mended their rocky relationship.|$|R
25|$|Adaptation {{rather than}} replacement. Names {{that came to}} <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were coined as Old English may {{actually}} come from Roman-period ones. For example, the city of York's connection to its original Romanised Celtic name Eburacum is not immediately obvious. But knowledge of the intermediate forms of the name, Old English *Eburwīc (later Eoforwīc) and Norse Jórvík, makes the connection clearer.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{of potato}} 'ring rot' are {{yellowing}} {{of the leaf}} margins which later turn brown and <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are burned. Tubers rot from the inside, sometimes progressing to leave hollow shells. Rotting of the tubers is the more common symptom. Infected land cannot be used again for susceptible crops for several years. Among others, USA, Canada, many EU states and Middle Eastern countries {{have not yet been}} able to eradicate this pathogen.|$|E
25|$|Character {{designer}} Kōsuke Fujishima {{noted that}} while Luke's clothing {{makes him look}} lazy, {{it was okay to}} have clothes that are outrageous since the setting was designed to have him wear the most fashionable clothes of his time. He decided to show Luke's abdomen to demonstrate that he was a combatant in the game. Fujishima remains anxious about Luke's design wondering what people think about his abdomen always showing. Luke's pose is the result of Fujishima's research in fashion books which feature images of boys who <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> hang out at Shibuya.|$|E
5000|$|... in 2004 White Hills had {{finished}} in {{second in the}} HDFL and had <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> {{it was going to}} win another premiership after a pretty long Final drought however they fell short to Colbinabbin who had won the flag three times in a row. But they were looking to get back up their in the next season (2005) but unfortunately fell short again and it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had rejuvenated the squad again and was <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had their finals hopes up, but they haven't been the same since those early days in 1988.|$|R

50|$|All of the contraptions {{were created}} using objects that might {{actually}} be found in an abandoned hotel, and {{in such a way}} that <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had been created by a gifted 13-year-old boy.|$|R
25|$|Marks built a grand 40 odd room Victorian mansion, Zwartkoppies Hall, on {{the farm}} near Pretoria, which became {{well-known}} to celebrities and dignitaries visiting South Africa. Sammy and Bertha moved into the house in 1886. Sammy had an Italian painter paint the walls on silk material so that the walls would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were made of silk. Beautiful patterns decorated each room of the mansion. Having the same restless energy that led to Marks's success, his wife Bertha controlled the house and its staff with ease, managing to raise nine children, breed poultry, maintain a garden, and entertain on a lavish scale. Luncheons, dinners, croquet on the lawn, tennis and billiards parties were all regular events. There was no dinner party, and no Sunday, which passed without a 5 course meal attended by 30+ guests. A staff of 13, {{most of whom were}} engaged through an agency in London, carried out the housework: parlourmaids, kitchenmaids, laundrymaids and gardeners, as well as a governess, a cook, an estate carpenter and a Scottish butler. A massive stove in the kitchen, with five ovens and 10 hot-plates, testified to the scale of the entertainment.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, George Street was added, {{and soon}} after Walford East tube station was built, to create further {{locations}} when EastEnders went from two to three episodes per week. The set was constructed by the BBC in-house construction department under construction manager Mike Hagan. The initial build took six months to complete. Most of the buildings on Albert Square have no interior filming space, with a few exceptions, and most do not have rears or gardens. Most areas by the front (and sometimes back) doors are decorated and dressed to match the interior set to allow shots of doors being opened. The grocery shop was originally open fronted, it {{was turned into a}} closed front shop, with removable interior walls to allow for filming inside the shop when the set was expanded in 1987. Some interior shots are filmed in the actual buildings, and the café also has some interior decoration so some limited filming can take place by the door. The newer exterior sets including fish and chip shop, video shop and beauty salon had some interior filming space to create a greater sense of realism. As the show is filmed up to six weeks in advance, the trees need to have extra leaves stuck on them during the spring to make them <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> would in summer.|$|E
500|$|The deluxe package {{comes in}} a tin with a {{microchip}} that plays a sound of someone walking down a hallway {{in the house and}} slamming a door when the package is opened. The urban themes of the packaging are expanded in this edition, with the album entitled [...] "Stick" [...] and the bonus content [...] "Rock"; discs are designed to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are covered in grass. This design of a pixelated, dimetricprojection domestic scene has been compared to TheSims.|$|E
50|$|In season 2002/03, {{they played}} in Polish Premier League (Ekstraklasa), were relegated {{straight}} away. Whilst it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> {{were about to}} win promotion immediately, they were convicted of match-fixing, along with several other clubs in widespread enquiry that shook Polish football.|$|R
50|$|Cleland {{finished}} fourth {{to add to}} his championship lead, he was on 104 points, while race winner Harvey was far behind in fifth place and only on 39 points. Cleland, Hoy, Rouse and Allam <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were the four to battle it out for the crown.|$|R
50|$|The Zeros came in {{strafing}} immediately afterward. I saw two Brewsters {{trying to}} fight the Zeros. One was shot down {{and the other was}} saved by ground fires covering his tail. Both <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were tied to a string while the Zeros made passes at them.|$|R
500|$|Justin Heckert of Atlanta {{magazine}} {{opined that}} [...] "the animation and art <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were done by daycare students", while Lucy Maher of Common Sense Media rated it one star, criticizing Fitz's [...] "anarchist" [...] qualities and ultimately stated that [...] "parents with teens {{who are interested}} in watching should preview an episode or two before letting them tune in on their own." [...] Felix Staica of Impulse Gamer gave the DVD release 8.3 out of 10, stating he was [...] "left confounded" [...] after watching and noted the video transfer as [...] "decidedly and deliberately rough, with weird unfocused pixilation [...] cropping up frequently." ...|$|E
500|$|Muniz's artwork {{comprises}} 36 mosaic-cast {{portraits of}} real people who <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are waiting for a train. These portraits, based on photographs of his acquaintances, are scattered along the exits and mezzanine. The portraits include those of chef Daniel Boulud and designer Waris Ahluwalia. Muniz also has a portrait of himself, running after a wayward suitcase while papers fly away behind him. A married same-sex couple is also depicted, marking the first permanent, non-political LGBT art in New York City. The depiction {{is based on a}} photograph of a Brooklyn same-sex couple and is meant to showcase the [...] "day to day normalcy of gay New Yorkers." ...|$|E
500|$|MTV Buzzworthy said, [...] "give {{it up for}} her sleek biker chick-meets-Park-Slope {{wardrobe}} {{and feel}} free to ogle/drool over the parade of shirtless dudes who <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> jumped off the cover of Abs Weekly magazine." [...] The review also complimented [...] "rapper/pants-dropper extraodinaire Lil Wayne" [...] who helped [...] "push her chest-bumpin' vid into must-see territory." [...] Although calling it a [...] "Soldier" [...] knock-off, BET Sound Off blog said, [...] "the visual is pretty entertaining." [...] Tracey Ford of AOL Boombox said, [...] "the diva makes it perfectly clear {{how easy it is}} to turn a woman on and off." [...] The video ranked at number two on [...] Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E
50|$|While he {{was working}} on the Mundy Case, Ilsa came back to his life and it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were going get back together, but much like with Casablanca's ending, {{at the end of the}} game Lewton watches her fly away in the Disc's first airplane.|$|R
50|$|A {{note was}} sent out via Myspace asking for extras. Only {{a small amount}} of them were {{actually}} highschoolers; the call was for people who were either 15-20 or <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were 15-20. No one was paid, and filming was done around 3:00 AM the following day.|$|R
5000|$|Questions - These are to {{and from}} the patrol to ensure they {{understand}} what you said. Remember when asking a question post pause pounce.

500|$|The People's Gavin Blyth and Jon Clarke {{stated that}} Toyah and Leanne were [...] "rough, tough and make other streetwise {{teenagers}} <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are {{fresh out of}} nursery." [...] The characters were credited with increasing the show's ratings from 13 million to 19 million viewers. When Toyah met Dobber, the Daily Mirror's Tony Purnell commented [...] "If anyone {{was going to find}} Mr Wrong on holiday it was Toyah Battersby." [...] John Millar from the Daily Record wrote [...] "The Street should be congratulated if the plight of Toyah Battersby – a brilliant performance by young Georgia Taylor, by the way – means just one schoolgirl says no to her lusting boyfriend." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Milhouse Divided" [...] is {{the only}} episode for which Steve Tompkins has sole writing credit, {{although}} {{he had been a}} part of the writing staff for several years. The writers wanted to do an episode that involved a couple getting divorced. They had wanted to break the sitcom convention that characters who <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> will divorce get back together and have two characters remain divorced even after the episode. The Van Houtens were chosen because the writers felt that they were the most developed couple next to Marge and Homer and the Lovejoys. The scene in the episode [...] "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming" [...] where Milhouse is in a jet pretending to fire missiles at his parents is where they got the idea to have his parents' marriage be in trouble.|$|E
500|$|Kapoor often {{speaks of}} {{removing}} both {{the signature of}} the artist from his works {{as well as any}} traces of their fabrication, or what he refers to as [...] "traces of the hand". He aspires to make his works <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have independent realities that he reveals rather than creates. For him, removing all the seams from Cloud Gate was necessary {{in order to make the}} sculpture seem as though it was [...] "perfect" [...] and ready-made. These effects increase the viewer's fascination with it and makes them wonder what it is and where it came from. His attempts to hide his works' seams as an artist stand in contrast to Frank Gehry's architectural designs in the park, Jay Pritzker Pavilion and BP Pedestrian Bridge, which display their seams prominently.|$|E
5000|$|Arriving {{the tragic}} evening, it dis-animated the {{inhabitants}} of this island to see the fire and ignite rocks, that escaped as meteors and almost <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> fell over the people, and {{the windows of the}} church almost appeared to break with the echoes of the sound that threatened our life." ...|$|R
50|$|Despite the name, 'e-cigarette,' {{these devices}} contain no tobacco and produce no smoke, and {{therefore}} {{any reference to}} them, should be under e-cigarettes and not smoking. Exceptions to this might be their role {{as an alternative to}} smoking, or as devices where it increasingly <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are helping young people avoid smoking.|$|R
25|$|Cho won the Honinbo for {{the first}} time in 1981. He won the Honinbo league undefeated with a score of 7 wins and 0 losses. His {{campaign}} was the first time someone won the Honinbo league undefeated.

500|$|At dawn on 7 April, the Japanese force {{passed the}} Ōsumi Peninsula {{into the open}} ocean heading south from Kyūshū toward Okinawa. They shifted into a {{defensive}} formation, with Yahagi leading Yamato and the eight destroyers deployed in a ring around the two larger ships, with each ship [...] {{from each other and}} proceeding at [...] One of the Japanese destroyers——developed engine trouble and turned back. U.S. reconnaissance aircraft began to shadow the main force of ships. At 10:00, the Japanese force turned west to make it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were withdrawing, but at 11:30, after being detected by two American PBM Mariner flying boats, the Yamato fired a salvo with her [...] bow guns using special [...] "beehive shells" [...] (...) but could not prevent the two planes from shadowing the Japanese force, they turned back towards Okinawa.|$|E
500|$|It has {{received}} positive critical reception, with McManus conducting an eight-page interview and profile of Hughes in {{appreciation of the}} series. The magazine had previously published a special issue centered on the network and its shows in July 2012, but overlooked Off the Air, presenting an [...] "opportunity to shed a little insight and background on an extraordinary unique show." [...] Speaking {{from the first time}} he watched it, McManus praised it for not being [...] "your typical try-too-hard-to-be-weird production." [...] In Adweek, Sam Thielman ranked it second place out of 18 other programs on the network. He tied it with the network's parody infomercial specials and wrote that it was [...] "in the same category as King Star King among things that are so cool and strange that they <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> should probably be part of a video installation in an art gallery somewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|From the start, {{fans were}} very wary of {{bringing}} in female characters to the male-dominated show; they feared Bela was brought {{on to be}} [...] "arm candy or [...] ". To make matters worse, when {{coming up with the}} scenes for the auditions for Bela, executive producer Robert Singer spent an hour writing a lackluster script not intended {{to be used in the}} show. Mere hours after the script was given to the casting director, the show's fans had found them on casting websites and were [...] "obsessively going over these scenes". According to Kripke, the fan reaction was the characters [...] "really <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> suck". Bela's overly-antagonistic actions throughout the season did not calm the viewers' fears. [...] " [...] over the boys so badly," [...] Kripke explained, [...] "that she became unlikeable to the fans because she was irredeemable". Kripke has confessed [...] part of the decision to kill the character off was due to the negative reaction from the fans.|$|E
50|$|Jake {{comes to}} Emily {{in her last}} {{daydream}} of the episode. He repeats what Roger said in a previous daydream, telling her she knows why she can't leave Jericho, and for a moment, it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are about to kiss. At the end, Emily is shown to be alone - she had only imagined Jake was present.|$|R
5000|$|Many colleges use the SAT {{score to}} decide {{acceptance}} and scholarships. The late reporting of errors upset many high-profile colleges. The dean of admissions at Pomona College commented, [...] "Everybody {{appears to be}} telling half-truths, and that erodes confidence in College Board...It <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> hired the {{people who used to}} do the books for Enron".|$|R
