Willoughby filled every page. Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other, that she wept with agony through the whole of it.|$|E

The application of the State Aid principles of the EC-Treaty are compatible with the tasks assigned to the German public law financial institutions: Whilst property ownership rules must not be affected by the EC-Treaty, Member Sates must not act in a way that contravenes the Treaty provisions. The market economy investor principle does not allow a Member State to grant aid as long as the supported institution remains in an economically viable position. The degree of aid granted can be masured by the enhanced credit rating. The value of unlimited aid is not comparable to civil law concepts such as guarantees, <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>comfort,</b> profit sharing agreements or investor compensation schemes.

5000|$|In 1167, Diarmait Mac Murchada (Dermot MacMurrough) was {{deprived}} of the Kingdom of Leinster by the High King of Ireland - Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair. The grounds for the dispossession were that Mac Murchada had, in 1152, abducted Derbforgaill, {{the wife of the}} King of Breifne, Tiernan O'Rourke (Tighearnán Ua Ruairc). To recover his kingdom, Mac Murchada solicited help from the King of England - Henry II. The deposed king embarked for Bristol from near Bannow on 1 August 1166. He met Henry in Aquitaine in the Autumn of 1166. Henry could not help him at this time, but provided a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> for willing supporters of Mac Murchada's cause in his kingdom. However, after his return to Wales, he failed to rally any forces to his standard. He eventually met the count of Striguil (nicknamed [...] "Strongbow") and other barons of the Welsh Marches. Mac Murchada came to an agreement with Richard de Clare: for the Earl’s assistance with an army the following spring, he could have Aoife, Mac Murchada's eldest daughter in marriage and the succession to Leinster. As Henry’s approval or license to Mac Murchada was a general one, the count of Striguil thought it prudent to obtain Henry's specific consent to travel to Ireland: he waited two years to do this. The license he got was to aid Mac Murchada in the recovery of his kingdom of Leinster.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, banks {{throughout}} the world have found {{it increasingly difficult to}} obtain outright guarantees from companies to cover loan or other financial facilities to subsidiaries. Consequently, various third party credit support devices or comfort instruments, generally known as letters of comfort, have developed to provide an alternative to traditional forms of security. It is necessary for a proper understanding of these instruments to investigate their origin, to delineate them, and to consider their use in corporate group and banking practice. The typical comfort letter transaction involves the parent&# 8208;subsidiary&# 8208;lender trinity and at least three different, but inter&# 8208;related relationships which may be regulated by different legal regimes &# 150; first, between a lender and the subsidiary; secondly, between a lender and the parent company; and thirdly, between the parent company and the subsidiary. When the relationship between a lender and the subsidiary breaks down or the latter becomes insolvent, the courts are usually asked to determine the contractual effect of the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> as between the lender and the parent company. Letters of comfort are predominantly used in international business transactions. The issue of comfort letter enforceability is considerably more complex within an international context than in one&# 146;s own legal system. Courts in different jurisdictions and in disparate legal systems have adopted distinct approaches to determine the contractual enforceability of letters of comfort. Accordingly, a trans&# 8208;systemic view of the contractual effect of letters of comfort is necessary {{to be aware of the}} way in which such letters are treated in other legal systems, and to facilitate a consistent treatment of an instrument of international use in one&# 146;s domestic law. Over the years, letters of comfort have become more detailed in content. The result is more litigation about the enforceability of letters of comfort and, because of courts undertaking more contractual analysis of such letters, a doctrinal foundation for the assessment of liability against a parent company has started to be developed by courts in some jurisdictions. Legal liability based on a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> is a real possibility. Like a boomerang, a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> is potentially a dangerous instrument when it returns to its unsuspecting originator...|$|E

40|$|The Assumption of debt {{is one of}} {{the most}} ancient institutes of civil law, which realizes a passive-subjective {{modification}} of the obligatory agreement. There are only few procedural guidelines on this institute, for this reason jurists have long questioned themselves about the structure, the cause and the subject of the Assumption of debt. This piece of writing aims to identify an innovative theory relative to the nature of the assumption of debt, to be intended not as the contract itself in favour of a third party but as a contract with an essential three-sided structure. Moreover, there’s the attempt to demonstrate the subsistence of a dual causal profile, given the presence in the assumption of debt of both the generic cause and the specific cause; this peculiarity, identified with respect for the reconstruction on the cause of the transaction, makes the institute of assumption of debt very adaptable and adequate to satisfy the most heterogeneous needs of the partners. In conclusion, the subject of the assumption has been analyzed, dedicating more attention to the assumption of future debts. After demonstrating the validity of assumption on future debts a comparison has been made between the assumption of future debts, the bail bond omnibus and the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>comfort,</b> identifying similarities and differences between the three. The paper finds its bases on the historical introduction with the aim of reproducing and understanding the phenomenon of third party debt assumption, already present in ius civile, with a specific reference to the dispositions of 1804 and 1865 codes...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Import and Export Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 This {{study will}} {{specifically}} {{focus on the}} delictual liability of a bank where misrepresentation with regards to a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> {{is the cause of}} damages suffered by a client. Ultimately, the goal {{of this study is to}} answer the legal question: Under what circumstances can a bank, with specific reference to letters of comfort, be held delictually liable for damages suffered by a client as a result of a misrepresentation by the bank? This study will be based on a comparison between the South African law and the English law. The English law is a statutory system based on the “Law of Commons” and it has had a marked influence on the South African law. Although South Africa is a third world country, its banking law is based on British legislation and also influenced by the case law of this first world country. During the past decade there has been a definite shift in the way South African courts view the legal relationship between banks and their customers. It is clear that the courts more readily hold banks liable for damages caused to their customers. (Bernert v Absa Bank Limited, case number 14302 / 03, is an unreported case heard in the North Gauteng High Court of South Africa on 15 October 2008). Nationally and internationally banks have gained a vast influence on the economic development of a country. As a result banking has become a controlled and regulated profession. Nevertheless, South African banking law is known to be conservative and very hesitant to change with regards to modern ideas and the constantly changing circumstances of our times. From the developments in the case of Bernert v Absa Bank Limited lessons may be learned from the English law. Although England has a system of parliamentary sovereignty while South Africa is now a constitutional democracy, it would nevertheless be recommended that South African courts more readily take into consideration the decisions made by the English courts as our commercial law legislation is based on English law. It would reduce the legal costs of the parties involved and more importantly have a positive effect on international trade as it would create legal certainty which could lead thereto that international traders would feel more comfortable and secure to bring their money into South Africa, make investments in our country and enter into import en export contracts with South African companies.

The {{purpose of this}} master thesis is to perform integral evaluation <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> in twenty-five playrooms of eighteen Central-Slovenian children day care centers. Integral evaluation <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> has been performed in four steps, which included measurements of selected parameters <b>of</b> <b>comfort,</b> as well as surveying of the employees. The comprehensive literature review {{was carried out in}} step 1 as we identified the problems and defined criteria for integral evaluation <b>of</b> <b>comfort.</b> In-situ measurements <b>of</b> the selected parameters of thermal and visual comfort, indoor air quality and acoustic comfort were carried out in step 2 (objective evaluation <b>of</b> <b>comfort).</b> In addition, the subjective evaluation <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> was performed in step 3 on the basis of validated questionnaire. In the context of step 4 – integral evaluation <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> – we compared the measured and calculated parameters <b>of</b> each <b>comfort</b> type, analyzed the possible relationship between various parameters <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> in selected playrooms, compared the results of objective and subjective evaluation <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> and exposed the key conclusions. Based on the implemented steps we formulated integral comfort scale. We suggested possible improvements for achieving comfortable and healthy conditions in children day care centers. We have found out that there are no researches, which would include integral evaluation of thermal, visual, acoustic comfort and indoor air quality of children day care centers. Consequently, we are the first who used integral evaluation <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> approach in an educational institution. We have discovered that <b>comfort</b> in majority <b>of</b> day care centers is poor, while subjective evaluations <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> parameters in playrooms were deviating from the objective ones.

Organizing construct : The concept <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> is analyzed and defined in the context <b>of</b> laboring women. <b>Comfort</b> studied from a feminist perspective is suggested. Sources : A literature review of nursing, midwifery, and medical texts from the 1920 s to 1998 provides information about labor, pain in labor, and goals of providers caring for laboring women. Research articles focusing on comfort are identified as they relate to the concept <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> in labor. Writings of contemporary feminist authors provided the ideas for designing the study <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> from a feminist perspective. Methods : To develop a theory <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> during labor, early nursing and midwifery texts were searched to identify goals of care. The meaning <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> was analyzed from the early 1920 s to the present by concept analysis. Validation of findings was sought from publications on comfort research. Findings : Comfort can exist in spite of great pain and nurses and midwives may be able to assist laboring women to achieve a level <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> during labor. Intervening to promote the <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> laboring women can empower these women during birthing.
