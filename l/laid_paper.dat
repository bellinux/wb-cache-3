Background An ultimate objective of technical examination of <b>laid</b> <b>papers</b> is to help determine their date and location of manufacture. Prior to the mid- 18 th century <b>laid</b> <b>papers</b> were made by scooping paper pulp with a mold comprised of a screen within a rectangular wooden frame (Hunter, 1978) (Loeber, 1982). The screen allowed the water to drain from the pulp leaving {{a sheet of paper}} – sized by the borders of the frame – that would be removed to dry. The mold-based procedure for producing <b>laid</b> <b>papers</b> described in (Hunter, 1978) and (Loeber, 1982), leaves impressed features, including chain and laid lines and watermarks, detectable as thinner locations on a sheet of paper. Transmitted light photographs and beta-radiographs are often proposed for revealing these impressions as the thinner portions of the paper impede the signal less and therefore stand out in the image produced. Transmitted light photographs have the disadvantag...|$|R
