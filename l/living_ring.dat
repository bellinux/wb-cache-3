All research efforts in our group focus on functional polymers and new ways of gaining higher levels of control {{with regard to the}} placement of functional groups within these polymers. Here, the <b>living</b> <b>ring</b> opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) will be reviewed for which end-functionalization methods had been rare until very recently. Polymers carrying particular functional groups only at the chain-ends are, however, very interesting for a variety of industrial and academic applications. Polymeric surfactants and polymer-protein conjugates are two examples for the former and polymer-β-sheet-peptide conjugates one example for the latter. The functionalization of macroscopic or nanoscopic surfaces often relies on mono-end functional polymers. Complex macromolecular architectures are often constructed from macromolecules carrying exactly one functional group at their chain- end. The ring opening metathesis polymerization is particularly interesting in this context as {{it is one of the}} most functional group tolerant polymerization methods known. Additionally, high molecular weight polymers are readily accessible with this technique, a feature that living radical polymerizations often struggle to achieve. Finding new ways of functionalizing the polymer chain-end of ROMP polymers has therefore been a task long overdue. Here, we present our contribution to this area of research...|$|E
40|$|A general {{kinetic model}} to {{describe}} the initiation and monomer depletion phases of the metal-catalysed <b>living</b> <b>ring</b> opening polymerisation (ROP) of cyclic esters is presented. The model allows the description of ROP reactions in terms of rates of initiation (ki) and propagation (kp) and is in principle applicable to all metal-mediated ROP reactions. The model was validated by curve-fitting of data obtained for the living ROP of L-lactide catalysed {{by a variety of}} tin(II) catalysts. The catalyst was chosen from tin(II) diisopropoxide or from heteroleptic complexes of the type (LOx) Sn(OR), in which (LOx) is an amino or aminoether phenolate ancillary ligand and OR is isopropoxide or O-tert-butyl lactate. All tested catalysts promote the controlled, living polymerisation of L-lactide. No initiation phase was discerned for any of the considered catalysts in polymerisations performed at 60 °C, whereas at 25 °C initiation is an order of magnitude slower than propagation and, therefore, the inclusion of ki is required for an accurate kinetic description. Tin diisopropoxide is polymeric in the solid state, but it is dimeric in toluene solution. [Sn(OiPr) 2] 2 is an excellent example of an aggregated catalyst precursor and is catalytically more active than the heteroleptic (LOx) Sn(OR).

The Cp 2 TiCl mediated styrene LRP was also demonstrated from both activated and inactivated halides. The effect of reaction parameters (aldehyde structure, temperature, reagent ratios) was investigated in depth and optimized conditions were elaborated. The living character was supported by the linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion, narrow polydispersity and linear first order kinetics. The initiation was demonstrated by the presence of the aldehyde or halide fragment on the polymer chain end. ^ A room temperature initiating system was developed for the (co) polymerization of fluorinated monomers. Kinetic investigations revealed a UV and peroxide prerequisite, and the free radical character of the polymerization. A series of fluorinated (co) polymers were subsequently successfully synthesized and characterized. ^ Gold halides were also investigated as superior catalysts for 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;-caprolactone LROP.

40|$|While early {{transition}} metal (Ti, Zr) complexes are heavily exploited in α-olefin metallocene polymerizations, their radical polymer chemistry is virtually neglected. One {{of the objectives}} {{of this research was}} the exploration of the radical and coordinative ring opening chemistry of Ti in the synthesis of complex polymer architectures through development of novel, inexpensive and simple catalysts/initiators systems for mechanistically dissimilar living polymerizations. Cp 2 Ti(III) Cl generated by room temperature Zn reduction of Cp 2 Ti(IV) Cl 2 was explored as a catalyst for living radical polymerization (LRP) of styrene and isoprene initiated from four different classes of initiators such as epoxides, aldehydes, peroxides and halides {{as well as for the}} <b>living</b> <b>ring</b> opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic esters via the corresponding in situ generated Ti-alkoxides. Moreover, these two mechanistically dissimilar polymerizations can occur simultaneously, thereby providing convenient fast access to novel, topologically complex block, graft, miktoarm stars, and hyperbranched systems via simple one pot procedures. ^ Zirconium complexes were also demonstrated to be extremely efficient, low toxicity initiators for the ring opening of cyclic esters. Thus Zr-alkoxides generated by in-situ hydrozirconation of cyclic esters (e. g., caprolactone) and aldehydes catalyze the synthesis of ultra-high molecular weight poly(caprolactone) (PCL) by living ROP. The resulting polymers show unprecedented improvement in mechanical and rheological properties over commercially available PCL and will expand the applications of biocompatible polymers both as commodity plastics and in biomedical field due to their controlled biodegradability. ^ These advances provide powerful new synthetic tools for polymer science on the way of bridging radical, ring opening and coordination polymerizations. Their implementation will converge in the controlled synthesis of monodisperse polymer structures with complex new architectures and unusual topologies and compositions based on a wide, previously inaccessible selection of monomers and therefore leading to new material properties. ...|$|E

Chapter 1 highlights areas of transition metal chemistry of relevance to the general theme of this thesis, including recent advances in the ROMP of functionalized norbornene and norbornadiene monomers.

Amongst the functional groups introduced in this manner are CI, Me, OMe, CHO, CN, NMe(_ 2), NO(_ 2), NH(_ 2), CF(_ 3) and CO(_ 2) Me. Unusual 2 -oxametallacycle intermediates have been observed in solution for benzaldehyde derivatives possessing electron withdrawing substituents.

The use of substituted styrenes allows for functionalizadon of the start of the polymer chain. Chapter 4 investigates the "heteroatom exchange" reactivity of a variety of four coordinate molybdenum complexes. The exchange of multiply bonded oxo, imido and alkqrlidene units between such species, and to and from external substrates, has been investigated, and such studies have helped to identify bimolecular decomposition pathways responsible for the high molecular weight impurity sometimes observed in polymer samples prepared by living ROMP.

Reversible self-assemblies of nucleic acids with proteins that have defined internal structure in solution, i. e. viruses, represent some of the best elucidated biological supramolecules. This thesis represents our latest efforts to synthesize structural, functional and systemic mimics of such natural complexes, using a strategy based on the molecular design, synthesis and characterization of non-biological dendritic supramolecular self-assemblies that resemble in a primitive way the assembly of cylindrical or icosahedral viruses. ^ Our investigation employed building blocks able to self-assemble into cylindrical or spherical supramolecules that afforded hexagonal columnar or cubic thermotropic lattices. Model dendrons, i. e. minidendrons, were used as maquettes for the elaboration of high generation dendrimers and we demonstrated their potential in determining: (a) critical structural parameters for the self-assembly, (b) thermally-induced shape change mechanism, (c) novel architectural motifs. In addition, covalent linkage of these maquettes via a poly(ethyleneimine) backbone allowed: (a) the elucidation of the shape change mechanism {{as a function of the}} degree of polymerization, (b) the demonstration of the structural quasi-equivalence of these dendrons in the self-assembled state and (c) visualization of the self-assemblies on surfaces. These findings afforded the possibility of the estimation of the structure-properties relationship in self-assemblies formed from larger generations of dendritic structures. ^ Subsequent investigations involved the <b>living</b> <b>ring</b> opening metathesis polymerization of 7 -oxanorbornene monomers bearing bulky dendritic substituents. The shape of the resulted self-assembly was monitored and the shape change event during the polymerization of suitable monomers was elucidated by employing kinetic methods. Under certain conditions, extremely bulky and rigid substituents prevent the propagation past a critical degree of polymerization and the active chain end is encapsulated by the supramolecular aggregate. This results in a non-statistical interruption and the contained polymer chain is monodisperse. This synthetic system presents a sum of characteristics encountered before only in nature, i. e. molecular recognition directed synthesis, programmed control over the molecular weights, encoding of the final shape and size in the parental structure, and functionality preservation. ...|$|E
