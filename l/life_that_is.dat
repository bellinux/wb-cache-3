5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and more on his immediate surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his own thoughts as he begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E

25|$|On May 18, 2010, Andrew J. Wade {{announced}} a self-constructing pattern dubbed Gemini which creates {{a copy of}} itself while destroying its parent. This pattern replicates in 34 million generations, and uses an instruction tape made of gliders which oscillate between two stable configurations made of Chapman-Greene construction arms. These, in turn, create new copies of the pattern, and destroy the previous copy. Gemini is also a spaceship, and is the first spaceship constructed in the Game of <b>Life</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a knightship, which is a spaceship that is neither orthogonal nor purely diagonal.|$|E
25|$|Transhumant grazing is an {{important}} aspect of the cultural heritage of the Australian Alps, an area of which has been included on the Australian National Heritage List. Colonists started using this region for summer grazing in the 1830s, when pasture lower down was poor. The practice continued during the 19th and 20th centuries, helping make Australia's pastoral industry viable. Transhumant grazing created a distinctive way of <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{an important}} part of Australia's pioneering history and culture. There are features in the area that are reminders of transhumant grazing including abandoned stockman's huts, stock yards and stock routes.|$|E
25|$|Hence in {{accordance}} with the natural karmic laws, consequences occur when one utters a lie, steals something, commits acts of senseless violence or leads the life of a debauchee. Rather than assume that moral rewards and retribution are the work of a divine judge, the Jains believe that there is an innate moral order to the cosmos, self-regulating through the workings of karma. Morality and ethics are important, not because of the personal whim of a fictional god, but because a <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> led in agreement with moral and ethical principles is beneficial: it leads to a decrease and finally to the total loss of karma, which means: to ever increasing happiness.|$|E

25|$|It is {{commonly}} perceived that once women {{near the end}} of their reproductive years and enter menopause that this equates to the end of her sexual life. However, especially since women today are living one third or more of their lives in a postmenopausal state, maintaining, if not improving, their quality of life, of which their sexuality can be a key determinant, is of importance. A recent study of sexual activities among women aged 40–69 revealed that 75% of women are sexually active at this age; this indicates that the sexual health and satisfaction of menopausal women are an aspect of sexual health and quality of <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> worthy of attention by health care professionals.|$|E
25|$|Many of Joseph Smith's early revelations prophesied {{that the}} Latter Day Saints would build Zion, a new Jerusalem, a {{religious}} utopia centered in Jackson County, MO. The Prophet urged {{his followers to}} give everything they had to this cause. However, when they failed to live the Law of Consecration, which was a promise to voluntarily give all their property to the community for equal distribution, Joseph Smith received a revelation that God would build Zion later, when the people were ready. Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church {{have come to understand}} Zion as primarily a community way of <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> centered around Jesus Christ, but many people still believe that, when they are ready, {{they will be able to}} build the literal city of Zion as well.|$|E
25|$|Complete {{removal of}} the cancer without damage {{to the rest of}} the body (that is, {{achieving}} cure with near-zero adverse effects) is the ideal goal of treatment and is often the goal in practice. Sometimes this can be accomplished by surgery, but the propensity of cancers to invade adjacent tissue or to spread to distant sites by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness; and chemotherapy and radiotherapy can have a negative effect on normal cells. Therefore, cure with nonnegligible adverse effects may be accepted as a practical goal in some cases; and besides curative intent, practical goals of therapy can also include (1) suppressing the cancer to a subclinical state and maintaining that state for years of good quality of <b>life</b> (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> treating the cancer as a chronic disease), and (2) palliative care without curative intent (for advanced-stage metastatic cancers).|$|E

25|$|Double {{depression}} {{occurs when}} a person experiences a major depressive episode {{on top of the}} already-existing condition of dysthymia. It is difficult to treat, as sufferers accept these major depressive symptoms as a natural part of their personality or as a part of their <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> outside of their control. The fact that people with dysthymia may accept these worsening symptoms as inevitable can delay treatment. When and if such people seek out treatment, the treatment may not be very effective if only the symptoms of the major depression are addressed, but not the dysthymic symptoms. Patients with double depression tend to report significantly higher levels of hopelessness than is normal. This can be a useful symptom for mental health services providers to focus on when working with patients to treat the condition. Additionally, cognitive therapies can be effective for working with people with double depression in order to help change negative thinking patterns and give individuals a new way of seeing themselves and their environment.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Navy has {{periodically}} {{monitored the}} environmental {{conditions of the}} site since the sinking and has reported the results in an annual public report on environmental monitoring for U.S. nuclear-powered ships and boats. The reports provide specifics on the environmental sampling of sediment, water, and marine <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> done to ascertain whether the submarine has significantly affected the deep-ocean environment. The reports also explain the methodology for conducting this deep sea monitoring from both surface vessels and submersibles. The monitoring data confirm {{that there has been}} no significant effect on the environment. The nuclear fuel aboard the submarine remains intact and no uranium in excess of levels expected from the fallout from past atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons has been detected by the Navy's inspections. In addition, Scorpion carried two nuclear-tipped Mark 45 anti-submarine torpedoes (ASTOR) when she was lost. The warheads of these torpedoes are part of the environmental concern. The most likely scenario is that the plutonium and uranium cores of these weapons corroded to a heavy, insoluble material soon after the sinking, and they remain at or close to their original location inside the torpedo room of the boat. If the corroded materials were released outside the submarine, their density and insolubility would cause them to settle into the sediment.|$|E
