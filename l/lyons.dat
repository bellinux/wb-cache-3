5|$|After {{the success}} of the Imperial Economic Conference, <b>Lyons</b> {{appointed}} Bruce to London as Resident Minister in the United Kingdom it was to remain his and Ethel's home {{for the rest of their}} lives. His first task in London was to renegotiate the terms of Australia's burgeoning government debts, the repayment of which was crippling Depression-era Australia. Over two years, he negotiated with the Westminster Bank and the British Government for loan conversions worth £84 million, which saved Australia millions of pounds in interest over several years and along with the Ottawa Agreements were significant in helping alleviate the Australian government's budgetary difficulties. Bruce was asked at several points during the 1930s to return to Australia by UAP backers and other political figures, who hoped that he could replace <b>Lyons</b> as prime minister. He himself had questioned Lyons' health and capacity to execute the role effectively, but he showed little interest in returning. In 1938 and 1939 Bruce was approached by senior UAP figures and <b>Lyons</b> himself to return to Australia and assume the leadership of the government, which was struggling under the ailing <b>Lyons,</b> but he either flatly declined or set conditions for his return (such as an all-party government behind him) that were impossible to meet.|$|E
