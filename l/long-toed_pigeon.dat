50|$|The trocaz pigeon, Madeira {{laurel pigeon}} or <b>long-toed</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba trocaz) is a pigeon which is endemic {{to the island}} of Madeira. It is a mainly grey bird with a pinkish breast; its silvery neck patch and lack of white wing {{markings}} distinguish it from its close relative and probable ancestor, the common wood pigeon. Its call is a characteristic six-note cooing, weaker and lower-pitched {{than that of the}} wood pigeon. Despite its bulky, long-tailed appearance, this pigeon has a fast, direct flight.|$|E
