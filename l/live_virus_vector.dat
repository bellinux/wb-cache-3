40|$|AbstractUsing a {{rapid and}} {{reliable}} {{system based on}} Tn 7 -mediated site-specific transposition, we have successfully constructed a recombinant Oka varicella vaccine (vOka) expressing the mumps virus (MuV) fusion protein (F). The backbone of the vector was our previously reported vOka–BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) genome. We inserted the transposon Tn 7 attachment sequence, LacZα–mini-attTn 7, into the region between ORF 12 and ORF 13 to generate a vOka–BAC–Tn genome. The MuV–F expressing cassette was transposed into the vOka–BAC genome at the mini-attTn 7 transposition site. MuV–F protein was expressed in recombinant virus, rvOka–F infected cells. In addition, the MuV–F protein was cleaved in the rvOka–F infected cells as in MuV-infected cells. The growth of rvOka–F {{was similar to that}} of the original recombinant vOka without the F gene. Thus, we show that Tn 7 -mediated transposition is an efficient method for introducing a foreign gene expression cassette into the vOka–BAC genome as a <b>live</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vector...</b>|$|E

Unfortunately, there is no vaccine which has been designed specifically for use in breeding stocks of falcons. Therefore the immunogenicity and protective capacity of two commercially available WNV vaccines, both approved for use in horses, were evaluated in large falcons. One vaccine contained adjuvanted inactivated WNV lineage 1 immunogens, while the second represented a canarypox recombinant <b>live</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vector</b> vaccine. The efficacy of different vaccination regimes for these two vaccines was assessed serologically and by challenging the falcons with a WNV strain of homologous lineage 1. Our {{studies show that the}} recombinant vaccine conveys a slightly better protection than the inactivated vaccine, but moderate (recombinant vaccine) or weak (inactivated vaccine) side effects were observed at the injection sites. Using the recommended 2 -dose regimen, both vaccines elicited only sub-optimal antibody responses and gave only partial protection following WNV challenge. Better results were obtained for both vaccines after a third dose, i. e. alleviation of clinical signs, absence of fatalities and reduction of virus shedding and viraemia. Therefore the consequences of WNV infections in falcons can be clearly alleviated by vaccination, especially if the amended triple administration scheme is used, although side effects at the vaccination site must be accepted...|$|E
40|$|Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an {{attractive}} candidate for a live-virus vector for the delivery of foreign antigens. The Oka vaccine strain of VZV is safe and effective in humans, and recombinant Oka VZV (ROka) can be generated by transfecting cells {{with a set of}} overlapping cosmid DNAs. By this method, the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) glycoprotein D (gD 2) gene was inserted into an intergenic site in the unique short region of the Oka VZV genome. Expression of gD 2 in cells infected with the recombinant Oka strain VZV (ROka-gD 2) was confirmed by antibody staining of fixed cells and by immunoblot analysis. Immune electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of gD 2 in the envelope of ROka-gD 2 virions. The ability of ROka-gD 2 to protect guinea pigs against HSV- 2 challenge was assessed by inoculating animals with three doses of uninfected human fibroblasts, fibroblasts infected with ROka VZV, or fibroblasts infected with ROka-gD 2. Neutralizing antibodies specific for HSV- 2 developed in animals immunized with ROka-gD 2. Forty days after the third inoculation, animals were challenged intravaginally with HSV- 2. Inoculation of guinea pigs with ROka-gD 2 significantly reduced the severity of primary HSV- 2 infection (P < 0. 001). These experiments demonstrate that the Oka strain of VZV {{can be used as a}} <b>live</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vector</b> to protect animals from disease with a heterologous virus...|$|E

40|$|Avipoxviruses have {{recently}} been studied as potential vectors for the delivery of heterologous vaccine antigen. Because these viruses abortively infect mammalian cells yet still effectively present encoded foreign genes to the host immune system, they offer a safer but effective alternative to other <b>live</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vectors.</b> We have examined the effect of coexpressing the cytokine interleukin- 6 or gamma interferon on immune responses to a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing influenza virus hemagglutinin. The encoded cytokine was expressed for prolonged periods in infected cell culture with little cytopathic effect due to the abortive nature of the infection. In mice, vector-expressed cytokine dramatically altered immune responses induced by the coexpressed hemagglutinin antigen. Expression of interleukin- 6 augmented both primary systemic and mucosal antibody responses and primed for enhanced recall responses. In contrast, expression of gamma interferon markedly inhibited antibody responses without affecting the generation of cell-mediated immunity. The safety of these constructs was demonstrated in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, and no side effects due to cytokine expression were observed.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Immunization {{protocols}} involving priming with DNA and boosting with recombinant <b>live</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vectors</b> such as recombinant modified Vaccinia Ankara (rMVA) {{are considered}} as vaccine candidates against HIV. Such protocols improve {{the outcome of}} simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) pathogenic challenge in Rhesus monkeys. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the fate of vaccine-induced T cells after a mucosal SHIV challenge. METHODS: We immunized Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) by DNA priming followed by rMVA boost. After intrarectal challenge with SHIV 89. 6 P, immunized animals demonstrated early control of viral replication and stable CD 4 T-cell counts. We monitored T-cell responses by measuring IFN-gamma secretion and proliferation. RESULTS: Immunization induced strong and sustained SHIV-specific CD 4 and CD 8 T-cell responses. CD 8 T-cell responses were recalled during acute infection, whereas none of the vaccine-induced SHIV-specific CD 4 T-cell responses were recalled. Moreover, most of the CD 4 T-cell responses became undetectable in peripheral blood or lymph nodes even after in-vitro peptide stimulation. In contrast, we persistently detected CD 4 T-cell responses specific for control recall antigens in infected animals. CONCLUSION: SHIV 89. 6 P challenge results in a lack of reactivity of vaccine-induced SHIV-specific CD 4 T cells. These results may have important implications in the AIDS vaccine field, especially {{for the evaluation of}} new vaccine candidates, both in preventive and therapeutic trials...|$|R

To provide an appropriate context for understanding the potential for recombination of virus-vectored vaccines, we review briefly {{the current status of}} virus-vectored vaccines, mechanisms of recombination between viruses, experience with recombination involving live attenuated vaccines in the field, and concerns raised previously in the literature regarding recombination of virus-vectored vaccines with wild type virus strains. We then present a discussion of the major variables that could influence recombination between a virus-vectored vaccine and circulating wild type virus and the consequences of such recombination, including intrinsic recombination properties of the parent virus used as a vector; sequence relatedness of vector and wild virus; virus host range, pathogenesis and transmission; replication competency of vector in target host; mechanism of vector attenuation; additional factors potentially affecting virulence; and circulation of multiple recombinant vectors in the same target population. Finally, we present some guiding principles for vector design and testing intended to anticipate and mitigate the potential for and consequences of recombination of virus-vectored vaccines with wild type pathogenic virus strains.

40|$|The {{vaccinia virus}} (VACV) Lister strain {{was one of}} the vaccine strains that enabled {{smallpox}} eradication. Although the strain is most often harmless, there have been numerous incidents of mild to life-threatening accidents with this strain and others. In an attempt to further attenuate the Lister strain, we investigated the role of 5 genomic regions known to be deleted in the modified VACV Ankara (MVA) genome in virulence in immunodeficient mice, immunogenicity in immunocompetent mice, and vaccine efficacy in a cowpox virus challenge model. Lister mutants were constructed so as to delete each of the 5 regions or various combinations of these regions. All of the mutants replicated efficiently in tissue culture except region I mutants, which multiplied more poorly in human cells than the parental strain. Mutants with single deletions were not attenuated or only moderately so in athymic nude mice. Mutants with multiple deletions were more highly attenuated than those with single deletions. Deleting regions II, III, and V together resulted in total attenuation for nude mice and partial attenuation for SCID mice. In immunocompetent mice, the Lister deletion mutants induced VACV specific humoral responses equivalent to those of the parental strain but in some cases lower cell-mediated immune responses. All of the highly attenuated mutants protected mice from a severe cowpox virus challenge at low vaccine doses. The data suggest that several of the Lister mutants combining multiple deletions could be used in smallpox vaccination or as <b>live</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vectors</b> at doses equivalent to those used fo...|$|R

A. Haller et al., 2000, J. Virol. 74, 11626 – 11635). The contribution of this conservative amino acid substitution (I 1103 V) in the polymerase to the temperature-sensitive and attenuation phenotypes of r-bPIV 3 was investigated by creating a new virus, r-bPIV 3 (I), that expressed the wild-type polymerase. r-bPIV 3 (I) was not temperature-sensitive for growth in vitro and the replication of r-bPIV 3 (I) was no longer restricted in hamsters. The effect of the amino acid substitution in the polymerase was also studied in a chimeric bovine/human PIV 3, a virus that displayed temperature-sensitive and attenuated phenotypes (A. A. Haller et al., 2000, J. Virol. 74, 11626 – 11635). It was not clear whether these defects were due to the impaired polymerase or the replacement of the bPIV 3 surface glycoproteins with those of hPIV 3. The results showed that the altered polymerase was indeed responsible for the temperature-sensitive phenotype of bovine/human PIV 3 but did not appear {{to play a role in}} the attenuation phenotype...|$|R

Inactivated H 5 N 1 vaccines induce limited immune responses and, {{in the case of}} live-attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIV), there are safety concerns regarding the possibility of reassortment between the H 5 gene segment and circulating influenza vi-ruses. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we rearranged the genome of an avian H 9 N 2 influenza virus and expressed the en-tire H 5 hemagglutinin open reading frame (ORF) from the segment 8 viral RNA. These vectors had reduced polymerase activities as well as viral replication in vitro and excellent safety profiles in vivo. Immunization with the dual H 9 -H 5 influenza virus re-sulted in protection against lethal H 5 N 1 challenge in mice and ferrets, and also against a potentially pandemic H 9 virus. Our studies demonstrate that rearranging the influenza virus genome has great potential for the development of improved vaccines against influenza virus as well as other pathogens.

40|$|Although RSV {{has been}} a high {{priority}} for vaccine development, efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine have yet to lead to a licensed product. Clinical and epidemiologic features of RSV disease suggest there are at least 4 distinct target populations for vaccines, the RSV naïve young infant, the RSV naïve child ≥ 6 months of age, pregnant women (to provide passive protection to newborns), and the elderly. These target populations raise different safety and efficacy concerns and may require different vaccination strategies. The highest priority target population is the RSV naïve child.

40|$|<b>Live</b> <b>viruses</b> and <b>live</b> <b>virus</b> {{vaccines}} induce {{cellular immunity}} {{more readily than}} do inactivated viruses or purified proteins, but the mechanism by which this process occurs is unknown. A trivial explanation would relate {{to the ability of}} <b>live</b> <b>viruses</b> to spread and infect more cells than can inactivated virus. We have used live but replication-defective mutants to investigate this question. Our studies indicate that the immune responses of mice to <b>live</b> <b>virus</b> differ greatly from the responses to inactivated virus even when the virus does not complete a replicative cycle. Further, these studies indicate that herpes simplex virus-specific T-cell responses can be generated by infection with replication-defective mutant viruses. These data indicate that the magnitude of the cellular immunity to herpes simplex virus may be proportional to the number or quantity of different viral gene products expressed by an immunizing virus. Because herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) are ubiquitous human pathogens which cause infections in newborn and immunocompromised patients and considerable morbidity in otherwise healthy people, considerable efforts have gone into producing herpesvirus-specific vaccines (2, 7, 20, 31, 39, 43 - 46). Although transient protection has been achieved by immunizing mice with purified glycoproteins (2), the search for long-lasting immunity has led investigators to concen-trate on the development of live vaccines which are better stimulators of T cells (7, 24, 27 - 29, 31, 36, 43).
