30|$|In this study, we {{have tried}} that the forming {{approach}} of the austenitic stainless steels as well as forming the helicopter tail rotor piece of steel grade 301 to be examined. Herein, based on the theory of Liu et al., the blank holder force is ascendant varied in during the forming. The flowchart of the secondary blank holder force is used to simulate the forming of the austenitic stainless steel sheet. In addition, to reduce the work hardening during the forming process, the initial preheat conditions were considered. Some sheet samples were placed under the various temperature conditions, and their mechanical properties were compared with the sheet tested under the ambient conditions. The result of this comparison showed that to prevent the work hardening during the process and to prevent the structure-phase changes, the preheated temperature that equal to 350  °C has closest and most optimal properties {{with respect to the}} environment temperature. The mechanical properties such as stress-strain curve required for the simulation were considered based on the abovementioned temperature. Secondly, the forming boundary condition set {{in such a way that}} when the punch goes down to 30  mm at the mouth of the die, the blank holder force is progressively shifted from the initial amount of 30, 000 to 350, 000  N. In order to form the intended steel group 301, the forming tensile die was designed and built based on the critical section and a sample length of 200  mm. Also, the primary and secondary blank forces are obtained using trial and error by design and construction of PLC system to control the speed of the punch relative to the velocity of movement of the plate holder jaw carriage. The hydraulic <b>lifting</b> <b>jack</b> pressure and the driver jack of the holder jaw carriage were considered based on the forming required tonnage, and then the prototype was built. Finally, by point to point controlling the resulting piece with the nominal dimensions contained in the plot, and based on the obtained results, it was concluded that the most piece deviation in the critical sections to the nominal dimensions is 0.9 % that is acceptable based on the simulated logarithmic strain. Hence, it can be concluded that the piece springback has decreased. Meanwhile, by preheating the piece and cooling it under conditions of the ambient temperature, the amount of work hardening during the process is reached to its minimum value.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>lift</b> <b>jack</b> is {{fundamentally}} a lever that {{attaches to the}} scenery wagon platform with a hinge, with a caster mounted to {{the underside of the}} lever near the hinge.

50|$|Jamalpur Workshop, {{the first}} {{full-fledged}} railway workshop facility in India, was opened on 8 February 1862, {{at a time}} when the Howrah-Delhi main line, passing through Jamalpur was under construction. It was felt that communities of gun smiths and other craftsmen in the area handling mechanical engineering jobs could pick up the skills required in a railway workshop. It undertook repairs of wagons, coaches, cranes and tower cars, and locomotives, as well as manufacture of some tower cars, break-down cranes and various kinds of heavy-duty <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks.</b> They also produced their own locomotives, starting with the CA 764 Lady Curzon in 1899. It has also produced ticket printers and other ticket machines (slitting, counting, and chopping). With fairly extensive workshop facilities, it was a fairly self-contained.|$|R
60|$|The two {{children}} <b>lifted</b> <b>Jack's</b> body, {{which was not}} at all heavy, and placed it upon the saddle. Then they climbed up behind it and the Sawhorse immediately turned and trotted back along the path he had come, bearing all three with ease. However, when the path began to branch into many paths, all following different directions, the wooden animal became puzzled and soon was wandering aimlessly about, without any hope of finding the right way. Toward evening they came upon a fine fruit tree, which furnished the children a supper, and at night the little ones lay upon a bed of leaves while the Sawhorse stood watch, with the limp, headless form of poor Jack Pumpkinhead lying helpless across the saddle.|$|R
5000|$|Later off the peg buses {{such as the}} Daimler Fleetlines {{were less}} suited to this style of {{maintenance}} due to the bodies distorting if removed from their chassis. These vehicles would be overhauled but without separating the body/chassis - indeed, many of them {{did not last long}} enough in London Transport service to receive overhauls. Overhauls of vehicles of this type were therefore carried with the vehicle in [...] "built up" [...] form. LT had to set aside a separate area of the works for this type of work away from the [...] "normal" [...] work. <b>Lifting</b> <b>jacks</b> to raise vehicles were installed to enable access beneath. This type of overhaul resulted in the bus being off the road for weeks or even months, and was a very inefficient use of vehicle fleets.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1857, Richard Tangye, with {{brothers}} James and Joseph, {{started a}} manufacturing business in Mount Street {{under the title}} of James Tangye and Bros. Principally manufacturing hydraulic appliances and particularly <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks,</b> on 31 January 1858, their jacks were successfully employed in the launching of Brunel's steamship [...] Tangye said of the project: We launched the Great Eastern and she launched us In 1859, brothers Edward and George joined, together with George Price. The company acquired the patent of the differential pulley-block in 1861, and in 1862 James Tangye invented the Tangye Patent Hydraulic Jack. This resulted in the 1862 purchase and demolition of Soho-located Smethwick Hall, {{on the site of}} which was built the Cornwall Works.

5000|$|The diesel shed was in {{reinforced}} concrete and comprised three adjoining buildings. The servicing and maintenance building that covers roads 1-4 {{is on the}} western side of the shed; number 1 road is equipped with a wheel lathe and <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks</b> for bogie changes. The central building was the Heavy Maintenance Shed; engines can be removed and repainting undertaken on the two roads, numbers 5 and 6. The final three roads were in the servicing shed on {{the eastern side of the}} site, where locomotives could be inspected and refuelled. There were covered fuelling points outside in the yard, supplied by a 45,000 gallon fuel tank. A small group of buildings house stores and a workshop for shed equipment and is situated between the main shed and the curve of the Sutton Harbour branch (now realigned to the west of the shed and known locally as the [...] "Speedway"). Carriage washing takes place south of the shed at Mount Gould, alongside the line to Plymouth Friary.|$|R
5000|$|Part of the Ford Fairlane 500 range, the Skyliner had {{a complex}} {{mechanism}} which folded {{the front of}} the roof and retracted it under the rear decklid. No hydraulic mechanisms were used as in regular convertibles of the era. The Skyliner top has seven reversible electric motors (only six for 1959 models [...] ), four <b>lift</b> <b>jacks,</b> a series of relays, ten limit switches, ten solenoids, four locking mechanisms for the roof and two locking mechanisms for the trunk lid, and a total of 610 ft of wiring. The large top took up vast amounts of trunk space, limiting the car's sales (however, unlike what most people believe, the mechanism had decent reliability). Production totaled 20,766 units in 1957, declining to 14,713 in 1958 and to 12,915 in 1959. An electric clock was standard. Fuel consumption was around 14 mpg overall. The fuel tank was placed vertically in back of the rear seat, which inadvertently added safety in rear collisions.|$|R
