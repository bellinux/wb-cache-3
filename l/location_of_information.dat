The historic [...] "Beechy" [...] train ran on this line from 1902 to 1962. The trail has 21 seats installed along the route for walkers to rest on, with shelters having been erected at Banool, Wimba, McDevitt and Dinmont. These were the old stopping points where the train would have collected travellers or produce. The original station signs have been replicated and painted in the Victorian railways colours. These being on a black board with white colouring and are positioned at the relevant stopping points along the rail trail.

50|$|The {{possible}} {{reason for not}} using a centralized <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is that tar was originally meant for tapes, which are bad at random access anyway: if the Table Of Contents (TOC) were {{at the start of}} the archive, creating it would mean to first calculate all the positions of all files, which needs doubled work, a big cache, or rewinding the tape after writing everything to write the TOC. On the other hand, if the TOC were at the end-of-file (as is the case with ZIP files, for example), reading the TOC would require that the tape be wound to the end, also taking up time and degrading the tape by excessive wear and tear. Compression further complicates matters; as calculating compressed positions for a TOC at the start would need compression of everything before writing the TOC, a TOC with uncompressed positions is not really useful (since one has to decompress everything anyway to get the right positions) and decompressing a TOC at the end of the file might require decompressing the whole file anyway, too.|$|E

Like other types <b>of</b> governmental <b>information,</b> location-based information can be collected, managed, used, and exchanged with support <b>of</b> new <b>information</b> and communication technologies (ICT). In past years, governments have implemented many initiatives to promote and facilitate the use and exchange <b>of</b> <b>location</b> <b>information.</b> In many cases these initiatives are situated outside the e-government area. However, many authors and practitioners have stressed the need for the integration <b>of</b> <b>location</b> <b>information</b> activities within e-government. In order {{to bridge the gap between}} location information activities and e-government, several governments have developed and implemented a location information strategy. The objective of this chapter is to explore how the development <b>of</b> <b>location</b> <b>information</b> strategies contributes to a better integration <b>of</b> <b>location</b> <b>information</b> in e-government. An analysis <b>of</b> four European <b>location</b> <b>information</b> strategies shows that these strategies have two elements in common: they all highlight the significance <b>of</b> <b>location</b> <b>information</b> for realizing the objectives of e-government and define requirements and actions for a better understanding and wider use <b>of</b> <b>location</b> <b>information.</b> A better integration <b>of</b> <b>location</b> <b>information</b> in e-government provides benefits to governments, citizens, and businesses. Key actions for realizing these benefits are improving the access to location information, establishing core reference data, and providing society with the skills and knowledge necessary for handling location information. status: publishe...|$|R

The experimental reasoning task used here, to decide a legal case, involved judgments of information relevance and inductive reasoning. Subjects tended to decide in favor of the party whose precedents were more directly linked to the evidence. Hence, the manipulation of the links caused a bias in subjects' reasoning. Subjects based their decisions the information that was most available to their mental models when they thought about the evidence and issues in the case. The availability of information was controlled by its presentation and subjects ' prior belief biases, suggesting a new principle: representation availability. There were no effect...|$|E

40|$|The {{well-known}} duality relating entangled {{states and}} noisy quantum channels {{is expressed in}} terms of a channel ket, a pure state on a suitable tripartite system, which functions as a pre-probability allowing the calculation of statistical correlations between, for example, the entrance and exit of a channel, once a framework has been chosen so as to allow a consistent set of probabilities. In each framework the standard notions of ordinary (classical) information theory apply, and it makes sense to ask whether information of a particular sort about one system is or is not present in another system. Quantum effects arise when a single pre-probability is used to compute statistical correlations in different incompatible frameworks, and various constraints on the presence and absence of different kinds of information are expressed in a set of all-or-nothing theorems which generalize or give a precise meaning to the concept of "no-cloning. " These theorems are used to discuss: the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in quantum channels modeled using a mixed-state environment; the CQ (classical-quantum) channels introduced by Holevo; and the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in the physical carriers of a quantum code. It is proposed that both channel and entanglement problems be classified in terms of pure states (functioning as pre-probabilities) on systems of p≥ 2 parts, with mixed bipartite entanglement and simple noisy channels belonging to the category p= 3, a five-qubit code to the category p= 6, etc.; then by the dimensions of the Hilbert spaces of the component parts, along with other criteria yet to be determined.
