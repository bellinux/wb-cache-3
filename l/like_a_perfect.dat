Sony's Rory Bruer {{explained}} that the audience of Men in Black 3 should be a perfect match for this footage and that the six minutes should get everyone excited. The footage revealed an exchange between Peter and Gwen that Brad Williams from WhatCulture.com described as [...] "brief and cutesy". Brad found the CGI fairly clean and felt that the film seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> match for 3D.|$|E

In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, but when I got there Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at that time. I always {{wanted to work with}} her and Like a Virgin seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> opportunity." ...|$|E

Speaking of Mulder's {{possible}} sexual encounter with Kristen, series creator Chris Carter said, [...] "I thought, 'This guy's a monk. Let's {{let him be}} a human. Especially in [...] absence, it seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> opportunity to do it." [...] Duchovny had previously acted alongside another real-life girlfriend, Maggie Wheeler, in the first season episode [...] "Born Again". Gillian Anderson is absent from the episode as she was on leave {{to give birth to}} her daughter Piper at the time. This episode was the first in which Scully did not appear.|$|E

500|$|Watched by {{more than}} 30million viewers weekly during its three-year run, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour was praised for the comedic timing, and deadpan Cher mocked Sonny about his looks and short stature. According to Berman, they [...] "exuded an aura of warmth, playfulness, and caring that only {{enhanced}} their appeal. Viewers were further enchanted when a young Chastity also appeared on the show. They seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> family." [...] Cher honed her acting skills in sketch comedy roles such as the brash housewife Laverne, the sardonic waitress Rosa, and historical vamps, including Cleopatra and Miss Sadie Thompson. The Bob Mackie designed clothing Cher wore {{was part of the}} show's attraction, and her style influenced the fashion trends of the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|... "A Short Story About Love" [...] was co-written by {{executive}} producer J.H. Wyman and co-producer Graham Roland. Wyman {{stated that the}} episode had [...] "scary" [...] and [...] "romantic" [...] themes, and as the title indicated, was [...] "all about motivation. Love is a great motivator, for good and evil." [...] He and fellow executive producer Jeff Pinkner believed the episode was [...] "kind of <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> version of what a Fringe show is," [...] because it depicted [...] "fringy" [...] elements {{in the form of}} killings while using love and relationships as central plot drivers. Wyman added that it was a [...] "culmination of what I could describe as — it’s a direction where we’ve been heading and I think the fans will be really happy and satisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|He continued, [...] "It {{all felt}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> fit. What's great about the scene, too, is there's hardly any dialogue. It's nine minutes long. I knew I {{had to start}} minimal and give it space. Let notes ring, then give it space, and build up the {{anticipation}} from there, without tipping in either direction." [...] Djawadi stated that he refrained from using the typical Lannister theme, [...] "The Rains of Castamere", {{in order to create}} more of a mystery. The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying [...] "The boys I recorded completely separate. The strings I recorded all together. Even the solo instruments, I recorded them separately — the solo violins and solo cellists were recorded separately. The piano, I played. And the organ as well." ...|$|E

500|$|NME {{reviewer}} Louis Pattison rated Syro 9out of 10and {{surmised that}} {{the album is}} [...] "a banging reminder of why the Cornish raver is one of music's true innovators". Pattison further stated that [...] "whereas Drukqs sometimes felt alienating or punishing, Syro charms and beguiles … [...] amazing: bug-eyed, banging rave that sounds quintessentially Aphex while not quite sounding like anything he's done before." [...] In his review for The Wire, Derek Walmsley wrote positively about the album. He said that [...] "Syro feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfected</b> memory of 80s music", adding [...] "its sweeping melodies, with echoes of 1991's Analogue Bubblebath, {{could be seen as}} a return to his roots" [...] but concluded that [...] "Aphex Twin's music seems as new as it ever was." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer Will Hermes gave Syro a four-out-of-five star rating and stated that the record is [...] "thick with Seventies jazz-funk nods" [...] and [...] "answers Daft Punks Random Access Memories with future-shock electronics supplanting nostalgic dazzle … graying snobs once called this 'intelligent dance music.'

Nevertheless, he was relieved that the race passed without any major incident and said the reason why the majority of the drivers supported Michael Schumacher was that he [...] "behaved <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> leader". Villeneuve said to British television station ITV that he felt discussing a no overtaking pact at the race circuit was not the appropriate place: [...] "We are race car drivers, Because we signed contracts before the season and everyone was happy to be a race car driver and to earn millions of dollars. Because we knew a year ago {{that there would be a}} race at Monza and nobody complained." [...] FIA president Max Mosley stated that he disagreed with the pact and said that the drivers should have raised the concerns in the months leading up to the Grand Prix.|$|E
500|$|... "Silly Love Songs" [...] was {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim from many television critics upon its initial airing. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave a very positive review of the episode, and wrote, [...] "This was our favorite type of Glee episode. Though we enjoy over-the-top spectacles , the show's real cleverness shines when they take songs from across the board and fit them into a cohesive storyline. Sue Sylvester didn't make an appearance and—dare we say it—we didn't even miss her." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed the episode, going on to write, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} strong showing, if a little disjointed. Well, at least it was honest. If this show is one thing, it's disjointed. It's part of its spazzy appeal." [...] Melissa Maerz of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode a positive review: [...] "On Tuesday night, Glee wasn’t only back at its usual time, it was back to doing what it does best: giving us entertaining [...] storylines involving characters we care about who sing songs that emerge organically and advance the story. It was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> heart-shaped bubble of an episode reminding the show’s fans about all the things we’ve missed about the show these last couple of months." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{considered}} a [...] "good moment" [...] on the film's soundtrack album by AllMusics writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine. Erlewine called it [...] "excellent" [...] and favored it over the tracks of Survivor (2001), Destiny's Child's previous album. Although considered a great transition for Beyoncé, Vibe disagreed, stating that the song debuted a tepid beginning for Beyoncé, who had high anticipations for a solo-career. Contactmusic.com named the contributions by Beyoncé on the movie's soundtrack as a highlight of the album. Rob Boss of Walmart called Beyoncé [...] "alluring" [...] while reviewing her performance on the soundtrack and comparing it to her performance in the movie itself. Dismissing Beyoncé's acting by stating [...] "she should stick to singing and leave the acting to the actors," [...] Boss called her performance on the song intense and stated that the opening track [...] "Work It Out" [...] was a reason enough to include Beyoncé in the film. Rob Fitzpatrick [...] of New Musical Express gave the song a mixed to positive review, writing that it sounds not only <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> imitation or replication of classic funk, but also like a derivation of various other sources and motifs. John Mulvey, writing for the same magazine, considered [...] "Work It Out" [...] {{to be the best}} tune Beyoncé had recorded since [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), and he further commented, [...] "it's Beyoncé yowling, testifying and wigging out in only slightly-studied retro fashion that's most striking." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} glowing {{praise from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "The Host" [...] a rare A+, noting {{that it was}} [...] "a refreshing instance of a fully and satisfactorily resolved episode — <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> meal, although you definitely don't want to eat during this one." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club described the episode as [...] "the first really, really icky X-Files", and while considering redundant the [...] "circular" [...] nature of the plot, with the creature {{coming back to the}} sewers after escaping, he felt that [...] "The Host" [...] "holds up because of the Flukeman's irreconcilable ugliness, and because it continues down the path that [...] "Little Green Men" [...] started on". On a more negative view, Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 6/10, considering that [...] "as fun as this episode can be, there are some places were it just doesn’t quite add up", criticizing writing elements such as the lack of resolution, the explanation for the Flukeman's origins, and the [...] "heavy-handed" [...] introduction of X. A writer from the Vancouver Sun listed [...] "The Host" [...] {{as one of the best}} stand alone episodes of the show, saying that it broke the [...] "B-movie fun at best" [...] quality of most X-Files standalone episodes, saying that [...] "thanks to its cinema-grade made-up effects, claustrophobic sets and chilling subject matter, this Chris Carter-penned episode not only took the show to new heights of horror and suspense, it offered a fresh alternative on network television". [...] "The Host" [...] was later picked for the 2008 DVD The X-Files: Revelations, with eight episodes Chris Carter considered [...] "essential grounding" [...] for the film [...] The plot for the episode was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Les Martin.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the sense}} drive overcomes the form drive, {{according}} to Schiller, it reduces man into matter, but leaves him without {{the ability to}} bring this matter into unity. [...] "As long as he merely feels, merely desires and acts upon desire, he is as yet nothing but world, if by this term we understand nothing but the formless content of time" [...] (117). In order to not be just [...] "world", man must exercise his form drive upon matter, and [...] "give reality the predisposition he carries within him". When the form drive overpowers, Schiller says we experience [...] "the greatest enlargement of being", meaning that {{because it is a}} drive toward the absolute, all limitations disappear, and instead of seeing the world finitely, as he does through the sensuous drive, [...] "man has raised himself to a unity of ideas embracing the whole realm of phenomena". Since the sense drive places us in time, indulging in the formal drive removes us out of time, and in doing so [...] "We are no longer individuals; we are species". While this seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfected</b> state, it is only a point on the path to man reaching his maximum potential.|$|R
