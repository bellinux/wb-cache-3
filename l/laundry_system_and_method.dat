40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{demonstration}} project is to quantify the energy savings and water efficiency potential of commercial <b>laundry</b> wastewater recycling <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> low-temperature detergent supply systems to help promote the adoption of these technologies in the commercial sector. This project will create a set of technical specifications for efficient multi-load <b>laundry</b> <b>systems</b> (both new <b>and</b> retrofit) tailored for specific applications and/or sectors (e. g., hospitality, health care). The specifications will be vetted with the appropriate Better Buildings Alliance (BBA) members (e. g., Commercial Real Estate Energy Alliance, Hospital Energy Alliance), finalized, published, and disseminated to enable widespread technology transfer in the industry and specifically among BBA partners...|$|R

40|$|A <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>method</b> for {{simultaneous}} <b>and</b> asynchronous transmissions in multi-antenna multi-hop networks. The <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>method</b> employ randomized <b>and</b> non-greedy {{resource allocation}} to counter starvation. The <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>method</b> define {{a class of}} asynchronous random access protocols subsuming MIMO systems via two components. Residual Capacity Estimation and Randomized Resource Allocation. The <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>method</b> realize the first asynchronous MIMO MAC protocol that counters flow starvation in multi-hop networks. Randomized and non-greedy antenna allocation coupled with local residual capacity estimation results in previously-starving nodes capturing {{a fair share of}} system resources while simultaneously exploiting throughput gains available to multi-antenna systems...|$|R

40|$|A {{photogrammetry}} <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>method</b> {{provide for}} determining the relative position between two objects. The system utilizes one or more imaging devices, such as high speed cameras, that are mounted on a first body, {{and three or more}} photogrammetry targets of a known location on a second body. The <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>method</b> can be utilized with cameras having fish-eye, hyperbolic, omnidirectional, or other lenses. The <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>method</b> do not require overlapping fields-of-view if two or more cameras are utilized. The <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>method</b> derive relative orientation by equally weighting information from an arbitrary number of heterogeneous cameras, all with non-overlapping fields-of-view. Furthermore, the system can make the measurements with arbitrary wide-angle lenses on the cameras...|$|R
