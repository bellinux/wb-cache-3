50|$|Duncan came up {{with the}} idea of THoR in a bit of a fluke while looking for {{something}} to entertain himself during a <b>long</b> <b>plane</b> ride and subsequent vacation. After a recommendation from a colleague, Duncan browsed through a few online history lectures in search of something to pass the time. While surfing through these lectures, through a series of links Duncan stumbled upon the 12 Byzantine Rulers podcast from Lars Brownworth, listened to a few episodes, and thought “This is really cool!”. However, when he searched for similar podcasts on the history of Rome, he could find none. Immediately, Mike was inspired to “do something like” Brownworth's podcast. He had had a longstanding interest in Roman history and was reading The War With Hannibal by Livy at the time. He enjoyed many of the historical episodes he encountered in the book, but realized that much of the public knew little about Rome outside of Caesar’s and Augustus’ time. One of Duncan's motivators for creating the podcast was to make the whole of Roman history attractive to the public through the form of a podcast.|$|E
50|$|The {{single-storey}} house {{is made of}} two gable-roofed sections, with broken-back extensions. Together they form a long, rectangular plan shape, the long sides of which are oriented toward the east and west. The northern section {{of the house is}} wider than the other by approximately 2m. This additional width extends to the west, on the rear elevation. The roof to the southern section of the house is slightly lower than the other, though its steep pitch is the same. A broken-back skirt of roof is created on its three exposed sides. On the eastern elevation, the <b>long</b> <b>plane</b> of roof set at a secondary pitch continues past the northern segment of the house, making a separate verandah roof. This roof bends to meet the wall of the first storey lookout, which nestles under the high ridge of the gable roof. A sandstone chimneystack projects from the site where the two main gable roofs join, near their ridgelines. Two sandstone chimneystacks project through the line where the roof changes pitch on the western side of the northern section of the house. On this elevation, where the two parts meet, the roof to the northern section is stepped back. This marks a narrow corridor and stair that separates the two sections. All roof planes are clad in corrugated iron, and unless otherwise stated this is the case with the roofs of other buildings in the complex.|$|E

Both the Nebraska and the Georgia tertiary care teaching hospitals are among the four U.S. facilities best suited for the treatment of Ebola patients; the Nebraska facility features the largest one, a 10-bed isolation unit. Dr. Sacra's wife, Debbie, at a news conference at the Worcester, Massachusetts-based UMass Memorial Medical Center, stated that her husband was in good spirits and had willingly chosen to go, knowing the risks. No further information beyond the above could be provided because of public health and patient confidentiality regulations.
