These architectures are the Shenoy-Shafer Architecture, the <b>Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter</b> <b>Architecture</b> and the HUGIN Architecture. We propose a new architecture called ”Fast-Division Architecture ” {{which is similar to}} the former two. But there are two important advantages: (i) results of intermediate computations are always valid Dempster-Shafer belief functions and (ii) some operations can often be performed much more efficiently. ...|$|E

There are several variants {{of this method}} all based on the algebraic structure of a valuation algebra. A strong requirement underlying {{this approach is that}} the elements of a problem decomposition form a join tree. Although it is always possible to construct covering join trees, if the requirement is originally not satisfied, it is not always possible or not efficient to extend the elements of the decomposition to the covering join tree. Therefore in this paper different variants of an axiomatic framework of valuation algebras are introduced which prove sufficient for local computation without the need of an extension of the factors of a decomposition. This framework covers the axiomatic system proposed by (Shenoy & Shafer, 1990). A particular emphasis is laid on the important special cases of idempotent algebras and algebras with some notion of division. It is shown that all well-known architectures for local computation like the Shenoy-Shafer <b>architecture,</b> <b>Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter</b> and HUGIN <b>architectures</b> may be adapted to this new framework. Further a new architecture for idempotent algebras is presented. As examples, in addition to the classical instances of valuation algebras, semiring induced valuation algebras, Gaussian potentials and the relational algebra are presented...|$|R
