25|$|Experts agree hand-washing {{can help}} prevent viral infections, {{including}} ordinary and the swine flu infections. Also, avoiding touching one's eyes, nose or mouth with one's hands helps to prevent the flu. Influenza can spread in coughs or sneezes, but an increasing body of evidence shows small droplets containing the virus can <b>linger</b> <b>on</b> tabletops, telephones and other surfaces and be transferred via the fingers to the eyes, nose or mouth. Alcohol-based gel or foam hand sanitizers work well to destroy viruses and bacteria. Anyone with flu-like symptoms, such as a sudden fever, cough or muscle aches, should stay away from work or public transportation, and should contact a doctor for advice.|$|E

25|$|The first {{attempts}} at developing an odor-based form of crowd control began in Israel in 2004 by Rafael. The IDF reconsidered {{at the time}} a change in its open fire procedures, and adopting other crowd dispersal methods after an Israeli demonstrator, Gil Na'amati (21), was shot during a protest over the separation barrier, near the West Bank village of Mas-ha in late 2003. It reportedly does not wash off easily and may <b>linger</b> <b>on</b> clothes for up to five years. The development of Skunk followed numerous accusations against Israeli forces that they often employ disproportionate force in clashes with Palestinian protestors (e.g. using rubber bullets or tear gas), which has led them to seek new, non-lethal but effective methods of crowd control.|$|E
25|$|The four-hour {{round trip}} to the summit and back via one of the shorter trails is {{considered}} moderately challenging for the average hiker but requires no technical skills during the late spring to early fall season. Wind and weather on the exposed, rocky summit is usually harsher than below, year round; winter storms and summer thunderstorms can be life-threatening. Winter snow and ice can <b>linger</b> <b>on</b> the trails well into May, making hiking hazardous or impossible without special equipment. The compacting of snow due to winter recreation on the more frequently used trails tends to lengthen {{the time it takes}} for the snow and ice to melt off. Stabilizers, crampons, ice axes, ski poles, and snowshoes may be helpful or necessary for winter and early spring ascents depending on ice and snow cover. Fall hiking generally requires warmer clothing, an awareness of weather conditions, and earlier ascent times. As there are few reliable water sources on the mountain and little shelter from the sun above , dehydration and heat stroke are potential hiking hazards. Poison ivy does not grow on Mount Monadnock, and venomous snakes do not inhabit it. The mountain and surrounding area are black bear habitat, although problem encounters with bears are rare.|$|E

500|$|The {{traditions of}} the local peoples are {{unanimous}} in affirming that the oldest inhabitants of Casamance are the Bainuk people and that the left bank of {{the mouth of the}} river was first populated by the Jola.

500|$|At {{least two}} phases of {{volcanic}} activity {{have been identified}} at The Volcano. Each event {{was followed by the}} eruption of lengthy basaltic lava flows that flowed down steep granitic flanks of the mountain ridge on which The Volcano lies. After this took place, they travelled through the Lava Fork valley for [...] Here, the flows crossed the British Columbia border into the U.S. state of Alaska and blocked the Blue River, a tributary of the Unuk River, forming several lakes. The lava flows in total are about [...] long and still contain their original features from when they cooled, including pressure ridges and lava channels. A series of large trees were engulfed by the lava flows during eruption. The bases of the trees burned and the upper trunks and branches collapsed into the solidifying lava, leaving the trees embedded {{on the surface of the}} lava flows. After the flows solidified, tree molds and lava tubes collapsed to form volcanic pits. At the southern end of one of the lava flows, it spreads into a broad terminal lobe on the flat alluvial plain of the Unuk River. Volcanic ash and lava from The Volcano still <b>linger</b> <b>on</b> small glaciers near Mount Lewis Cass, a [...] mountain near the Alaska-British Columbia border.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{inhabitants of}} the island were the Jola, the ethnic group which {{is still the most}} populous on the island. The Portuguese were active in the region from the 16th century onwards; however, they did not <b>linger</b> <b>on</b> [...] "Mosquito Island", the mosquitoes and black flies convincing them to establish their trading post in the town of Ziguinchor instead in 1645. On January 22, 1836, the island was ceded to France by the village leader of Kagnout in return for an annual payment of 196francs. A series of treaties between the French and the leaders of the local peoples ensued; however, the inhabitants of Carabane did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them, resulting in lootings and abductions among French rice farmers by the Karoninka people. In 1869, Carabane became autonomous, but it merged with Sédhiou in 1886. Since , the population of the island has gradually declined {{for a variety of reasons}} including periods of drought, the Casamance Conflict and, more recently, the sinking of the ferry Joola in 2002. Much of the village's ability to trade and receive tourists was lost until 2014, when MV Aline Sitoe Diatta resumed ferry services to the island.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} negative. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely {{critical}} review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris wrote [...] "with its trip into blatant religiosity, 'All Souls' comes {{off like a}} bad episode of Millennium". Furthermore, she was critical of the scenes wherein the Nephilims' souls were taken, noting the excessive religious imagery: [...] "as [...] soul is taken, the camera pans {{to the right and}} stops to <b>linger</b> <b>on</b> a telephone pole that forms a cross." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two derided the fact that the episode's killer appears to either be God or an angel commanded by God, along {{with the fact that the}} four girls are destined to die because they are disabled and [...] "have no right to live". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson concluded that, while religious worship is not a passive act, it is treated so in the episode. Ultimately, they concluded that while [...] "looking at death from a different angle is fascinating" [...] it would be explored better [...] "in 'Closure'." ...|$|E

500|$|As December arrived, {{production}} was halted {{for a few}} days due to snowfall in New York City. Madonna decided to utilize the time by working on the film's soundtrack and her next concert tour. While recording the title track, Madonna decided to change the film's name from Slammer to Who's That Girl as she felt it to be a better title. Filming commenced in January 1987, where the scene involving a cougar was shot. During the second take, the cougar accidentally escaped from the cage, resulting in filming being paused for a few hours. By February 1987, Madonna's scenes were already shot although she proceeded to <b>linger</b> <b>on</b> the set to watch Foley and his team work. Foley described her being around the set and not acting as a [...] "pain-in-the-ass", since she [...] "wont skimp especially on cost and she should know that Warner had a tight schedule and constraints on the budget. They still did not trust Madonna when it came to acting. Hell they even gave a greater percentage of the budget to the soundtrack." [...] Filming ended in March 1987, with post-production continuing till July 1987. During the development of the starting credits, Madonna asked Foley if they could have a cartoon figure of her character introducing the film credits. Foley liked the idea, and Warner enlisted cartoonist April March to create the cartoon.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{final moments}} <b>linger</b> <b>on</b> Dean [...] "meat-hooked {{in the center}} of what looks like a {{thousand}} mile spiderweb of rusty chains", a scene Kripke described as [...] "M. C. Escher meets Hellraiser". The original vision for the final scene would have placed Dean in a [...] "really nasty, bloody slaughterhouse, hanging from meat hooks". Here, Dean would start screaming as shadows fall over him. Discussions between Kripke, Manners, and Hayden led to the decision to present [...] "one epic glimpse" [...] of Hell, though they avoided aspects such as fire and brimstone to focus on more affordable visuals. Much debate went into the appearance of Hell because of its many variations. Though the scene matched with the many versions of [...] "chains and people being ripped apart", art director John Marcynuk felt they should have made it [...] "a little more mysterious and dark". He commented, [...] "My opinion is, the vaguer the better, because you let the imagination take over. People have different fears, and Hell's such a personal torment." [...] In series writer Sera Gamble's opinion, Dean's location is more of the [...] "waiting room"—the place [...] "they stick you before they hand you the sign-in sheet"—a far cry from what he will experience [...] "once he gets into the first chamber of Hell".|$|E
500|$|Writing for Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars and praised it as [...] "a {{skillful}} thriller", saying that Deep Blue Sea [...] "is essentially one well-done action sequence after another [...] It doesn't <b>linger</b> <b>on</b> the special effects (some of the sharks look like cartoons), but it knows how to use timing, suspense, quick movement and [...] surprise". He concluded that the film keeps spectators guessing in an otherwise predictable genre. In a positive review, Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times considered Deep Blue Sea a return to form for Harlin, especially after the [...] "dismal swamps" [...] of Cutthroat Island and The Long Kiss Goodnight. He described the film as [...] "an example of how expert action filmmaking and up-to-the-minute visual effects can transcend a workmanlike script and bring excitement to conventional genre material". Similarly, Desson Howe of The Washington Post remarked that, while the film's premise feels familiar, it [...] "knows its audience and knows what'll get them going – and even wondering". He said that Deep Blue Sea might not be Harlin's finest two hours, but he managed to build [...] "something that, if nothing else, gives you a great big shock every few minutes". In a three-and-a-half out of four review, Robert Lasowski of The Florida Times-Union highly praised the film's pacing, intense action, and chase scenes, stating that Deep Blue Sea is [...] "a great popcorn movie" [...] and [...] "what summer at the cineplex is all about".|$|E

500|$|Later {{assessments}} of the album have been positive; AllMusic gave the album five stars, their highest rating. In 1991, Select gave the album a five out of five rating, describing it as an album of [...] "mind-blowing diversity" [...] and as a [...] "classic album". In the November 2003 issue of Rolling Stone, the album charted at number 436 in the magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums ever. In a retrospective review, Rolling Stones J. D. Considine gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and commented that [...] "It may be easy to hear both an anticipation of punk and an echo of Roxy Music in the arch clangor of Here Come the Warm Jets, but what shines brightest is the offhand accessibility of the songs", adding that [...] "the melodies <b>linger</b> <b>on...</b> the album seems almost a blueprint for the pop experiments Bowie (with Eno collaborating) would conduct with Low". In 2004, Pitchfork ranked the album at number 24 on its [...] "Top 100 Albums of the 1970s" [...] list, Pitchfork |date=23 June 2004 |website=Pitchfork |accessdate=21 December 2014}} as well as giving the re-issue of the album 9.5 out of 10. In 2003, Blender placed the album on their list [...] "500 CDs You Must Own: Alternative Rock", stating that Here Come the Warm Jets [...] "remains his best pop effort. His experimental touch turns basic glam-rock into something sick and sinister. The free-associating, posh-voiced vocals are an acquired taste, but there's method in this madness". The Canadian music magazine Exclaim! referred to Here Come the Warm Jets as [...] "Arguably one of the greatest solo debuts of the 1970s... Songs such as [...] "Baby's on Fire", [...] "Driving Me Backwards" [...] and [...] "Needles in the Camel's Eye" [...] capture the lush and sleazy underpinning narratives of the British Invasion in arrangements that sound quintessentially timeless".|$|E
500|$|To {{deal with}} these limitations, Frye {{simplified}} the maze's intricate pattern of corridors to a more repetitive pattern. The small tan pellets in the arcade original were changed to rectangular [...] "wafers" [...] that shared the wall color on the 2600, a change necessitated because both the pellets and walls were drawn with the 2600's Playfield graphics, which have a fixed width. To achieve the visual effect of wafers disappearing as Pac-Man eats them, the actual map of the maze was updated as the data was written into the Playfield registers, excluding those pellets that had been eaten. The 2600's Player-Missile graphics system (sprites) {{were used for the}} remaining objects, the one pixel-wide Missiles were used to render the flashing power pills and the center of the vitamin. [...] Pac-Man and ghost characters were implemented using the 2600's two Player objects, with one being used for Pac-Man and the other being used in for all four ghosts, with the result that each ghost only appears once out of every four frames, which creates a flickering effect. This effect takes advantage of the slow phosphorescent fade of CRT monitors and the concept of persistence of vision, resulting in the image appearing to <b>linger</b> <b>on</b> screen longer, but the flickering remains noticeable, and makes each individual ghost's color nearly impossible to discern. Frye chose to abandon plans for a flicker-management system to minimize the flashing in part because Atari didn't seem to care about that issue in its zeal to have the game released. His game also did not conform to the arcade game's color scheme in order to comply with Atari's official home product policy that only space type games should feature black backgrounds. [...] Another quality-impact was his decision that two-player gameplay was important, which meant that the 23 bytes required to store the current difficulty, state of the dots on the current maze, remaining lives, and score had to be doubled for a second player, consuming 46 of the 2600's meager 128 byte memory, which precluded its use for additional game data and features.|$|E
500|$|Professional {{television}} critics deemed Martin Keamy {{a welcome}} {{addition to the}} cast.

[...] I have loved this character all season long—and not just solely for [...] physical attributes ... although those certainly don't hurt." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger reflected, [...] "He was only on the show for a season and not featured all that much in that season, but Kevin Durand always made an impression as Keamy. [...] Lots of actors might have his sheer physical size, but there's a sense of danger (insanity?) that you can't build at the gym, you know?"
