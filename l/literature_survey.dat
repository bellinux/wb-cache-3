25|$|While {{nuclear power}} does not {{directly}} emit greenhouse gases, emissions occur, as with every source of energy, over a facility's life cycle: mining and fabrication of construction materials, plant construction, operation, uranium mining and milling, and plant decommissioning. A <b>literature</b> <b>survey</b> by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of 32 greenhouse gas emissions studies, found a median value of 16 g equivalent lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions per kWh for nuclear power.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of {{direct and indirect}} deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices is estimated by the World Health Organisation to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age. The multiple interdependencies between malnutrition and infectious diseases {{make it very difficult}} to quantify the portion of malnutrition that is caused by infectious diseases which are in turn caused by unsafe WASH practices. Based on expert opinions and a <b>literature</b> <b>survey,</b> researchers at WHO arrived at the conclusion that approximately half of all cases of malnutrition (which often leads to stunting) in children under five is associated with repeated diarrhoea or intestinal worm infections as a result of unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene.|$|E
2500|$|A 2010 study uses {{a complex}} method (termed multiclassifier {{combinatorial}} proteomics or MCCP) {{to analyze the}} proteomic composition of vertebrate chromosomes, including kinetochores. [...] Although this study does not include a biochemical enrichment for kinetochores, obtained data include all the centromeric subcomplexes, with peptides from all 125 known centromeric proteins. According to this study, there are still about one hundred unknown kinetochore proteins, doubling the known structure during mitosis, which confirms the kinetochore {{as one of the}} most complex cellular substructures. Consistently, a comprehensive <b>literature</b> <b>survey</b> indicated that there had been at least 196 human proteins already experimentally shown to be localized at kinetochores.|$|E
