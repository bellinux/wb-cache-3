40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} explore how <b>landscape</b> {{dynamics}} and past <b>landscape</b> developments can contribute to current <b>landscape</b> planning. Through a literature review and {{a case study of}} the <b>landscape’s</b> historical development on the Bjäre peninsula, approaches for investigating and understanding past <b>landscape</b> developments and <b>landscape</b> dynamics are presented. Contemporary <b>landscape</b> planning challenges, such as the European <b>Landscape</b> Convention and the Swedish environmental objectives, are reviewed to outline the context in which <b>landscape</b> planning is practiced today, as well as to discuss how an analysis of historical <b>landscapes</b> can be used in current <b>landscape</b> planning. In the case study, changes in land use, <b>landscape</b> functions and driving forces are investigated, and furthermore discussed with the terminology of time-geography and the <b>landscape</b> as a budget frame. Some of the conclusions are that knowledge about <b>landscape</b> dynamics and the <b>landscape’s</b> past can contribute to the search for <b>landscape</b> identity, and the understanding of the <b>landscape’s</b> dependence on history, as well as its significance for the future. Identifying driving forces of <b>landscape</b> change can furthermore facilitate the task of reaching the goals in the European <b>Landscape</b> Convention and the Swedish environmental objectives. The <b>landscape</b> as a budget frame approach can by revealing the power struggle linked to <b>landscape</b> development, be used to discuss priorities in <b>landscape</b> planning, as well as their consequences...|$|R

Cultural conventions powerfully influence <b>landscape</b> pattern in both inhabited and apparently natural <b>landscapes.</b> 3. Cultural concepts of nature are different from scientific concepts of ecological function. 4. The appearance of <b>landscapes</b> communicates cultural values. Both the study of <b>landscapes</b> at a human scale and experimentation with possible <b>landscapes,</b> <b>landscape</b> patterns invented to accommodate ecological function, are recommended as means of achieving more precise cultural principles...|$|R

5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include <b>landscaping</b> that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. <b>Landscaping</b> includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from the building that previously occupied the site.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí also practiced <b>landscaping,</b> {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his {{works in the}} most {{appropriate}} natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to <b>landscaping</b> is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of the Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned {{the path to the}} Holy Cave.|$|E

40|$|Integration of <b>landscape</b> {{ecology and}} <b>landscape</b> architecture: an {{evolutionary}} and reciprocal process <b>Landscape</b> architecture {{is a professional}} field that is significantly focused on <b>landscape</b> pattern – the spatial configuration of <b>landscapes</b> at many scales. <b>Landscape</b> architecture is informed by scientific knowledge and aspires to provide aesthetic expressions in <b>landscapes</b> {{across a range of}} spatial scales. <b>Landscape</b> ecology has been defined as the study of the effect of <b>landscape</b> pattern on process, in heterogeneous <b>landscapes,</b> across a range of spatial and temporal scales (Turner, 1989). The logical reasons for integrating these two fields are clear and compelling, with a great potential to support sustainable <b>landscapes</b> through ecologically based planning and design.

40|$|<b>Landscape</b> {{is usually}} {{classified}} into cultural and natural part. <b>Landscape</b> {{can be defined}} on more general level as a unit operating {{on the basis of}} interaction between phisically existing plane, i. e. <b>landscape</b> as an organism, and plane interpretational, which is result of reading the <b>landscape</b> by its elements. Interdependence of the two <b>landscape</b> levels follows the definition of <b>landscape</b> memory. Parts of the <b>landscape</b> memory correspond to the theoretical <b>landscape</b> levels and shape specific aesthetics aspects of landsape. <b>Landscape</b> memory also reflects independency of the <b>landscape</b> and its parts. This thesis {{is based on the assumption}} that components involved in shaping the <b>landscape</b> are both living creatures and inanimate objects (with all the problems that this assumption would entail). All these components are responsible for <b>landscape</b> memory and come across this function in <b>landscape</b> only as a whole. Theoretical conclusions about the <b>landscape</b> memory are instantiated in this work by the Sudeten <b>landscape</b> example from which they are also partly derived...|$|R

40|$|Human {{attribution}} of multiple values to <b>landscapes</b> {{is not well}} understood owing to the variability and complexity of both the <b>landscape</b> concept and the human valuation process. In this study, we extend psychophysical analysis of <b>landscapes</b> by examining the relationships between multiple <b>landscape</b> values and physical <b>landscape</b> character. Previous <b>landscape</b> research has {{tended to focus on}} the relationship between a single value such as <b>landscape</b> aesthetics and a single physical <b>landscape</b> component, such as vegetation or water. We spatially intersected eight <b>landscape</b> values collected through a regional public participation GIS (PPGIS) process with <b>landscape</b> components and classes from the New Zealand Land Classification (NZLC) system. We used chi-square residual analysis and correspondence analysis to identify significant spatial associations. The results indicate that the general public associate particular values with specific <b>landscape</b> components at a regional scale. Greater than expected <b>landscape</b> values were associated with urban areas, water features, indigenous landcover, and mountains. Fewer than expected <b>landscape</b> values were associated with flatter, agricultural <b>landscapes.</b> We discuss the benefits and limitations of these methods for <b>landscape</b> assessment in New Zealand, {{and in the absence of}} PPGIS data to directly measure <b>landscape</b> values, whether <b>landscape</b> components should be used to interpolate values for <b>landscape</b> assessment. We urge replication of the method in other regions to increase the external validity of the <b>landscape</b> value–physical <b>landscape</b> associations described herein...|$|R

40|$|<b>Landscape,</b> {{people and}} {{identity}} <b>Landscape</b> {{is about the}} interaction of a place or an area with people, which {{is reflected in the}} material interaction of people creating or shaping the <b>landscape</b> as well as in their mental perception, valuation and symbolic meaning of that <b>landscape</b> (Cosgrove 1998). This mutual and dynamic interaction forms the fundamental principle of the concept of <b>landscape</b> identity. <b>Landscape</b> identity has been described in scientific literature as a concept to bridge the physical, social and cultural aspects of <b>landscapes.</b> Also policy documents related with <b>landscape</b> and heritage (for example the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, the European <b>Landscape</b> Convention, the Faro Convention) are mentioning identity and <b>landscape</b> as key concepts. In those examples, <b>landscape</b> identity can refer to either the <b>landscape</b> itself - its features that makes the <b>landscape</b> unique (thus the <b>landscape</b> character), or to the social and personal construction. However, there is an interdependency between those two perspectives that needs to be conceptualised. <b>Landscape</b> identity is therefore defined as the multiple ways and dynamic relation between <b>landscape</b> and people (Loupa Ramos et al 2016) ...|$|R
