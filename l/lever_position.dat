50|$|True full {{authority}} digital {{engine controls}} have no form of manual override available, placing full {{authority over the}} operating parameters of the engine {{in the hands of}} the computer. If a total FADEC failure occurs, the engine fails. If the engine is controlled digitally and electronically but allows for manual override, it is considered solely an EEC or ECU. An EEC, though a component of a FADEC, is not by itself FADEC. When standing alone, the EEC makes all of the decisions until the pilot wishes to intervene. FADEC works by receiving multiple input variables of the current flight condition including air density, throttle <b>lever</b> <b>position,</b> engine temperatures, engine pressures, and many other parameters. The inputs are received by the EEC and analyzed up to 70 times per second. Engine operating parameters such as fuel flow, stator vane position, bleed valve position, and others are computed from this data and applied as appropriate. FADEC also controls engine starting and restarting. The FADEC's basic purpose is to provide optimum engine efficiency for a given flight condition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the last}} decade, the {{increase}} in the need for the accuracy of the torque metrology created an obligation to produce a new torque standard machine for precise measurement of torque. This paper summarizes the torque standard machine designed and manufactured at UME with the range from 2 Nm up to 1 kNm. In this machine torque is realized by a lever-mass system. Nominal force arm length of the lever is 0. 5 m and constant. In each side of the lever, there are 6 different weight sets; and each set is containing 13 individual mass-stacks. For minimizing the torque loss at fulcrum an aerostatic bearing is used, and the change in the <b>lever</b> <b>position</b> due to the dead weights loading is corrected...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of the Westinghouse electronic power regulator operating on a J 34 -WE- 32 turbojet engine was investigated in the NACA Lewis altitude wind tunnel {{at the request of}} the Bureau of Aeronautics, Department of the Navy.

Recordings of the response of the following parameters to step changes in power <b>lever</b> <b>position</b> throughout the available operating range of the engine were obtained; ram pressure ratio, compressor-discharge pressure, exhaust-nozzle area, engine speed, turbine-outlet temperature, fuel-valve position, jet thrust, air flow, turbine-discharge pressure, fuel flow, throttle position, and boost-pump pressure. Representative preliminary data showing the actual time response of these variables are presented. These data are presented in the form of reproductions of oscillographic traces...|$|E
40|$|A. General Electric {{fuel and}} torque {{regulator}} was tested {{in conjunction with}} a T 31 - 3 turbine-propeller engine in the sea-level static test stand at the NACA Lewis laboratory. The engine and control were operated over the entire speed range: 11, 000 rpm, nominal flight idle, to 13, 000 rpm, full power. Steady-state and transient data were recorded and are presented with a description of the four control loops being used in the system. Results of this investigation indicated that single-lever control operation was satisfactory under conditions of test. Transient data presented showed that turbine-outlet temperature did overshoot maximum operating value on acceleration but that the time duration of overshoot did not exceed approximately 1 second. This temperature limiting resulted from a control on fuel flow as a function of engine speed. Speed and torque first reached their desired values 0. 4 second from the time of change in power-setting <b>lever</b> <b>position.</b> Maximum speed overshoot was 3 percent...|$|E

40|$|The Flap/Slat Controller {{benchmark}} {{is derived}} from a case study for Airbus [1]. During take-off (and landing) flaps and slats of the aircraft are extended to generate more lift at low velocity {{and have to be}} retracted in time as they are not robust enough for high velocities. Our system model is scalable in the number of flaps/slats, which allows us to study scalability of our methods on systems of concurrent components. 1 Application Domain Flaps and slats are aerodynamic surfaces on respectively the trailing and leading edge of an aircraft’s wings. During take-off and landing, these flaps and slats are extended to generate more lift at low velocity and have to be retracted in time as they are not robust enough for high velocities. They are under the primary control of the pilot via a Slat/Flap Lever, where lever positions correspond to flap/slat positions.

40|$|Brain machine {{interface}} (BMI) {{has been proposed}} as a novel technique to control prosthetic devices aimed at restoring motor functions in paralyzed patients.

Next, we collect brain signals with four implanted electrodes, two in the motor cortex and two in the somatosensory cortex area.

Offline and online classification results of rat’s brain signals show that the Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) outperforms other neural networks.

40|$|The maximum {{displacement}} of the T-bar handle of a rat response lever wag recorded under two schedules: (a) programed variable-duration SUand S periods with reinforcement only for SD presses between 23. 540 and 28. 640 (Positi,%n 5) and (b) the same requirements for a reinforcement as in (a) but with S initiated only by a "wrong " press in SD, and prolonged by any press in S 6.
