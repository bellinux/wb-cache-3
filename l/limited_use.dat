5|$|Fires were a {{constant}} problem as the palace compound was constructed {{almost entirely of}} wood. The Daigokuden was reconstructed after fires in 876, 1068 and in 1156 despite its <b>limited</b> <b>use.</b> However, after the major fire of 1177 which destroyed much of the Greater Palace, the Daigokuden was never again rebuilt. The Burakuin was destroyed by a fire in 1063 and was never rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, two sail-driven tankers {{were built}} on England's River Tyne. These were {{followed}} in 1873 {{by the first}} oil-tank steamer, Vaderland, which was built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company for Belgian owners. The vessel's use was curtailed by U.S. and Belgian authorities citing safety concerns. By 1871, the Pennsylvania oil fields were making <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> of oil tank barges and cylindrical railroad tank-cars {{similar to those in}} use today.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, renewed {{criticism}} regarding current Premier Jean Charest's <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> of {{the apartment}} led to another proposal for a proper official residence. Charest, who heads a family of five and lives in Montreal, saw little reason to move them across the province. These proposal were never taken further, and Charest's successor, Pauline Marois, made regular use {{of the apartment}}.|$|E

5|$|Since Gliese 581c has {{not been}} {{detected}} directly, there are no measurements of its radius. Furthermore, the radial velocity method used to detect it only puts a lower limit on the planet's mass, which means theoretical models of planetary radius and structure can only be of <b>limited</b> <b>use.</b> However, assuming a random orientation of the planet's orbit, the true mass {{is likely to be}} close to the measured minimum mass.|$|E
5|$|Specialized {{applications}} include use in laboratories as containment for high-pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> in specialized windows. With {{the continuing}} advances {{being made in}} the production of synthetic diamonds, future applications are becoming feasible. The high thermal conductivity of diamond makes it suitable as a heat sink for integrated circuits in electronics.|$|E
5|$|Strontium {{chloride}} {{is sometimes}} used in toothpastes for sensitive teeth. One popular brand includes 10% total {{strontium chloride hexahydrate}} by weight. Small amounts {{are used in the}} refining of zinc to remove small amounts of lead impurities. The metal itself has a <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> as a getter, to remove unwanted gases in vacuums by reacting with them, although barium may also be used for this purpose.|$|E

5|$|The Disney bomb saw <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> by the United States Army Air Forces in Europe from February to April 1945.

5|$|During its <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> as a {{first-class}} cricket ground, only one century was scored on the ground, by Jim Parks. During the 1937 match, he scored 140 runs for Sussex. The most wickets {{taken by a}} bowler in a match at West Hendford was achieved in 1938, when Hampshire's Stuart Boyes took twelve wickets, including nine in the first innings. Somerset's only success on the ground was in 1936 against Worcestershire, who they dismissed for 60 runs in the first innings, and 77 in the second.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, {{operating}} as Eastern Airlines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its tail-mounted number two engine. The shrapnel from that engine inflicted damage {{on all four}} of its hydraulic systems, which were also close together in the tail structure. Fluid was lost {{in three of the}} four systems. The fourth hydraulic system was impacted with shrapnel, but not punctured. The hydraulic pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> of the outboard spoilers, the inboard ailerons, and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.|$|E

5|$|In acute liver failure, the {{development}} of severe encephalopathy strongly predicts short-term mortality, and is almost {{as important as the}} nature of the underlying cause of the liver failure in determining the prognosis. Historically, widely used criteria for offering liver transplantation, such as King's College Criteria, are of <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> and recent guidelines discourage excessive reliance on these criteria. The occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in people with Wilson's disease (hereditary copper accumulation) and mushroom poisoning indicates an urgent need for a liver transplant.|$|E
5|$|In {{their work}} Pleasure Able: Sexual Device Manual for Persons with Disabilities, authors Kate Naphtali and Edith MacHattie of the Disabilities Health Research Network under the {{supervision}} of doctors Andrei Krassioukov and Stacy L Elliott recommended use of the Magic Wand in sexual activity for people with disabilities. The authors said the person holding the device would need to be capable of maintaining an active wide grasp throughout the process. They wrote that the Magic Wand was helpful for disabled people with either limited strength in their upper extremities or <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> of their hands. They also said it was well-suited for individuals with decreased movement in their upper extremities.|$|E
5|$|It took until 1994 for the Queen {{to approve}} the new design for general use, though the Canadian Heraldic Authority began to allow for its <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> {{beginning}} in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians. These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the annulus behind the shield bearing the motto of the Order of Canada—Desiderantes meliorem patriam. As soon as royal approval was forthcoming, the full achievement was redesigned {{for use by the}} federal government within the Federal Identity Program. The present design of the arms of Canada was drawn by Cathy Bursey-Sabourin, Fraser Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur's {{decision}} to move swiftly against Finschhafen, coupled with Blamey's to envelop the Japanese defences by landing at Scarlet Beach, and Yamada's to avoid a decisive engagement that might result {{in the loss of}} all or part of his force, gave Windeyer the time and space he needed to take Finschhafen. Blamey's objective was therefore in Allied hands; but it was of <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> without Sattelberg. The Allied intelligence failure and subsequent dithering meant that the Japanese reinforced their position faster, and thus were able to seize the initiative.|$|E
5|$|Metal armour was of <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> in the hot, wet {{tropical}} climate. It {{was heavy}} {{and had to}} be constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in direct sunlight, metal armour became unbearably hot. Conquistadores often went without metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle. They were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this {{with the use of a}} simple metal war hat. Shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood. Rings secured it to the arm and hand.|$|E
5|$|On Crete, Kippenberger was {{promoted}} to temporary colonel and given command of the 10th Brigade, an ad-hoc formation, which included a 750-man composite battalion consisting mainly of artillery and Army Service Corps men (sans most of their heavy equipment and trucks), New Zealand Divisional Cavalry, some machine gunners and two Greek regiments (although Kippenberger assessed the Greek units to be of <b>limited</b> <b>use).</b> His 20th Battalion was {{also part of the}} brigade but strict controls were in place around its deployment and use.|$|E
