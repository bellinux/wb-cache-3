5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} tiebreaker with long {{histories}} {{of frustration and}} disappointment. California had won the AL West division title on 3 occasions (1979, 1982, and 1986), but failed {{to advance to the}} World Series each time. In particular, the Angels blew a 2–0 series lead in the best-of-five 1982 ALCS to the Milwaukee Brewers, and were one strike away from defeating the Boston Red Sox in Game 5 of the 1986 ALCS but ended up <b>losing</b> <b>that</b> game and the next two to lose the best-of-seven series that they had led 3–1. They had not returned to the postseason since the 1986 loss.|$|E
5|$|Upon Derby's {{retirement}} in 1868, Disraeli became Prime Minister briefly before <b>losing</b> <b>that</b> year's general election. He {{returned to the}} Opposition, before leading the party to winning {{a majority in the}} 1874 general election. He maintained a close friendship with Queen Victoria, who in 1876 appointed him Earl of Beaconsfield. Disraeli's second term was dominated by the Eastern Question—the slow decay of the Ottoman Empire and the desire of other European powers, such as Russia, to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the Suez Canal Company (in Ottoman-controlled Egypt). In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the Congress of Berlin to obtain peace in the Balkans at terms favourable to Britain and unfavourable to Russia, its longstanding enemy. This diplomatic victory over Russia established Disraeli as one of Europe's leading statesmen.|$|E
25|$|Pennsylvania's longest-serving Senator, Arlen Specter, {{was from}} Philadelphia; {{he served as}} a Republican from 1981 and as a Democrat from 2009, <b>losing</b> <b>that</b> party's primary in 2010 and leaving office in January 2011. He was also the city's District Attorney from 1966 to 1974.|$|E

25|$|The mid-1970s {{were more}} turbulent. Illingworth {{and several others}} had refused to tour India in 1972–73 {{which led to a}} clamour for Illingworth's job {{by the end of that}} summer – England had just been thrashed 2–0 by a {{flamboyant}} West Indies side – with several England players well over 35. Mike Denness was the surprising choice but only lasted 18 months; his results against poor opposition were good, but England were badly exposed as ageing and lacking in good fast bowling against the 1974–75 Australians, <b>losing</b> <b>that</b> series 4–1 to lose the Ashes.|$|E

Doctors warned that if he survived, he would likely remain permanently paralyzed and unable to speak. News of his stroke was made public on Opie and Anthony on October 26.|$|E

The match versus Nigeria in the league stages was to decide which of the 2 nations would progress to the ICC World Cricket League Division Six {{to be held in}} Malaysia in September 2011 and by <b>losing</b> <b>that</b> match, Botswana failed to progress and will remain in Division Seven till the next instalment of the ICC WCL.|$|E
25|$|Borg {{failed to}} win the US Open in 10 tries, losing four finals, 1976 and 1978 to Jimmy Connors, and 1980 and 1981 to McEnroe. He played on hard courts at the US Open from 1978 to 1981 and reached the final there on three occasions, in 1978, 1980 and 1981. He led 3–2 in the fifth set of the 1980 final, before <b>losing.</b> <b>That</b> match {{followed}} Borg's classic encounter with McEnroe at the 1980 Wimbledon. In 1978, 1979 and 1980, Borg was halfway to a Grand Slam after victories at the French and Wimbledon (the Australian Open being the last Grand Slam tournament of each year at the time) only to falter at Flushing Meadow, lefty Tanner his conqueror in 1979.|$|E
25|$|However, {{against the}} Washington Redskins the {{following}} week, his 100th career start, Cutler tore a groin muscle when sacked by Chris Baker, breaking Jim Harbaugh's franchise {{record for most}} times sacked. Josh McCown was solid in relief, barely <b>losing</b> <b>that</b> Redskins game in a 45–41 shootout, and after the bye-week tossing two touchdowns in a 27–21 win at Green Bay. Cutler was medically cleared to return early for the week 10 game against Detroit, where he had 250 yards, 1 TD, and 1 INT before a hit from Stephen Tulloch {{in the second quarter}} finally drove him from the game on the Bears last drive. McCown drove 74 yards in 90 seconds for a touchdown, but the two-point conversion failed and the Bears lost 21–19.|$|E

25|$|Jayasuriya was the {{previous}} record-holder for the fastest century (off 48 balls), before <b>losing</b> <b>that</b> to Shahid Afridi's 37 ball century. This is {{cited as the}} first ever fastest century scored in less than 50 balls in world cricket. The record was then broken by Corey Anderson of New Zealand (36 balls), which is currently held by AB de Villiers of South Africa with 31 ball century. He has also held the world record for most ODI sixes (270 in 441 ODIs), which was surpassed by Shahid Afridi during the 2010 Asia Cup match against Bangladesh. He became the fourth batsman to score more than 10,000 runs and the second batsman to score more than 12,000, and 13,000 runs {{in the history of}} ODIs. He also has 28 centuries, the fourth highest in ODIs. He held the record of scoring most runs in an ODI over (30; he has achieved this twice), and first batsman to score over 30 in an over. This record is now held by South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs (36 runs in an over).|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the 90-minute format was intended to be temporary, with the added time used to prepare a storyline for a spinoff, Texas in 1980. For upon its debut, the mother show contracted to 60 minutes again, this time moving to 2/1 Central, where it settled for the remaining 19 years of its run. Texas, starring the hugely popular Beverlee McKinsey and attempting {{to cash in on the}} Dallas craze, while itself not a success, may have caused further erosion of Another World viewership, to the point that it was no longer NBC's highest-rated serial, <b>losing</b> <b>that</b> position to Days of our Lives (which itself, along with the rest of NBC's daytime lineup, was in serious ratings trouble). Another World fell from eighth to as low as 11th in the ratings chart, and by the 1981–1982 television season it sunk so low in the Nielsens to 4.7 (a drop of 3.9 points in four seasons). Much like General Hospital winning the 3/2 slot for ABC, One Life to Live came in strong at 2/1, with CBS attempting to get its new Capitol off the ground during that period.|$|E
25|$|Congress reconsidered the Act in 2006 as {{the special}} {{provisions}} {{were due to}} expire in 2007. Civil rights organizations advocated for the renewal and strengthening of the special provisions. As a matter of principle, Democrats generally supported renewing the special provisions. However, the Republican Party controlled both chambers of Congress and the presidency, and many Republicans considered the preclearance requirement an affront to states' rights and the principle of color-blindness. Furthermore, conservatives believed that the primary beneficiaries of the special provisions were African Americans, who overwhelmingly and increasingly voted for Democratic Party candidates. However, Republicans were receiving increasing support from some language minority groups, particularly Hispanics and Asian Americans, {{and they did not}} wish to risk <b>losing</b> <b>that</b> support by refusing to reauthorize the special provisions. Republicans also recognized that the Act often helped Republican candidates win by requiring jurisdictions to pack Democratic-leaning racial minorities into few electoral districts. In addition, House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) had a strong desire to reauthorize the special provisions, and he led an early effort to pass a reauthorization bill before his chairmanship expired at the end of 2006. Thus, a consensus in favor of reauthorizing the special provisions emerged early in the legislative process.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the fifth}} playoff series between these two teams. This was a rematch of the second-round series that took place the {{previous}} year, in which San Jose defeated Detroit in five games. After losing the first three games, Detroit won the next three, to force a seventh game. This was the eighth time this feat had been achieved in NHL history, {{the third time in}} the last two seasons, and the second time in the 2011 playoffs. Chicago had accomplished the same feat against Vancouver in the Quarterfinals, ultimately <b>losing</b> <b>that</b> series. Since the New York Islanders twice forced a game seven after being down 3–0 during the 1975 Stanley Cup playoffs, there had been 112 consecutive failed attempts to repeat that feat prior to the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs, after which it has happened in three of the seven possible series. San Jose won the seventh game by a score of 3–2 to avoid becoming the fourth team in NHL history to lose a series after taking a 3–0 series lead. It allowed them their second consecutive trip to the Conference Finals. Six of the games were decided by only one goal; the only exception was a 3–1 win by Detroit in game six, in which Darren Helm of Detroit scored an empty net goal.|$|E
25|$|Dallas {{played into}} their {{traditional}} Thanksgiving home game, this time against division rival Philadelphia. Both teams were vying {{for first place}} in the division with identical 8–3 records. The Eagles got off to a fast start and the Cowboys were unable to catch up, losing 33–10. They would rebound the next week where on the road Thursday night game they defeated Chicago 41–28 for their 9th win of the year to clinch their first winning season since 2009. This {{was the first time that}} Dallas played on back to back Thursdays. Week 15 was a rematch against 1st place Philadelphia. This time it was the Cowboys who got off to a fast start going up 21–0. Then the Eagles put up 24 answered points but Dallas came back to win 38–27 to go into first place for the first time in the season and improve to 10–4. Going into their Week 16 matchup at home against Indianapolis, Dallas was in a position to clinch their first division title since 2009 by defeating the Colts thanks to the Eagles <b>losing</b> <b>that</b> week to the Redskins. They would not disappoint as they blew out the Colts 42–7 to become the 2014 NFC East Champions, eliminating the Eagles from the playoffs. Dallas would end the regular season with a 12–4 record and an 8–0 away record when they won on the road against Washington 44–17. They would also finish December 4–0 which was huge for the Cowboys since they had struggled in the recent years in the month of December.|$|E

500|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} to the 1965 World Series. Alston could not start his number one pitcher, Koufax, in the opening game of that series because Koufax was observing Yom Kippur.

500|$|As {{with other}} outdoor games, special jerseys were worn for the event.
