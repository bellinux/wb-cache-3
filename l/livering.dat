40|$|When visiting {{new places}} you want {{information}} about restaurants, shopping, places of historic in- terest etc. Smartphones are perfect tools for de- <b>livering</b> such location-based information, but {{the risk is}} that users get absorbed by texts, maps, videos etc. on the device screen and get a second- hand experience of the environment they are vis- iting rather than the sought-after first-hand expe- rience. One {{problem is that the}} users’ eyes often are directed to the device screen, rather than to the surrounding environment. Another problem is that interpreting more or less abstract informa- tion on maps, texts, images etc. may take up sig- nificant shares of the users’ overall cognitive re- sources. The work presented here tried to overcome these two problems by studying design for human-computer interaction based on the users’ everyday abilities such as directional hearing and point and sweep gestures. Today’s smartphones know where you are, in what direction you are pointing the device and they have systems for ren- dering spatial audio. These readily available tech- nologies hold the potential to make information more easy to interpret and use, demand less cog- nitive resources and free the users from having to look more or less constantly on a device screen.

40|$|Limited {{access to}} Chagas disease {{diagnosis}} and trea tment {{is a major}} obstacle to reaching the 2020 World Health Organization milestones of de <b>livering</b> care to all infected and ill patients. Colombia {{has been identified as}} a health system in transition, reporting one of the highest levels of health insurance coverage in Latin America. We explore if and how this high level of coverage extends to those with Chagas disease, a traditionally marginalised population. Using a mixed methods approach, we cal culate coverage for screening, diagnosis and treatment of Chagas. We then identify supply-side constraints both quantitatively and qualitatively. A review of off icial registries of tests and treatments for Chagas disease delivered between 2008 and 2014 is c ompared to estimates of infected people. Using the Flagship Framework, we explore ba rriers limiting access to care. Screening coverage is estimated at 1. 2 % of the popu lation at risk. Aetiological treatment with either benznidazol or nifurtimox covered 0. 3 – 0. 4 % of the infected population. Barriers to accessing screening, diagnosis and treatment are id entified for each of the Flagship Framework’s five dimensions of interest: financing, payment, regulation, organisation and persuasion. The main challenges identified were: a lack of clarity in terms of financial responsibilities in a segmented health system, clai ms of limited resources for undertaking activities particularly in primary care, non-inclus ion of confirmatory test(s) in the basic package of diagnosis and care, poor logistics in th e distribution and supply chain of medicines, and lack of awareness of medical personn el. Very low screening coverage emerges as a key obstacle hindering access to care for Chagas disease. Findings suggest serious shortcomings in this health system for Chag as disease, despite the success of universal health insurance scale-up in Colombia. W hether these shortcomings exist in relation to other neglected tropical diseases needs investigating. We identify opportunities for improvement that can inform additional planned health reforms...|$|E

40|$|Multicasting is {{now widely}} {{used to support}} {{real-time}} applications, such as IPTV, in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). This is because multicast reduces network cost and bandwidth consumption as compared to unicast when de <b>livering</b> a packet to multiple subscribers. However, multicast transmissions are carried out using the base data rate. This well-known behavior results in unfairness among users with diverse data rates. As a result, multicast transmissions severely degrade the network capacity of WLANs. To date, researchers have proposed many approaches to optimize the performance of multicast in WLANs. They include association control, smart antenna, rate adaptation and emulating multicast using unicast transmissions. In association control schemes, APs can actively re-associate stations (STAs) to other APs that provide better data rate and hence optimizing metrics such as airtime. Smart antenna approaches {{on the other hand}} utilize superior gains to improve the data rate of STAs with weak signal strength. Rate adaptation methods take advantage of the multi-rate feature supported by IEEE 802. 11 standards. For instance, a content-based rate adaptation scheme may categorize contents into different layers by service quality requirements and use high data rates in favorable channel conditions and low data rates otherwise. To date, there is no work that combines association control strategies with smart antennas. To this end, this thesis is the first to consider association of stations and the benefits of smart antennas simultaneously. As the problem is NP-hard by a reduction from the Maximum Coverage with Group Budget (MCG) problem, this thesis proposes four novel heuristics to optimize various metrics, including the average load of APs, number of satisfied users, fairness among APs and throughput of APs. In addition, the thesis also studies an optimization that allows APs to rotate the beams of smart antennas to improve coverage and thereby, increases the opportunity of selecting the best subsets of stations. Experimental results in Matlab and Pamvotis show that the proposed heuristics outperform the Best Signal Strength Method (BSSM). Specifically, Heuristic 1, which covers the most users and has the lowest cost, reduces the average load of APs by up to 36. 1...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of variations in fatty <b>liver</b> on the ultrasonographic detection of focal <b>liver</b> lesions. Methods: A total of 229 patients with varying degrees of fatty <b>liver</b> and focal <b>liver</b> lesions and 200 patients with focal <b>liver</b> lesions but no fatty <b>liver</b> were randomly selected for inclusion in groups I and II, respectively. Findings of focal <b>liver</b> lesions identified on computed tomography were taken as the reference, and findings on ultrasonography were compared with them. Results: The number of focal <b>liver</b> lesions in groups I and II were 501 and 413, respectively. The ultrasonographic detection rates of focal <b>liver</b> lesions in groups I and II were 86. 8 % (435 / 501) and 94. 2 % (389 / 413), respectively. Comparison of the detection of the focal lesions between patients with and without fatty <b>liver</b> or different grades of fatty <b>liver</b> were as follows: mild fatty <b>liver</b> (162 / 177) vs. <b>liver</b> without fat infiltration (389 / 413) (P= 0. 277); mild fatty <b>liver</b> (162 / 177) vs. moderate fatty <b>liver</b> (190 / 212) (P= 0. 604); mild fatty <b>liver</b> (162 / 177) vs. severe fatty <b>liver</b> (83 / 112) (P< 0. 001); moderate fatty <b>liver</b> (190 / 212) vs. <b>liver</b> without fat infiltration (389 / 413) (P= 0. 051); moderate fatty <b>liver</b> (190 / 212) vs. severe fatty <b>liver</b> (83 / 112) (P< 0. 001); severe fatty <b>liver</b> (83 / 112) vs. <b>liver</b> without fat infiltration (389 / 413) (P< 0. 001); and fatty <b>liver</b> (435 / 501) vs. <b>liver</b> without fat infiltration (389 / 413) (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Mild and moderate fatty <b>liver</b> are not significantly associated with the visualization of the lesion, while severe fatty <b>liver</b> usually impairs the detection of focal lesions in the <b>liver.</b> If a patient with severe fatty <b>liver</b> is suspected to have a <b>liver</b> tumor, ultrasonography should only be chosen cautiously in case of a missed diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Hepatectomy is an {{effective}} method for treatment {{of a variety of}} benign and malignant <b>liver</b> diseases. But extended <b>liver</b> resection could lead to a fatal <b>liver</b> failure, and it is still a worldwide problem. Although <b>liver</b> transplantation is {{an effective}} treatment, but the shortage of donor limits the development of <b>liver</b> transplantation. The existing bioartificial <b>liver</b> technology still can not completely fulfill all the functions of the <b>liver,</b> and the proliferation of hepatic cells after in vivo cell transplantation is limited, thus encroaching upon its therapeutic effect. But, unlike other organs, the <b>liver</b> has a huge potential regenerative capacity. After hepatectomy, the <b>liver</b> parenchymal cells and non-parenchymal cells in the remaining <b>liver,</b> various cytokines and growth factors in the body and hepatic stem cells are able to respond promptly. The <b>liver</b> volume will therefore be able to restore to its original size, and <b>liver</b> function may return to normality soon. <b>Liver</b> regeneration is roughly divided into three phases, i. e., initiation, proliferation and termination phases. <b>Liver</b> regeneration is complex at all the phases, and they will be affected by many factors. The mechanism of <b>liver</b> regeneration has not yet fully understood. Therefore, to explore the mechanism of <b>liver</b> cell regeneration has extremely important practical significance, and the understanding of which will establish a theoretical basis for enhancing <b>liver</b> regeneration in clinical practice, and for the prevention and treatment of <b>liver</b> failure. <b>Liver</b> regeneration after <b>liver</b> resection has become a research hotspot in recent years. This review summarizes the research progress of <b>liver</b> regeneration after <b>liver</b> resection. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2014. 01. 1...|$|R

This article summarizes the latest research advances in the roles of TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, Hedgehog signaling pathway, and integrin signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of <b>liver</b> fibrosis and points out that these signaling pathways play an extremely {{important role in the}} development and progression of <b>liver</b> fibrosis and may provide new directions for the treatment of <b>liver</b> fibrosi...|$|R
40|$|Selective {{internal}} radiation therapy (SIRT) is a promising treatment modality for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma or metastatic <b>liver</b> cancer. SIRT is usually well tolerated. However, in most patients, SIRT {{will result in}} a (temporary) decreased <b>liver</b> function. Occasionally patients develop radioembolization induced <b>liver</b> disease (REILD). In case of a high tumor burden of the <b>liver</b> it could be beneficial to perform SIRT in two sessions enabling the primary untreated <b>liver</b> segments to guarantee <b>liver</b> function until function in the treated segments has recovered, or functional hypertrophy has occurred. Clinically used <b>liver</b> function tests provide evidence of only one of the many <b>liver</b> functions, though all of them lack the possibility of assessment of segmental (regional) <b>liver</b> function. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) has been validated as a tool to assess total and regional <b>liver</b> function in <b>liver</b> surgery. It is also used to assess segmental <b>liver</b> function before and after portal vein embolization. HBS is considered a valuable quantitative <b>liver</b> function test enabling assessment of segmental <b>liver</b> function recovery after regional intervention and determination of future remnant <b>liver</b> function. We present two cases in which HBS was used to monitor total and regional <b>liver</b> function in a patient after repeated whole <b>liver</b> SIRT complicated with REILD and a patient treated unilaterally without complications...|$|R

We pro-vided an overview of current practices of <b>liver</b> surgery in normal and cirrhotic <b>livers.</b> The critical size of 25 % of remnant <b>liver</b> volume was related to patients with normal parenchyma [1]. Impaired function of the remaining <b>liver</b> is of major concern for the hepatopancreatobiliary surgeon, particu-larly in patients with an underlying <b>liver</b> disease.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{the most}} frequent primary hepatic tumour, and 90 % of the cases occur in patients with chronic underlying <b>liver</b> disease. <b>Liver</b> transplantation and <b>liver</b> resection are the two curative treatment options. However, <b>liver</b> transplantation cannot be proposed in all patients with HCC due to donor scarcity and the limitations of transplant criteria in this context. <b>Liver</b> resection is as a result becoming the best alternative treatment, providing that <b>liver</b> function is not altered and the future <b>liver</b> remnant volume is adequate. This Chapter focuses on the indications for safe <b>liver</b> resection in HCC patients associated with normal <b>liver</b> parenchyma or with underlying chronic <b>liver</b> disease.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} found that {{augmenter}} of <b>liver</b> regeneration (ALR) not only promotes <b>liver</b> regeneration and protects the <b>liver</b> from damage, but may also {{play an important role in}} the formation and development of the <b>liver.</b> The recent progress in research on the biological function and action mechanism of ALR in the <b>liver</b> is reviewed, and the application of ALR in the diagnosis and treatment of <b>liver</b> diseases is summarized. It is suggested that ALR may regulate hepatocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway to promote <b>liver</b> repair and regeneration. In the future, ALR may be used as a candidate for evaluating <b>liver</b> regeneration and prognosis in patients with <b>liver</b> failure.
