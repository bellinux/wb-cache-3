5|$|Another {{common and}} {{potentially}} fatal complication of doxorubicin is typhlitis, an acute <b>life-threatening</b> {{infection of the}} bowel.|$|E
5|$|Cena {{has granted}} over 500 wishes for {{children}} with <b>life-threatening</b> illnesses through the Make-A-Wish Foundation; the most in Make-A-Wish history. In 2009, Cena received the Chris Greicius Celebrity Award.|$|E
5|$|Southerly {{flow from}} Hurricane Norbert over the Pacific brought {{moisture}} from Dolly over the Southwestern United States, resulting in possible <b>life-threatening</b> flash flooding.|$|E
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. <b>Life-threatening</b> airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of <b>life-threatening</b> airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} (DKA) is {{a potentially}} <b>life-threatening</b> complication of diabetes mellitus. Signs and symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, deep gasping breathing, increased urination, weakness, confusion, and occasionally loss of consciousness. A person's breath may develop a specific smell. Onset of symptoms is usually rapid. In some cases {{people may not}} realize they previously had diabetes.|$|E
5|$|Hepatorenal {{syndrome}} (often abbreviated HRS) is a <b>life-threatening</b> {{medical condition}} {{that consists of}} rapid deterioration in kidney function in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. HRS is usually fatal unless a liver transplant is performed, although various treatments, such as dialysis, can prevent advancement of the condition.|$|E
5|$|In itself, NSML {{is not a}} <b>life-threatening</b> diagnosis, {{most people}} {{diagnosed}} with the condition live normal lives. Obstructive cardiomyopathy and other pathologic findings involving the cardiovascular system may be a {{cause of death in}} those whose cardiac deformities are profound.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} stages, {{electrolyte}} levels are often abnormal and require correction. High potassium levels can be <b>life-threatening,</b> {{and respond to}} increased urine production and renal replacement therapy (see below). Temporary measures include the administration of calcium to protect against cardiac complications, insulin or salbutamol to redistribute potassium into cells, and infusions of bicarbonate solution.|$|E
5|$|On September4, the NHC {{noted that}} large swells {{likely to cause}} <b>life-threatening</b> rip current {{conditions}} were expected to impact the East Coast of the United States over subsequent days. The increased surf resulted {{in the death of}} a swimmer in Ormond Beach, Florida the following day, and a second death off Monhegan, Maine on September11.|$|E
5|$|Product safety testing : Sterility (bacteria and fungi), In vitro and in vivo {{testing for}} {{adventitious}} viruses, Murine retrovirus testing... Product safety data needed before the initiation of feasibility trials in serious or immediately <b>life-threatening</b> conditions, it serves to evaluate dangerous potential of the product.|$|E
5|$|Self-harm is not {{typically}} suicidal behaviour, {{although there is}} the possibility that a self-inflicted injury may result in <b>life-threatening</b> damage. Although the person may not recognise the connection, self-harm often becomes a response to profound and overwhelming emotional pain that cannot be resolved in a more functional way.|$|E
5|$|Some Armenians {{who were}} {{captured}} by the Germans as POWs opted to serve in German battalions rather than risk <b>life-threatening</b> conditions in POW camps. As with many Soviet soldiers who surrendered to German forces during fighting, Armenians were punished by Stalin and sent to work at labor camps located in Siberia.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{noted that}} the {{precursor}} disturbance {{had the potential to}} drop heavy rainfall which could result in <b>life-threatening</b> flash flooding or mudslides in Oaxaca and Guerrero. However, no damage reports were received there.|$|E
5|$|The {{commercial}} use of beryllium requires {{the use of}} appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the toxicity of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic <b>life-threatening</b> allergic disease in some people called berylliosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of subcutaneous emphysema {{in a person}} who appears quite ill and febrile after bout of vomiting followed by left chest pain is very suggestive of the diagnosis of Boerhaave's syndrome, which is a <b>life-threatening</b> emergency caused by rupture of the distal esophagus.|$|E
5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be <b>life-threatening.</b> In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain <b>life-threatening</b> situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.|$|E
5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop weakness of the breathing muscles leading to respiratory failure, the inability to breathe adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This <b>life-threatening</b> scenario is complicated by other medical problems such as pneumonia, severe infections, blood clots in the lungs and bleeding in the digestive tract in 60% of those who require artificial ventilation.|$|E
5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally <b>life-threatening</b> swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 review, {{there have}} been few studies on the {{efficacy}} of Proactiv. A 2011 Consumer Reports study compared Proactiv with two less expensive types of benzoyl peroxide, AcneFree and OXY Maximum, and found all three to be equally effective. The US Food and Drug Administration warned in 2014 that over-the-counter acne treatments can cause severe irritation, as well as rare but <b>life-threatening</b> allergic reactions.|$|E
5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially <b>life-threatening</b> bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of <b>life-threatening</b> interactions with these drugs.|$|E
5|$|Category1 storms usually cause no {{significant}} structural damage to most well-constructed permanent structures; however, they can topple unanchored mobile homes, {{as well as}} uproot or snap weak trees. Poorly attached roof shingles or tiles can blow off. Coastal flooding and pier damage are often associated with Category1 storms. Power outages are typically widespread to extensive, sometimes lasting several days. Even though it is the least intense type of hurricane, the storm can still produce widespread damage and can be a <b>life-threatening</b> storm.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis can be <b>life-threatening,</b> and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially <b>life-threatening</b> complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In {{a small proportion of}} cases, the disease develops into the <b>life-threatening</b> dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E
5|$|Early in its life, Debby was {{forecast}} to {{pass through}} the southern Cape Verde islands as a tropical storm, potentially causing <b>life-threatening</b> flooding. Most computer models consistently predicted Debby to track to the northwest throughout its lifetime, though intensity was more problematic for forecasters. The National Hurricane Center continually predicted Debby to intensify to hurricane status, though strong vertical shear ultimately prevented the storm from becoming a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction. These are potentially <b>life-threatening</b> conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable {{for much of the}} world's population.|$|E
5|$|Espanto Jr. is {{the most}} {{recognizable}} ring name of Jesús Andrade Salas (born May 11, 1956), a retired Mexican luchador, or professional wrestler. Over his 25-year-long career, Andrade worked under {{a number of different}} aliases, most importantly as Espanto Jr. ("Terror Jr."), later on as El Santo Negro ("The Black Saint"), and as the first person to work as Pentagón. Andrade was forced to retire from wrestling after suffering a <b>life-threatening</b> injury during a match that briefly left him clinically dead before being revived {{in the middle of the}} ring.|$|E
5|$|Generally, yellow {{stingrays}} pay little heed to divers and can {{be approached}} closely. If stepped on or otherwise provoked, however, this ray will defend itself with its tail spine, coated in potent venom. The resulting wound is extremely painful, but seldom <b>life-threatening.</b> Small and docile, the yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it requires {{a large amount of}} space (at least 180gal or 684L) and a fine, deep substrate with minimal ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|Greer was {{the site}} of the City of Hope Celebrity Softball Challenge from 1991 to 2014. Two teams of country music stars participated in the game, from which {{proceeds}} go toward research and treatment of cancer and other <b>life-threatening</b> diseases. Past participants include Vince Gill, Carrie Underwood, Brad Paisley, Billy Ray Cyrus, Sara Evans, Montgomery Gentry, and Phil Vassar. As of the 2008 event, more than $1.5million had been raised. In 2015, the game relocated to First Tennessee Park.|$|E
5|$|If {{symptoms}} develop {{during the}} acute phase, they usually resolve spontaneously within three {{to eight weeks}} in approximately 90% of individuals. Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase. Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease, 60–80% will never develop symptoms (called indeterminate chronic Chagas disease), while the remaining 20–40% will develop <b>life-threatening</b> heart and/or digestive disorders during their lifetime (called determinate chronic Chagas disease). In 10% of individuals, the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic Chagas disease.|$|E
5|$|In August 1912 Massenet went to Paris {{from his}} house at Égreville to see his doctor. The {{composer}} had been suffering from abdominal cancer for some months, but his symptoms did not seem imminently <b>life-threatening.</b> Within a few days his condition deteriorated sharply. His wife and family hastened to Paris, and were {{with him when he}} died, aged seventy. By his own wish his funeral, with no music, was held privately at Égreville, where he is buried in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, DiBiase {{started his}} own {{non-profit}} organization, the Ted DiBiase Foundation. As part of the foundation, individuals with <b>life-threatening</b> illnesses or disabilities are offered the chance to meet DiBiase at WWE live events, and further programs for youth leadership and community causes are being developed. When DiBiase left WWE, he took up an executive position with CollegeGarageSale.com, a college textbook e-commerce website.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially <b>life-threatening</b> and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{care in the}} hospital, as in the prehospital setting, aims {{to ensure}} {{adequate}} airway, breathing, cardiovascular function, and spinal immobilization. Imaging of the spine to ascertain presence of SCI may need to wait if emergency surgery is needed to stabilize a <b>life-threatening</b> injury. Acute SCI merits treatment in an intensive care unit, especially injuries to the cervival spinal cord. Patients with SCI need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons.|$|E
