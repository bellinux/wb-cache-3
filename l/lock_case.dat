The trigger may consist of a spring-loaded lever or plunger that engages the bolt when the back cover is dislodged from the <b>lock</b> <b>case.</b> Some combination locks also are equipped with a thermal relock trigger that activates in the event of a torch attack. Nearly all safes made after World War II have relock triggers in their combination locks.|$|E

50|$|The {{cylindrical}} lock {{was invented}} by Walter Schlage in 1923. The bored cylindrical lock arose from {{a need for a}} more cost-effective method of locking doors. The previous norm, the mortise lock, is a more complex device, and its higher manufacturing cost as well as its more labor-intensive installation make the bored cylindrical lock an ideal substitute, both in price and functionality. Because the mortise lock has a larger <b>lock</b> <b>case,</b> a larger and more complex volume must be removed from the door before it can be installed, but the mortise lock may offer additional functions compared to a cylindrical lock; for instance, the mortise lock may include a deadbolt in a single unit, while the cylindrical lock would require separate face bores for a deadbolt and doorknob. The 1923 patent evolved from an earlier Schlage patent filed in 1920 for a lock whose installation required a face bore and surface rabbet, which simplified door preparation compared to a mortise lock.|$|E

40|$|Reliability {{in terms}} of {{functional}} properties from the safety-liveness spectrum is an indispensable requirement of low-level operating-system (OS) code. However, with evermore complex and thus less predictable hardware, quantitative and probabilistic guarantees {{become more and more}} impor-tant. Probabilistic model checking is one technique to automatically obtain these guarantees. First experiences with the automated quantitative analysis of low-level operating-system code confirm the expectation that the naive probabilistic model checking approach rapidly reaches its limits when in-creasing the numbers of processes. This paper reports on our work-in-progress to tackle the state explosion problem for low-level OS-code caused by the exponential blow-up of the model size when the number of processes grows. We studied the symmetry reduction approach and carried out our ex-periments with a simple test-and-test-and-set <b>lock</b> <b>case</b> study as a representative example {{for a wide range of}} protocols with natural inter-process dependencies and long-run properties. We quickly see a state-space explosion for scenarios where inter-process dependencies are insignificant. However, once inter-process dependencies dominate the picture models with hundred and more processes can be constructed and analysed. ...|$|E

50|$|Some {{expensive}} merchandise {{will be in}} a <b>locked</b> <b>case</b> requiring {{an employee}} to get items at a customer's request. The customer is either required to purchase the merchandise immediately or it is left at the checkout register (under the supervision of a cashier) for the customer to purchase when finished shopping. This prevents the customer from having a chance to conceal the item. Another way of locking merchandise, especially popular in liquor stores, is to place it in a secure, store-administered hard-plastic cap on a regular bottle top. Once purchased the clerk will remove the cap with a store key. It is not otherwise easily removable. Many stores also lock CDs, DVDs, and video games in <b>locking</b> <b>cases,</b> which can only be opened by the checkout operator once the item has gone through the checkout. Many stores have certain items on locking pegs which are secure hooks to where the item cannot be removed from the hook.|$|R

500|$|Illinois was {{the last}} {{state in the nation}} to allow {{concealed}} carry of a handgun. [...] Prior to 2013, Illinois prohibited the carry of a firearm in a loaded condition, other than at one's own property. [...] If the firearm was loaded and not in a <b>locked</b> <b>case,</b> or if it was otherwise available for immediate use, it was a felony offense called Aggravated Unlawful Use of a Weapon (AUUF). [...] Illinois courts had uniformly upheld the constitutionally of the statute prior to 2008.

They were split into three groups of four and were given thirty minutes to find three {{avalanche}} beacons that had been hidden in the snow, to the north, east, and west of their starting position. Each group was given shovels and a receiver that would beep if it was within 40 meters of the beacon. The groups sent to the north and to the east found what they were looking for quickly - the group sent to the north found the beacon itself, while the group sent to the east found a <b>locked</b> black <b>case.</b> Upon returning to the starting position, they found that the north groups beacon had a dogtag on it that revealed the combination to one of the locks. Kristy, Heidi, Sonya, and John, sent to the west, initially went in the wrong direction and returned with their beacon with mere seconds on the clock. The group unlocked the black case in time, but what they found inside it was a second <b>locked</b> <b>case.</b> The host revealed that he had the key to that case, and to obtain it, nine of the players would have to spend the night in a snow cave. The three who were spared were Liz, Heidi, and Kristy. The other nine were told that if anyone asked to leave the snow cave, they could, but the money for the challenge would then be lost.
