Both peripheral and peritoneal PMN <b>leucocytes</b> were incubated in medium containing [35 S]sulphate and [3 H]glucosamine. Each sample obtained after incubation was separated into cell, cell-surface and medium fractions by trypsin digestion and centrifugation. The glycosaminoglycans secreted from peripheral and peritoneal PMN <b>leucocytes</b> were decreased in size by alkali treatment, indicating that they existed {{in the form of}} proteoglycans. Descending paper chromatography of the unsaturated disaccharides obtained by the digestion of glycosaminoglycans with chondroitinase AC and chondroitinase ABC identified the labelled glycosaminoglycans of both the cell and the medium fractions in peripheral PMN <b>leucocytes</b> as 55 - 58 % chondroitin 4 -sulphate, 16 - 19 % chondroitin 6 -sulphate, 16 - 19 % dermatan sulphate and 6 - 8 % heparan sulphate. Oversulphated chondroitin sulphate and oversulphated dermatan sulphate were found only in the medium fraction. In peritoneal PMN <b>leucocytes</b> there is a difference in the composition of glycosaminoglycans between the cell and the medium fractions; the cell fraction was composed of 60 % chondroitin 4 -sulphate, 5. 5 % chondroitin 6 -sulphate, 16. 8 % dermatan sulphate and 13. 9 % heparan sulphate, whereas the medium fraction consisted of 24. 5 % chondroitin 4 -sulphate, 28. 2 % chondroitin 6 -sulphate, 33. 7 % dermatan sulphate and 10 % heparan sulphate. Oversulphated chondroitin sulphate and oversulphated dermatan sulphate were found in the cell, cell-surface and medium fractions.

His next paper on the subject was published in 1964, when he observed a clear relationship between <b>leucocyte</b> antigen compatibility and antibody response to skin grafts. This finding sparked a flurry of {{research in}} the topic of histocompatibility, {{and by the end of}} 1965 Dausset had published over a dozen papers exploring <b>leucocyte</b> antigens and their relevance to histocompatibility. After identifying that a two-allele <b>leucocyte</b> antigen group had an influence on histocompatibility and observing the induction of hyper-sensitivity to skin grafts following injection of <b>leucocyte</b> fractions, Dausset developed a system for grouping <b>leucocyte</b> antigens on the basis of histocompatibility.

P-cresol, a prototype protein-bound uraemic retention solute, has been shown to exert toxic effects in vitro.

Recently, we have shown the importance of HS on activated mouse glomerular endothelial cells (mGEnC- 1) for the firm adhesion of <b>leucocytes</b> in a static adhesion assay. In the present study, we evaluated the role of HS on glomerular endothelial cells and the effect of adding heparinoids on the leucocyte-glomerular endothelium interaction under dynamic flow conditions. METHODS: The number of rolling and firmly adhering <b>leucocytes,</b> and the rolling velocity of <b>leucocytes</b> was determined on a monolayer of unactivated or TNF-alpha-activated mGEnC- 1 under dynamic flow conditions using physiological relevant shear stress rates in a flow chamber system. Furthermore, the effects of removal of HS on TNF-alpha-activated mGEnC- 1 by heparinase III treatment, and of different concentrations of heparin, tinzaparin and HS, on the rolling and adhesion of <b>leucocytes</b> were evaluated. RESULTS: At the calculated physiological shear stress rate of 0. 8 dynes/cm 2 the number of rolling and firmly adhering <b>leucocytes</b> to mGEnC- 1 increased 2 -fold after activation with TNF-alpha, whereas the rolling velocity of the <b>leucocytes</b> decreased 2 -fold. Addition of heparin, tinzaparin or HS, and the removal of HS on mGEnC- 1 reduced the number of <b>leucocytes</b> rolling and adhering to activated mGEnC- 1 about 2 - 3 -fold, while the rolling velocity increased more than 2 -fold.
