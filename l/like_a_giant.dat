These include a tunnel cleaning train, {{consisting of two}} 1938 stock motor cars and three purpose-built cars, which act <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> vacuum cleaner, and can hold 6 tons of dust before the filter tanks need to be emptied. Three Plasser & Theurer track tamping machines were purchased in 1980, and two Unimog road-rail vehicles were obtained in 1983 and 1986, for use as depot shunters.|$|E
5|$|The survey {{continued}} {{to the south}} in Patagonia. They stopped at Bahía Blanca, and in cliffs near Punta Alta Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He identified the little-known Megatherium by a tooth and its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him to be <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> version of the armour on local armadillos.

5|$|A common {{plot device}} is referenced, where a {{shoulder}} angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, {{as both the}} devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used {{to show that a}} character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking up at his head as it floats over them).|$|E
5|$|If {{the account}} of Sima Qian (c. 145–86 BC) in his Records of the Grand Historian is proven correct upon the {{unearthing}} of Qin Shi Huang's (r. 221–210 BC) tomb, the raised-relief map has existed since the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). Robert Temple and Joseph Needham suggest that certain pottery vessels of the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) showing artificial mountains as lid decorations may have influenced the raised-relief map. The Han Dynasty general Ma Yuan (14 BC – 49 AD) made a raised-relief map of valleys and mountains in a rice-constructed model of 32 AD. Such rice models were expounded on by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) author Jiang Fang in his Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice (c. 845 AD). A raised-relief map made of wood representing all the provinces of the empire and put together <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> 0.93 m2 (10ft2) jigsaw puzzle was invented by Xie Zhuang (421–466 AD) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479).|$|E

It {{is known that}} Ma Yuan (14 BC– 49 AD) created a raised-relief map in 32 AD made out of rice, a type of map described in detail during the Tang Dynasty (618–907) by Jiang Fang in his Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice (c. 845). Xie Zhuang (421–466) of the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479) created a 0.93 m2 (10ft2) wooden raised-relief map of the empire (showing mountains and rivers) which could be taken apart and pieced together <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> jigsaw puzzle.

25|$|Zwicky also {{considered}} the possibility of rearranging the universe to our own liking. In a lecture in 1948 he spoke of changing planets, or relocating them within the solar system. In the 1960s he even considered how the whole solar system might be moved <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> spaceship to travel to other stars. He considered this might be achieved by firing pellets into the Sun to produce asymmetrical fusion explosions, and by this means {{he thought that the}} star Alpha Centauri might be reached within 2500 years.|$|E
25|$|Ordinarily, atoms {{are mostly}} {{electron}} clouds by volume, with very compact nuclei {{at the center}} (proportionally, if atoms were {{the size of a}} football stadium, their nuclei would be the size of dust mites). When a stellar core collapses, the pressure causes electrons and protons to fuse by electron capture. Without electrons, which keep nuclei apart, the neutrons collapse into a dense ball (in some ways <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> atomic nucleus), with a thin overlying layer of degenerate matter (chiefly iron unless matter of different composition is added later). The neutrons resist further compression by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, in a way analogous to electron degeneracy pressure, but stronger.|$|E

25|$|Unlike most {{subduction}} zones worldwide, {{there is}} no deep oceanic trench present along the continental margin in Cascadia. The {{reason is that the}} mouth of the Columbia River empties directly into the subduction zone and deposits silt {{at the bottom of the}} Pacific Ocean, burying this large depression. Massive floods from prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula during the Late Pleistocene also deposited large amounts of sediment into the trench. However, as with other subduction zones, the outer margin is slowly being compressed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> spring. When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals, the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes, such as the magnitude 9.0Cascadia earthquake on January 26, 1700.|$|E
25|$|Bai Tho Mountain is a {{limestone}} mountain formation, which {{rises to}} {{a height of}} 106 meters, {{right in the middle}} of the Hạ Long City. It appears <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> castle with three towers of the undulating rock. Another famous mountain is the That Bai Tho Mountain, which was earlier called the Transmission Mount(Then). It has historical linkage to the visit of Emperor Lê Thánh Tông to the provincial city in 1468. The emperor was moved by the beauty of the mountain covered with clouds, called it a young fairy of Hạ Long and got a poem written on it and engraved on the southern side of the rocky cliff. In 1729, Lord Trịnh Cương did a painting and poem on Emperor Lê Thánh Tông on this mountain.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} two trails through the Jewellery Quarter that {{were created by}} the city council. The Findings Trail was {{designed}} by Laura Potter, a practising maker and graduate from the School of Jewellery. There are 30 pavement slabs, with a stainless steel information plaque based on {{the form of a}} hallmarked tag usually found on jewellery. There is also a glass cat's eye set into each information plaque which reflects light at night and day on the principle of a gemstone set in jewellery. Slabs contain various elements of either stainless steel or cast bronze. The Charm Bracelet Trail was designed by the Birmingham-based artist partnership Renn and Thacker. The trail is shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> bronze charm bracelet. At the bottom of Newhall Hill is a charm bracelet padlock that illuminates at night, marking the start of the trail.|$|E

As yet, however, there were no Spaniards to be seen, for the reason that none had dared to stand upon this high tower whereof the bulwarks were all gone, while the bowsprit of the Margaret crashed down upon it <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant's</b> club, and, as she rolled, swept it with its point.|$|R
25|$|The old citadel (in Greek Palaio Frourio (Παλαιό Φρούριο) {{is an old}} Venetian {{fortress}} {{built on}} an artificial islet with fortifications surrounding its entire perimeter, although some sections, particularly on the east side, are slowly being eroded and falling into the sea. Nonetheless, the interior has been restored and is in use for cultural events, such as concerts (συναυλίες) and Sound and Light Productions (Ηχος και Φως), when historical events are recreated using sound and light special effects. These events take place amidst the ancient fortifications, with the Ionian sea in the background. The central high point of the citadel rises <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> natural obelisk complete with a military observation post at the top, with a giant cross at its apex; {{at the foot of}} the observatory lies St. George's church, in a classical style punctuated by six Doric columns, as opposed to the Byzantine architectural style of the greater part of Greek Orthodox churches.|$|E
25|$|Other {{branches}} of physics also received attention {{during the period}} of the Scientific revolution. William Gilbert, court physician to Queen Elizabeth I, published an important work on magnetism in 1600, describing how the earth itself behaves <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> magnet. Robert Boyle (1627–91) studied the behavior of gases enclosed in a chamber and formulated the gas law named for him; he also contributed to physiology and to the founding of modern chemistry. Another important factor in the scientific revolution was the rise of learned societies and academies in various countries. The earliest of these were in Italy and Germany and were short-lived. More influential were the Royal Society of England (1660) and the Academy of Sciences in France (1666). The former was a private institution in London and included such scientists as John Wallis, William Brouncker, Thomas Sydenham, John Mayow, and Christopher Wren (who contributed not only to architecture but also to astronomy and anatomy); the latter, in Paris, was a government institution and included as a foreign member the Dutchman Huygens. In the 18th century, important royal academies were established at Berlin (1700) and at St. Petersburg (1724). The societies and academies provided the principal opportunities for the publication and discussion of scientific results during and after the scientific revolution. In 1690, James Bernoulli showed that the cycloid is the solution to the tautochrone problem; and the following year, in 1691, Johann Bernoulli showed that a chain freely suspended from two points will form a catenary, the curve with the lowest possible center of gravity available to any chain hung between two fixed points. He then showed, in 1696, that the cycloid is the solution to the brachistochrone problem.|$|E
