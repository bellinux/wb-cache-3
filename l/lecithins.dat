40|$|In testing several egg <b>lecithin</b> {{preparations}} {{prepared by}} ourselves {{it was found}} that they did not react in complement fixation tests with immune sera made by injections with commercial egg <b>lecithin</b> Merck. With the flocculation method two of the preparations reacted only faintly. Also the brain <b>lecithin</b> and hydrolecithin gave no distinct reactions. The immunization experiments of Sachs and Klopstock could easily be confirmed when commercial egg <b>lecithin</b> Merck was used for the injections. Immunizations with brain <b>lecithin</b> and hydrolecithin yielded no active sera. With an egg <b>lecithin</b> (No. 1) prepared by us the results were not satisfactory though a great number of injections was made. Only one serum gave reactions of medium strength by complement fixation and in flocculation tests with emulsions of Merck <b>lecithin.</b> It did not react however with the <b>lecithin</b> preparation No. 1 itself. In this respect the results resemble to a certain degree those of Sachs and Klopstock with their <b>lecithin</b> Bohringer immune serum. While the reactions of Merck <b>lecithin</b> were slightly diminished by the removal of cholesterol) addition of cholesterol to the <b>lecithin</b> No. 1 had no marked effect on the complement fixation tests, even when a larger amount was added than that present in the Merck preparation. The cholesterol content of this <b>lecithin</b> therefore does not suffice to account for the difference in the results. It is noteworthy that our <b>lecithin</b> immune serum No. 967 gave complement fixation with emulsions of cholesterol although this substance was not present in the injected material. There are several plausible explanations for our results. According to one, the production of antibodies for <b>lecithin</b> would depend on certain physicochemical conditions of the emulsion injected or upon the presence of auxiliary substances in the <b>lecithin</b> preparation (cf. Sachs and Klopstock). Another possibility is that the active agent inducing the formation of antibodies is not <b>lecithin</b> itself but some other substance present in the active <b>lecithin</b> preparations. With regard to the latter assumption it may be mentioned that we obtained definite immunization effects from several injections of quantities as little as 0. 2 mg. of purified preparations of Forssman's heterogcnetic haptene mixed with pig serum. 2 To decide between the alternative explanations, further studies are necessary...|$|R
25|$|<b>Lecithin</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring lipid. It {{can be found}} in egg yolks and oil-producing plants. it is an emulsifier and thus is used in many foods. Corn, soy and safflower oil are sources of <b>lecithin,</b> though the majority of <b>lecithin</b> commercially available is derived from soy. Sufficiently processed <b>lecithin</b> is often undetectable with standard testing practices. According to the FDA, no evidence shows or suggests hazard to the public when <b>lecithin</b> is used at common levels. <b>Lecithin</b> added to foods amounts to only 2 to 10 percent of the 1 to 5 g of phosphoglycerides consumed daily on average. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about GM food extend to such products. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in Europe in 2000, when Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including <b>lecithin.</b> Because of the difficulty of detecting the origin of derivatives like <b>lecithin</b> with current testing practices, European regulations require those who wish to sell <b>lecithin</b> in Europe to employ a comprehensive system of Identity preservation (IP).|$|R

50|$|To {{modify the}} {{performance}} of lecithin to make it suitable for the product {{to which it is}} added, it may be hydrolysed enzymatically. In hydrolysed <b>lecithins,</b> a portion of the phospholipids have one fatty acid removed by phospholipase. Such phospholipids are called lysophospholipids. The most commonly used phospholipase is phospholipase A2, which removes the fatty acid at the C2 position of glycerol. <b>Lecithins</b> may also be modified by a process called fractionation. During this process, lecithin is mixed with an alcohol, usually ethanol. Some phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, have good solubility in ethanol, whereas most other phospholipids do not dissolve well in ethanol. The ethanol is separated from the lecithin sludge, after which the ethanol is removed by evaporation to obtain a phosphatidylcholine-enriched lecithin fraction.|$|E

The mean size of zein-lecithin composite colloidal nanoparticles was firstly increased {{with the rise of}} <b>lecithin</b> concentration and then siginificantly decreased. The nanoparticles at the zein to <b>lecithin</b> mass ratio of 5 : 1 had the largest particle size (263 nm), indicating that zein and <b>lecithin</b> formed composite colloidal nanoparticles, which might aggregate due to the enhanced interaction at a higher proportion of <b>lecithin.</b> Continuing to increase <b>lecithin</b> concentration, the zein-lecithin nanoparticles possibly formed a reverse micelle-like or a vesicle-like structure with zein in the core, which prevented the formation of nanoparticle aggregates and decreased the size of composite nanoparticles. The presence of <b>lecithin</b> significantly reduced the ζ-potential of zein-lecithin composite colloidal nanoparticles. The interaction between zein and <b>lecithin</b> enhanced the intensity of the fluorescence emission of zein in ethanol-water solution.

40|$|To {{determine}} the molecular species composition of <b>lecithins</b> of different nascent lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins (HDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons (CM) were {{isolated from the}} mesenteric lymph of rats. Lymph was collected at 0 degrees C with 5, 5 '-dithiobis- 2 -dinitrobenzoic acid added to inhibit lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase. CM were separated by ultracentrifugation and HDL from VLDL by dextran SO 4 -MG+ 2 precipitation. Molecular species of lecithin were directly isolated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. In fasted animals, the lecithin compositions of lymph HDL and VLDL were virtually the same and closely resembled the lecithin composition of intestinal mucosa. When bile lecithin was eliminated (by bile diversion), there was a marked change in lecithin composition of all lipoprotein and mucosal samples, which was most notable for a reduction in 16 : 0 -species (which are predominant in bile) and a relative increase in the corresponding 18 : 0 -species. Feeding unsaturated triglycerides (triolein, trilinolein, {{or a combination of}} triolein and trilinolein) also resulted in a change in HDL and VLDL lecithin composition. The effect was similar whether bile lecithin was present or eliminated and was notable for a reduction in 16 : 0 -species, an increase in 18 : 0 -species, and the emergence of large amounts of diunsaturated <b>lecithins</b> that corresponded to the fatty acid composition of the triglycerides fed (i. e., 18 : 1 - 18 : 1, 18 : 2 - 18 : 2, and 18 : 1 - 18 : 2 <b>lecithins).</b> When bile-diverted rats were infused via the duodenum with a mix of [14 C]choline-labeled <b>lecithins</b> (isolated from the bile of other rats), the incorporation of infused <b>lecithins</b> into different lymph lipoproteins was distinctly different. Individual <b>lecithins</b> were incorporated to a variable extent into each lipoprotein. In fasted rats the specific activities of all major molecular species of lecithin were relatively greater in VLDL than HDL, indicating that HDL derived proportionately more of its <b>lecithins</b> from an endogenous pool than did VLDL. Feeding triolein changed the specific activities of more of the lecithin species of VLDL than of HDL. The specific activities of <b>lecithins</b> in CM were more similar to VLDL than to HDL after triolein feeding. Results thus indicate that, although the <b>lecithins</b> of different mesenteric lymph lipoproteins are similar and may be derived from membrane sites with the same lecithin composition, <b>lecithins</b> incorporated into different lipoproteins originate from different metabolic pools and/or by different mechanisms...|$|E
