40|$|Several studies link modern {{economic}} performance to institutions transplanted by European colonizers {{and here we}} extend this line of research to Asia. Japan imposed its system of well-defined property rights in land on some of its Asian colonies, including Korea, Taiwan and Palau. In 1939 Japan began to survey and register private land in its island colonies, an effort that was completed in Palau but interrupted elsewhere by World War II. Within Micronesia robust economic development followed only in Palau where individual property rights were well defined. Second, we show that well-defined property rights in Korea and Taiwan secured land taxation and enabled farmers to obtain bank loans for capital improvements, principally irrigation systems. Our analytical model predicts that high costs of creating an ownership updating system and a citizen identity system discourage a short-sighted government from implementing these crucial components, the absence of which gradually makes land registration obsolete. Third, considering all of Japan’s colonies, we use {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>land</b> <b>survey</b> as an <b>instrument</b> to identify the causal impact of new institutions. Our estimates show that property-defining institutions were important for economic development, results that are confirmed when using a similar approach with British Colonies in Asia. ...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{processes}} require monitoring {{to ensure}} safety and to control the new and existing structures. Traditional monitoring is based on <b>land</b> <b>surveys</b> and geotechnical <b>instruments</b> and only allows for point-like measurements. Ground-based synthetic aperture radar (GB-SAR) is a remote sensing radar installed in the ground that offers the possibility of acquiring measurements in 2 D covering areas of up to a few square kilometers in a single acquisition. Because the GB-SAR technology measures phase shifts along the Line-of-Sight, it only allows for measurements in the longitudinal direction. Moreover, this technology requires coherence between subsequent acquisitions. These restrictions can be a limitation to the usage of GB-SAR for monitoring a construction process because in this context, the movements of soil and existing structures occur in any direction and at a very fast pace. This paper aims to test the GB-SAR suitability to measure movements during construction. To do so, an experiment was performed in the future railway station of La Sagrera, Barcelona (Spain), in which GB-SAR was used to accurately quantify wall displacements induced by dewatering and proved to be helpful to understand structural deformations and to identify vulnerable areas. The results were compared to traditional monitoring data and numerical models to confirm {{the reliability of the}} GB-SAR measurements. Peer reviewe...|$|R
