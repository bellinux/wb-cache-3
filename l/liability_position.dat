40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the path of}} the UK's international investment position (IIP) {{with the rest of the}} world. The paper shows that both UK assets and liabilities grew considerably during the past decade. Liabilities always outstripped assets during this period, mainly reflecting the persistent current account deficits, which meant that the UK consistently ran a net <b>liability</b> <b>position.</b> Although the size of the net <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> increased over the decade, its growth has been volatile. The paper presents a model which shows that in the long term flows had driven the changes to the UK’s net IIP, while the volatility in the short term was driven by other changes. The model showed that in 2008 exchange rate effects were the main driver of the UK’s improved net liability position; this was because sterling depreciated sharply against all three major currencies. The deterioration in the net <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> in 2009 and 2010 was explained mainly in terms of price effects, as equity markets began to recover; but also exchange rate effects as sterling began to rally, particularly against the euro; and flows as investors turned to UK gilts in preference to euro denominated government debt...|$|E

40|$|Using {{two sources}} {{of data on}} {{commercial}} bank liabilities we examine the behavior of various components of deposits following a monetary tightening (downturn) {{as well as a}} nonmonetary downturn equal in magnitude to the monetary downturn in order to better understand the portfolio behavior of commercial banks. We find that the increase in total deposits during a monetary tightening (when output is low and interest rates are high) is attributable to an increase in small time deposits and that large time deposits and demand deposits exhibit a decrease. This suggests that banks are able to, at least partially, offset the potentially adverse effects of a monetary tightening on their balance sheet by borrowing and raising additional small time deposits. Further, non-monetary downturns, when both interest rates and output are low, seem to have little effect on the <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> of banks. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} Investment Position (IPP) is {{a statement}} that shows the value of external financial assets and liabilities of residents of an economy {{at a point in}} time. Its evolution {{at the end of a}} specific period reflects balance of payments financial account transactions, valuation changes (in asset prices and exchange rates) and other adjustments, which consist mainly of reclassifications of external financial assets and liabilities. The purpose of this paper is to provide figures on trends of valuation adjustments due to price and exchange rate changes implicit in Spain´s International Investment Position (IIP), and to briefly analyze their limitations. We found that valuation effects depend on the characteristics of the financial instruments involved, and on the sources of information available for each component. In the case of portfolio investment transactions, we used security by security market prices that were available for the years 2003 and 2004. Additionally, in Spain´s international investment position, most foreign direct investment data are not available at market values. As these assets and liabilities have experienced important price increases between 1993 and 2006, we present a new methodology for measuring foreign direct investment positions that includes valuation effects. The results presented in this paper show that in Spain, revaluations of stocks explain a very important part of changes in the IIP during recent years: 55 % of the increase in the net <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> of the Spanish economy between 1993 and 2004 reflects changes of value due to variations in prices or in exchange rates of external assets and liabilities. Overall, the sum of these revaluation effects represent 19 % of GDP of the year 2004. Between 1997 and 2004, Spain’s net <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> increased 247, 930 million euros, of which balance of payments financial account transactions accounted for 52, 6 %, whereas revaluations and other adjustments explain the remaining 47, 3 %.

40|$|Many {{emerging}} market economies have experienced large buildups {{of foreign exchange}} rate reserves over the last decade. Much of the contemporary discussion of this phenomenon has focused on this reserve growth as the consequence of exchange rate policies which have maintained fixed pegs to the US dollar.

While Asian economies have become significant gross creditors in bonds and other fixed income assets, their <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> in equity and FDI assets has also grown significantly. This suggests that a full understanding of the reserve growth episode must be seen as part of an overall model of portfolio choice. The paper constructs a model of the interaction between an emerging market and an advanced economy in which an optimal general equilibrium portfolio structure implies that emerging market economies simultaneously build up a stock of foreign exchange rate reserves while receiving FDI flows from the advanced economy. The model can provide a reasonable quantitative account of the recent Asian experience. Asia Financial globalization FDI Foreign exchange rate reserves...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{determinants}} of gross capital flows, project the size of China’s international investment positions in 2020 and analyse the implications for the renminbi real exchange rates. We assume in this exercise that the renminbi will have largely achieved capital account convertibility {{by the end of}} this decade, a timetable consistent with recent proposals by the People’s Bank of China. Our analysis shows that China’s gross international investment positions would grow significantly, and inflows and outflows would become much more balanced. The private sector would turn its net <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> into a balanced position, and the official sector would reduce its net asset position significantly, relative to the country’s GDP. Because of the increasing importance of private sector foreign claims and the decreasing importance of official foreign reserves, China would be able to earn higher net investment incomes from abroad. Overall, China would continue to be a net creditor, with the net foreign asset position as a share of GDP remaining largely stable through this decade. These findings suggest that the renminbi real exchange rate would not be particularly sensitive to capital account liberalisation as capital flows are expected to be two-sided. The renminbi real exchange rate would likely be on a path of moderate appreciation as China is expected to maintain a sizeable growt...|$|E
40|$|Sustained large U.

S. consumption. Two factors that, to date, have cast doubt on such concerns are the stability of U. S. net external liabilities and the minimal net income payments made by the United States on these liabilities. We show that the stability of the external position reflects sizable capital gains stemming from strong foreign equity markets and a weaker dollar - conditions that could be reversed in the future. We also show that while minimal U. S. net income payments reflect a much higher measured rate of return on U. S. foreign direct investment (FDI) assets than on U. S. FDI liabilities, ongoing borrowing is likely to overwhelm this favorable rate of return, pushing the U. S. net income balance more deeply into deficit.; In addition, we review the argument that the United States holds large amounts of intangible assets not captured in the data - assets that would bring the true U.
