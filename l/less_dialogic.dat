50|$|In recent times, {{the concept}} of {{dialogic}} learning {{has been linked to}} contributions from various perspectives and disciplines, such as the theory of dialogic action (Freire, 1970), the dialogic inquiry approach (Wells, 1999), the theory of communicative action (Habermas, 1984), the notion of dialogic imagination (Bahktin, 1981) and the dialogical self (Soler, 2004). In addition, the work of an important range of contemporary authors is based on dialogic conceptions. Among those, it is worth mentioning authors like Jack Mezirow (1990, 1991, 2000) and his transformative learning theory; Michael Fielding (2001), who sees students as radical agents of change; Timothy Koschmann (1999), who highlights the potential advantages of adopting dialogicality as the basis of education; and Anne C. Hargrave (2000), who demonstrates that children in dialogic-learning conditions make significantly larger gains in vocabulary, than do children in a <b>less</b> <b>dialogic</b> reading environment.|$|E

Data do not only reveal that different signals are used across the two disciplines, but they also illustrate that their choice underlies broader epistemological stances, i. e. a more or <b>less</b> <b>dialogic</b> way of positioning research contribution...|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from the}} exchanging of information, an {{important}} role of conversation and communication is to promote social harmony through the maintenance of relationships. This {{is referred to as}} the ‘phatic’ function of communication. Indeed, digital communications technologies, and social media in particular, have been lauded for their potential to promote activism and social change through ‘raising awareness’ of injustices, their ability to motivate people into political action, and the facility to organise and co-ordinate that action for maximum effect. In this paper, I build upon previous arguments which suggested that the rise of social networking demonstrated that online culture and communication had become increasingly ‘phatic’ and <b>less</b> <b>dialogic.</b> Here I use previous empirical work to challenge the above claims of digital politics enthusiasts. I then suggest an alternative theoretical account of the function of digital media activism which better suits these empirical findings. I suggest that digital politics demonstrates a rise of ‘phatic communion’ in social media. Incorporating Heidegger’s notion of ‘idle talk’, I further suggest that the rise of a phatic online culture in social media activism has atrophied the potential for digital communications technologies to help foster social change by creating a conversational environment based on limited forms of expressive solidarity as opposed to an engaged, content-driven, dialogic public sphere...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{three studies}} {{that were designed}} to examine formative assessment from a sociocultural perspective. The first study presents the development, inter-rater reliability, {{and use of the}} Formative Assessment and Interaction Record (FAIR), which is a measure for documenting teachers' use of formative assessment and additional research-based instructional strategies. The FAIR was created to serve several interrelated purposes: (a) to document teachers' strategy use, (b) to allow teachers and schools to set specific goals for changes in instruction and to provide a means to document those changes, (c) to provide a tool for principals to use in their efforts to develop professional learning communities focused on equity in achievement, and (d) to encourage collaborative reflection and dialogue that is focused on the use of research-based strategies as a means to extend students' opportunities to learn. The goal {{of this study was to}} construct a reliable tool that could support district administrators and site principals in their collaborative efforts to increase teachers' use of formative assessment and equity-focused strategies. The second study is a qualitative investigation of collaboration between site and district leaders to engage teachers in inquiry and analysis of teacher performance data and student assessment results, with a focus on formative assessment practices and their relationship to equity and opportunity to learn. Interviews were conducted with principals from six elementary schools in a district serving a diverse student population with 49 % socioeconomically disadvantaged students and 38 % English learners. Results describe: how principals used teacher performance data to increase teachers' use of research-based formative assessment practices, the means by which principals facilitated the formative use of assessment data through teacher inquiry, and principals' perceptions of how this work relates to their goals of increasing achievement, equity, and opportunity to learn. The final investigation is a case study of teacher-student dialogue in the context of a whole-class peer assessment activity to demonstrate how such formative assessment activities support the use of dialogic instruction. While numerous studies have documented the positive effects of dialogic instruction on student learning, little is known about the variety of classroom contexts that might prove more or <b>less</b> conducive to <b>dialogic</b> instruction. The research question addressed in this study was: Can formative assessment support a dialogic lesson structure? It was hypothesized that teacher-student interactions in the context of student assessment would include authentic, high-level teacher questions, high-level teacher responsiveness, a substantial proportion of time devoted to discussion, broad participation by students, and longer student responses than what is commonly associated with typical teacher-student dialogue. Results indicated that the whole-class peer assessment activity was consistent with features of dialogic instruction...|$|R
40|$|The {{central focus}} {{of this study is}} to characterise {{classroom}} talk (CT) from the Dialogicity perspective and relate this characterisation to pupils‟ learning. It aims particularly to reflect on and develop the concept of Dialogicity as a theoretical perspective for characterising the nature of CT in relation to both teaching and learning. The study developed an analytical framework to analyse CT based on further characterising the Authoritative and Dialogic types of talk as defined by the communicative approach of Mortimer and Scott (2003). Data was generated by videotaping grade nine Omani science classes and probing the conceptual understanding of samples of pupils from these classes using bubble dialogue sheets and focus group discussions. This exploration was carried out in two stages separated by a short teacher training intervention designed to promote the practice of dialogic talk. The results demonstrated a quite big change in CT practice between the two stages, with more incidents of Dialogic talk in the second stage. Detailed analysis revealed a number of features characterising the Authoritative and Dialogic communicative approaches. Furthermore, it demonstrated different kinds of CT that were to be judged as Authoritative and others as Dialogic. This has resulted in viewing each type of talk along three general levels of high, mid and low. Consequently, the study has developed the communicative approach to a „multi-level Authoritative-Dialogic‟ model. Deeper reflection on this model, as characterising CT Dialogicity at the empirical level, led to propose the „less-more‟ dialogic model to approach CT Dialogicity at the theoretical level. The study argues that the continuity view of Dialogicity that this theoretical model is based on might be helpful in developing the concept of Dialogicity as a perspective in approaching the nature of CT. In investigating the relationship between CT Dialogicity and learning, the study looked into learning as a process and as a product. General results pointed to the superiority of Dialogic talk in supporting pupils‟ learning over Authoritative talk, in the terms of pupils‟ engagement, cognitive level of questions and responses and the conceptual understanding following from the teaching. However, the study argues that it is not possible to establish a constant claim on this superiority because the comparison between the two types can be approached differently, depending upon which of their levels are being compared. Alternatively, it suggests that the relationship between CT Dialogicity and learning is better approached in the light of the continuity view within the „less-more‟ dialogic model. Accordingly, different claims on the advantages of more dialogic talk over <b>less</b> <b>dialogic</b> in supporting pupils‟ learning have been suggested. In addition, the results illustrated a resonance between the pupils‟ conceptual understanding and difficulties and what happened in the preceding teaching. In summarising the relationship between CT Dialogicity, teaching and learning, the study asserts that learning is closely connected to the CT characterisation from the Dialogicity perspective, and does not stand in isolation from teaching. Different implications for research and teacher training have been raised in view of the study‟s methodological practices and findings...|$|E
40|$|This EPA STRIVE {{research}} fellowship report presents a literature review and fieldwork data {{for a project}} that investigated how the topic of nanotechnology can be engaged with by both experts on the topic and nonexperts. The first objective was to map out what {{can be said about}} knowledge of nanotechnology in contemporary Ireland. All perspectives on nanotechnology were taken on board, analysed and synthesised, including deviations from the accepted truths about nanotechnology. While perspectives on environmental and health implications were of particular interest, they were not the primary focus in discussions, unless raised by participants and commentators. Methods used for this study included an awareness survey and media and document analyses. The second objective was to pilot a series of nanotechnology communication events, which would provide the basis of a future communications/ consultation strategy for policy-makers. The types of activities used in these events included focus groups, a ‘citizens’ jury’, online forums and an installation in the Science Gallery in Dublin. The contributions from these activities also added to the first objective of addressing nanotechnology knowledge. The third and final objective was to report to the EPA, in order to aid future environmental research associated with public communication and wider science communication and technology assessment policy by the Irish government. The following was concluded from this project: • Scientists were the most prominent voices in public discourse about nanotechnology, but mostly in the context of commercial exploitation and innovation. • Environment and health risks and benefits were tied to social and ethical considerations very closely and participants in public engagement activities were at least as concerned about governance and equity issues (in terms of how nanotechnology is controlled) as they were about the environmental and health implication • Scientists were the most prominent voices in public discourse about nanotechnology, but mostly in the context of commercial exploitation and innovation. • Environment and health risks and benefits were tied to social and ethical considerations very closely and participants in public engagement activities were at least as concerned about governance and equity issues (in terms of how nanotechnology is controlled) as they were about the environmental and health implication • Where nanotechnology was described in the media, it tended to be either framed in commercial terms, or in basic, scientific, didactic terms for education and outreach, for example, ‘nanotechnology is …’ Both representations reduce the chances for nanotechnology risks, of any kind, to be discussed, and are at odds with policy measures of nanotechnology public engagement in other countries. • Dialogicality (expressing multiple voices and views on a topic) was weak in many official nanotechnology texts, new media approaches provided more opportunities for dialogue. • The concept of nanotechnology as an ‘entity’ was important – for young participants in particular. • Levels of attendance at public engagement events were low for the open-invitation focus group and the citizens’ jury pilot especially. The following recommendations are made: • Establish a Convergence Technologies Forum; • Ensure that dialogue initiatives are included for future nanotechnology; • Use all communication channels, including new Web 2. 0 media; • Learn from the public engagement mistakes of other emerging technology debates, such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs); • Link to global networks already involved in nanotechnology and emerging technology public engagement; • Include social sustainability as a criterion in future EPA- and exchequer-funded research and technology assessment. Even though there is little media or public interest, Nano-Innovation discourses are growing. In any future campaign for nanotechnology, media exposure and public relations require considerable investment. In other countries, dialogue is considered as important as promoting the technology itself. This report offers a ‘menu’ of dialogue models for policy-makers to address the many objectives of nanotechnology strategy, from <b>less</b> <b>dialogic</b> information transfer to public-led dialogue and the public imagining of a future with nanotechnology. If only some of the predictions are accurate, nanotechnology will have many social implications. Much work is necessary to ensure nanotechnology public engagement is taken seriously in Ireland if the technology is an economic priority, or indeed if it has some bearing on progress in health, environment and technology. This report confirms what is found in international studies of science and society – public engagement needs to be about what can be accepted, not what can be sold. This report recommends that, for a more inclusive approach to nanotechnology knowledge – and to avoid another ‘GM scenario’ – dialogue must form the basis of the communication strategy with embedded ‘triple bottom line’ values, that is, where society and environment are given the same level of importance currently granted to the economy...|$|E
