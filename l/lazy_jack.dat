50|$|In the 19th century, a French captain {{is said to}} have marvelled at {{the sight}} of a {{flotilla}} of trading vessels assembled from all corners of the globe in the harbour off Duyong island: Arab dhows, Indonesian perahus, Portuguese lorchas, English schooners, and Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai junks. The two perahu besar of Terengganu, the pinas and the bedar are the result of this cultural interchange. Pinas carry traces of French influence from French pinasse, while the bedar shows Arab/Indian (dhow) elements. Jib and bowsprit in the two are of western origin, as junks almost never carry these features. The sails of both of types are that of a classic Chinese junk: The rigging has an elaborate sheet system, parrels, snotter and <b>lazy</b> <b>jack</b> system. All have been documented in Chinese literature for over 2000 years. The desire for ever faster and more manoeuvrable vessels combined these positive elements and created these junk hybrids.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lazy</b> <b>jacks</b> (or lazyjacks) are {{a type of}} rigging {{which can}} be applied to a fore-and-aft rigged sail to assist in sail {{handling}} during reefing and furling. They consist of a network of cordage which is rigged to a point on the mast and to a series of points {{on either side of the}} boom; these lines form a cradle which helps to guide the sail onto the boom when it is lowered, reducing the crew needed to secure the sail. <b>Lazy</b> <b>jacks</b> are most commonly associated with Bermuda rigged sails, although they can be used with gaff rigged sails and with club-footed jibs. Blocks and rings may be part of some lazyjacks.|$|R
50|$|The oyster {{dredging}} sailboats of the Chesapeake Bay, bugeyes and skipjacks, were inevitably {{equipped with}} <b>lazy</b> <b>jacks,</b> as their huge sail plans, {{combined with the}} changeable conditions on the bay, made it necessary {{to be able to}} reef quickly and with a small crew. Of late they have been revived as a feature of pleasure yachts as an alternative to roller reefing and furling. The latter methods can distort the sail, and are not compatible with battens in the reefed or furled portion of the sail. <b>Lazy</b> <b>jacks</b> are also cheaper, and can be easily applied after-market. However, they are not without disadvantages. The extra lines provide something else for the sail to foul upon when it is being raised, particularly if it is battened, and the lines and the connections between them can chafe and beat upon the sail, shortening its life and making unwanted noise. Also, unlike the roller systems, some crew member(s) must be on deck to secure the sail.|$|R

50|$|In 1978, he briefly fronted a Spanish blues-rock band in Spain, {{and lived}} with a gypsy family for six months. After {{becoming}} a father in 1985, he relocated to Stuttgart, Germany, and played with a local blues band. In 1987, Richard opened for Joe Cocker at the Backnang Open Air Festival. Two years later he led his own Richard Ray Farrell Band, and started touring across Europe. Through connections he toured with <b>Lazy</b> Lester, Big <b>Jack</b> Johnson, Big Boy Henry, Louisiana Red, Frank Frost and R. L. Burnside between 1990 and 1993, during which time Farrell released his debut album, Live in Germany (1992). In 1993, he formed an outfit known as Street Talk, but the members lived across the Northern Hemisphere, making commitment impossible. Farrell returned to both solo acoustic performances and playing with his electric blues trio. In 1995, Farrell and Jimmy Carl Black formed the Farrell and Black Band, who recorded two albums for Stormy Monday Records, Cataract Jump (1996) and Black Limousine (1999). He honed his songwriting skills on these albums and then released Street Songs, Jazzy Tunes and Down Home Blues (1998).|$|R
