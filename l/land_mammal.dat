5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{from the}} Eastgate local fauna in the Monarch Mill Formation of Churchill County, Nevada. This fauna dates to the early Barstovian <b>land</b> <b>mammal</b> age, around 15–16 mya. This makes Apeomyoides the {{youngest}} known apeomyine, and its occurrence helps close {{a gap in the}} known geographic range of North American apeomyines between Megapeomys bobwilsoni elsewhere in Nevada and Arikareeomys in Nebraska. Other eomyids found at Eastgate include species of Leptodontomys and Pseudotheridomys.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a survey}} in 1989–90, Tripura hosts 90 <b>land</b> <b>mammal</b> species from 65 genera and 10 orders, {{including}} such species as elephant (Elephas maximus), bear (Melursus ursinus), binturong (Arctictis binturong), wild dog (Cuon alpinus), porcupine (Artherurus assamensis), barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), sambar (Cervus unicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa), gaur (Bos gaurus), leopard (Panthera pardus), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), and many species of small cats and primates. Out of 15 free ranging primates of India, seven are found in Tripura; this is {{the highest number of}} primate species found in any Indian state. The wild buffalo (Bubalus arnee) is extinct now. There are nearly 300 species of birds in the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} {{specimen}} of ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus is a mandible (lower jaw) {{found in the}} spring of 1935 by David Dunkle in Edson Quarry, Sherman County, Kansas. It is in the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University as specimen MCZ 6202. Edson Quarry is in the Ogallala Formation and the Hemphillian North American <b>Land</b> <b>Mammal</b> Age. Claude W. Hibbard described the mandible as ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus in a 1939 paper. Hibbard wrote that the fauna was middle Pliocene, but it is now considered Miocene. The Edson Quarry fauna contains a diversity of other fossils, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.|$|E

5|$|Because Ireland became {{isolated}} from mainland Europe by rising sea levels {{before the last}} ice age had completely finished, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain, which separated later, or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of them only 26 <b>land</b> <b>mammal</b> species are considered native to Ireland. Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow.|$|E
5|$|H. altispinus {{shared the}} Horseshoe Canyon Formation with fellow hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus and Saurolophus, hypsilophodont Parksosaurus, ankylosaurid Anodontosaurus, nodosaurid Edmontonia, horned dinosaurs Montanoceratops, Anchiceratops, Arrhinoceratops, and Pachyrhinosaurus, pachycephalosaurid Stegoceras, ostrich-mimics Ornithomimus and Struthiomimus, {{a variety of}} poorly known small theropods {{including}} troodontids and dromaeosaurids, and the tyrannosaurs Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus. The dinosaurs from this formation are sometimes known as Edmontonian, after a <b>land</b> <b>mammal</b> age, and are distinct {{from those in the}} formations above and below. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is interpreted as having a significant marine influence, due to an encroaching Western Interior Seaway, the shallow sea that covered the midsection of North America through much of the Cretaceous. H. altispinus may have preferred to stay more landward.|$|E
5|$|Other {{indigenous}} {{animals are}} represented by reptiles (tuatara, skinks and geckos), frogs, spiders, insects (weta) and snails. Some, such as the tuatara, are so unique {{that they have been}} called living fossils. Three species of bats (one since extinct) were the only sign of native land mammals in New Zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from a unique, mouse-sized <b>land</b> <b>mammal</b> at least 16 million years old. Marine mammals however are abundant, with almost half the world's cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and large numbers of fur seals reported in New Zealand waters. Many seabirds breed in New Zealand, a third of them unique to the country. More penguin species are found in New Zealand than in any other country.|$|E

5|$|The {{age of the}} Santa Rosa fauna remains highly uncertain, as the outcrop {{where the}} fossils were found cannot easily {{be placed in a}} known stratigraphical unit, and the fossils are so {{distinct}} from other known fossil faunas that biostratigraphy cannot provide a precise estimate. In a summary of the 2004 volume, Kenneth Campbell tentatively referred Santa Rosa to the Mustersan South American <b>Land</b> <b>Mammal</b> Age (SALMA), which he placed near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary, around 35 million years ago. However, Mario Vucetich and colleagues suggested in 2010 that the Santa Rosa fauna may be substantially later—perhaps as young as the Deseadan SALMA (late Oligocene, around 25 million years ago). According to Campbell, the Santa Rosa mammals likely lived in a savanna habitat that contained rivers.|$|E
5|$|The horses' senses {{are based}} on their status as prey animals, where they {{must be aware of}} their {{surroundings}} at all times. They have the largest eyes of any <b>land</b> <b>mammal,</b> and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Catherine's ukase of 1788, just as other nations were {{entering}} the maritime fur trade, the Russians had spent over 40 years establishing and expanding their maritime operations in North America. A number of colonies were being established over a large region stretching from the Aleutian Islands to Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Many ships sailed from Kamchatka to Alaska each year. The Russians not only had an early start, but they also controlled the habitats {{of the most valuable}} sea otters. The Kurilian, Kamchatkan, and Aleutian sea otters' fur was thicker, glossier, and blacker than those on the Northwest Coast and California. The four grades of fur were based on color, texture, and thickness. The most prized furs were those of Kurilian and Kamchatkan sea otters, Aleutian furs were second grade, those of the Northwest Coast third, and the poorest grade was those of Californian sea otters. Russia also controlled the sources of sable furs, the most valuable fur-bearing <b>land</b> <b>mammal.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Apart from cranial vibrissae, {{other groups}} are found {{elsewhere}} on the body. Many <b>land</b> <b>mammals,</b> including domestic cats, also have carpal (of the wrist) vibrissae {{on the underside of}} the leg just above the paws.

5|$|The sauropods {{were the}} largest and {{heaviest}} dinosaurs. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger {{than anything else in}} their habitat, and the largest were an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric mammals such as Paraceratherium (the largest <b>land</b> <b>mammal</b> ever) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size. There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but {{it may be that the}} most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments.|$|E
