5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early <b>land</b> <b>plant</b> spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of <b>land</b> <b>plant</b> evolution during the Ordovician period.|$|E
5|$|The algae are a polyphyletic {{group and}} {{are placed in}} various divisions, some {{more closely related to}} plants than others.

40|$|The phylogenetic {{branching}} {{order of}} the green algal groups {{that gave rise to}} <b>land</b> <b>plants</b> remains uncertain despite its fundamental importance to understanding plant evolution. Previous studies have demonstrated that <b>land</b> <b>plants</b> evolved from streptophyte algae, but different lineages of streptophytes have been suggested to be the sister group of <b>land</b> <b>plants.</b> To better understand the evolutionary history of <b>land</b> <b>plants</b> and to determine the potential effects of “long-branch attraction ” in phylogenetic reconstruction, we analyzed a chloroplast genome data set including three new chloroplast genomes from streptophyte algae: Coleochaetae orbicularis (Coleochaetales), Nitella hookeri (Charales), and Spirogyra communis (Zygnematales). We further applied a site pattern sorting method together with site- and time-heterogeneous models to investigate the branching order among streptophytes and <b>land</b> <b>plants.</b> Our chloroplast phylogenomic analyses support previous hypotheses based on nuclear data in placing Zygnematales alone, or a clade consisting of Coleochaetales plus Zygnematales, as the closest living relatives of <b>land</b> <b>plants.</b> Key words: phylogenomics, chloroplast genomes, <b>land</b> <b>plants,</b> streptophyte algae, heterogeneous models.

5|$|In 1976, the Dunstan Government {{stepped up}} its {{legislative}} efforts. Some bills, {{such as the one}} to remove the sodomy law and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council. However, the bill to abolish capital punishment passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September. Rape law was properly codified and defined as a crime within marriage {{for the first time in}} Australia. Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open. Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs. The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed. The first signs of Monarto's eventual failure began to appear: birth rates started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia's robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, came to an abrupt halt. However, state money continued to be poured into the Monarto project, despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while his Liberal successor Malcolm Fraser gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan's departure, no less than $20 million had been used to buy <b>land,</b> <b>plant</b> trees and formulate development plans, and the failed project is often seen as Dunstan's greatest failure. In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at Whyalla, forcing the operations to be scaled down.|$|E
25|$|A strobilus (plural: strobili) is a {{structure}} present on many <b>land</b> <b>plant</b> species consisting of sporangia-bearing structures densely aggregated along a stem.

Strobili are characterized by a central axis (anatomically a stem) surrounded by spirally arranged or decussate structures that may be modified leaves or modified stems.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{cells in}} a {{multicellular}} plant contain chloroplasts. All green {{parts of a}} plant contain chloroplasts—the chloroplasts, or more specifically, the chlorophyll in them are what make the photosynthetic parts of a plant green.

A plant cell which contains chloroplasts is known as a chlorenchyma cell. A typical chlorenchyma cell of a <b>land</b> <b>plant</b> contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts.|$|E
40|$|Life on Earth {{as we know}} {{it would}} not be {{possible}} without the evolution of plants, and without the transition of plants to live on <b>land.</b> <b>Land</b> <b>plants</b> (also known as embryophytes) are a monophyletic lineage embedded within the green algae. Green algae as a whole are among the oldest eukaryotic lineages documented in the fossil record, and are well over a billion years old, while <b>land</b> <b>plants</b> are about 450 – 500 million years old. Much of green algal diversification took place before the origin of <b>land</b> <b>plants,</b> and the <b>land</b> <b>plants</b> are unambiguously members of a strictly freshwater lineage, the charophyte green algae. Contrary to single-gene and morphological analyses, genome-scale phylogenetic analyses indicate the sister taxon of <b>land</b> <b>plants</b> to be the Zygnematophyceae, a group of mostly unbranched filamentous or single-celled organisms. Indeed, several charophyte green algae have historically been used as model systems for certain problems, but often without a recognition of the specific phylogenetic relationships among <b>land</b> <b>plants</b> and (other) charophyte green algae. Insight into the phylogenetic and genomic properties of charophyte green algae opens up new opportunities to study key properties of <b>land</b> <b>plants</b> in closely related model. This review will outline the transition from single-celled algae to modern-day <b>land</b> <b>plants,</b> and will highlight the bright promise studying the charophyte green algae holds for better understanding plant evolution...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPlants {{have been}} {{recognized}} since ancient times as a distinct lineage of organisms, but the precise boundaries of the group have only recently come into sharp focus. <b>Land</b> <b>plants,</b> or embryophytes, are immediately familiar as the organisms that constitute the terrestrial vegetation, dominate agriculture, and play {{a wide range of}} cultural and economic roles in human society. It is more difficult to identify the boundaries of plants as a whole because there is a vast diversity of photosynthetic eukaryotes that have affinities with <b>land</b> <b>plants</b> but are less conspicuous or lack the structural features of <b>land</b> <b>plants.</b> These organisms, algae, were classically treated as a subset of plants, but include both close relatives of plants and quite distantly related organisms: the term ‘alga’ is a form-classification, not a natural one. Some algae are naturally classified with <b>land</b> <b>plants,</b> while others are not. Furthermore, the original diversification of many algal lineages greatly predates that of <b>land</b> <b>plants,</b> so although it is tempting to think of algae as a kind of plant, it is really more accurate to think of <b>land</b> <b>plants</b> as a kind of alga...|$|R
25|$|Plant {{evolution}} is {{an aspect of}} the study of biological evolution, involving predominantly evolution of plants suited to live on land, greening of various land masses by the filling of their niches with <b>land</b> <b>plants,</b> and diversification of groups of <b>land</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Increased {{interest}} in mycorrhizal symbiosis {{and the development}} of sophisticated molecular techniques has led to the rapid development of genetic evidence. [...] Wang et al. (2010) investigated plant genes involved in communication with order Glomales fungal partners (DMI1, DMI3, IPD3). [...] These three genes could be sequenced from all major clades of modern land plants, including liverworts, the most basal group, and phylogeny of the three genes proved to agree with then current <b>land</b> <b>plant</b> phylogenies. This implies that mycorrhizal genes must have been present in the common ancestor of land plants, and that they must have been vertically inherited since plants colonized land.|$|E

2500|$|Molecular {{genetics}} {{has also}} {{shed light on}} the relation between radial symmetry (characteristic of stems) and dorsiventral symmetry (typical for leaves). James (2009) stated that [...] "it is now widely accepted that... radiality [...] and dorsiventrality [...] are but extremes of a continuous spectrum. In fact, it is simply the timing of the KNOX gene expression!" [...] In fact there is evidence for this continuum already at the beginning of <b>land</b> <b>plant</b> evolution. Furthermore, studies in molecular genetics confirmed that compound leaves are intermediate between simple leaves and shoots, that is, they are partially homologous with simple leaves and shoots, since [...] "it is now generally accepted that compound leaves express both leaf and shoot properties”. This conclusion was reached by several authors on purely morphological grounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biological}} pump plays {{a negligible}} role, {{because of the}} limitation to pump by ambient light and nutrients required by the phytoplankton that ultimately drive it. Total inorganic carbon is not believed to limit primary production in the oceans, so its increasing availability in the ocean does not directly affect production (the situation on land is different, since enhanced atmospheric levels of CO2 essentially [...] "fertilize" [...] <b>land</b> <b>plant</b> growth to some threshold). However, ocean acidification by invading anthropogenic CO2 may affect the biological pump by negatively impacting calcifying organisms such as coccolithophores, foraminiferans and pteropods. Climate change may also affect the biological pump in the future by warming and stratifying the surface ocean, thus reducing the supply of limiting nutrients to surface waters.

2500|$|Stomata {{are present}} in the {{sporophyte}} generation of all <b>land</b> <b>plant</b> groups except liverworts.

Monocotyledons such as onion, oat and maize may have about the same number of stomata on both leaf surfaces. In plants with floating leaves, stomata may be found only on the upper epidermis and submerged leaves may lack stomata entirely. Most tree species have stomata only on the lower leaf surface. Leaves [...] with stomata on both the upper and lower leaf are called amphistomatous leaves; leaves with stomata only on the lower surface are hypostomatous, and leaves with stomata only on the upper surface are epistomatous or hyperstomatous.

Marine mollusks and crustacea, echinoderms, corals, and foraminifera are not technically fishes. But they are abundant in the palæozoic rocks, ages upon ages older than those in which the first evidences of true fishes appear. And if, in a geological book, Mr. Gladstone finds the quite true statement that plants appeared before fishes, it is only by a complete misunderstanding {{that he can be}} led to imagine it serves his purpose.

But, if we are to read the pentateuchal statement as a scientific document (and, in spite of all protests to the contrary, those who bring it into comparison with science do seek to make a scientific document of it), then, as it is quite clear that only terrestrial plants of high organisation are spoken of in verses 11 and 12, no palæontologist would hesitate to say that, at present, the records of sea animal life are vastly older than those of any <b>land</b> <b>plant</b> describable as [...] "grass, herb yielding seed, or fruit-tree." ...|$|E
