An economic game theory model is proposed as a foundation for understanding the behaviour of subcontractors in allocating resources to projects. The model describes the influence of the degree of reliability of the planned schedule on subcontractors' and project managers' behaviours under traditional unit price contracting. Unreliable plans undermine efforts to promote cooperative behaviour. Decision making, game theory, lean construction, partnering, resource allocation, subcontracting,...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} outcome of an {{investigation}} into the construction costs in 11 motorway projects. The projects formed one length of road and were of identical specification; five of the projects were undertaken by a traditional design, tender, construct method, and five were undertaken by a procurement system by which the contractor bid a <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> for the work and so absorbed potential risks and benefits from changes in prices of resources or fluctuations in quantities of work necessary for the completion of the work. One project was undertaken by a design and build method. The results of the analysis indicate that in roadworks the construction cost per kilometre of road is some 11 % less expensive when <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>contracts</b> are used. This benefit appears to be more pronounced in the case of bridge structures incorporated into the motorway. Of greater significance is the cost certainty that is afforded using the <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> methods. The research showed that <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> projects {{were much more likely to}} be completed within the budget. Finally the <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> methods required less management by the client organization and delivered more harmonious working relationships between the client and contractor.

40|$|In this {{complicated}} industry, variation {{orders are}} {{part and parcel}} in construction contract. It is likely impossible not to have changes in completing the project either to the plans or the construction process itself. Due to its complexity in nature, these changes are inevitable in any construction project. Most construction contracts commonly include variations clauses to enable the employer’s design team to vary the design and specification, including in the Lump Sum type of contract. The main criticism of the traditional <b>Lump</b> <b>Sum</b> <b>Contract</b> has been that, it invites a confrontational approach over disputes arising out of contract variations. Furthermore, changes in <b>Lump</b> <b>Sum</b> <b>Contract</b> are difficult to quantify and the owner might reject the change order request. Thus, variation issues often give rise to argument, debate and litigation. Hence, {{the objective of this}} study is to identify the issues regarding variation order in <b>Lump</b> <b>Sum</b> <b>Contract.</b> The scope of the study is from the legal cases reported in Lexis Malaysia in relation to variations and <b>Lump</b> <b>Sum</b> <b>Contract.</b> The cases were analysed in order to achieve the objective of this project report. From the cases, few legal issues of ‘variation orders in Lump Sum Contract’ were found. The cases then be categorized under the issues discovered earlier in the literature review. From the analysis, it can be summarized that, the most common issue contended in court is on the validity of variation claims. The second is on the establishment of the very fact of a variation itself, while the third are, on the status of “cardinal” changes, and, “the contractual” and “common law position”. Last but not least, the issues on the measurement of varied work and valuation of variation orders, have also been identified in one case each respectively. Therefore, by conducting this research, the judgment made by the court on issues pertaining to variation order can be used as a reference to establish a guideline for the people in the industry so that the same problem will not be repeated in future project in <b>Lump</b> <b>Sum</b> <b>Contract.</b> The issues highlighted and the judgment delivered can become a lesson learned rather than opt for bringing the matter to court...|$|E

Thus, variations {{have become an}} inevitable situation in construction projects irrespective of the type, size and complexity. This research therefore focuses on <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> projects which account for {{a significant amount of}} variations in Sri Lanka. The research aimed at investigating the nature of variations in <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> projects, significant effects of variations and the means of minimizing variations. Semi-structured interviews and questionnaire survey were carried out to investigate the research phenomena. The professionals who involved in variation handling of <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> projects were taken for collecting data. The results through questionnaires were analyzed using RII and interviewee outcome were analyzed using content analysis. It was found {{that there are a number}} of factors contributing to variations in <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>contracts.</b> The variations occur very often during the design stage of projects. The research findings revealed that delay in completion of project, increase in project cost, rework and demolition, quality standards enhancement and delay in payments are the most significant effects of variation. The research emphasized that identification of client’s requirements is essential to minimize variations within the project. The research recommended freezing design, preparation of detailed project brief, conducting comprehensive site investigations, involving owner at planning and design stage and reducing contingency sum could minimize the occurrence of variations. Further, the current study enables the professionals to assess and take proactive measures to mitigate the adverse impacts of variations through the identified controls for variations.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the inter‐relationship between profitability, {{cost of capital}} and capital structure among property developers and contractors in Hong Kong. Whilst major indigenous local developers are among the largest and the most profitable in the world, their contractor counterparts are generally small and nowhere near as profitable. An analysis of financial data suggests that gearing is generally higher among contractors than developers. However, {{it does not mean}} that contractors borrow more than developers. Indeed they do not need to borrow as much as developers even if they have the assets to pledge as collateral. Contractors do not have to pay for high land costs, and they obtain project finance from developers through interim payments in <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>contracts</b> that are widely adopted in the industry. Their high gearing reflects more their low equity base than high level of debts. Their costs of equities are about double the developers’, probably due to their usually low or negative profit margins. This conclusion is substantiated by further regression analysis of the data. The findings indicate that capital gearing is positively related with asset but negatively with profit margins. This article concludes with a discussion on implications of such profitability divide between the two sectors on the unequal relationship between developers and contractors, and on their competitiveness.

40|$|Geotechnical {{uncertainty}} may be {{the most}} difficult risk to manage in construction. In design-build (DB), where the project’s price is fixed before design and in many cases the subsurface investigation is complete, the risk profile is fundamentally changed and the owner must address it. This paper assesses the potential of DB as a tool for addressing geotechnical uncertainty in public transportation projects by comparatively evaluating three successful approaches. The first case study involves the use of a geotechnical baseline report as a subsurface condition risk allocation tool. The second uses unit price pay items inside the larger <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>contract</b> to share the geotechnical risk with the design-builder. Finally, a “nested DB” landslide repair clause inside a design-bid-build interstate highway contract successfully addressed the post-award potential landslide risk.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the management of risks in competitive bidding for refurbishment work (<b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>contracts).</b> It investigates the main difficulties and risks faced by contractors when they are making decisions in competitive bidding {{as a result of the}} general lack of information both inside and outside a contractor's organisation. A decision support and risk management system model is developed which provides a systematic and objective approach to risk management in competitive bidding for refurbishment work. The model provides a framework whereby both quantitative (tender bid records) and qualitative (risk perception of contractors) information may be obtained to support the decisions of contractors during tendering. The research adopts a combination of both Archival and Opinion research methodologies to build up two main databases consisting of tender bid records and information on the risk perception of contractors during tendering. From the analysis, a decision support and risk management system is developed consisting of six modules namely: (i) Module 1 - Databases of tender bid records and Repertory grid data, (ii) Module 2 - General information of bidding characteristics, (iii) Module 3 - Contractor's analysis, (iv) Module 4 - Competitor's analysis, (v) Module 5 - Bidding models, and (vi) Module 6 - Risk management system. This study has demonstrated that past tender bid records of contractors may be organised in a systematic way to provide invaluable strategic information to enhance the understanding of contractors with respect to their competitive bidding environments, their own bidding performance and the bidding behaviour of their competitors, thereby enabling contractors to manage risks more effectively and efficiently...|$|R

D.), Individual Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program, Washington State UniversityThe {{construction}} {{industry is a}} large and complex industry involving multiple stakeholders with divergent interests who often experience conflict that is detrimental to all involved. Interpersonal conflict know as relationship conflict produces outcomes that are detrimental to performance {{as seen in the}} project schedule, morale of the management team, and the budget. The {{construction industry}} recognizes {{there is a problem with}} relationship conflict but little research has examined the topic to understand what construction management professionals experience and the effects on performance. This qualitative grounded theory research examined the effects of relationship conflict on performance and budget in construction management, through 25 interviews with construction management professionals, conducted in 18 northwest construction firms. The professionals interviewed included, three superintendents, 11 project managers, three senior project managers, and eight project executives. The goal of the study was to understand from the construction industry's perspective what the antecedents and outcomes of relationship conflict were for the firms and individuals involved. Key antecedents that produced relationship conflict were lack of communication, "old school" attitude, and <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>contracts.</b> The primary players who produced relationship conflict were the owner and owner's representative, subcontractors, and superintendents. Resulting from relationship conflict, the major detrimental outcomes were schedule delays and budget increases, while factors that mitigated relationship conflict were, good communication and trust. Performance was also negatively affected on a personal level as management professionals experienced the effects of relationship conflict through mental, emotional, physical, and family-life disruption.

Maintenance activities of transmission and distribution lines without shutdown the energize line called Hot Line Work. With hotline work activities could prevent production loss during maintenance job. Based on Computerized Maintenance Management System data in 2015 there were 432 work order active in electrical maintenance team. Work orders active are number of active work orders in open status {{at the end of}} the month and not shutdown classification, 278 of 432 work order active are under maintenance power line team. In this study we propose alternatives to reduce work order active in power line team. In this study fish bone diagram and pareto chart is applied to analyze the problem and find the root of problem. Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique (SMART) used in decision making process. SMART is used in this study because with this method allow complex problem to be decomposed into sets of simpler judgment. This simplicity influences directly on the understanding of the decision maker about the process used in the solution of the problem since the decision making process involving many decision makers from various background. The TOWS matrix is used in alternative generation. Brainstorming tool is used in attribute identification. Interval scale form is used in measuring the weight of attribute and attribute value to each alternative. From TOWS matrix there were four (4) alternatives generated. Alternative 1 : Purchase new bucket truck by PT. NYZ and operator of bucket truck from PT. NYZ employee. Alternative 2 : Purchase new bucket truck by PT.

40|$|A {{performance}} specified {{maintenance contract}} (PSMC) is a medium to long term maintenance contract running typically over a 10 year period. The contract covers {{all aspects of}} road network maintenance activity including day to day maintenance, resurfacing and reconstruction costs. The PSMC contract is based around the contractor meeting various performance standards {{in return for a}} lump sum amount. This paper illustrates the benefits of a PSMC style asset maintenance solution in managing a network such as that proposed in the Challenge. A PSMC maintenance solution offers benefits to the road maintenance authority through the ability of the Contractor to programme work at the optimum time, rather than being constrained to relatively even annual budgets. In this paper, a 15 % saving was predicted over the 20 year analysis period with no loss of level of service, through the ability to fund maintenance works in a more optimal fashion. This paper concludes that PSMC contracts offer an attractive asset maintenance solution. The <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>contract</b> price also provides greater certainty of long term expenditure levels than a more traditional year by year approach. There are further benefits of PSMC contracts which are not addressed as part of this paper such as economies of scale, certainty of work efficiencies, quality drivers on the Contractor to “do it right first time ” and proactive maintenance programmes...|$|E
40|$|For {{design-build}} (DB) projects, owners normally use {{lump sum}} and Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) {{as the major}} contract payment provisions. However, {{there was a lack}} of empirical studies to compare the project performance within different contract types and investigate how different project characteristics affect the owners’ selection of contract arrangement. Project information from Design-build Institute of America (DBIA) database was collected to reveal the statistical relationship between different project characteristics and contract types and to compare project performance between lump sum and GMP contract. The results show that lump sum is still the most frequently used contract method for DB projects, especially in the public sector. However, projects using GMP contract are more likely to have less schedule delay and cost overrun as compared to those with <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>contract.</b> The chi-square tests of cross tabulations reveal that project type, owner type, and procurement method affect the selection of contract types significantly. Civil infrastructure rather than industrial engineering project tends to use lump sum more frequently; and qualification-oriented contractor selection process resorts to GMP more often compared with cost-oriented process. The findings of this research contribute to the current body of knowledge concerning the effect of associated project characteristics on contract type selection. Overall, the results of this study provide empirical evidence from real DB projects that can be used by owners to select appropriate contract types and eventually improve future project performance...|$|E

An implosion is the act of bringing a structure down in a well planned and directed manner using explosive materials. Three major structures in three separate projects were imploded using this well known commercial technology. Safety is, and will always be, the major consideration {{with each of the}} projects. As each project succeeded another, the work process used new and improved methods to lower the risk to the environment, provide a safer workplace by reducing the exposure of high risk work and reducing the spread of lead, asbestos and radioactive materials. The time frame for dismantlement of the steel structures was greatly improved, thus reducing the total project cost.

40|$|The actual {{construction}} time {{and cost of}} construction projects may {{be affected by the}} client, project and contractual characteristics and in many cases can be very different from the contract time and cost. In this paper, details of 93 Australian construction projects are used to develop several models for actual {{construction time}} and cost prediction. A forward crossvalidation regression analysis is used {{for the development of the}} model for actual construction time forecast when client sector, contractor selection method, contractual arrangement, project type, contract period and contract sum are known. The standard deviation of the deleted residual indicates the best model for actual construction time prediction to comprise the independent variables log contract time, lump sum procurement and non-standard contractor selection. Regression models are also developed for forecasting the actual construction time and cost when client sector, contractor selection method, contractual arrangement and project type are known while contract period and contract sum are estimated. Different forms of regression analyses, including the standard regression and the crossvalidation regression, are used and the crossvalidation regression model with the smallest deleted residual sum of squares is selected. Since these models for time and cost are dependent on the contract period and contract sum being known, it is necessary to investigate the effects in situations where these have to be estimated. The results of the sensitivity analyses show that the errors in predicted actual construction time become smaller as the contract period increases. In contrast, the errors in predicted actual construction cost are virtually the same for large and small projects. The effects of different project type, contractor selection method and contractual arrangement are also examined. The results indicate that the actual construction time for industrial project is the longest when compared with residential, educational and recreational projects and that significant savings in actual construction time can be achieved when negotiated tender and design and build contract are used instead of the traditional open tendering and <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>contract</b> approaches. Finally, some practical applications of the models are illustrated for predicting the actual construction time and cost based on the risks and uncertainties of different client sector, contractor selection method, contractual arrangement and project type. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.
