For different functions (i. e., illumination and color), it may have two or more performance characteristics. When the multiple performance characteristics are dependent, it creates a challenging problem to accurately analyze the system reliability. In this paper, we assume that the system has two performance characteristics, and each performance characteristic is governed by a random effects Gamma process where the random effects can capture the unit to unit differences. The dependency of performance characteristics is described by a Frank copula function. Via the copula function, the reliability assessment model is proposed.

Based on a recently developed HID lamp model frame, a semi-theoretical fluorescent lamp model that can be determined by genetic algorithms and simple electrical measurements is presented. This model does not require any <b>lamp</b> <b>data</b> from lamp manufacturers. Its parameters can be determined from electrical voltage and current measurements of the lamps under ac operation at mains frequency. With the same set of parameters, the model can predict the lamp terminal characteristics accurately under low, medium and high frequency operations. Good simulation results were achieved when the lamp power was reduced to 60 % of rated power and when the lamp was operated under step-up and step-down transient processes. Simulation results for different sizes of tubular and compact fluorescent lamps agree well with their experimental results. Particularly, the differences between simulation results and experimental results under rated power are less than 10 %. Hence, the proposed model shows a good degree of accuracy: 1) for different types of fluorescent lamps; 2) at different operating frequencies; 3) under different dimming levels; and 4) during step-up and step-down transient processes. © 2007 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Melaleuca alternifolia oil has shown medicinal importance by demonstrating antifungal and bactericidal action against proven human pathogens. Objective To evaluate the physical and chemical aspects such as pH and calcium release, of Melaleuca alternifolia oil associated with calcium hydroxide, during different time intervals. Material and method Calcium hydroxide powder was added to vehicles to reach a concentration of 72 mg / 0. 1 mL. Three groups were formed: Group I: Calcium Hydroxide + Distilled Water; Group II: Calcium hydroxide + Propylene Glycol; Group III: Calcium hydroxide + Melaleuca oil.

40|$|The Advanced Land Imager Assessment System (ALIAS) {{supports}} radiometric and {{geometric image}} processing for the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) instrument onboard NASA s Earth Observing- 1 (EO- 1) satellite. ALIAS {{consists of two}} processing subsystems for radiometric and geometric processing of the ALI s multispectral imagery. The radiometric processing subsystem characterizes and corrects, where possible, radiometric qualities including: coherent, impulse; and random noise; signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs); detector operability; gain; bias; saturation levels; striping and banding; and the stability of detector performance. The geometric processing subsystem and analysis capabilities support sensor alignment calibrations, sensor chip assembly (SCA) -to-SCA alignments and band-to-band alignment; and perform geodetic accuracy assessments, modulation transfer function (MTF) characterizations, and image-to-image characterizations. ALIAS also characterizes and corrects band-toband registration, and performs systematic precision and terrain correction of ALI images. This system can geometrically correct, and automatically mosaic, the SCA image strips into a seamless, map-projected image. This system provides a large database, which enables bulk trending for all ALI image data and significant instrument telemetry. Bulk trending consists of two functions: Housekeeping Processing and Bulk Radiometric Processing.

In addition, the ARTEMIS mission monitored the solar wind alpha particle flux to the Moon. Modeling the lunar helium exosphere, we relate the LAMP polar observations to the LADEE equatorial observations. Further, using the ARTEMIS alpha flux in the Monte Carlo model reproduces the temporal variations in helium density. Comparing the <b>LAMP</b> <b>data</b> to the LADEE data shows excellent agreement. Comparing those with the ARTEMIS data reveals that the solar wind alpha flux is the primary driver to variability in the helium exosphere throughout the LADEE mission. Using a decay time for exospheric helium of 5 days, we determine that the solar wind contributes 64 +/- 5 % of the helium to the lunar exosphere. The remaining 36 +/- 5 % is presumed to come from outgassing of radiogenic helium from {{the interior of the}} Moon. Furthermore, the model reproduces the measurements if 63 +/- 6 % of the incident alpha particles are converted to thermalized helium atoms through the interaction between the alphas and the lunar surface.

The treatment regimen for at present involves exposure doses that are increased alogarithmically and is based upon previous broadband knowledge. No established protocol for TLOl UVB phototherapy exists. Patients were randomly chosen from Dryburn Hospital Phototherapy Department. Baseline minimal erythemal measurements were calculated (MED(_ 0)) and random measurements were taken during the course using a single TLOl <b>lamp.</b> <b>Data</b> was collected over a period of 1 year and the effects of photoadaptation were determined. Factors considered include the period of time in between treatments, the number of treatments already attended and cumulative doses. MED ratios were calculated and analysed to produce a skin adaptation model. The majority of patients were phototested 2 - 6 times during the treatment course, which lasted 6 weeks (mean). Results indicated that missing a treatment session was insignificant to the rate of tolerance. The model for tolerance was calculated to be: T(_n) = 1 + 3 [1 - exp (= 0. 03 n) ] n = tolerance following n treatments A revised protocol was established and a clinical trial implemented. Protocol results indicated that the new regimen significantly reduced cases of burning and significantly reduced the cumulative doses of radiation. Revised protocol patients (yellow group) received total doses of 12. 7 J/cm(^ 2) (median) and the original regimen provided a total of 16. 9 J/cm(^ 2) (median). There was no significance in the time length of the treatment protocols. The revised protocol is therefore significantly more suitable because it reduces chances of excessive erythema discomfort and by reducing the radiation exposure doses the regimen also reduces the risk of skin malignancies...|$|E

Evaluation of the {{propylene}} glycol association on some {{physical and chemical}} properties of mineral trioxide aggregate. International Endodontic Journal, 45, 565570, 2012. Abstract Aim To evaluate the influence of {{propylene glycol}} (PG) on the flowability, setting time, pH and calcium ion release of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Methodology Mineral trioxide aggregate was mixed with different proportions of PG, as follows: group 1 : MTA + 100 % distilled water (DW); group 2 : MTA + 80 % DW and 20 % PG; group 3 : MTA + 50 % DW and 50 % PG; group 4 : MTA + 20 % DW and 80 % PG; group 5 : MTA + 100 % PG. The ANSI/ADA No. 57 was followed for evaluating the flowability and the setting time was measured by using ASTM C 266 - 08. For pH and calcium release analyses, 50 acrylic teeth with root-end cavities were filled with the materials (n = 10) and individually immersed in flasks containing 10 mL deionized water. After 3 h, 24 h, 72 h and 168 h, teeth were placed in new flasks and the water in which each specimen was immersed had its pH determined by a pH metre and the calcium release measured by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer with a calcium-specific hollow cathode <b>lamp.</b> <b>Data</b> were analysed by using one-way anova test for global comparison and by using Tukeys test for individual comparisons. Results The highest value of flowability was observed with MTA + 20 % DW and 80 % PG and the lowest values were found with MTA + 100 % DW. They were significantly different compared to the other groups (P < 0. 05). The presence of PG did not affect the pH and calcium release. The MTA + 100 % PG favoured the highest (P < 0. 05) pH and calcium release after 3 h. Increasing the PG proportion interfered (P < 0. 05) with the setting time; when used at the volume of 100 % setting did not occur. Conclusion The addition of PG to MTA-Angelus increased its setting time, improved flowability and increased the pH and calcium ion release during the initial post-mixing periods.

LED which is {{the main component of}} LED lamp has a very long lifetime. This means that no or very few failures are expected during LED lamp testing.
