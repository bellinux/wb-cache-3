METHODS: Human RPE cell line D 407 was treated by 100, 200, 400 μmol/L H 2 O 2 for 24 h and harvested to isolate total RNA by Trizol reagent. The expression difference of D 407 cell miRNA after processing of different concentrations was generated by Exiqon miRCURY LNA TM microRNA expression <b>profile</b> <b>chip</b> and the changes after processing of different concentrations were conducted by Hierarchical Clustering analysis. The results of chips were verified through Stem loop realtime PCR, and the target genes of identified miRNAs were predicted by bioinformatics software. RESULTS: Among the 1 425 known miRNAs listed on microarray, 367 miRNAs showed differential expression after H 2 O 2 treatment. The Treeview Clustering showed that 17 miRNAs, including miR- 31, were downregulated along {{with the increase of}} H 2 O 2 concentration. Meanwhile, 7 miRNAs, including miR 206, were upregulated. The results of qRT-PCR further validated the better results of microarray.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} material-geographic {{analysis of the}} materiality of log home manufacturing and {{may be the first}} quantitative application of ‘new materiality’ concepts. It tests the thesis that log home attributes reveal a manufacturer’s geographic region and building culture. A study of human-environment interaction, the research investigated the organization of log home manufacturing in the Eastern Woodlands of North America and illustrates relationships between manufacturers, their perspectives on forest resources and their choices of log conversion (i. e., processing) methods. Data were obtained from secondary sources and by surveying managers of log home manufacturing firms. Methods included hierarchical cluster analysis, spatial analysis using the standard deviational ellipse, a spatial statistic, in GIS, and multinomial logistic regression. The results support the conclusion that log conversion attributes do, in fact, identify manufacturers’ regions, their perspectives on their forest resources, and, by extension, their building cultures. Surprisingly, the regions correspond to those originally established by Native Americans hundreds of years ago. A manufacturer’s log acquisition methods, distances from timber supplies, timber performance requirements, influences on log conversion methods, and perceptions of market barriers to offering ‘green’ certified logs were predicted by a manufacturer’s log conversion methods. Manufacturers’ perspectives on environmental issues and geographic distances from their markets were not. A manufacturer’s timber inputs were found to have profound implications. Higher volume manufacturers were more likely to acquire their timber locally or nearby as raw logs and were more likely to produce regionally specific <b>log</b> <b>profiles.</b> Lower volume manufacturers were more likely to acquire their timber as cants from a greater distance and to produce a greater variety of <b>log</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R

30|$|As stated before, Cruz-Atienza et al. (2009) {{proposed}} Rc (the resolution distance) {{to evaluate}} the accuracy of Dc″. They proposed that Rc = 0.8 Vs Tc where Vs is the shear wave velocity and Tc is the breakdown time. Vs is 2.7  km/s taken from the <b>logging</b> <b>profile</b> of this station (NIED 2016 d). Tc was estimated at about 1.1  s from {{the time when the}} displacement started to accelerate until the peak ground velocity occurred (Fig.  4). Thus, in the present case, Rc becomes about 2.4  km. The distance from KMMH 16 to the fault is much smaller than this estimate (Fig.  2). Therefore, the present observations were done inside the Rc, and we consider that the estimated value has some meaning on the slip-weakening distance. At the very least, the present estimation suggests the upper bound of the slip-weakening distance.|$|R

While some techniques have been proposed to track calling context efficiently, they lack a reliable and precise decoding capability; or they work only un-der restricted conditions, that is, small programs without object-oriented programming or dynamic component loading. These short-comings have limited the application of calling context tracking in practice.

The technique thus enables calling context tracking {{in a wide variety}} of scenarios.

A synthetic sonic <b>log</b> <b>profile</b> obtained from multichannel seismic data from Site 583 showed that the apparently stratified layer has a lower seismic velocity than the overlying accreted sediments. This inver-sion strongly suggests that the pelagic layer is overpressurized because interstitial water cannot be released through the sedimentary overburden. When the accretion of trench-wedge turbidites proceeds, major thrust faults extending to the decollement are generated and the overpressurized pore water is able to escape to the seafloor through the faults. As a result, the thrust fault plane yields reflections with reversed polarity and the pelagic layer often has normal velocity dis-tribution beyond the major thrust zone...|$|R

An {{estimation of the}} Mincer wage equation using microdata of the Basic Survey of Wage Structure 2005 - 2008 reveals following six points as caveats. Wage profile is discontinuous at age 60 because of mandatory retirement. Wage rate, which is the dependent variable of the equation, should be log transformed. Educational attainments should be included as discrete dummy variables rather than a single index as the years of education. <b>Log</b> wage-potential experience <b>profiles</b> differ across educational backgrounds. <b>Log</b> wage-potential experience <b>profiles</b> are well approximated as quadratic functions. Log wage variance within a group defined by educational background and potential experience increases as the years of potential experience increases.

Moreover, their combined deregulation cooperated in modulating the hepatic tumor phenotype, implicating stem cell-like regulation of Myc-dependent miRs in poorly differentiated HBs. Importantly, a four-miR signature representative of these clusters efficiently stratified HB patients, and when applied to 241 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), it identified invasive tumors with a poor prognosis. Our data argue that Myc-driven reprogramming of miR expression patterns contributes to the aggressive phenotype of liver tumors originating from hepatic progenitor cells...|$|R
