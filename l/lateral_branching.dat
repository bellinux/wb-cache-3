50|$|During domestication, crop species undergo intense {{selective}} {{pressures that}} alter their genomes. The process of selection during domestication has largely focused on core traits {{that have come}} to define domesticated species. In seed or grain crops, these hallmark traits include increases in seed size, a reduction in natural seed dispersal, reduced <b>lateral</b> <b>branching,</b> and an annual life cycle. The genes that code for these traits have been elucidated in some species, such as the maize tb1 gene, which controls for <b>lateral</b> <b>branching,</b> using classical genetic techniques as well as genomics. However, traditional Mendelian genetics which examines inheritance patterns on an individual trait basis is limited to traits or phenotypes that cleanly segregate into distinct classes. Genomics is able to overcome this limitation through the comparison of the genomes of individuals exhibiting a trait or phenotype of interest to a reference genome which enables the identification differences between the two genomes such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), the movement of transposable elements (or retrotransposons) or deletions, among other genetic changes.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the genetic diversity of morphological traits in 121 genotypes of lima, red and pinto beans, and to study the relation between characters, and to get better understanding of factors affecting the interaction between characters by multivariate analysis, an experiment was conducted in 1997 as a simple lattice design at the Research Station of Agricultural College, Isfahan University of Technology. High variability was observed among genotypes for all characters studied. The phenotypic coefficients of variability were greater than the genotypic ones for all the traits. Among the characters studied seed yield, number of pods per <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> and main stem, length of <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> and main stem, number of nodes per <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> and main stem, 100 -seed weight and number of <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> had the highest genotypic and phenotypic variability, while days to maturity had the lowest variability. Traits relative to <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> were more variable than the same traits in the main stem. Factor analysis for all the genotypes and, separately, for lima, red, pinto, determinate and indeterminate genotypes revealed 4 factors which justified more than 78. 4 {{percent of the total}} variation. The results of the analysis based on all the genotypes showed that the first factor was mostly correlated to days to maturity, length of main stem and <b>lateral</b> <b>branches,</b> number of nodes per main stem and <b>lateral</b> <b>branches,</b> which was named “vegetative factor”. The second and third factors had the highest correlations with number of pods per main stem and <b>lateral</b> <b>branches,</b> number of seeds per pod in the main stem and branches and 100 -seed weight, which were named “yield component factors”. The fourth factor showed the highest correlation with number of <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> and was named for this trait. The first and fourth factors were related to vegetative growth characteristics and physiological source. The second and third factors were related to physiological sink. On the basis of stepwise regression analysis, number of pods per <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> was the most important component of yield, and number of pods per <b>lateral</b> <b>branches</b> and main stem had the next following ranks.

This promotes shoot growth, and restricts <b>lateral</b> <b>branching.</b> Cytokinin moves from the roots into the shoots, eventually signaling lateral bud growth. Simple experiments support this theory. When the apical bud is removed, the axillary buds are uninhibited, lateral growth increases, and plants become bushier.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the physiologic effectiveness of multi-site, multi-depth sacral <b>lateral</b> <b>branch</b> injections. Design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.

Interventions: Bilateral multi-site, multi-depth <b>lateral</b> <b>branch</b> green dye injections and subsequent dissection on two cadavers revealed a 91 % accuracy with this technique. Session 1 : 20 asymptomatic subjects had a 25 -g spinal needle probe their interosseous (IO) and dorsal sacroiliac (DSI) ligaments. The inferior dorsal SIJ was entered and capsular distension with contrast medium was performed. Discomfort had to occur with each provocation maneuver and a contained arthrogram was necessary to continue in the study. Session 2 : 1 week later; computer randomized, double-blind multi-site, multi-depth <b>lateral</b> <b>branch</b> blocks injections were performed. Ten subjects received active (bupivicaine 0. 75 %) and 10 subjects received sham (normal saline) multi-site, multi-depth <b>lateral</b> <b>branch</b> injections. Thirty minutes later, provocation testing was repeated with identical methodology used in session 1. Outcome measures: Presence or absence of pain for ligamentous probing and SIJ capsular distension. Results: Seventy percent of the active group had an insensate IO and DSI ligaments, and inferior dorsal SIJ vs 0 – 10 % of the sham group. Twenty percent of the active vs 10 % of the sham group did not feel repeat capsular distension. Six of seven subjects (86 %) retained the ability to feel repeat capsular distension despite an insensate dorsal SIJ complex. Conclusion: Multi-site, multi-depth <b>lateral</b> <b>branch</b> blocks are physiologically effective at a rate of 70 %. Multi-site, multi-depth <b>lateral</b> <b>branch</b> blocks do not effectively block the intra-articular portion of the SIJ. There is physiological evidence that the intra-articular portion of the SIJ is innervated from both ventral and dorsal sources. Comparative multi-site, multi-depth <b>lateral</b> <b>branch</b> blocks should be considered a potentially valuable tool to diagnose extra-articular SIJ pain and determine if <b>lateral</b> <b>branch</b> radiofrequency neurotomy may assist one with SIJ pain...|$|R

50|$|At first most of {{the early}} polysporangiophytes (land plants other than liverworts, mosses and hornworts) were placed in a single class, Psilophyta, {{established}} in 1917 by Kidston and Lang. As additional fossils were discovered and described, {{it became apparent that}} the Psilophyta were not a homogeneous group of plants. In 1968, Banks proposed splitting it into three groups, one of which was the subdivision Trimerophytina, informally called the trimerophytes. Psilophyton was a prominent member of this group. The distinction between main stems and strongly branched lateral stems evident in species such as P. forbesii has been considered {{to be one of the}} key steps towards the evolution of the leaves of euphyllophytes (modern members of which are the ferns and seed plants), based on the theory that such leaves evolved through 'webbing' of flattened <b>lateral</b> <b>branching</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|Foraging {{takes place}} almost {{exclusively}} at night. It {{is characterized by}} large numbers of wasps explosively departing from the nest, then quickly returning only to depart again in a similar fashion. As the night progresses there are moderate to heavy levels of return and departures by smaller groups of wasps. The foraging patterns of Apoica pallens are dependent on the moon’s cycle: when the moon is new or small, Apoica pallens forages during the first 4 hours after sunset, with another small peak of activity just before dawn as wasps return to the nest. When the moon is waxing, Apoica pallens extends the hours that it forages until individuals are out all night long. Over time, Apoica pallens have developed adaptations that have enhanced their vision allowing them to forage in these low light intensity conditions. These wasps have larger visual fields compared to those of relatives due to a greater diameter of the rhabdom,a rodlike structure in the eye that’s sensitive to light. A. pallens also have increased number of facets instead of larger facets of the eye, which has increased its relative eye size. Although these features help increase the wasp’s nocturnal vision, other factors not widely studied also contribute, such as the <b>lateral</b> <b>branching</b> of neurons in the first optic ganglion within the eye.|$|E

In maize (Zea mays), however, selection {{for a strong}} central stalk during domestication is attributed primarily to the Tb1 locus, leaving the architectural roles of SLs unclear. To determine how this signaling network is altered in maize, we ﬁrst examined effects of a knockout mutation in an essential SL biosynthetic gene that encodes CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE8 (CCD8), then tested interactions between SL signaling and Tb1. Comparative genome analysis revealed that maize depends on a single CCD8 gene (ZmCCD8), unlike other panicoid grasses that have multiple CCD8 paralogs. Function of ZmCCD8 was conﬁrmed by transgenic complementation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) max4 (ccd8) and by phenotypic rescue of the maize mutant (zmccd8::Ds) using a synthetic SL (GR24). Analysis of the zmccd8 mutant revealed a modest increase in branching thatcontrasted with prominent pleiotropic changesthat include (1) markedreduction in stem diameter, (2) reduced elongation of internodes (independent of carbon supply), and (3) a pronounced delay in development of the centrally important, nodal system of adventitious roots. Analysis of the tb1 zmccd8 double mutant revealed that Tb1 functions in an SL-independent subnetwork that isnot required for the other diverse roles of SL in development. Our ﬁndings indicate that in maize, uncoupling of the Tb1 subnetwork from SL signaling has profoundly altered the balance between conserved roles of SLs in branching and diverse aspects of plant architecture.(Jiahn Chou Guan*, Karen E.
