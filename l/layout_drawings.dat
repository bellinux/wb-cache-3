Uncoated films are preferred for archival, because there is then no possibility that the coating material could deteriorate over time or react with other materials.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} new linear-time {{algorithm}} {{to construct a}} rectilinear planar layout (horvert-representation, visibility representation) for a given planar graph. Our approach {{is based on the}} canonical representation of planar graphs and it is basically different from previous algorithms. If we direct the edges from lower-numbered vertices to higher-numbered vertices and there are n vertices out of which k vertices have out-degree greater than in-degree, then the maximum width of the constructed layout is. ∑i= 1 nmax{dout(vi), 0 }⩽ 2 n− 4 −(k− 2) ⩽ 2 n− 4, and the maximum height is h + 1 ⩽ n, where h is length of the longest directed path. We discuss the selection of a good canonical numbering to be used when constructing layouts. We also show how our algorithm can be applied to compute planar layouts for planar graphs using other drawings for vertices than horizontal segments. In these <b>layouts</b> the <b>drawings</b> for vertices may have arbitrary nonequal sizes and shapes...|$|R

5000|$|Poe was {{preoccupied with}} entombment. Many of his {{characters}} have been incarcerated {{in some form}} or other - in coffins, brick walls or under floorboards. We came up with the 'taped' man - a mummy-like figure who is wrapped, not in bandages, but in 2" [...] recording tape. This motif is partially horror-like, as well as being 'entombed', and the 2" [...] tape appropriately suggests that the album is done by a producer in a studio, as opposed to a band recording material they will play on stage. Although the clients were intrigued by this idea they did not desire a pictorial cover but preferred instead a precise graphic representation. The narrow strip of illustration from George Hardie shows a long shadow of the taped man.The booklet (attached {{to the inside of the}} cover) is composed of photos related to the songs, and line drawings which explore the taped man as he thrashes about in his restricted world and strives to unravel himself. The illustrated capital letters continue the idea. The <b>layout</b> and <b>drawings</b> are by Colin Elgie. The sleeve is one of our better attempts at combining photographs and illustration.|$|R

40|$|Graphs {{are widely}} and {{effectively}} used abstractions for organizing and visualizing information. In this paper {{we present a}} graph data structure for representing trees and a drawing framework for positioning the nodes such that {{the result is a}} planar radial <b>layout.</b> Radial <b>drawings</b> make good use of the screen space. An XML-based file format for the storing of graph data is presented. The design of the file format achieves data abstraction amongst its layers separating the data and the application. We use an object-oriented algorithmic paradigm. Classes with low cohesion that emphasize scalability and efficiency are produced. A prototype application is presented to test and exhibit the design. The framework and data structures are used to create a radial drawing application for a web-based course storyboard. The radial drawing is a graphical representation {{of the structure of the}} web-based course that can be used in the design of the course as well as used as the actual site map. In the prototype, the node structure is not the traditional point used by most graph-drawing applications but rather a complex structure with its own internal structure. A novel specialized design layout for these node structures in which the readability of text-based labels is maximized is offered. This adds to the data abstraction of the design, facilitating the reuse of layout information and improving the overall efficiency. The algorithms are linear with O (n) complexity. Through navigation of the site and interaction with the drawing, the user can alter the focus of the graph as required. This recentering of the graph incorporates animation features for dynamic graph drawing. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Tables are a {{ubiquitous}} form of communication. While {{everyone seems}} to know what a table is, a precise, analytical definition of “tabularity ” remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text <b>layouts,</b> and schematic <b>drawings</b> share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Most past research has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from raster images of tables scanned from printed documents, although there is growing interest in the processing of tables in electronic form as well. Recent research on table composition and table analysis has improved {{our understanding of the}} distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. This review, which is structured in terms of generalized paradigms for table processing, indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display...|$|R
