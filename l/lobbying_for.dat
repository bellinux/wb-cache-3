5|$|In May 1941, David Stirling, {{an injured}} British forces Commando in the North Africa theatre, {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} small airborne special forces units to operate behind enemy lines. Whilst <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> support within Middle East Command it came to Clarke's attention, who offered his backing provided the force {{could also be used}} to help his own deception schemes.|$|E

5|$|Conjectures {{regarding}} extraterrestrial {{life have}} ensured a high-profile for Europa and {{have led to}} steady <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> future missions. The aims of these missions have ranged from examining Europa's chemical composition to searching for extraterrestrial life in its hypothesized subsurface oceans. Robotic missions to Europa need to endure the high-radiation environment around itself and Jupiter. Europa receives about 5.40 Sv of radiation per day.|$|E
5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by former Denver Broncos head coach Dan Reeves, who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, Reeves took {{the unusual step of}} <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> the job. After being rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, {{during the}} Second World War, the {{building}} was destroyed by an incendiary bomb in the London Blitz. Despite much <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> the hall to be rebuilt, the government decided against doing so.

5|$|In Thailand, however, {{substantial}} {{efforts to}} prevent further such occurrences had not materialized {{in the months following}} the accident. Labour activists, trade unions and workers were <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> the creation of an independent occupational health and safety institute. Social critics pointed out that the accident, along with several prior disasters such as the Kader toy factory fire, was part of a trend in which the country's rapid industrialization resulted in increasing health and environmental hazards due to poor regulations and lack of official willingness to tackle the issue.|$|E
5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil embargo against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Because the United States imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, the embargo had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began demanding {{a solution to the}} problem, and President Richard Nixon began <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least a part of the answer.|$|E
5|$|Revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 {{after three}} priests—Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora (collectively known as Gomburza)—were accused of sedition by colonial {{authorities}} and executed. This would inspire a propaganda movement in Spain, organized by Marcelo H. del Pilar, José Rizal, and Mariano Ponce, <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> political {{reforms in the}} Philippines. Rizal was eventually executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion. As attempts at reform met with resistance, Andrés Bonifacio in 1892 established the secret society called the Katipunan, who sought independence from Spain through armed revolt.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{contributing}} factor may be lobbying by earlier immigrants.

5|$|The mid-20th century brought {{change to}} Riverside and Avondale, {{including}} {{the construction of}} Interstate 95 and the Fuller Warren Bridge, the establishment of St. Vincent's Medical Center, {{and the construction of}} office buildings along Riverside Avenue. Through this time, a number of Riverside and Avondale's historic buildings were demolished or allowed to decay. Neighborhood advocates fought this trend by forming a historic preservation organization, Riverside Avondale Preservation, in 1974, and <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> the creation of historic districts in the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|After {{the coup}} on 1 November 1963, in which Diệm and Nhu were killed the {{following}} day, Thơ was appointed Prime Minister by Minh's military junta five days later, on 6 November 1963. He {{was the leading}} civilian in the provisional government overseen by the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC).

Ramachandran, {{in a bid}} to {{influence}} voters prior to the Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1989. The decision was criticised for awarding Ramachandran before independence activist B. R. Ambedkar and Vallabhbhai Patel, who were bestowed the honour in 1990 and 1991 respectively. While Ravi Shankar was accused of <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> the award, the decision by Indira Gandhi to posthumously honour K. Kamaraj was considered to have been aimed at placating Tamil voters for the Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1977. The seventh Prime Minister V. P. Singh was criticised for posthumously honouring B. R. Ambedkar to please Dalits.|$|E
5|$|Joy Smith, Member of Parliament (MP) for Kildonan—St. Paul {{with the}} Conservative Party, put forward motion C-153 in February 2007 {{to put in}} place a Canada-wide action plan to combat human trafficking, and the House of Commons passed the motion unanimously. Thomas Axworthy of the Toronto Star said that the {{unanimity}} of this decision demonstrated that the Harper government was just as dedicated to opposing human trafficking as was Barack Obama, President of the United States. Early promoters of a Canadian anti-trafficking action plan hoped for up to $100 million in funding, which they argued would turn Canada into a world leader in the fight against human trafficking. World Vision Canada began <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> a national human trafficking action plan in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Leeds City had {{finished}} 19th in the Second Division {{in the season}} preceding Chapman's arrival, and were facing re-election. Chapman played an essential part in <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> the side's readmission and Leeds City were duly re-elected. That done, Chapman signed new talent such as Jimmy Speirs from Bradford City and despite some erratic performances – losing 6–0 in between two 5–1 wins, for example – City finished sixth in 1912–13, Chapman's first season. Attendances rose at Elland Road from 8,500 to 13,000 in his first year, as Chapman's attacking side scored 70goals, the second-highest total in the entire division.|$|E

5|$|Since 2008, the zoo {{has been}} <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> {{a permit to}} build an eagle {{sanctuary}} {{in order to be}} able to distribute the animals' feathers to tribal members for ceremonial purposes in accordance with federal law. Since the species are listed as endangered, any remains of dead animals are confiscated by the federal government and transported to a central repository in Colorado; members of Native American Indian nations then have to apply individually to receive parts, such as feathers, in a lengthy process with wait-times that can exceed several years. Since a tribally operated eagle sanctuary constitutes an exception to the process, it would be instrumental in strengthening Navajo cultural sovereignty; currently, only the Iowa and Zuni nations operate eagle sanctuaries for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|The 1971 Local Government White Paper {{proposed}} abolishing county boroughs, {{which would}} have left Plymouth, a town of 250,000 people, being administered from a council based at the smaller Exeter, {{on the other side}} of the county. This led to Plymouth <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> the creation of a Tamarside county, to include Plymouth, Torpoint, Saltash, and the rural hinterland. The campaign was not successful, and Plymouth ceased to be a county borough on 1 April 1974 with responsibility for education, social services, highways and libraries transferred to Devon County Council. All powers returned when the city become a unitary authority on 1 April 1998 under recommendations of the Banham Commission.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a period}} of renewed <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> a road {{crossing}} in the 1920s and 1930s, at which time the only vehicle crossing was a single passenger and vehicle ferry. Sir William Denny championed the expansion of that service in the 1930s, providing and operating on behalf of the London and North Eastern Railway two additional ferries that aimed to supplement the services of the adjacent railway bridge. Their success allowed for the addition of two more craft in the 1940s and 1950s, by which time the ferries were making 40,000 crossings annually, carrying 1.5 million passengers and 800,000 vehicles.|$|E
