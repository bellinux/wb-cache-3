Power gating and body biasing {{are widely used}} for standby <b>leakage</b> <b>control.</b> Their large energy overhead for performing mode transition is the major obstacle for more aggressive <b>leakage</b> <b>control.</b> Temperature and process variation (TV/PV) further magnify the overhead problem, leading to socalled “corner case <b>leakage</b> <b>control</b> ” problem. Light-Weight Vth Hopping (LW-VH) is a candidate technique to tackle the energy overhead problem. This paper demonstrates the application of LW-VH on microarchitectural- and RTL-level idleness exploitation with adaptive control techniques for TV/PV compensation. Adaptive LW-VH shows 30 % average saving on total CPU leakage at microarchitectural level, and 4 % to 15 % leakage saving at RTL level.

40|$|Wind-driven air {{infiltration}} {{has been recognized}} among the major reasons for energy loss in buildings, and the impact to energy efficiency under steady conditions has been reported and issued as part of many building codes. The nearly zero-energy building demand makes uncontrolled leakage paths even more undesired and creates {{the need for further}} investigation of their behavior under unsteady wind conditions. The present numerical study examines the role of wind gustiness on instantaneous infiltration rates of a low-rise building. For this purpose, two levels of gust frequency Ω have been simulated, expressed as a sinusoidal factor in the wind profile formula. In parallel, a ratio α is employed to represent seven different cases of external leakages distribution, while five scenarios of compartmentalization and internal leakages shows the impact of the latter on the dynamics of building air exchange rates. The results indicate that higher wind gustiness results in higher ACH, marking out gusts as a potential critical factor under unsteady climate conditions. The infiltration rates shown in relation to the leakage distribution ratio α provide arguments for the importance of the detailed detection of external leakages while the comparison of the different internal-volume-scenario highlights the key-role of internal <b>leakages</b> <b>control</b> towards a drastic reduction of infiltration rates...|$|R
