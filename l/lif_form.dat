Maintenance of SSCs and or induction of in vitro spermiogenesis may provide a therapeutic strategy to treat male infertility. Objective: This study investigated the role of luekemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on the propagation of SSCs and both functions of Sertoli cells on the proliferation and differentiation of these cells. Materials and Methods: SSCs were sorted from the testes of adult male mice by magnetic activated cell sorting and thymus cell antigen 1 antibody. On the other hand, isolated Sertoli cells were enriched using lectin coated plates. SSCs were cultured on Sertoli cells for 7 days in the absence or presence of LIF. The effects of these conditions were evaluated by microscopy and expression of meiotic and post meiotic transcripts by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Results: Our data showed that SSCs co-cultured with Sertoli cells in the presence of <b>LIF</b> <b>formed</b> colonies on top of the Sertoli cells. These colonies had alkaline phosphatesase activity and expressed SSCs specific genes. SSCs were enjoyed limited development after the mere removal of LIF, and exhibiting expression of meiotic and postmeiotic transcript and loss of SSCs specific gene expression (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Our findings represent co-culture of SSCs with Sertoli cells provides conditions that may allow efficient proliferation and differentiation of SSCs for male infertility treatment. ...|$|R
40|$|Li-O- 2 cells {{composed}} of a carbon cathode containing an alpha-MnO 2 nanowire catalyst and a Kynar (PVDF-HFP) binder were cycled with different electrolytes containing 0. 5 M LiB(CN) (4) salt in polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (PEGDME) or tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (Tetraglyme) solvents. All cells exhibited fast capacity fading. To explain this, the surface chemistry of the carbon electrodes were investigated by synchrotron based hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) using two photon energies of 2300 and 6900 eV. It is shown that the LiB(CN) (4) salt and Kynar binder were degraded during cycling, forming a layer {{composed of}} salt and binder residues on the cathode surface. The degradation mechanism of the salt differed in the two tested solvents and, consequently, different types of boron compounds were formed during cycling. Larger amounts of the degraded salt was observed using Tetraglyme as the solvent. With a nonfluorined Li-salt, the observed formation of LiF, which might be {{a reason for the}} observed blockage of pores in the cathode and for the observed capacity fading, must be due to Kynar binder decomposition. The amount of <b>LiF</b> <b>formed</b> in the PEGDME cell was larger than that formed in the Tetraglyme cell.

Lithium-poly(carbon monofluoride) [Li-(CF) n] cells and batteries offer very high specific energies practical values of about 600 W. h/g and a theoretical maximum value of 2, 180 W. h/kg. However, because Li-(CF) n cells and batteries cannot withstand discharge at high rates, they have been relegated to niche applications that involve very low discharge currents over times of the order of hundreds to thousands of hours. Increasing the discharge capacities of Li- (CF) n batteries while maintaining high practical levels of specific energy would open new applications for these batteries. During the discharge of a Li-(CF) n cell, one of the electrochemical reactions causes LiF to precipitate at the cathode.

This approach {{is in contrast}} to conventionally used high-temperature thermal doping processes, which require multistep patterning processes to produce diffusion masks. Both MoOx and LiF thin films are inserted between the Si absorber and Al electrodes interdigitatedly at the rear cell surfaces, facilitating effective carrier collection at the MoOx/Si interface and suppressed recombination at the Si and LiF/Al electrode interface. With optimized MoOx and LiF film thickness as well as the all-back-contact design, our 1 -cm 2 Si nanohole solar cells exhibit a conversion efficiency of up to 15. 4 %, with an open-circuit voltage of 561 mV and a fill factor of 74. 6 %. In particular, because of the significant reduction in Auger/surface recombination as well as the excellent Si-nanohole light absorption, our solar cells exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 83. 4 % for short-wavelength light (~ 400 nm), resulting in a dramatic improvement (54. 6 %) in the short-circuit current density (36. 8 mA/cm 2) compared to that of a planar cell (23. 8 mA/cm 2).

Some results of this research at a prior stage were summarized in Increasing Discharge Capacities of Li(CF) n Cells (NPO- 42346), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 32, No. 2 (February 2008), page 37. A major difference between the present and previously reported results is that now there is some additional focus on improving performance at temperatures from ambient down to as low as 40 C. To recapitulate from the cited prior article: During the discharge of a Li-(CF) n cell, one of the electrochemical reactions causes LiF to precipitate at the cathode. LiF is almost completely insoluble in most non-aqueous solvents, including those used in the electrolyte solutions of Li- (CF) n cells. LiF is electrochemically inactive and can block the desired transport of electrons at the cathode, and, hence, the precipitation of <b>LiF</b> can <b>form</b> an ever-thickening film on the cathode that limits the rate of discharge. An anion-receptor electrolyte additive helps to increase the discharge capacity in two ways: It renders LiF somewhat soluble in the non-aqueous electrolyte solution, thereby delaying precipitation until a high concentration of LiF in solution has been reached. When precipitation occurs, it promotes the formation of large LiF grains that do not conformally coat the cathode. The net effect is to reduce the blockage caused by precipitation of LiF, thereby maintaining a greater degree of access of electrolyte to the cathode and greater electronic conductivity...|$|R
40|$|A facile {{approach}} to the surface modification of spinel LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 (LNMO) cathode active materials for high-voltage lithium ion batteries is demonstrated. This strategy is based on nanoarchitectured polyimide (PI) gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) coating. The PI coating layer successfully wrapped a large area of the LNMO surface via thermal imidization of 4 -component (pyromellitic dianhydride/biphenyl dianhydride/phenylenediamine/oxydianiline) polyamic acid. In comparison to conventional metal oxide-based coatings, distinctive features of the unusual PI wrapping layer are the highly continuous surface coverage with nanometre thickness (similar to 10 nm) {{and the provision of}} facile ion transport. The nanostructure-tuned PI wrapping layer served as an ion-conductive protection skin to suppress the undesired interfacial side reactions, effectively preventing the direct exposure of the LNMO surface to liquid electrolyte.

Combined use of in-house X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and soft and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) enabled nondestructive depth profiling at four different probing depths in the 2 - 50 nm range. Cells cycled with PMS and LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) were compared to a reference sample cycled without PMS. In the first cycle, PMS cells showed a higher irreversible capacity, which is explained by formation of a thicker solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). After three cycles, the SET thicknesses were determined to be 19 and 25 nm for the reference and PMS samples, respectively. After the initial cycling, irreversible losses shown by the PMS cells were {{lower than those of}} the reference cell. This could be attributed to a different SET composition and lower differences in the amount of lithium between lithiated and delithiated electrodes for the PMS sample.

Even at these resonances the reaction probability is relatively high, starting at a value about 30 % and increasing rapidly to > 90 % with increasing energy. This implies the tunneling through the barrier. The reason for the high efficiency in the photoinitiated reaction is that the main excitation corresponds to the HF (or DF) stretch within the complex, which is the >active> mode for the reaction in agreement with the presence of a late barrier. These results are very different from those obtained in Li+HF or Li+DF collisions at the same total energies, the reaction probabilities being much lower in these latter since the excitation of the HF (DF) mode is unlikely to occur during the collision. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.

40|$|Seals are, arguably, {{the single}} most {{important}} component in any complex machine. Seals maintain lubrication and prevent the ingestion of contaminants into bearing surfaces, allowing high tolerance components to function reliably. Consequently, the performance of seals can be directly linked to the performance, life span and reliability of virtually all equipment of any complexity. Investigation of the failure of these components due to external contaminants ingestion and lubrication breakdown is of particular importance. To facilitate the study of the lubricant behavior, a unique non-invasive two-dimensional optical technique which allows instantaneous measurement of the lubricating film thickness and temperature was developed. The technique is based on the use of Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF). In its simplest <b>form,</b> <b>LIF</b> has a number of limitations and shortcomings. In the past, it has been mostly used as a tracer for qualitative purposes, seeing limited use as a quantitative tool. This stems primarily from the dependence of fluorescence on exciting light intensity, rendering the emission useful only as a tagging indicator. In order to use the fluorescent emission as a signal for highly accurate quantitative measurements, a dual emission ratiometric approach that suppresses excitation intensity information was implemented. The concept is to use one emission as the carrier of the desired information, while the other emission provides the excitation intensity information. (cont.) Film temperature measurements require optically thin conditions and a strong dependence on temperature of one fluorescent emission. Film thickness measurements were performed using an innovative approach that requires an optically thick fluorescence system that portrays reabsorption of one fluorescent emission. Alluding to this requisite, the new technique was termed Emission Reabsorption Laser Induced Fluorescence (ERLIF) and along with the temperature measurement approach they are presented and discussed {{in the first part of}} this thesis. The second part of this thesis addresses the particulars of the investigation carried out on rotating shaft seals, in specific on the particle ingestion mechanics that lead to the failure of these components.

Abstract The possibility of detecting high quality images of materials, devices and biological samples {{in the soft}} and hard X-ray spectral ranges with high spatial resolution and contrast and by using simple exposing configuration is a topical task nowadays. For this purpose, we propose the use of versatile imaging detectors based on the radiation sensitivity of {{lithium fluoride}} (LiF) to extreme ultraviolet, soft and hard X-rays [1, 2]. X-rays generate stable point defects in LiF, known as colour centres (CCs), which emit broad-band photoluminescence at visible wavelengths under optical pumping. The high dynamic response of the material to the received dose together with the atomic scale of the CCs make <b>LiF</b> plates, in <b>form</b> of thin films or crystals, extremely attractive as high-spatial-resolution radiation-imaging detectors both in absorption and phase contrast imaging configurations [1, 3]. The latent images are subsequently read by using optical fluorescence microscopes, which {{in the case of}} advanced techniques can reach spatial resolutions well below 100 nm [4]. We present lensless imaging experiments in projection mode at the TOPO–TOMO beamline of the synchrotron light source Anka (Karlsruhe, Germany) by using LiF crystals and thin films irradiated in the energy range 6 – 40 keV. Stable fluorescent images were <b>formed</b> in <b>LiF</b> detectors by scattered X-rays after an object had been positioned between the X-ray source and the detectors. The object used in this work is the commercial test pattern X 500 - 200 - 30 (Xradia, Pleasanton, CA, USA) consisting of a gold mask (thickness 3 m) deposited on a (500  500) μm 2 Si 3 N 4 window (thickness 330 nm). The LiF detectors were crystals and 1 m thick polycrystalline films deposited on glass substrates. To imprint the X-ray image of the sample on the LiF detectors, the test pattern was irradiated with several exposure times between 1 s and 60 s. The X-ray micro-radiographies were optically read with a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM, Nikon Eclipse 80 i-C 1) operating in fluorescence mode. It is worth pointing out that a 1 m LiF film was able to store high-quality and well contrasted fluorescence images of the test pattern, although X-ray attenuation length in LiF varies between 0. 02 - 12 mm for X-ray energies in the investigated range. The stored images show edge-enhancement effects that are ascribable to diffraction processes occurring during the X-ray beam propagation after its interaction with the sample. A computer simulation was performed to calculate the incoming X-ray intensity distribution across the detector. A fairly good agreement with experimental data evidences a linear optical fluorescence response of LiF-film based detectors under the investigated conditions. This linear behaviour has been confirmed by measurements of the PL signals of F 2 and F 3 + CCs detected with a CLSM system for several X-ray irradiation times. Further investigations are in progress to study the exploitation of solid-state LiF detectors for X-ray lensless projection imaging experiments and applications. References [1]	G. Baldacchini, F.

A first part was dedicated to the deposition of cathodes in thin film form of aknown material, LiCoO 2, and an alternative one, Li(NiMnCo) O 2 employing physical vapordeposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), respectively. Results on thedeposition of LiCoO 2 showed how after cycling there is a reduction of rate capability andincrease in interface resistance. The X-ray diffraction pattern showed the presence of severalorientations related to the known HT phases found in literature for LiCoO 2 with lowcrystallinity. On the other hand Li(NixMnyCoz) O 2 thin films prepared via aerosol assistedCVD were analyzed with X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement using the March-Dollasemodel for the determination of the texturing and microstructural characteristics. Additionallythe morphology of the films was characterized using scanning electron microscopy. Theinvestigation showed that concentration of precursor solution and process pressures have asignificant effect on the film morphology and texturing. A second part was focused on the cathode-electrolyte interface for three case studies: 1) asdeposited LiCoO 2 cathode thin film, 2) ZrO 2 coated LiCoO 2 thin film and 3) LiPON coatedLiCoO 2 thin film. The interface cathode-electrolyte of these three cases were studied beforeand after galvanostatic cycling to determine surface layer characteristics and changes arisingon the interface after battery operation. The interface of a bare LiCoO 2 layer was furtherstudied after soaking in liquid electrolyte to elucidate the effect of short storage procedures inbatteries. Surface analysis done on LiCoO 2 thin films showed changes occurring at the interface layersafter the electrode was in short contact with the electrolyte solution and after galvanostaticcycling. Washing and soaking the electrode material in electrolyte and solvent showed thatsurface reactions start from the first contact. A main component of the electrolyte solution,LiPF 6, has critical effect since it can decompose and form HF which reacts with carbonatesand <b>forms</b> <b>LiF</b> on the surface. Given the large amount of LiF, a high reactivity of LiCoO 2 withthe decomposed species was observed, as the main components of the film were related to thedecomposed LiPF 6 salt. The surface chemistry of the layer formed on LiCoO 2 after cycling was mainly based ondecomposed species from the electrolyte salt arising from carbonated and fluorinated species. Artificial surface layers were deposited on LiCoO 2 by means of rf sputtering. The thin layersof ZrO 2 and LiPON used as coatings had minor effects on the original film morphology andcrystalline structure. An XPS analysis of the interface showed how the nature of each layerafter galvanostatic cycling was different for each case. The resulting artificial surface layerformed from ZrO 2 coating showed mainly inorganic species, while the LiPON coatedcathode showed an organic nature. The final surface layers after electrochemical cycling ofthe ZrO 2 coated film resembled that of the uncoated LiCoO 2. Additionally, LiPON thin films were studied on the basis of structural changes occurringwith nitrogenation and its correlation to a possible mechanism during ion conduction. Composition of phosphate glasses with rf sputtering was proven to be greatly influenced bythe gas ratio employed. The largest variations were observed for lower amounts of N 2 in thegas mixture. The IR spectra results showed important differences in the short range order forfilms with a similar amount of lithium. The lithium phosphorus oxynitride films depositedhere presented glassy structures with mainly ortho and pyro-phosphate units with smallamounts of short metaphosphate chains. Nitrogen insertion favors stability of lithium bygiving an environment with lower potential energy, as was evidenced by the far-IR results.

Les résultats (LiCoO 2) ont montrés comment, après cyclage, il y a diminutionde la capacité à cycler à régime rapide et augmentation de la résistance à l’interface. Ladiffraction des rayons X a montré la présence de différentes orientations, peu cristallisées,appartenant à la phase LiCoO 2 HT selon confirmation par la littérature. Les couches mincesde Li(NixMnyCo 1 -x-y) O 2 ont été préparées par dépôt chimique en phase vapeur assisté paraérosol. La diffraction des rayons X et l’analyse Rietveld utilisant le modèle March-Dollase aété mise en oeuvre pour la détermination de la texture et des caractéristiques microstructurales. La morphologie des films a été caractérisée par microscopie électronique à balayage. L’étudea montré que la concentration de la solution de précurseur et la pression totale ont un effetmajeur sur la morphologie des films et leur texture. Une seconde partie s’est focalisée sur l’interface cathode-électrolyte pour trois cas d’étude : 1) couche mince de matériau de cathode LiCoO 2, 2) couche mince de LiCoO 2 recouvert de ZrO 2 et 3) couche mince de LiCoO 2 recouvert de LIPON. L’interface cathode-électrolyte de cestrois cas d’étude a été étudiée avant et après cyclage galvanostatique afin de déterminer lescaractéristiques de la couche de surface et les changements provenant à l’interface lors dufonctionnement de l’accumulateur. L’interface des couches minces de LiCoO 2 a été étudiéeplus en détail après trempage dans un électrolyte liquide afin de comprendre l’effet desprocédures de stockages courts dans les accumulateurs. De plus, les couches minces de LiPON ont été étudiées sur la base de changementsstructuraux se produisant avec la nitruration et sa corrélation à un possible mécanisme ayantlieu durant la conduction ionique...|$|R
