50|$|The {{foundation}} for the present-day church was laid in 1869; its cornerstone was laid on May 14, 1870. Construction on the upper story, delayed for financial reasons, began in 1873. The completed church was dedicated on August 27, 1876, {{making it one of}} the oldest churches remaining in downtown Indianapolis. The total cost of the new church was estimated at $128,000, including the <b>lot,</b> <b>structure,</b> interior decoration, and an organ. The building debt was not repaid until 1900. Roberts Park church was the site of a series of historic revivals In 1881, 1886, and 1896. The congregation also established several women's groups during this time, including the Woman's Home Missionary Society (1895) and the Women's Social and Business Union (1894). The church's youth alliance became an Epworth League in 1888.|$|E

50|$|The {{full-time}} booth is {{near the}} center of the mezzanine. There are three staircases to the street on all corners of Queens Boulevard and Jackson Avenue except the northern one. There is an outside passageway to two more staircases on the southern and western corners of Jackson Avenue and West Street at the south endm near a former booth. The old-style change booth was in place until it was removed in 1998. Two of the outside entrances were redone to match the facade of the DOT indoor parking <b>lot</b> <b>structure</b> when it was constructed in 1975. Before the renovation, the station had a full length mezzanine (inside and outside of fare control) with three booths. Since then, this area has balconies that allow views of local trains and platforms down below. There are three staircases to each platform from that end. Two staircases in between both fare control areas were removed during the renovation process. The part-time booth has two stairs to the northwest and southeast corners of Northern Boulevard at 41st Avenue, and one to each platform.|$|E

Bidders can neither propose different network configurations nor can they submit bids {{on a group}} of network links. We believe the market itself can be designed better. We present a <b>lot</b> <b>structure</b> and an auction design where bidders might propose and build different network configurations and where bidding for packages is a possibility. We demonstrate why the auction design in this paper should be considered for future network procurement exercises through an example, inspired by UK offshore electricity transmission assets, to illustrate our idea...|$|E
40|$|We propose an elevation-based {{approach}} to parking <b>lot</b> <b>structure</b> analysis from aerial imagery. In contrast to image-based methods, {{the new approach}} treats parked vehicles as 3 -D microstructures and attempts to locate them in the elevation domain. The STME (Surface Texture and Microstructure Extraction) system {{is applied to the}} elevation map to extract the 3 -D microstructures. A hybrid application of this system to both intensity and elevation maps results in a complete extraction of individual vehicles. Based on a comparison of texture exploitation techniques, a WCC (weighted combination criterion) algorithm is presented to generate a clean parking lot ground surface, which facilitates visualization and simulation of parking lot activities {{with a high degree of}} visual realism...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years the Québec City {{agglomeration}} has been subject to numerous transformations despite the city's rather mediocre economic development and a rate of increase of population which is lower than that of most large cities of Canada. These transformations present differing characteristics in the various sectors of the city and of its suburbs. The central zone of the agglomeration, where the population is decreasing, has been the locale of rather extensive urban renewal despite the many problems posed by historic buildings and an outmoded <b>lot</b> <b>structure.</b> A second zone, termed « peripheral » by the writer, contains the areas exhibiting the greatest increase of population of the agglomeration ; this zone is characterised by a disorderly spatial structure, typical of recently urbanised areas. Finally, the third zone, termed sub-urban, gives the appearance of having been subjected to the minimum amount of change. Here, however, farms are rapidly disappearing as a result of land speculation and incipient urbanisation...|$|E

40|$|Examining committee: Marc Schlossberg, chair, Yizhao YangAll around Eugene {{there is}} parking <b>lot</b> <b>structures</b> that remain {{partially}} unoccupied {{for the vast}} majority of time. These parking lots have a major influence on the shape of a city and are in part responsible for the downfalls associated with car usage Ã¢ environmental degradation, traffic congestion, traffic accidents, physical fitness, health, etc. In the last twenty years, some lots have incorporated drive-thru coffee stores occupying some parking spots near the ingress/egress zone. The emergence of these stores has not been widely covered and there is scarce literature about this phenomenon. In the city of Eugene there are nearly twenty stores, with the most recent one opened in May, 2008. This study examines the emergence of drive-thru coffees stores in Eugene and poses several questions to be answered: are drive-thru coffee stores evidence of an exaggerated off-street parking supply? Are these stores pioneers into a redevelopment process of converting parking <b>lots</b> into different <b>structures</b> with higher end uses? This paper tries to find answers for these questions from the perspectives of store managers, lot owners and city officials...|$|R
40|$|A basic {{research}} project regarding cartographic, cadastral and archive documents for {{the preparation of}} reconstruction maps of cities in Sardinia The {{basic research}} project entitled “Development of methods {{for the production of}} medieval and modern reconstruction plans of cities in Sardinia: computerized analysis of <b>lot</b> <b>structure</b> and urban evolution of historic settlements” enabled us to embark upon a course of study of the cartographic materials regarding cities in Sardinia. Among the goals of the project is the development of materials that can be useful for analytical and critical readings of the region’s historic urban heritage. The medieval origins, still to be studied partly in relation to design components and the form of the dwelling units, represent an interesting sampling of Italian and Mediterranean cultures. The reorganization of cartographic documents, developed in accordance with current research methodologies, provides some new insights into urban structure using computerized data processing procedures that can be useful both for developing new studies {{as well as for the}} preservation of urban and landscape heritage...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is mainly divided in two parts. In the first part we study the problem of distributed averaging, which has attracted {{a lot of interest}} in the research community in recent years. Our work focuses on the issues of implementing distributed averaging algorithms on peer-to-peer networks such as the Internet. We present algorithms that eliminate the need for global coordination or synchronization, as many other algorithms require, and show mathematical analysis of their convergence. Discrete-event simulations that verify the theoretical results are presented. We show that the algorithms proposed converge rapidly in practical scenarios. Real-world experiments are also presented to further corroborate these results. We present experiments conducted on the PlanetLab research network. Finally, we present several promising applications of distributed averaging that can be implemented in a wide range of areas of interest. The second part of this thesis, also related to peer-to-peer networking, is about modelling and understanding peer-to-peer file sharing. The BitTorrent protocol has become one of the most popular peer-to-peer file sharing systems in recent years. Theoretical understanding of the global behavior of BitTorrent and similar peer-to-peer file sharing systems is however not very complete yet. We study a model that requires very simple assumptions yet exhibits a <b>lot</b> <b>structure.</b> We show that it is possible to consider a wide range of performance criteria within the framework, and that the model captures many of the important issues of peer-to-peer file sharing. We believe the results provide fundamental insights to practical peer-to-peer file sharing systems. We show that many optimization criteria can be studied within our framework. Many new directions of research are also opened up...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} the {{settlement}} of the North Shore region of the Gulf St. Lawrence {{can be divided into}} five stages : the periodical visits of Basque and Breton fishermen from the XIV th to the XVII th century ; the repeated concessions from 1653 to about 1820 of coast sectors to companies, such as the Hudson Bay Co., and merchants of Québec who hold exclusive rights of occupation and exploitation ; the foundation of most of the existing agglomerations between 1836 and 1865 when settlers gather around sawmills between Tadoussac and Baie-Trinité and fishermen from the south shore of the Gulf, the Magdalen Islands, Newfoundland and the Channel Islands, sometimes after a long association with the exploitation of the coastal fisheries, establish some 20 hamlets and villages between Sept-lies and Blanc-Sablon ; the consolidation of the population, parallel to the growth of the pulp and paper industry up to the advent of the second world war ; the mass immigration brought about by the mining developments in the 1950 's. Various conditions have influenced the distribution of the population and given rise to different types of settlement. These conditions have been : the hold of the wood and pulp companies on the land and the labour force, the absence of industrial diversification in any one sector of the region or, in other words, the over-specialization of the economic activities, the proper requirements of those activities, the particular conditions of the land tenure and of the <b>lot</b> <b>structure</b> and, to a lesser extent, the social background of the immigrants. The settlement outlook is thus as follows. From Tadoussac to Natashquan, the habitat is differenciated : the largest communities have grown at the points of transhipment where man and merchandise journey to and fro, that is near deep sheltered bays ; the villages depending on the export of pulpwood are all sited {{at the mouth of the}} rivers and show small but dense concentrations of population ; when agriculture dominates, the « rang » System of rural settlement is prevalent ; below Sept-lies, the population concerned with fishing bas settled in small nuclei at short distance from its fisheries. From Kegashka to Blanc-Sablon, the inhabitants are individualistic, dwell on Crown Lands — often as squatters — and keep jealously to their self-appropriated fishing spots, whence their dispersion. In the backcountry, the mining towns of Schefferville, Wabush, Labrador and Gagnon bear witness of the conceptions that presided to their elaboration...|$|E

50|$|Local governments often pass {{zoning laws}} which control what {{buildings}} {{can be built}} on a lot {{and what they can}} be used for. For example, certain areas are zoned for residential buildings such as houses. Other areas can be commercially, agriculturally, or industrially zoned. Sometimes zoning laws establish other restrictions such as a minimum lot area and/or frontage length for building a house or other building, maximum building size, or minimum setbacks from a lot boundary for building a structure. This is in addition to building codes which must be met. Also minimum lot sizes and separations must be met when wells and septic systems are used. In urban areas, sewers and water lines often provide service to households. There may also be restrictions based on covenants established by private parties such as the real estate developer. There may be easements for utilities to run water, sewage, electric power, or telephone lines through a lot.Something which is meant to improve the value or usefulness of a lot can be called an appurtenance to the <b>lot.</b> <b>Structures</b> such as buildings, driveways, sidewalks, patios or other pavement, wells, septic systems, signs, and similar improvements which are considered permanently attached to the land in the lot are considered to be real property, usually part of the lot but often parts of a building, such as condominiums, are owned separately. Such structures owned by the lot owner(s), as well as easements which help the lot owners or users, can be considered appurtenances to the lot. A <b>lot</b> without such <b>structures</b> can be called a vacant lot, urban prairie, spare ground, an empty lot, or an unimproved or undeveloped lot.|$|R
