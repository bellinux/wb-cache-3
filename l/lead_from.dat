5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated {{blood lead}} level can lead to miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood. Lead is able {{to pass through the}} placenta and into breast milk, and {{blood lead level}}s in mothers and infants are usually similar. A fetus may be poisoned in utero if <b>lead</b> <b>from</b> the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.|$|E

5000|$|When Palmer's major roadway system {{first started}} {{to develop in}} the 18th century, it was {{dictated}} largely by the trails leading from Easton to outlying communities. William Penn Highway, the first road built in Palmer in around 1755, led from Easton to Bethlehem. Likewise, Freemansburg Avenue <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> Easton to Freemansburg; Old Nazareth Road <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> Easton to Nazareth; Tatamy Road <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> Easton to Tatamy; and Hecktown Road and the Newburg Pike <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> Seipsville to the Hecktown and Newburg communities. Greenwood Avenue, which runs between Freemansburg Avenue and William Penn Highway, was opened in the 1960s. At the time, township Supervisor President H. Robert Daws said, [...] "The opening of this north-south artery {{in the center of}} the township benefits not only the township, but the whole area." ...|$|R

5|$|Entering the race, {{the only}} two drivers still in {{contention}} for the IndyCar Championship were Ganassi's Franchitti and Penske's Power. Franchitti was 18 points ahead of Power, retaking the championship points <b>lead</b> <b>from</b> him with a second-place finish at the 2011 Kentucky Indy 300 two weeks prior. Power was still mathematically in the points race despite an awful finish at Kentucky, but needed to finish far ahead of Franchitti {{in order to win}} the championship title.|$|E
5|$|External staircases. Most villas and palazzi were {{designed}} for formal entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street façade, leading to a courtyard within. An intricate double staircase would <b>lead</b> <b>from</b> the courtyard to the piano nobile. This would be the palazzo's principal entrance to the first-floor reception rooms; the symmetrical flights of steps would turn inwards and outwards {{as many as four}} times. Owing to the topography of their elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps; these steps were often transformed into long straight marble staircases, in themselves decorative architectural features (illustration 19), in the manner of the Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E

5|$|Hélio Castroneves, the {{defending}} champion of the Indy Japan 300, won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying. In the race, Wheldon gained the <b>lead</b> <b>from</b> Castroneves on lap 44 and led {{for more than half}} of the 200 laps, but a pit stop with 14 laps remaining forced him to relinquish the top position. Kanaan took the lead because of a late pit stop by Dixon, and held off a late challenge by Wheldon to secure first place.|$|E
5|$|In 1685, the Duke of Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion {{in which}} Somerset people fought against James II.

They were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last battle fought on English soil.
