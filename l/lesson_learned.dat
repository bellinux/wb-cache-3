When multiple carrier divisions were operating together, the divisions' air groups were combined.

His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth.

[...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief.
