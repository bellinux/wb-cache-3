60|$|Mr. Blotton was ejected but not conquered. He {{also wrote}} a pamphlet, {{addressed}} to the seventeen <b>learned</b> <b>societies,</b> native and foreign, containing a repetition of the statement he had already made, and rather more than half intimating his opinion that the seventeen <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> were so many 'humbugs.' Hereupon, the virtuous indignation of the seventeen <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> being roused, several fresh pamphlets appeared; the foreign <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> corresponded with the native learned societies; the native <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> translated the pamphlets of the foreign <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> into English; the foreign <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> translated the pamphlets of the native <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> into all sorts of languages; and thus commenced that celebrated scientific discussion so well known to all men, as the Pickwick controversy.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the view {{that has long been}} fashionable in related policies and literature that the establishment of the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> is a necessary response to changing times. This article suggests that the association between the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> and current change may be defensible but is limited. The justification of the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> should be expanded beyond that association, and the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> should be promoted as a good in its own right. This article begins with an exploration of the phenomenon of change, which has been the primary argument for the establishment of the <b>learning</b> <b>society.</b> Then, it examines the claim that the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> is essential. Finally, I suggest that discussions of the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> should shift from the current paradigm of justification based on external relationships to an appreciation of the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> in its own right.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>learning</b> <b>societies</b> {{is the issue}} of issues of the 21 st century. Every social issue — such as poverty, peace, justice, developm nt, the environment — will necessarily require collective learning for solution. The better we understand the process of collective learning the more able will we be to address our collective problems. Collective learning about collective learning is high-order learning and should be our first priority. The collective meta-cognitive task will be aided by clarification of concepts and terms about the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> and collective <b>learning.</b> The phrase “learning society ” is used differently by different thinkers. In a related domain, the term “organizational learning ” has been defined in so many different ways that discussion sometimes becomes blurred as different participants think they are talking about the same thing when they are not. 1 In an eff rt to avoid confounding different conceptions of <b>learning</b> <b>societies,</b> it would help to identify characteristics or dimensions that distinguish varieties of <b>learning</b> <b>societies.</b> Here I will suggest two such dimensions. CONCEPTIONS OF A LEARNING SOCIETY ON THE INDIVIDUAL —SUPRA-INDIVIDUAL DIMENSION One dimension by which conceptions of the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> may be classified is by {{the degree to which a}} <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> refers to <b>learning</b> that involves a) changes in individuals, and b) change...|$|R

25|$|The Society of Science, Letters and Art, {{also known}} as the Society of Science or SSLA, was a soi-disant <b>learned</b> <b>society</b> which flourished between 1882 and 1902.

25|$|The Library Company's {{example was}} soon imitated {{in other cities}} along the Atlantic coast, from Salem to Charleston.

When John Penn, making up for his slow start, sent an air-pump to the <b>learned</b> <b>society</b> in 1739, the directors, to house it commissioned a glazed cabinet, the earliest extant example of American-made Palladian architectural furniture. Rooms {{on the second floor}} of the newly finished west wing of the State House (now Independence Hall) housed the Library and its collections: there Franklin and his associates performed their first experiments in electricity during the 1740s. Later Benjamin West sent the mummified hand of an Egyptian princess.|$|E
25|$|Distinct trends exist {{regarding}} conservation development. While many countries' {{efforts to}} preserve species and their habitats have been government-led, {{those in the}} North Western Europe tended to arise out of the middle-class and aristocratic interest in natural history, expressed {{at the level of}} the individual and the national, regional or local <b>learned</b> <b>society.</b> Thus countries like Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, etc. had what we would today term NGOs – in the shape of the RSPB, National Trust and County Naturalists' Trusts (dating back to 1889, 1895 and 1912 respectively) Natuurmonumenten, Provincial Conservation Trusts for each Dutch province, Vogelbescherming, etc. – a long time before there were national parks and national nature reserves. This in part reflects the absence of wilderness areas in heavily cultivated Europe, as well as a longstanding interest in laissez-faire government in some countries, like the UK, leaving it as no coincidence that John Muir, the Scottish-born founder of the National Park movement (and hence of government-sponsored conservation) did his sterling work in the USA, where he was the motor force behind the establishment of such NPs as Yosemite and Yellowstone. Nowadays, officially more than 10 percent of the world is legally protected in some way or the other, and in practice, private fundraising is insufficient to pay for the effective management of so much land with protective status.|$|E
