5000|$|Artist Patrick J. Reynolds {{was born}} in New Orleans in 1963 where he began his long and {{distinguished}} career. At age 11 he began winning awards and receiving {{the respect of the}} elite of the art world. Having unlimited styles at his disposal in the art community of New Orleans, Patrick decided early on to not conform to any of them, Instead, carving out his own way creating a style never before seen.Today, Patrick is the only artist in the United States to maintain graphite block and limestone suspended in oil. As he developed the medium over time, graphite figurative romanticism was born. And one could easily say that his art will be carved into the history books and studied for generations to come.Today, Patrick pushes the envelope of his style, forever exploring the stories that can be told through art. The signature style remains evident in every new <b>layout</b> <b>drawing</b> or final masterpiece. [...] "The passion is the same" [...] says Patrick. [...] "It's a burning desire to begin a piece that has already been completed in my head. It must materialize, it must come to life."."Fanciful or not, the winged beings tell the tales that course through Reynolds' soul and spring from his fingertips." [...] Says [...]Patrick begins his pieces by grinding graphite and limestone into boiled linseed oil and varying thickness on his palette. He then uses a brush to swirl the mixture onto the board creating both texture and form. The result becomes a rock hard fine art that will last for centuries.Art collectors {{from all walks of life}} describe the work as moving, and that is what it is intended to do, move you. Rarely, if ever, does it match the couch or the curtains. Patrick's work falls into the category of generational collections. Found in some of the most prestigious corporate and family collections in the world.As a published author, of his art and writings such as Principals of Peace, Patrick continues work on new projects such as Journey of Dreams, a new book due out this summer, and Tears of a Dreamer, a book based on the philosophies of Patrick Reynolds works. Known for painting notable art works as [...] "Heavens Hues America". An angel bows her head over an American flag and weeps. And [...] "Eternal Embrace", the piece depicting two people becoming one.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{business}} market environment has got very dynamic and volatile character. The financial and economy crisis in 2008 influenced all industrial branches and their supply chains {{in a great}} deal. Competitiveness across global markets is evident in many ways such as cost, quality or time delivery. The industrial companies must manage all processes in their inner and outer supply chains thru their integrated logistics management systems. General logistics management system of a company is composed of subsystems which can be classified as purchasing, manufacturing, warehousing, packaging, distribution and reverse material flows management. One of the logistics objectives is to plan, to manage and to control all rising material flows inside particular mentioned subsystems. Thus, the foundation of effective logistics management system is <b>layout</b> <b>drawing</b> documentation in required detail.
