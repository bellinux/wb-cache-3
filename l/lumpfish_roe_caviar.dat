25|$|Important fish include {{sturgeon}} (yielding its <b>roe</b> for <b>caviar),</b> bream, whitefish, salmon, mullet, carp, catfish, perch, and roach. More than 200 {{species of}} fish {{are found in the}} Persian Gulf, 150 of which are edible, including shrimps and prawns.|$|R
50|$|Eggs laid by many {{different}} species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, {{have probably been}} eaten by mankind for millennia. Popular choices for egg consumption are chicken, duck, <b>roe,</b> and <b>caviar,</b> but {{by a wide margin}} the egg most often humanly consumed is the chicken egg, typically unfertilized.|$|R

40|$|The lipid {{profile of}} Sturgeon <b>roe</b> (<b>caviar)</b> was {{monitored}} by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI(+) -MS), thermal imprinting easy ambient sonic-spray ionization mass spectrometry (TI-EASI(+) -MS) and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI(+) -MS). Freshly salted and commercially salted pasteurized caviar samples of Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) were stored either at + 4 degrees C {{or at room}} temperature for 4 weeks. The different types of chemical information achieved by these MS techniques were compared: MALDI(+) -MS detects mainly phospholipids (PL) whereas TI-EASI(+) -MS allows monitoring of both triacylglycerols (TAG) and PL. ESI(+) coupled to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance high resolution mass spectrometer (FT-ICR-MS) and MS/MS experiments were used to fully characterize the detected lipids, ensure the absence of oxidation products in the degradation process and confirm the high efficiency of the thermal imprinting extraction. TI-EASI(+) -MS, via a more comprehensive profiling and easier operation, has therefore been demonstrated to provide caviar lipidomic profiles and discriminate its changes as a function of storage time and temperature. The data have also confirmed that hydrolysis is the main process of lipid degradation in caviar...|$|R

50|$|Excursion Inlet was {{originally}} an Alaska Native village. Excursion Inlet {{has had a}} fishing cannery since 1891. The current plant, constructed in 1918, still functions to this day. It mostly processes pink and chum salmon, as well as salmon <b>roe,</b> salmon <b>caviar,</b> halibut and sablefish. It is located {{near the mouth of}} the inlet, about 40 mi west of Juneau.

5000|$|As {{with most}} caviars, Beluga is usually handled with a caviar spoon made of mother of pearl, bone, or other {{non-metallic}} material, as metal utensils tend to impart an unwelcome metallic taste to the delicate and expensive <b>roe.</b> [...] Beluga <b>caviar</b> is usually served by itself on toast, unlike other less expensive caviars {{that can be}} served {{in a variety of}} ways, including hollowed and cooked new potatoes, on a blini, or garnished with sour cream, crème fraîche, minced onion or minced hard boiled egg whites. These items can, however, be served with Beluga as palate cleansers.|$|R
5000|$|The Caspian Sea had {{not always}} been {{the only source of}} caviar. Beluga {{sturgeon}} were common in the Po river in Italy in the 16th century, and were used to produce caviar.Cristoforo da Messisbugo in his book Libro novo nel qual si insegna a far d'ogni sorte di vivanda, Venice, 1564, at page 110, gave the first recorded recipe in Italy about extraction of the eggs from the <b>roe</b> and <b>caviar</b> preparation [...] "to be consumed fresh or to preserve".The writer and voyager Jérôme Lalande in his book [...] "Voyage en Italie", Paris, 1771, vol. 8 page 269, noted that many sturgeon were caught in the Po delta area in the territory of Ferrara.In 1753 a diplomatic war broke out between the Papal States, governing the Ferrara territory, and the Venetian Republic about sturgeon fishing rights in the Po river, the border between the two states. From about 1920 and until 1942 there was a shop in Ferrara, named [...] "Nuta" [...] from the nickname of the owner Benvenuta Ascoli, that processed all the sturgeons caught in the Po river for caviar extraction, using an elaboration of the original Messisbugo recipe, and shipped it to Italy and Europe. Production was sporadically continued by a new owner until 1972, when sturgeon stopped swimming up the Po river. Since 2015, some sturgeon have reappeared in the Po.|$|R
25|$|The culinary {{traditions of}} Roman times lived {{on in the}} Byzantine empire. Inherited from Greek traditions {{was the use of}} olives and olive oil, wheat bread, and plenty of fish. These would very often be served or {{prepared}} with garós, the Greek term for garum, a sauce made out of fermented fish that was so popular that it more or less replaced salt as the common food flavoring. The Byzantine kitchen was also influenced by Arab cuisine from which it imported the use of eggplants and oranges. Seafood was very popular and included tuna, lobster, mussels, oysters, murena, and carp. Around the 11th century the habit of eating <b>roe</b> and <b>caviar</b> was also imported from the Black Sea region. Dairy products were consumed in the form of cheese (particularly feta), and nuts and fruits such as dates, figs, grapes, pomegranates, and apples. The choice of meats were lamb, and several wild animals like gazelles, wild asses, and suckling young in general. Meat was often salted, smoked or dried. Wine was popular, like elsewhere around the Mediterranean, and it was the drink of choice among the higher social classes, where sweet wines like Muscat or Madeira/Malmsey were popular. Among the lower classes, the common drink tended to be vinegar mixed with water. Like all Christian societies the Byzantines had to abide by the dietary restrictions of the church, which meant avoiding meats (and preferably general excesses) on Wednesdays and Fridays and during fast and Lent.|$|R

[...] Enzyme-assisted hydrolysis of shrimp heads and female <b>lumpfish</b> after <b>roe</b> extraction was carried out. Of the enzymes considered (Alcalase, Neutrase and Trypsin), Alcalase was the most efficient in producing protein hydrolysates with desired degree of hydrolysis (DH) and highest nitrogen recovery (NR). Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the hydrolysis conditions using Alcalase for shrimp heads and lumpfish proteins. A polynomial regression model was used to predict the optimum conditions for the process, these were 58 °C at pH 8. 1 and enzyme/substrate concentration ratio of 33. 1 AU/kg crude protein for shrimp protein hydrolysis for a predicted DH of 17. 8 %. The optimum hydrolysis conditions for lumpfish protein, as predicted by the regression model, were temperature, 63 °C; pH. 8. 1 : and enzyme/substrate concentration ratio. 28. 5 AU/kg crude protein for a DH of 18. 4 %. Nitrogen recovery in shrimp and lumpfish protein hydrolysates prepared under optimum hydrolysis conditions were 72. 2 and 79. 9 %, respectively. The regression coefficient (R²) values which were > 0. 95 and the close values of experimental hydrolysis results to those predicted, indicated the adequacy of the models employed. The total amino acid composition of the prepared shrimp and lumpfish protein hydrolysates were similar to those of their starting materials. However, over a 14 -fold increase in the content of free amino acids was noted in these protein hydrolysates. Furthermore unique functional characteristics of the hydrolysates with respect to moisture and fat adsorption, emulsifying capacity, emulsion stability, among others, were noted. Addition of 3 % (w/w) shrimp protein hydrolysate to mechanically deboned chicken meat (MDCM) resulted in cooking yield and drip volume of 118 % and 5. 3 mL/ 100 g, respectively, as compared with 76 % and 10. 6 mL/ 100 g for the control. These effects of the addition of shrimp protein hydrolysates compare favourably with those obtained for commonly used phosphates (sodium tripolyphosphate, trisodium pyrophosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate) in food. The protein hydrolysates also displayed antioxidant activity in a meat model system by inhibiting the formation of 2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and in a β-carotene/linoleate emulsion system by delaying the bleaching of β-carotene. Sephadex G- 15 column separation of the peptides of shrimp protein hydrolysate afforded 5 fractions based on their absorbance at 220 and 280 nm, with fraction IV being most antioxidatively active.

The number and concentration of volatile compounds from hydrolysate 1 (DH, 11. 2 %) and hydrolysate 2 (DH, 17. 1 %), only differed marginally.
