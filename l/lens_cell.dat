50|$|Galactosemia, a rare {{metabolic}} disorder characterized by decreased ability to metabolize galactose, {{can be caused}} by a mutation in any of the three enzymes in the Leloir pathway. Galactokinase deficiency, also known as galactosemia type II, is a recessive {{metabolic disorder}} caused by a mutation in human galactokinase. About 20 mutations have been identified that cause galactosemia type II, the main symptom of which is early onset cataracts. In lens cells of the human eye, aldose reductase converts galactose to galactitol. As galactose is not being catabolized to glucose due to a galactokinase mutation, galactitol accumulates. This galactitol gradient across the <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> membrane triggers the osmotic uptake of water, and the swelling and eventual apoptosis of lens cells ensues.|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study is to probe the {{mechanical}} properties of individual eye <b>lens</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from nucleus and cortex of adult sheep eye lens, and to characterize the effect of cytoskeletal drugs. METHODS. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM), featuring a spherical tip at the end of a soft cantilever, to indent single <b>lens</b> <b>cells,</b> and measure the Young's modulus of isolated nuclear and cortical <b>lens</b> <b>cells.</b> Measurements were performed under basal conditions, and after addition of drugs that disrupt actin filaments and microtubules. RESULTS. We found that single <b>lens</b> <b>cells</b> were able to maintain their shape and mechanical properties after being isolated from the lens tissue. The median Young's modulus value for nuclear <b>lens</b> <b>cells</b> (4. 83 kPa) was ~ 20 -fold higher than for cortical <b>lens</b> <b>cells</b> (0. 22 kPa). Surprisingly, disruption of actin filaments and microtubules did not affect the measured Young's moduli. CONCLUSIONS. We found that single <b>cells</b> from the <b>lens</b> nucleus and cortex can be distinguished unambiguously using the elastic modulus as a criterion. The uncommon maintenance of shape and elastic properties after cell isolation together with the null effect of actin filaments and microtubules targeting drugs suggest that the mechanical stability of fiber cells is provided by cellular elements other than the usual cytoskeletal proteins.

50|$|The Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP) of {{the human}} lens of the eye (Aqp0), after which the MIP family was named, {{represents}} about 60% of the protein in the <b>lens</b> <b>cell.</b> In the native form, it is an aquaporin (AQP), but during lens development, it becomes proteolytically truncated. The channel, which normally houses 6-9 water molecules, becomes constricted so only three remain, and these are trapped in a closed conformation. These truncated tetramers form intercellular adhesive junctions (head to head), yielding a crystalline array that mediates lens formation with cells tightly packed as required to form a clear lens. Lipids crystallize with the protein. Ion channel activity has been shown for Aquaporins 0, 1, and 6, Drosophila 'Big Brain' (bib) and plant Nodulin-26.

40|$|AbstractThe actin {{cytoskeleton}} has {{the unique}} capability of integrating signaling and structural elements to regulate cell function. We {{have examined the}} ability of actin stress fiber disassembly to induce <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation {{and the role of}} actin filaments in promoting <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> survival. Three-dimensional mapping of basal actin filaments in the intact lens revealed that stress fibers were disassembled just as lens epithelial cells initiated their differentiation in vivo. Experimental disassembly of actin stress fibers in cultured lens epithelial cells with either the ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632, which destabilizes stress fibers, or the actin depolymerizing drug cytochalasin D induced expression of <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation markers. Significantly, short-term disassembly of actin stress fibers in lens epithelial cells by cytochalasin D was sufficient to signal <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. As differentiation proceeds, lens fiber cells assemble actin into cortical filaments. Both the actin stress fibers in lens epithelial cells and the cortical actin filaments in lens fiber cells were found to be necessary for cell survival. Sustained cytochalasin D treatment of undifferentiated lens epithelial cells suppressed Bcl- 2 expression and the cells ultimately succumbed to apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of Rac-dependent cortical actin organization induced apoptosis of differentiating lens fiber cells. Our results demonstrate that disassembly of actin stress fibers induced <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, and that actin filaments provide an essential survival signal to both lens epithelial cells and differentiating lens fiber cells...|$|E

The dynamics of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum were also studied in digitonin-permeabilized bovine cells. Results. Tissue-cultured bovine and human <b>lens</b> <b>cells</b> have very similar resting calcium levels (235 ± 22 nM and 216 ± 12 nM, respectively).

FVB/N and C 57 BL/ 6 x SJL F 2 hybrid transgenic mice were assayed for CAT activity in the lens, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, liver, cerebrum, and muscle. F 0, F 1, and F 2 mice from multiple lines carrying single mutations of the DE- 1 or alpha A-CRYBP 1 sites showed high levels of CAT activity in the lens, but not {{in any of the}} non-lens tissues. By contrast, despite {{activity of the}} wild-type promoter, none of the mutant promoter/CAT constructs were active in the transiently transfected and stably transformed <b>lens</b> <b>cells.</b> The mice carrying transgenes with either site-specific mutations in both the DE- 1 and alpha A-CRYBP 1 sites or a deletion of the entire DE- 1 and part of the alpha A-CRYBP 1 site (- 60 /+ 46) fused to the CAT gene did not exhibit CAT activity above background in any of the tissues examined, including the lens. Our results thus indicate that the DE- 1 and alpha A-CRYBP 1 sites are functionally redundant in transgenic mice. Moreover, the present data coupled with previous transfection and transgenic mouse experiments suggest that this functional redundancy is confined to lens expression within the mouse and is not evident in transiently transfected and stably transformed <b>lens</b> <b>cells,</b> making the cultured <b>lens</b> <b>cells</b> sensitive indicators of functional elements of crystallin genes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies showed}} that lens {{epithelial}} cells proliferate rapidly in the embryo and that a lens mitogen, most likely derived from the blood, {{is present in the}} anterior chamber of the embryonic eye (Hyatt, G. A., and Beebe, D. C.,Development 117, 701 – 709, 1993). Messenger RNAs for several growth factor receptors have been identified in embryonic lens epithelial cells. We tested several growth factors that are ligands for these receptors for their ability to maintain <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation. Embryo serum, PDGF, GM-CSF, and G-CSF maintained <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, but NGF, VEGF, and HGF did not. This and a previous study (Potts, J. D., Harocopos, G. J., and Beebe, D. C.,Curr. Eye Res. 12, 759 – 763, 1993) detected members of the Janus kinase family (Jaks) in the developing lens. Because Jaks are central players in the Jak-STAT-signaling pathway, we identified STAT proteins in the lens and tested whether they were phosphorylated in response to mitogens. STAT 1 and STAT 3, but not STAT 5 were detected in chicken embryo lens epithelial cells. Only STAT 3 was found in terminally differentiated lens fiber cells. STAT 1 and STAT 3 were phosphorylated in lens cells analyzed immediately after removal from the embryo and when lens epithelial explants were treated with embryo serum, PDGF, or GM-CSF, but not with NGF. Chicken embryo vitreous humor or IGF- 1, factors that stimulate <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, but not proliferation, did not cause STAT phosphorylation. When lens epithelial cells were cultured for 4 h in unsupplemented medium, STAT 1 and STAT 3 declined to nearly undetectable levels. Treatment with PDGF or embryo serum for an additional 15 min restored STAT 1 and - 3 levels. This recovery was blocked by cycloheximide, but not actinomycin D, suggesting that STAT levels are regulated at the level of translation. STAT levels were maintained in epithelial explants by lens mitogens, but not by factors that stimulated lens fiber differentiation. Both factors that stimulated <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and those that caused fiber differentiation protected cultured lens epithelial cells from apoptosis. These data suggest that the factor(s) responsible for <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> proliferationin vivoactivates the Jak–STAT-signaling pathway. They also indicate that growth factors maintain STAT protein levels in lens epithelial cells by promoting the translation of STAT mRNA, an aspect of STAT regulation that has not been described previously.

The CHAMP concept also has potential for diverse terrestrial applications that could include remotely controlled or robotic geological exploration, prospecting, field microbiology, environmental surveying, and assembly- line inspection. A CHAMP (see figure) would include two lens cells: (1) a distal cell corresponding to the objective lens assembly of a conventional telescope or microscope and (2) a proximal cell that would contain the focusing camera lens assembly and the camera electronic image-detector chip, which would be of the active-pixel-sensor (APS) type.

In this study, we have investigated the role of heparan sulfate in lens specific signaling by generating a conditional ablation of heparan sulfate modification genes, Ndst 1 and Ndst 2. In this mutant, N-sulfation of heparan sulfate was disrupted after the lens induction stage, resulting in reduced <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, increased cell death and defective lens fiber differentiation in later lens development. The loss of Ndst function also prevented the assembly of Fgf/Fgfr complexes on the <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> surface and disrupted ERK signaling within the lens. We further demonstrated that Ndst mutation completely inhibited the FGF 1 and Fgf 3 overexpression phenotypes, but Kras reactivation was sufficient to reverse the Ndst deficient lens differentiation defect.

40|$|Posterior capsule {{opacification}} (PCO) commonly develops following cataract {{surgery and}} is a wound-healing response that can ultimately lead to secondary visual loss. Improved management of this problem is required. The isothiocyanate, sulforaphane (SFN) is reported to exert cytoprotective and cytotoxic actions and the latter may be exploited to treat/prevent PCO. SFN concentrations of 10 µM and above significantly impaired wound-healing in a human lens capsular bag model. A similar pattern of response was also seen with a human <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> line, FHL 124.

40|$|The murine alpha B-crystallin gene (a {{member of}} the small heat shock protein family) is {{expressed}} constitutively at high levels in the lens and at lower levels in many other tissues, including skeletal muscle. We have previously used the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter fused to the human growth hormone gene to identify an alpha B-crystallin enhancer at positions - 427 to - 259 that has high activity in muscle and low activity in <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> lines. In the study reported here, we performed DNase I footprinting, transfection, mutagenesis, and electrophoretic mobility shift experiments using the murine C 2 C 12 muscle and alpha TN 4 - 1 <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> lines and the rabbit N/N 1003 A <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> line to identify sequences responsible for activity of this enhancer. Enhancer activity in both the muscle and lens cells was dependent on novel elements called alpha BE- 1 (- 407 to - 397), alpha BE- 2 (- 360 to - 327), and alpha BE- 3 (- 317 to - 306). These elements were also weakly occupied by nuclear proteins in L 929 cells, which appear to express the alpha B-crystallin gene at a very low level (detectable only by the polymerase chain reaction). A fourth element containing a consensus muscle regulatory factor-binding site called MRF (- 300 to - 288) was occupied and used only by the C 2 C 12 muscle cells. Cotransfection in NIH 3 T 3 cells and antibody-gel shift experiments using C 2 C 12 nuclear extracts indicated that MyoD, myogen, or a similar member of this family can activate the alpha B-crystallin enhancer by interaction with the MRF site. Taken together, we conclude that the alpha BE- 1, alpha BE- 2, and alpha BE- 3 elements are shared by both lens and muscle cells, but the MRF element is used only in muscle cells, providing the first example of a muscle-specific control element in a crystallin gene...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{prevention}} of the posterior capsule opacification is still unsolved. To interfere with proliferating cells the T-type calcium channel antagonist Mibefradil was immobilized in poly-lactic-co-glycolic-acid micro particles which were fixed at a capsular tension ring and {{tested in a}} human organ culture model {{as well as in}} human <b>lens</b> <b>cells</b> HLE-B 3 in vitro. It is feasible to get a release significantly affecting cell viability and growth evaluated by MTT test and cell cycle analysis. In addition, Bionas ® sensor chips were used for time-dependent adhesion experiments in living <b>lens</b> <b>cells.</b> Interestingly, the concentration of Mibefradil which inhibited subconfluent cells is not effective in confluent cells.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Cell shape {{changes and}} {{signaling}} pathways {{are essential for}} the development and function of the lens. During lens development proliferating epithelial cells will migrate down to the equator of the lens, differentiate into <b>lens</b> fiber <b>cells,</b> and begin to elongate along the lens capsule. The Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathway has been extensively studied for its role in <b>lens</b> fiber <b>cell</b> differentiation and elongation. However, the main mediators of FGF stimulated <b>lens</b> fiber <b>cell</b> elongation have not been identified. Adaptor proteins Crk and CrkL are SH 2 - and SH 3 -containing proteins that transduce signals from upstream tyrosine phosphorylated proteins to downstream effectors, including Ras, Rac 1 and Rap 1, which are important for cell proliferation, adhesion and migration. Underlying their diverse function, these two adaptor proteins have been implicated in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, focal adhesion assembly, and cell shape. To explore the role of Crk and CrkL in FGF signaling-dependent lens development and fiber elongation, we employed Cre/LoxP system to generate a lens specific knockout of Crk/CrkL. This led to extracellular matrix defects, disorganization of the <b>lens</b> fiber <b>cells,</b> and a defect in <b>lens</b> fiber <b>cell</b> elongation. Deletion of Crk and CrkL in the lens also mitigated the gain-of-function phenotype caused by overexpression of FGF 3, indicating an epistatic relationship between Crk/CrkL and FGF signaling during <b>lens</b> fiber <b>cell</b> elongation. Further studies, revealed that the activity of Crk and CrkL in FGF signaling {{is controlled by the}} phosphatase Shp 2 and the defect observed in <b>lens</b> fiber <b>cell</b> elongation can be rescued by constitutive activation of the GTPases Ras and Rac 1 in the Crk and CrkL mutant lens. Interestingly, the deletion of the GTPases Rap 1 in the lens showed no obvious phenotype pertaining to <b>lens</b> fiber <b>cell</b> elongation. These findings suggest that Crk and CrkL {{play an important role in}} integrating FGF signaling and mediating <b>lens</b> fiber <b>cell</b> elongation during <b>lens</b> development...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Integrins {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{to play a major}} role in lens morphogenesis. To determine the role of β 1 -integrin and its down-stream signaling partner, integrin linked kinase (ILK), in lens morphogenesis, eyes of WT mice and mice with a nestin-linked conditional knockout of β 1 -integrin or ILK were analyzed for defects in lens development. Mice, lacking the genes encoding the β 1 -integrin subunit (Itgb 1) or ILK (Ilk), showed a perinatal degeneration of the lens. Early signs of lens degeneration included vacuolization, random distribution of <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei, disrupted fi ber morphology and attenuation and separation of the lens capsule. The phenotype became progressively more severe during the fi rst postnatal week even-tually leading to the complete loss of the lens. A more severe phenotype was observed in ILK mutants at similar stages. Eyes from embryonic day 13 β 1 -integrin-mutant embryos showed no obvious signs of lens degeneration, indicating that mutant lens develops normally until peri-recombination. Our fi ndings suggest that β 1 -integrins and ILK cooperate to con-trol <b>lens</b> <b>cell</b> survival and link lens fi bers to the surrounding extracellular matrix. The assembly and integrity of the lens capsule also appears to be reliant on integrin signaling within lens fi bers. Extrapolation of these results indicates a nove...|$|E

40|$|Lens-specific {{expression}} of the delta 1 -crystallin gene is governed by an enhancer in the third intron, and the 30 -bp-long DC 5 fragment {{was found to be}} responsible for eliciting the lens-specific activity. Mutational analysis of the DC 5 fragment identified two contiguous, interdependent positive elements and a negative element which overlaps the 3 '-located positive element. Previously identified ubiquitous factors delta EF 1 bound to the negative element and repressed the enhancer activity in nonlens cells. Mutation and cotransfection analyses indicated the existence of an activator which counteracts the action of delta EF 1 in <b>lens</b> <b>cells,</b> probably through binding site competition. We also found a group of nuclear factors, collectively called delta EF 2, which bound to the 5 '-located positive element. delta EF 2 a and -b were the major species in <b>lens</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas delta EF 2 c and -d predominated in nonlens cells. These delta EF 2 proteins probably cooperate with factors bound to the 3 '-located element in activation in <b>lens</b> <b>cells</b> and repression in nonlens cells. delta EF 2 proteins also bound to a promoter sequence of the gamma F-crystallin gene, suggesting that delta EF 2 proteins are involved in lens-specific regulation of various crystallin classes...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{study in}} vivo human <b>lens</b> {{epithelial}} <b>cell</b> proliferation on the anterior surface of PMMA implants and its interaction with postoperative blood-aqueous barrier breakdown in eyes undergoing cataract surgery. METHODS: A prospective study {{was carried out}} on three consecutive patient cohorts undergoing cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation using three different surgical techniques which produce different anatomical relations between the implant and lens capsule. Specular microscopy of the anterior implant surface was used to document the natural history, topography, and density of <b>lens</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> and the laser flare and cell meter were used to measure postoperative blood-aqueous barrier breakdown. RESULTS: All groups showed <b>lens</b> epithelial <b>cell</b> proliferation onto the anterior surface of PMMA implants. This was initiated by and restricted to the region of anterior capsule-implant contact and decreased {{with the onset of}} anterior capsular opacification. Significant correlation was found in all groups between <b>lens</b> epithelial <b>cell</b> proliferation and postoperative blood-aqueous barrier breakdown. CONCLUSIONS: Human <b>lens</b> epithelial <b>cell</b> behaviour on PMMA surfaces in vivo differs from that seen in culture studies. Humoral factors in the aqueous, biomaterial properties of the implant, and its anatomical relations with the anterior and posterior lens capsule influence <b>lens</b> epithelial <b>cell</b> behaviour in vivo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInterferon {{regulatory}} factors (IRFs) are {{a family}} of transcription factors involved in regulation of cell growth and immunological responses. Nine IRFs have been described and they are expressed {{in a variety of}} cells, except for ICSBP and LSIRF/Pip, which are thought to be expressed exclusively in immune cells. Here, we show that IRF- 1, IRF- 2, ICSBP, and LSIRF/Pip are constitutively expressed in the mouse lens. These IRFs are present in both the cytoplasm and the nuclei of <b>lens</b> <b>cells.</b> However, the nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins exhibit distinct mobilities on SDS/PAGE. We further show that in the developing mouse lens, IRF- 1 and IRF- 2 are expressed at high levels in differentiated <b>lens</b> fiber <b>cells</b> with very low and barely detectable levels in undifferentiated <b>lens</b> epithelial <b>cells.</b> Although the level of ICSBP expression is very low in the normal mouse lens, in transgenic mice with constitutive expression of interferon γ in the lens, its level is markedly elevated and ICSBP expression is detected exclusively in the nuclei of undifferentiated <b>lens</b> <b>cells.</b> Taken together, our data suggest that expression of IRF transcription factors is spatially regulated in the lens and that distinct IRFs may contribute to differential gene regulation in the epithelial and fiber compartments of the vertebrate lens...|$|R
