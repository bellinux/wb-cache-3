2500|$|Robert Barnwell Roosevelt, uncle of American President Theodore Roosevelt, {{also built}} a proa {{at about the}} same time. [...] He used it sailing from Long Island. It was {{significantly}} different but equally creative, and at , much longer. [...] From his 1898 article in The Rudder, it appeared the main hull of Roosevelt's proa was an open [...] wide scow hull; the ama was a smaller, fully decked scow which looked like it could rock on a single aka. [...] The mast was a bipod arrangement with both masts stepped to windward, with a boomed, balanced <b>lugsail</b> suspended from the apex. [...] A balanced rudder at each end managed itself by pivoting 180° when its end was the [...] "bow", and leeboards were used.|$|E

60|$|Dane rose stiffly, but {{he could}} see little except the belts of {{thinning}} haze which dimmed the waters ahead. He could hear the thunder of breakers on the invisible foot of the cliff. The light was growing each moment, the breeze dying fast, and presently the damp <b>lugsail</b> slatted against the mast.|$|E
60|$|Harry slept {{down in the}} {{forecastle}} {{with the}} crew, the captain keeping on deck all night. He was awoke by an order shouted down the forecastle for all hands to come on deck; and hurrying up with the rest found that the sun had just risen. The day was beautifully fine, and to Harry's surprise he found that those on deck had already lowered the great <b>lugsails.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{they opened}} up the bay the sea got rougher, but the wind was on the gig's quarter and they let her go. She rolled on the angry combers and the boom that {{stretched}} the <b>lugsail's</b> foot tossed up. If she fell off much and the sail lurched across, the shock would capsize her or carry away the mast. Wyndham, however, held her straight and she drove on, with curling foam piled about her side. It was a wild run and they were glad when they got near the land again and found shelter. The sea was smooth now, and the breeze moderate, although it blew in gusts that heeled the boat and set the water splashing against her planks. Once or twice Wyndham made Marston strike a match and look at his watch.|$|R
60|$|There are mingled some dismal {{memories}} with so {{many that}} were joyous. Of the fisher-wife, for instance, who had cut her throat at Canty Bay; and of how I ran with the other children {{to the top of}} the Quadrant, and beheld a posse of silent people escorting a cart, and on the cart, bound in a chair, her throat bandaged, and the bandage all bloody - horror! - the fisher-wife herself, who continued thenceforth to hag-ride my thoughts, and even to-day (as I recall the scene) darkens daylight. She was lodged in the little old jail in the chief street; but whether or no she died there, with a wise terror of the worst, I never inquired. She had been tippling; it was but a dingy tragedy; and it seems strange and hard that, after all these years, the poor crazy sinner should be still pilloried on her cart in the scrap-book of my memory. Nor shall I readily forget a certain house in the Quadrant where a visitor died, and a dark old woman continued to dwell alone with the dead body; nor how this old woman conceived a hatred to myself and one of my cousins, and in the dread hour of the dusk, as we were clambering on the garden-walls, opened a window in that house of mortality and cursed us in a shrill voice and with a marrowy choice of language. It was a pair of very colourless urchins that fled down the lane from this remarkable experience! But I recall with a more doubtful sentiment, compounded out of fear and exultation, the coil of equinoctial tempests; trumpeting squalls, scouring flaws of rain; the boats with their reefed <b>lugsails</b> scudding for the harbour mouth, where danger lay, for it was hard to make when the wind had any east in it; the wives clustered with blowing shawls at the pier-head, where (if fate was against them) they might see boat and husband and sons - their whole wealth and their whole family - engulfed under their eyes; and (what I saw but once) a troop of neighbours forcing such an unfortunate homeward, and she squalling and battling in their midst, a figure scarcely human, a tragic Maenad.|$|R
60|$|He {{threw an}} oar into the {{sculling}} notch and they drifted away, slipping between the trawl-boats that {{rose out of}} the gloom and vanished astern. A minute later, the stream boiled noisily along the gravel bank, the white buildings faded, and they were swept into the darkness that brooded over the Firth. The fisherman hoisted a small, black <b>lugsail</b> and jib, and took the tiller as the boat listed gently down to a biting wind.|$|E
60|$|Then a {{splashing}} sound grew louder, and a dim gray object drove toward them. Whitney {{knew it was}} a <b>lugsail</b> boat {{beating up}} the Firth, and he saw that she would pass at a few yards' distance if she stood on. So far, he did not think they had been seen, for the Rowan's hull was low, and she had no sail set. While he waited in suspense he heard the splash of an oar as somebody sounded.|$|E
60|$|After some {{discussion}} Redmond reluctantly agreed to remain behind {{in charge of}} the gold Dane brought down; and it was nearly dark when, without shipping overmuch water, the surf-boat cleared the beach, and with tall <b>lugsail</b> straining, lurched away eastward over the moonlit swell. It was then that, lying in the stern to rest and gather strength for what might yet be required of him, Dane told Gilby his detailed story. He could afterward recall the intent face fixed upon him, the crash of breakers throbbing through the haze that hid the shore, and the listing craft's swift rise and fall. At the time, however, he was conscious of nothing except that they were speeding east, and that the trader assured him the slender native canoe dare carry very little sail in such a strength of breeze. Gilby held the tiller, a big Krooboy sat on the weather gunwale slacking off the <b>lugsail</b> sheet each time the boat dipped her side to a stronger puff of breeze, and Amadu lay on the weather floorings, deadly sick and groaning horribly, to the amusement of the amphibious heathen.|$|E

60|$|The <b>lugsail</b> rustled down, {{the mast}} was lowered. Muscular black men perched {{themselves}} on the gunwales, and the paddles beat the water, while, when they had brought the head abeam, the mist rolled back, and the red track of the sunrise streaked the heaving sea. A low, black blur and a smear of smoke crawled athwart it; while nearer the shore, and seen only when the surf-boat climbed the long undulations, a dusky strip, with moving figures silhouetted against the radiant sea, lurched toward the approaching steamer.|$|E
60|$|One {{of these}} was raging when they scudded down a lake on a cold and {{lowering}} evening. Gray vapor blurred the rocky shore, but {{here and there a}} few dark pines stood out, harshly distinct. The water was leaden-colored between the lines of foam, and short, slashing seas broke angrily about the canoe, which ran before them with a small <b>lugsail</b> set. Carnally knelt astern, holding the steering paddle; Andrew lay down amidships, out of the wind; and Graham, crouching forward, fixed his eyes ahead.|$|E
60|$|They were {{exhausted}} {{when they stopped}} beside a belt of sparkling water, and Jim cried out hoarsely and clenched his fist. The channel was wider than he had thought, and near the other bank a punt was running down with the tide. One could hardly see her low, gray hull, but the tanned <b>lugsail</b> cut sharply against the bank, and its slant and the splash of foam at the bows indicated speed. Shooting punts are not built to carry canvas, but they sail fast in smooth water when the wind is fair.|$|E
60|$|Shoals {{surrounded}} the basin where Mossamedes rode {{two miles from}} land. From her deck {{it looked as if}} she were at sea, for the banks that sheltered her were only marked by lines of foam. Although she rolled, the motion was not violent, and Kit got a sense of space and freedom. He liked the lonely anchorage better than a noisy port. In the morning they hoisted the boat's <b>lugsail,</b> and following the edge of the sands, stopped where fish were numerous. A disturbed swell crossed the shoals, and spray blew about. Sometimes when the boat sank in the trough they could not see the ship, but the fresh breeze tempered the heat and drove along a thin haze that softened the light. Kit caught strange, deep-bodied fish with square heads, and was content.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} her to follow Rideau you shall have the boat for nothing, and we'll both come along," [...] said Redmond. [...] "Gilby, get down to the beach and see to the gear and crew. Meantime, you are coming {{straight}} into the factory to get some food. Where is Rideau making for? That I don't know, but he'll probably try to get on board the Minella if he's afraid of you. She's billed on a stopping trip for Lagos, but she'll edge close round Twin Point Bluff, and he'll no doubt try to board her there. There's a nice southwester blowing now, and under the big <b>lugsail</b> we ought to overhaul the canoe before he does so. She can't have got far until the breeze sprang up." ...|$|E
60|$|They were {{occupied}} for some minutes, and then Wyndham {{sat down at}} the tiller and the gig, leaning over, gathered speed. Marston had had the <b>lugsail</b> and jib made in England by a famous yacht-chandler, and the boat was fast. Foam piled up at her lee bow, lapped the gunwale at her waist, and boiled round her stern. The breeze came down in gusts from the high land, and now and then the boat, listing sharply, shipped some water. Wyndham might have avoided this by slackening the sheet, but he held on to the rope and kept his course. Although the night was dark, he could see the hills against the sky and for a time he followed the coast. Then, when the shore curved back in a wide bay, he told Marston to put the compass on the thwart and light the lantern.|$|E

50|$|A smaller drascombe for single-handed sailing, the Scaffie has no centreboard, relying {{instead on}} a long central keel and two bilge stub keels. Rig is a single {{standing}} <b>lugsail.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A <b>lugsail</b> catboat: {{like the}} loose-footed square sail (left), but the yard is hauled off-center rather than hanging {{balanced}} on the mast, which lets it sail more nearly upwind.|$|E
50|$|Some {{designers}} {{have addressed the}} issue by eliminating the boom completely. Classic types of sail like the Square rig or the Standing <b>Lugsail</b> have always worked without booms. Modern alternatives without a boom are the Mast aft rig.|$|E
50|$|The junk rig, {{also known}} as the Chinese <b>lugsail</b> or sampan rig, is a type of sail rig in which rigid members, called battens, span the full width of the sail and extend the sail forward of the mast.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A French lugger, beached {{and drying}} nets. The <b>lugsail</b> is {{spread on the}} beach. She is beached stern first as is normal.

5000|$|There {{are other}} ways to tack or gybe a <b>lugsail.</b> Some methods use a {{downhaul}} to the forward end of the spar so that a sharp downward tug on the line will pull dip the forward end around the aft side of the mast. Generally the procedure, which may be feasible only on smaller sails, is to: ...|$|E
5000|$|A single loose-footed {{square sail}} {{hung from a}} yard was likely the oldest form of sail, as woven cloth is {{initially}} square. Ancient Egyptian boats had a single square sail with two yards, top and bottom. A <b>lugsail</b> is similar, but the yard is pulled offcenter, making it more weatherly {{so that it can}} go more quickly upwind. A settee sail is a <b>lugsail</b> with one very short side. If the lug is so offcenter that one end is attached to the mast, it is a gaff rig. A spritsail is like a gaff, but the [...] "gaff" [...] runs diagonally across the face of the sail and supports the peak of the sail, and is therefor called a sprit. If the [...] "gaff" [...] is bound nearly parallel to the mast, it becomes a gunter rig. If the sail is a triangle strung between the mast and the horizontal boom, it is a Bermuda rig.|$|E
50|$|Originally the zeesenboote were small, single-masted boats with {{a square}} rigged sail. With the {{increasing}} size of zeesenboote {{in the early}} 19th century, the square rig {{gave way to a}} lug sail. From about 1870, the fore-and-aft rig was introduced (gaff rigged). Towards the end of the 19th century, a second mast became common which also carried a <b>lugsail.</b> The rig of the zeesenboote at this time is the one used today on those boats that are still sailing.|$|E
5000|$|The lug sail, or <b>lugsail,</b> is a fore-and-aft, four-cornered sail that is {{suspended}} from a spar, called a yard. When raised the sail area overlaps the mast. For [...] "standing lug" [...] rigs, the sail {{remains on the}} same side of the mast on both the port and starboard tacks. For [...] "dipping lug" [...] rigs, the sail is lowered partially to be brought around to the leeward side of the mast in order to optimize the efficiency of the sail on both tacks.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Barnwell Roosevelt, uncle of American President Theodore Roosevelt, {{also built}} a proa {{at about the}} same time. He used it sailing from Long Island. It was {{significantly}} different but equally creative, and at 50 ft, much longer. From his 1898 article in The Rudder, it appeared the main hull of Roosevelt's proa was an open 4 ft wide scow hull; the ama was a smaller, fully decked scow which looked like it could rock on a single aka. The mast was a bipod arrangement with both masts stepped to windward, with a boomed, balanced <b>lugsail</b> suspended from the apex. A balanced rudder at each end managed itself by pivoting 180° when its end was the [...] "bow", and leeboards were used.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{pictorial}} {{evidence that}} by the end of the sixteenth century similar influences may have affected the design of the Scottish galley. A carving made at Arasaig in 1641 shows a vessel with a lowered stem and stern. An English map of north-east Ireland made no later than 1603 shows [...] "fleetes of the Redshanks Highlanders of Cantyre" [...] carrying what resembles a <b>lugsail</b> on a sloping yard arm, with a small cabin at the stern projecting backwards. Two Clanranald seals attached to documents dated 1572 show a birlinn with raised decks at stem and stern, a motif repeated in later heraldic devices. If such changes occurred, they would reflect (as in Ireland) influences from the south-east and ultimately from the Mediterranean.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Fifie" [...] {{then became}} the {{predominant}} fishing {{boat on the}} Scottish east coast. They were used from the 1850s {{until well into the}} 20th century. Fifies had a vertical stem and stern with a broad beam, which made them very stable. Their long keel was a disadvantage, especially manoeuvring in confined spaces. These boats were two masted with a main dipping <b>lugsail</b> and a mizzen sail. The masts were set quite far forward and aft to release a good working space. Fifies built from 1860 onwards were all decked, and from the 1870s onwards the bigger boats were built with carvel planking, i.e. the planks were laid edge-to-edge instead of the overlapping clinker style of previous boats. Some boats were now being built up to about 70 ft in length and were very fast.|$|E
50|$|The Louisa Heartwell {{found that}} Alf {{was in a}} bad way when she {{returned}} to the scene. The barque had broken in two and her cargo of timber was washing out. The waves were crashing across her deck, which was now under water. Coxswain Blogg manoeuvred his boat under lee quarter of Alf, and held the Louise Heartwell in this position despite her stern's being struck by a huge wave. The exhausted first mate and the second mate descended the mizzen rigging and dropped into the lifeboat. Coxswain Blogg quickly turned the boat, hoisted the <b>lugsail,</b> and set a course for Great Yarmouth. One hour after the Louisa Heartwell arrived in Yarmouth, the Chanticleer came into port with the other nine survivors. The Cromer men had been at sea for fifteen hours. The lifeboat returned to Cromer on 24 August at 2:00pm; she had damage to her stern band and six of her oars had been broken.|$|E
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 19th century a class of boat called the Skaffie appeared. These were favoured mainly in the Moray Firth region. The early skaffie boats were small with rounded stems and raked sterns. They were two-masted with a tall dipping <b>lugsail</b> and a mizzen sail. Their short keel gave them good manoeuvrability in good weather, but they tended to be unstable in bad weather. They were usually crewed by around six people. Above all, though, they were light enough to be hauled up on to the beaches. The boats were un-decked and provided no shelter for the crew. Because of the vulnerability of the boats, they stayed only a few miles out to sea {{in full view of the}} land. These boats were gradually built bigger and could be around 42 ft long, and partially decked. This came about because the harbours that were constructed from the mid to late19th century meant that the boats no longer needed to be beached. Skaffies were not built in any great numbers after 1900.|$|E
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} and hydrodynamic design {{factors are}} considered {{in relation to}} a 9 m performance orientated cruiser trimaran: 1. 	A scenario of a cruise across the Channel was used to develop the requirements. 2. 	The initial dimensioning parameters were based on similar trimaran designs. 3. 	The hydrodynamic resistance of a trimaran hull and outrigger were analysed using theoretical and empirical based formulae, and a lines plan developed. 4. 	The hydrodynamic lift and drag characteristics of the keel were analysed and a suitable foil chosen. 5. 	A novel rig based on a Chinese <b>lugsail</b> with leading and trailing edge flaps and streamlined mast envelope was proposed, analysed, and rejected due to problems with achieving sufficient space for a mast within the bounds of the geometry of the section. An alternative proposal was put forward without the leading edge flap, and its design features developed to a sail plan. ...|$|E
