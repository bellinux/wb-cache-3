5|$|The {{disaster}} gained international notoriety {{due in part}} to {{a photograph}} taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named Omayra Sánchez, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her sense of dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E

25|$|Sharkey's lack of {{physical}} vigor precluded Sharkey from {{joining in the}} sports of other children. Yet she enjoyed companionship, and often attracted a circle of little friends, who would sit around her for hours, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> stories, improvised as rapidly as she could utter them. That rapidity of thought and facility of expression were characteristic of her maturer years. She began a sketch {{of one or more}} columns and usually finished it at one sitting.

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, shortly {{after the release of}} the first demo, Seppälä and Kuri began searching for a female vocalist with high {{technical}} skills to replace Goodman, feeling he wasn't right for the music. Around the time they placed an ad, they found another for soprano vocalist Heidi Parviainen, who had grown tired of her keyboard duties of Iconofear. After <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> samples, they decided to set up a demo with her and the band. It turned out that she was exactly what they were looking for, due to her ability to both sing and contribute lyrics, after writing the lyrics to Passing Bells. This completed the band's lineup, now under the name of Amberian Dawn, the result of a day of brainstorming. In spite of having Goodman leave his position as singer, there were no hard feelings between him and the band, and he has made minor appearances on all three Amberian Dawn albums since.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} assume, as mentioned, {{that the}} story had existed independently before it was integrated into its current context. Willem Beuken think that the original tale was not about the king's wisdom - The concluding note about Solomon's wisdom is considered secondary - but about a woman who, by <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> motherly instinct, helped the king {{to break through the}} legal impasse. Beuken notes additional biblical stories which share the motif of the woman who influenced the king: Bathsheba, the woman of Tekoa, and Solomon's foreign wives who seduced him into idolatry. Beuken concludes that the true mother exemplifies the biblical character type of the wise woman. He proposes an analysis of the literary structure of the story, according to which the section that notes the compassion of the true mother (verse 26b) constitutes one of the two climaxes of the story, along with the section that announces Solomon's divine wisdom (verse 28b). According to this analysis, the story in its current context gives equal weight to the compassion of the true mother and to the godly wisdom that guided Solomon in the trial.|$|E

500|$|When she was 17, Heyer began {{a serial}} story to amuse her brother Boris, who {{suffered}} from a form of haemophilia and was often weak. Her father enjoyed <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> story {{and asked her to}} prepare it for publication. His agent found a publisher for her book, and The Black Moth, about the adventures of a young man who took responsibility for his brother's card-cheating, was released in 1921. According to her biographer Jane Aiken Hodge, the novel contained many of the elements that would become standard for Heyer's novels, the [...] "saturnine male lead, the marriage in danger, the extravagant wife, and the group of idle, entertaining young men".

500|$|The group first rehearsed in Shotton's {{house on}} Vale Road, {{but because of}} the noise his mother told them to use the {{corrugated}} air-raid shelter in the back garden. Rehearsals were moved from the cold air-raid shelter to Hanton's or Griffiths' house—as Griffiths' father had died in WWII, and his mother worked all day. The band also often visited Lennon's mother at 1 Blomfield Road, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> collection of rock and roll records by Elvis, Shirly and Lee's [...] "Let the Good Times Roll", and Gene Vincent's [...] "Be-Bop-A-Lula" [...] which they added to their repertoire. After his tenure on tea-chest bass, Nigel Walley became the group's manager.

500|$|Milian {{believed}} that the public expected [...] "a certain thing" [...] from her when she first appeared with Ja Rule, however she wanted to record the type of music she was signed to do. She said that [...] "AM to PM" [...] was a [...] "cool record", {{but it was not}} what the public expected. Milian felt that her record label was confused as to how they wanted her image to be portrayed; one second she was young and singing [...] "AM to PM", and next she was a grown woman singing [...] "Get Away". She realized that the change confused the audience, and that [...] "nobody was buying it". To explain that she was serious about her musical career, Milian approached the executives at Island Def Jam, and [...] "cussed them all out", telling them that they were not <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

500|$|... "Crazy for You" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Madonna {{from the}} soundtrack album to the 1985 film Vision Quest. It was {{released}} on March 2, 1985 by Geffen Records as the first single from the soundtrack. The song appears remixed on the greatest hits compilation The Immaculate Collection (1990) and was re-released on February 24, 1991 by Sire Records to promote the album. The song was also included on the ballads compilation Something to Remember (1995) and the greatest hits compilation Celebration (2009). Producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber, along with music director Phil Ramone, decided to use Madonna after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> previous recordings, employing John Bettis and Jon Lind to write the song. After reading the script of the film, Bettis and Lind wrote the song {{about the situation in}} which the lead characters meet at a nightclub. Initial recording sessions did not impress Bettis and Lind, and they felt that [...] "Crazy for You" [...] would be dropped from the soundtrack. However, a new version was recorded to their liking.|$|E
500|$|Badu {{subsequently}} held recording {{sessions at}} Electric Lady Studios in New York City, where {{the album was}} completed. [...] "Everything that the producers e-mailed me I put into GarageBand", she explained to Remix. [...] "Then we would try to duplicate it at Electric Lady. I did vocals on my laptop, babies crying and everything. I also EQ'd the tracks using effects like GarageBand's Vocal Reflection." [...] Badu worked with audio engineers Chris Bell, Tom Soares, and Chavarria, who had spent numerous hours with Badu <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> previous albums, including her 1997 debut Baduizm and its 2000 follow-up Mama's Gun, and older albums such as The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) by progressive rock band Pink Floyd and Innervisions (1973) by Stevie Wonder. They worked with the producers' emailed music and embellished their own 2-tracks by using Pro Tools to incorporate live instrumentation such as bass, guitar, flutes, percussion, and keyboards. Contributing musicians included vocalist Georgia Anne Muldrow, trumpeter Roy Hargrove, vibraphonist Roy Ayers, guitarist Omar Rodríguez-López, and vocalist Bilal.|$|E
500|$|Ruby's {{credibility}} builds throughout Season 3. In [...] "Sin City", she restores {{power to}} the Colt for the Winchesters to use in their war against demons. The episode [...] "Malleus Maleficarum" [...] provides her backstory, revealing {{that she had been}} a witch during the Plague who sold her soul to a demon. She confides in Dean that, unlike other demons, she still remembers {{what it is like to}} be human, citing this trait as the reason she is helping the brothers against other demons. She returns in [...] "Jus in Bello" [...] to save the brothers from an attacking horde of demons. Upon learning that they have lost the Colt, she decides to perform a spell that will destroy all the demons in the area, including herself. However, because the spell requires a human virgin's heart, Dean does not allow her to perform it. Although the plan he comes up with instead saves himself and his brother, the people they leave behind get killed by demons pursuing Sam and Dean, which Ruby uses to rebuke the brothers for not <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
