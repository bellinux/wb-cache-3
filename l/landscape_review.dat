40|$|The {{paper was}} first {{published}} in <b>Landscape</b> <b>Review</b> 1998 : 4 (1). Unfortunately only the text was printed: technical problems resulted in the illustrations being omitted. In this issue of <b>Landscape</b> <b>Review</b> we are reproducing the same paper inclusive of its illustrations (ed). We apologise to Richard Weller, the author, for the unfortunate earlier omission. I consider sustainable development to be a contradiction. What we need is sustainable life. In the 20 th century the glory of the human has become the desolation of the earth. The desolation of the earth is becoming the destiny of the human. All human institutions, activities and programs must be judged primarily by {{the extent to which they}} inhibit, ignore or foster a mutually enhancing human-earth relationship. There are enormous creative possibilities if only we would take them. Thomas Berry in discussion with Paul Collins. Encounters, ABC Tapes, 1995. This paper describes a recent design project for the Future Generations University, by the interdisciplinary design company Room 4. 1. 3. The Future Generations University is to be a new university specifically devoted to issues of sustainability, sited north of Sydney on Australia's east coast. The paper describes the idea of such a new educational institution, the design process by which such a place expects to be formed, the theoretical position of Room 4. 1. 3 's submission and the forms and concepts of the design itself. These aspects of the project are then placed within the context of contemporary environmental design theory. The project itself, and the means by which the work was both solicited and done, presents a case study in interdisciplinary design, wherein landscape architectural sensibilities provide a platform for emergent design paradigms...|$|E

One area of research which Nesta believes is of critical importance to stakeholders concerns the demand for and use of hyperlocal media. This is of particular importance given the rapid take-up of connected devices such as smartphones and tablets, which enable citizens and consumers to consume hyperlocal media in new ways and which may help to drive new business models towards long-term sustainability. Nesta commissioned some consumer research with Kantar Media to address key questions concerning the nature of demand for hyperlocal media across the UK.

40|$|Landscape {{design is}} an interventionist act. In {{a way that}} ameliorates the act, we frequently-and correctly-refer to {{landscape}} design involving a mediation between art and nature. Designers may (indeed should) see themselves as enticing users to share or experience the designer's artifice and discover meaning. As part of this connection with underlying reasons for design, words like 'context', 'meaning' and 'significance' occur in our design language. Our engaging with these terms as metaphors for understanding design has become a focus for enquiry in landscape architecture. This engagement {{is accompanied by a}} welcome resurgence in discussion on landscape architecture as an art form and parallels the post-modern focus on the arts and humanities (see Simon Swaffield Editorial: languages of landscape architecture, <b>Landscape</b> <b>Review,</b> 1995 : 2). This essay looks at these issues from an Australian perspective. It uses a number of designs as illustrations of context, meaning and significance after attempting to tease out definitions of the terms. They are difficult terms to define, but because we use them increasingly we need to reflect on their meaning...|$|E
40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{acknowledge the}} need for rigorous research in landscape architecture to improve practice and teaching, and several recent studies have explored research trends in the discipline. This study continues this exploration by reviewing the articles published in the three prominent English- language landscape architecture journals: Landscape Journal, <b>Landscape</b> <b>Review,</b> and the Journal of Landscape Architecture. Specifically, this study analyzes the abstracts from 441 research articles to determine specific themes and publishing trends over 31 years (1982 – 2013). Findings indicate that “history” {{is by far the}} most prominent research theme, followed by “social and cultural processes and issues” and “aesthetics. ” Several themes—such as “sustainability and green infrastructure,” “participation and collaboration,” and “research methods and methodologies”—have become more prominent in recent years. However, topics of current social and political concern—such as “climate change,” “active living,” “energy,” and “health”—are not yet prominent themes in the research literature, and could be key areas for future contribution. With the exception of a few themes, findings also suggest a moderate degree of alignment between research and practice. The article concludes with recommendations for future areas of research that will better position landscape architecture as a research- oriented profession with broad social relevance...|$|E
40|$|Juxtaposing {{the terms}} 'language ' and 'landscape {{architecture}} ' evokes {{a wealth of}} possible relationships between the two. At the two LOLA conferences held at Lincoln University in I 995 and 1998, 'language ' and 'landscape architecture ' were connected through the preposition 'of'. The choice of this seemingly benign preposition has served to inspire {{a broad range of}} perspectives on the topic. As the Concise Oxford Dictionary explains, 'of ' expresses 'a wide range of relationships', and the papers presented at the LOLA conferences have explored many of the connections that 'of ' suggests. In this issue of <b>Landscape</b> <b>Review,</b> the final five invited papers from the second Languages of Landscape Architecture conference (LOLA 2), held at Lincoln University on July 9 - 12 I 998, illustrate the diversity of perspectives that exist on language and landscape. In Rolley's paper the connection between language and landscape architecture is proprietorial. One definition of 'of ' is 'belonging, connection, or possession', which in a language context could be viewed as discourse.

40|$|My thesis, {{entitled}} 'Transformative Mappings: the cartographer's {{house in}} the ecologist's garden', part design and part text, is concerned with contemporary design theory. However, its main ambition is to manifest theory in the action of designing and building a house for a cartographer within one of the world's most biodiverse landscapes. The principal {{aim of the research}} is to investigate possibilities for making highly site-specific architecture within biologically significant sites, linking mapping techniques to computer-aided design and manufacture processes. Contrary to local and global trends in architecture I am not seeking a romanticised vernacular nor trying to emulate the hyper-sensual form-making of practitioners such as Greg Lynn and Frank Gehry. Rather, I am interested in a complex ecology of architecture; an architecture generated through the agency of mapping, design, construction and landscape itself. Part one of this report explains the context of this project and is divided into three sub-themes: Ecologist's Garden, Mapping Techniques and Computer-aided Design and Manufacture. In part two, the writings of James Corner, the main theme for this issue of <b>Landscape</b> <b>Review,</b> form a critical framework for discussing the principal philosophical themes of the thesis. The sections, New Ecology of Seeing and Enacted Cartography describe creative projects developed specifically for the thesis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{global health}} {{community}} {{is beginning to}} {{gain an understanding of}} the global burden of norovirus-associated disease, which appears to have significant burden in both developed- and developing-country populations. Of particular importance is the growing recognition of norovirus as a leading cause of gastroenteritis and diarrhea in countries where rotavirus vaccine has been introduced. While not as severe as rotavirus disease, the sheer number of norovirus infections not limited to early childhood makes norovirus a formidable global health problem. This article provides a <b>landscape</b> <b>review</b> of norovirus vaccine development efforts. Multiple vaccine strategies, mostly relying on virus-like particle antigens, are under development and have demonstrated proof of efficacy in human challenge studies. Several are entering phase 2 clinical development. Norovirus vaccine development challenges include, but are not limited to: valency, induction of adequate immune responses in pediatric and elderly populations, and potential for vaccine-strain mismatch. Given current strategies and global health interest, the outlook for a norovirus vaccine is promising. Because a norovirus vaccine is expected to have a dual market in both developed and developing countries, there would likely be scale-up advantages for commercial development and global distribution. Combination with or expression by another enteric pathogen, such as rotavirus, could also enhance uptake of a norovirus vaccine...|$|E
40|$|As {{noted by}} Julian Raxworthy, 1 {{landscape}} architecture {{is different from}} other design discourses, notably architecture, because of its utilisation of ‘dynamic’ construction media such as plant materials, soils and water, compared with the ‘static’ materials of architecture, colloquially described as bricks and mortar. This dynamic of plant growth and performative ecological processes leads to representation of change over time in any landscape. The psychological benefits of gardens and landscape have been well documented. 2 The Unitec landscape is a field of remnants and features remaining {{from the days of}} the psychiatric hospital, such as the trees, landform modifications, productive gardens, and orientation to views. Along with historical photographs and texts the landscape reveals evidence of therapeutic intent {{in the design of the}} hospital grounds. 3 This paper investigates how the therapeutic landscape of the 19 th century can now itself be considered to be under therapy. 1 Julian Raxworthy, “Writing Gardens – Gardening Drawings: Fung, Bruier and Gardening as a Model of Landscape Architectural Practice,” in <b>Landscape</b> <b>Review</b> Special Issue: CELA 2001 : Here and There?

40|$|The spatial {{turn will}} be {{considered}} through three case studies involving digital data. Each case considers technological agency in the articulation of space and place. The first two cases will involve the conception of the DigiLab, — from its online case study research (which involved a <b>landscape</b> <b>review</b> of digital research centres, networks and labs and studios worldwide), to its architectural construction as a space located {{on the ground floor}} of the London College of Communication. The third case will explore the geo-spatial user-interface design research that required a collaborative studio practice before the DigiLab was built.    In the 1960 s Robert Sommer and Edward T. Hall posed questions around design, ‘personal space’ (1969) and ‘proxemics’ (1964). Neither took into consideration the role of technological agency in the articulation of their spatial questions. Further spatial preoccupations occur in the 1980 - 90 s through the de-territorialisation and re-territorialisation maneuvers of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari ([1988] 2004), as well as the interest in the non-place by Marc Augé (1995). These articulations of space and place will be traced through the case studies to understand the spatial turn in STS.    The concept will be explored as a discussion of territoriality and emergence referring to the ‘emergent historic’ (Berlant 2011) by way of ‘intra-action’ (Barad 2003). Independently, each case articulates the spatial turn as the emergent historic. Interweaved, however, the spatial articulations of the DigiLab (media and design lab) emerge alongside the geo-spatial research undertaken and vice-versa (as a simultaneous matter of intra-action) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} how the landscape studio has supported scholarly problem-solving pedagogy. Examination {{was limited to}} studio-educators’ published pedagogical research on problem-solving topics and on landscape architecture students’ preferences for solving studio-based problems. A unique multi-method research approach {{was used to assess}} the scholarly rigor and breadth of 467 academic articles published between 1997 and 2008 in Landscape Journal, Landscape Research, and <b>Landscape</b> <b>Review.</b> Scholarly rigor was assessed using Boyer’s model of scholarship, Cross and Steadman’s multiple scholarships of teaching, Weimer’s scholarly work on teaching and learning, and Groat and Wang’s architectural research methods. Content analysis was used to catalogue the breadth of problem-solving tools, techniques and theories mentioned in the articles. Research questionnaires, one-on-one interviews, focus groups and formal project presentations surveyed students’ problem-solving preferences. Seventy-eight first and final year students at Edinburgh College of Art, Scotland and Washington State University, United States participated. Data were tested to determine whether what studio-educators claimed in the articles were supported by landscape students’ preferences for solving studio-based problems. Results found 56 articles possessed characteristics of scholarly work on teaching and learning and advanced problem-solving knowledge. Twenty-two different problem-solving tools, techniques or theories were mentioned in the articles. Students independently reported a preference for using 20 of the 22 problem-solving approaches. Strongly shared approaches involved cultural awareness and site visits. Approaches recommended by educator-authors, but not preferred by students, involved the environment, teamwork and innovation. Further research may be needed to explain these differences. In conclusion, the landscape studio has supported scholarly problem-solving pedagogy through studio-educators’ pedagogical research published in discipline-based journals and students’ preferences for solving studio-based problems. This study is significant in its use of multi-method approaches to examine scholarly research and teaching. In the future, educator-authors may use information contained in this study to strengthen their teaching and scholarship...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} stage of a TALI Strategic Project on Academic Staff Digital Literacies. The report scopes the grey and peer {{reviewed}} literature and provides a <b>landscape</b> <b>review</b> of some of the major developments focussing particularly on approaches supported by the major sector bodies (JISC, HEA and ALT). The report comes to the following conclusions: • The term digital capability appears to have growing use by sector bodies (e. g. Jisc and UCISA) replacing digital literacy and digital fluency. We support this because it may be more acceptable to academic staff because it may appear less pejorative. In addition {{it should be noted that}} both terms are highly temporally contingent in this is a fast moving area. • Staff digital literacies are deeply embedded in their local discipline context. • Whilst there are many projects that focus on students’ digital literacy the literature on staff is much less prevalent. • Of the few projects that focus on staff digital literacies these tend to lack any empirical base in relation to efficacy or impact. • Digitally confident practitioners display a range of attributes related to confidence, willingness to explore, resilience to failure and that it is these attributes that characterise them rather than their technical skills. • Approaches to achieving sustained change in relation to development of digital confident practitioners are more likely to be achieved by focussing on ‘hearts and minds’ where staff have agency and ownership, and feel empowered to make changes rather than audits or appraisals. • A particular ‘hearts and mind’ approach that has had some use across several HEIs is the course redesign model called ‘Carpe Deum’ (Salmon & Wright 2014). • In addition Appreciative Inquiry as a model for supporting change processes which has been advocated by Jisc (Gray and Ferrell nd) ...|$|E
