50|$|Later this {{draft was}} adopted with some {{modifications}} when the Nuclear Command Authority was announced on January 4, 2003. A significant modification was the dilution of the NFU principle to include <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation</b> to attacks by {{biological and chemical}} weapons.|$|R
25|$|The Cold Start {{doctrine}} {{has invited}} criticism from Pakistani media and former generals {{who claim that}} although the doctrine was designed to punish Pakistan in a limited manner without triggering <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation,</b> the Indian Army cannot be sure if Pakistan's leadership will, in fact, refrain from such a response.|$|R
5000|$|International {{concerns}} {{increased when}} Pakistani foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmad {{made a statement}} on 31 May warning that an escalation of the limited conflict could lead Pakistan to use [...] "any weapon" [...] in its arsenal. This was immediately interpreted as a threat of <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation</b> by Pakistan {{in the event of}} an extended war, and the belief was reinforced when the leader of Pakistan's senate noted, [...] "The purposeof developing weapons becomes meaningless if they are not used when they are needed". Many such ambiguous statements from officials of both countries were viewed as warnings of an impending nuclear crisis where the combatants would consider use of their <b>limited</b> <b>nuclear</b> arsenals in [...] "tactical" [...] nuclear warfare in the belief that it would not have ended in mutual assured destruction, as could have occurred in a nuclear conflict between the United States and the USSR. Some experts believe that following nuclear tests in 1998, the Pakistani military was emboldened by its nuclear deterrent to markedly increase coercion against India.|$|R
50|$|Fail-deadly {{can refer}} to {{specific}} technology components, or the controls system as a whole. The United Kingdom's fail-deadly policies delegated strike authority to submarine commanders {{in the event of}} a loss of command (using a letter of last resort), ensuring that even when uncoordinated, <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation</b> could be carried out.|$|R
50|$|The United States {{operated}} a command missile system {{known as the}} Emergency Rocket Communications System (ERCS). In {{the event of a}} nuclear first strike against the continental United States, centrally located LGM-30 Minuteman missiles would be launched, each of which carried a payload that would electronically trigger a <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation.</b>|$|R
50|$|Massive {{retaliation}} {{works on}} the same principles as mutual assured destruction (MAD), with the important caveat that even a minor conventional attack on a nuclear state could conceivably result in all-out <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation.</b> However {{at the time when}} massive retaliation became policy, there was no MAD, because the Soviet Union lacked a second strike capability throughout the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The crucial goal in {{maintaining}} second-strike capabilities is preventing first-strike attacks from {{taking out a}} nation's nuclear arsenal. In this manner, a country can carry out <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation</b> even after absorbing a nuclear attack. The United States and other countries have diversified their nuclear arsenals through the nuclear triad {{in order to better}} ensure second-strike capability.|$|R

Shortly thereafter the Jayhawk Wars begin, a conventional attack against Fithp forces which is rapidly destroyed using space support. About two weeks later, the Americans and Soviets cooperate in a combined <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation</b> that defeats the Fithp forces and wrecks much of Kansas in the process.|$|R
50|$|According to the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the UN - on 19 January 2006, over 22 {{years after}} the {{incident}} - <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation</b> requires that multiple sources confirm an attack.

25|$|Cold Start is a {{military}} doctrine developed by the Indian Armed Forces {{for use in a}} possible war with Pakistan. It involves the various branches of India's military conducting offensive operations as part of unified battle groups. The Cold Start doctrine is intended to allow India's conventional forces to perform holding attacks in order to prevent a <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation</b> from Pakistan in case of a conflict.|$|R

50|$|In nuclear strategy, a second-strike {{capability}} is a country's assured {{ability to respond}} to a nuclear attack with powerful <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation</b> against the attacker. To have such an ability (and to convince an opponent of its viability) is considered vital in nuclear deterrence, as otherwise the other side might attempt to try to win a nuclear war in one massive first strike against its opponent's own nuclear forces.|$|R
50|$|This {{modelization}} {{gave the}} basis for the massive <b>retaliation</b> <b>nuclear</b> doctrine. The zero-sum fallacy and cooperative games would be theorized only later, while the evolution of nuclear technology and missiles made the massive <b>retaliation</b> <b>nuclear</b> strategy obsolete.|$|R
50|$|In nuclear warfare theory, a {{decapitation}} {{strike is}} a pre-emptive first strike attack {{that aims to}} destabilize an opponent's military and civil leadership structure {{in the hope that}} it will severely degrade or destroy its capacity for <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation.</b> It is essentially a subset of a counterforce strike but whereas a counterforce strike seeks to destroy weapons directly, a decapitation strike is designed to remove an enemy's ability to use its weapons.|$|R
5000|$|The Soviet {{deployment}} of the SS-20 missile from 1975 caused major concern in the NATO alliance. The longer range, greater accuracy, mobility and striking power of the new missile was perceived to alter the security of Western Europe. It was feared that the Soviet Union could launch a nuclear strike against Western Europe with a reduced threat of <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation</b> (i.e. compared to {{an attack on the}} continental United States). After discussions, NATO agreed to a two part strategy: ...|$|R
5000|$|Spatial Threshold - The {{military}} {{penetration of}} Indian Armed Forces into Pakistan {{on a large}} scale may elicit a nuclearized massive retaliation, if and only if the Pakistan Army is unable to stop such intervention. For instance, many analysts, including some Indians, believe that the Indus Valley— the [...] "lifeline" [...] of Pakistan— is one of many other [...] "red lines" [...] that Indian forces should not cross. The capture of key objectives in this crucial northeast-southwest axis might well provoke <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation</b> by Pakistan.|$|R
5000|$|The USSR {{took steps}} to ensure that <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation,</b> and hence deterrence, {{remained}} possible even if its leadership were to be destroyed in a surprise attack. In contrast, Thompson argues that Perimeter's function was to limit acts of misjudgment by political or military leadership in the tight decision-making window between SLBM/cruise missile launches and impact. He quotes Zheleznyakov on the purpose of Perimeter being [...] "to cool down all these hotheads and extremists. No matter what was going to happen, there still would be revenge." ...|$|R

[1] The introduction of {{tactical nuclear weapons}} (TNWs) into its inventory has been portrayed to have sufficiently lowered its nuclear threshold.

2500|$|With the {{development}} of more rapid-response technologies (such as rockets and long-range bombers), this policy began to shift. If the Soviet Union also had nuclear weapons and a policy of [...] "massive retaliation" [...] was carried out, it was reasoned, then any Soviet forces not killed in the initial attack, or launched while the attack was ongoing, would be able to serve their own form of <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation</b> against the U.S. Recognizing that this was an undesirable outcome, military officers and game theorists at the RAND think tank developed a nuclear warfare strategy that was eventually called Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD).|$|R

Taylor, of the CATO Institute, maintained that the effective, U.S. threat of <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation</b> halted Hussein from employing his chemical weapons. The locations of many of Iraq's chemical stockpiles were never uncovered and there is widespread speculation that U.S. troops were exposed to chemical munitions while destroying weapons caches, particularly near the Khamisiyah storage site. After the war, analysis suggested the chemical defense capabilities of U.S. forces were woefully inadequate {{during and after the}} conflict. In addition, some experts, such as Jonathan B. Tucker, suggest that the Iraqis did indeed employ chemical weapons during the war.|$|R
40|$|The Western Alliance {{model for}} {{deterrence}} theory {{is based on}} nuclear deterrence. The usual picture is that nuclear attack is deterred {{by the threat of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation.</b> But this cannot be the whole picture. After all, there are lots of countries which do not have nuclear weapons, are not in a nuclear alliance and are not attacked. How, then, would countries such as Peru, Burma, Switzerland or Mali, or more recently New Zealand, ever escape being attacked by nuclear weapons? One answer is that there would be probably little to be gained by such an attack. Why not? An incredibly important factor is the world outrage that would be turned against the attacker...|$|R
50|$|Nuclear {{peace is}} a theory of {{international}} relations that argues that under some circumstances nuclear weapons can induce stability and decrease the chances of crisis escalation. In particular, nuclear weapons {{are said to have}} induced stability during the Cold War, when both the US and the USSR possessed mutual second strike retaliation capability, eliminating the possibility of nuclear victory for either side. Proponents of nuclear peace argue that controlled nuclear proliferation may be beneficial for inducing stability. Critics of nuclear peace argue that nuclear proliferation not only increases the chance of interstate nuclear conflict, but increases the chances of nuclear material falling into the hands of violent non-state groups who are free from the threat of <b>nuclear</b> <b>retaliation.</b>|$|R
