25|$|Although {{trampoline}} {{competitors are}} highly trained, {{they are also}} attempting to perform complex manoeuvres {{which could lead to}} accidents and falls. Trampolines used in competitions have their springs covered in pads to reduce the chance of injury when landing off the bed. They also have padded end decks, which are the locations that athletes are most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>off</b> the trampoline. The rules for international competitions (updated by FIG in 2006) also require 200mm thick mats on the floor for 2 metres around each trampoline and for there to be four spotters whose task it is to attempt to catch or reduce the impact of an athlete falling {{off the side of the}} trampoline bed. The floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full; for example in the UK the requirement for National & Regional competition is still 2m but only of 20–25mm matting.|$|E
25|$|The stirrup, {{which gives}} greater {{stability}} to a rider, {{has been described}} {{as one of the most}} significant inventions in the history of warfare, prior to gunpowder. As a tool allowing expanded use of horses in warfare, the stirrup is often called the third revolutionary step in equipment, after the chariot and the saddle. The basic tactics of mounted warfare were significantly altered by the stirrup. A rider supported by stirrups was less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>off</b> while fighting, and could deliver a blow with a weapon that more fully employed the weight and momentum of horse and rider. Among other advantages, stirrups provided greater balance and support to the rider, which allowed the knight to use a sword more efficiently without falling, especially against infantry adversaries. Contrary to common modern belief, however, it has been asserted that stirrups actually did not enable the horseman to use a lance more effectively (cataphracts had used lances since antiquity), though the cantled saddle did.|$|E

50|$|Xenophon {{suggests}} {{using the}} volte {{as an exercise}} for the horse, as it makes him easy to turn in either direction and makes {{both sides of the}} mouth equally responsive. He also describes an ovular pattern, with a wheeling performed on the turns and galloping on the straight sections. However, he notes that on the curve the horse should be slowed, as it is unsafe to make a tight turn at high speeds, especially when the footing is slippery. When collecting the horse, the rider should try to use as little rein as possible. He should not change the incline of his body, as he is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> end up <b>falling</b> <b>off.</b> After the horse has been turned, he should immediately be urged to a fast gallop. This is to help him practice charging, which will be useful in battle.|$|R
6000|$|Never did the Knights of Arthur's Round Table {{meet in a}} stouter fight {{than did}} these two. In a moment Robin stepped quickly upon the bridge where the {{stranger}} stood; first he made a feint, and then delivered a blow at the stranger's head that, had it met its mark, would have tumbled him speedily into the water. But the stranger turned the blow right deftly and in return gave one as stout, which Robin also turned as the stranger had done. So they stood, each in his place, neither moving a finger's-breadth back, for one good hour, and many blows were given and received by each in that time, till here and there were sore bones and bumps, yet neither thought of crying [...] "Enough," [...] nor seemed <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> from <b>off</b> the bridge. Now and then they stopped to rest, and each thought that he never had seen in all his life before such a hand at quarterstaff. At last Robin gave the stranger a blow upon the ribs that made his jacket smoke like a damp straw thatch in the sun. So shrewd was the stroke that the stranger came within a hair's-breadth of <b>falling</b> <b>off</b> the bridge, but he regained himself right quickly and, by a dexterous blow, gave Robin a crack on the crown that caused the blood to flow. Then Robin grew mad with anger and smote {{with all his might}} at the other. But the stranger warded the blow and once again thwacked Robin, and this time so fairly that he fell heels over head into the water, as the queen pin falls in a game of bowls.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{reliability}} of wireless pedometers in measuring elementary school children’s physical activity. Activity measurement using a wireless pedometer Fitbit ZipTM was compared to activity measurement using Yamax Digi-WalkerTM SW 701 for a group of randomly selected 25 children in Grades 3, 4, and 5. Fitbit ZipTM wireless pedometers were found to have an appropriate degree (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994) of accuracy and reliability compared to the Yamax Digi-WalkerTM SW 701 pedometer. The Fitbit ZipTM wireless pedometer collected more step counts than the Yamax Digi-WalkerTM SW 701 pedometer; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Participants reported that they preferred wearing the Fitbit ZipTM to the Yamax Digi-WalkerTM SW 701 because the Fitbit ZipTM was more comfortable to wear and less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>off.</b> Participants also reported being more motivated to move while wearing the Fitbit ZipTM...|$|E

40|$|Student {{homelessness}} {{is on the}} rise, {{with more}} than 1. 3 million homeless students identified during the 2013 - 14 school year. This is a 7 percent increase {{from the previous year}} and more than double the number of homeless students in 2006 - 07. As high as these numbers seem, they are almost certainly undercounts. Despite increasing numbers, these students - as well as the school liaisons and state coordinators who support them - report that student homelessness remains an invisible and extremely disruptive problem. Students experiencing homelessness struggle to stay in school, to perform well, and to form meaningful connections with peers and adults. Ultimately, they are much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>off</b> track and eventually drop out of school more often than their non-homeless peers. This study: provides an overview of existing research on homeless students, sheds light on the challenges homeless students face and the supports they say they need to succeed, reports on the challenges adults - local liaisons and state coordinators - face in trying to help homeless students, and recommends changes in policy and practice at the school, community, state and national level to help homeless students get on a path to adult success. This is a critical and timely topic. The recent reauthorization of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) provides many new and stronger provisions for homeless students (effective Oct. 1, 2016); requires states, district and schools {{for the first time to}} report graduation rates for homeless students (effective beginning with the 2016 - 17 school year); and affirms the urgency and importance of dealing with homelessness so that all children can succeed...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focused on}} how visual and {{olfactory}} cue use by insects affect tritrophic interactions among the Arizona walnut, Juglans major (Juglandaceae), the fly Rhagoletis juglandis (Diptera: Tephritidae), whose larvae feed on the husk surrounding walnut fruits, and the parasitic wasp Biosteres juglandis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Opiinae) which oviposits in the fly larvae. The foraging behavior of female Biosteres juglandis was studied {{in the field and}} greenhouse, with specific attention paid to their use of visual and olfactory cues produced by walnut fruits harboring R. juglandis larvae. Field work demonstrated that wasps are successful in locating fruits infested with host larvae interspersed among uninfested fruits, and that they use fruit phenological traits (i. e. stage of rot) to do so. The method by which females appear to choose fruits in the field is functional, provided there are high host infestation levels. In greenhouse assays, fruit damage (apart from larval presence) was specifically identified as an important cue affecting wasp fruit choice. Wasps are also able to orient to infested fruits using only one type of cue, either olfactory or visual. Preliminary data from a pilot analysis of volatile compounds associated with infested, uninfested, and artificially damaged walnuts indicated that visual cues were more important than olfactory cues to free-foraging wasps. Rhagoletis juglandis adult females visit walnut fruits for oviposition, while adult males visit them to obtain matings. The effect of fruit color pattern on the behavior of male and female flies both inexperienced and experienced with real ripe walnuts was studied in the greenhouse. Overall, both sexes of flies exhibited a landing preference for plastic fruit models that appear ripe and uninfested, over models that appear infested. The behavior of both sexes may be driven by females who are attempting to provide offspring with the most possible food resources. Finally, the growth and germination of Arizona walnut seeds was followed to determine whether either was affected by infestation of the husk by R. juglandis. Although infested fruits were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>off</b> a tree sooner, this did not affect the size of a walnut or its ability to germinate...|$|E
