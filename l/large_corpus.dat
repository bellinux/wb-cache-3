25|$|Unlike other ancient Near Eastern gods, the Hebrew God {{is portrayed}} as unitary and solitary; consequently, the Hebrew God's {{principal}} relationships are not with other gods, but with the world, and more specifically, with the people he created.

According to the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), God promised Abraham to make of his offspring a great nation. Many generations later, he commanded the nation of Israel to love and worship only one God; that is, the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God's concern for the world. He also commanded the Jewish people to love one another; that is, Jews are to imitate God's love for people.

[...] "Fu on the Two Metropolises" [...] (Èr jīng fù [...] ) is considered Zhang's masterpiece. [...] Zhang spent ten years gathering material for the fu, a response to an earlier fu by Ban Gu that is a poetic comparison between the two capitals of the Han dynasty: Luoyang and Chang'an. [...] Zhang's fu is highly satirical and cleverly mocks many aspects of the Western Han period, including Emperor Wu himself The piece contains long passages colorfully describing life in the two capitals in great detail, including the entertainment areas.|$|E

[...] This led to the Spanish missionaries teaching Nahuatl to Indians living as far south as Honduras and El Salvador. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Classical Nahuatl was used as a literary language, and a <b>large</b> <b>corpus</b> of texts from that period exists today. Texts from this period include histories, chronicles, poetry, theatrical works, Christian canonical works, ethnographic descriptions, and administrative documents. The Spanish permitted a great deal of autonomy in the local administration of indigenous towns during this period, and in many Nahuatl speaking towns the language was the de facto administrative language both in writing and speech. A large body of Nahuatl literature was composed during this period, including the Florentine Codex, a twelve-volume compendium of Aztec culture compiled by Franciscan Bernardino de Sahagún; Crónica Mexicayotl, a chronicle of the royal lineage of Tenochtitlan by Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc; Cantares Mexicanos, a collection of songs in Nahuatl; a Nahuatl-Spanish/Spanish-Nahuatl dictionary compiled by Alonso de Molina; and the Huei tlamahuiçoltica, a description in Nahuatl of the apparition of the Our Lady of Guadalupe.|$|E

40|$|<b>Large</b> <b>corpora</b> {{are crucial}} {{resources}} for building many statistical language technology systems, and the Web is a readilyavailable source of {{vast amounts of}} linguistic data from which to construct such corpora. Nevertheless, little research has considered how to best build corpora from the Web. In this study we consider the importance of language identification in Web corpus construction. Beginning with a Web crawl consisting of documents identified as English using a standard language identification tool, we build corpora of varying sizes both with, and without, further filtering of non-English documents with a stateof-the-art language identifier. We show that the perplexity of a standard English corpus is lower under a language model trained from a Web corpus built with this extra language identification step, demonstrating the importance of state-of-the-art language identification in Web corpus construction. 1 The need for <b>large</b> <b>corpora</b> Corpora are essential resources for building language technology (LT) systems {{for a variety of}} applications. For example, frequency estimates for n-grams — which can be used to build a language model, a key component of many contemporary LT systems — are typically derived from corpora.

At sundown on Friday, the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing.

It is customary to have challah, two braided loaves of bread, on the table. During Shabbat, Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under 39 categories of melakhah, translated literally as [...] "work". In fact the activities banned on the Sabbath are not [...] "work" [...] in the usual sense: They include such actions as lighting a fire, writing, using money and carrying in the public domain.
