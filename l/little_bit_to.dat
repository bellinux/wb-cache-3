500|$|On November 16, 2013, it was {{revealed}} that West would be premiering the music video for [...] "Bound 2" [...] on The Ellen DeGeneres Show the following week. The Nick Knight-directed music video was released on November 19, 2013. The video features his then-fiancée Kim Kardashian, topless, riding atop West's motorbike through Monument Valley and other landscapes. Eric Diep of XXL described it as, [...] "a confident display of love and passion with little to no narrative." [...] Spin felt that [...] "a pretty bad idea seen through so completely that it stops being a bad idea". Tom Breihan from Stereogum found the video confusing, saying [...] "it'll take a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> figure out what all's going on there". Lanre Bakare of The Guardian described it as [...] "self-indulgent, idiosyncratic and a bit weird".|$|E
500|$|... "Bedtime Story" [...] has {{frequently}} {{been cited as}} one of the songs with the most unfulfilled potential in Madonna's career, nonetheless, the song did enjoy some success, being a club [...] "favorite" [...] in the mid-1990s. It has been described as the record that foreshadowed Madonna's usage of electronic music in her later work, especially Ray of Light (1998), which according to Vicente, owes [...] "its contemplative and electronic techno rave character to 'Bedtime Story'". O'Brien wrote in Madonna: Like an Icon, that the song [...] "foreshadowed [...] move towards electronica" [...] and labelled it an [...] "embryonic moment that went a lot further on the next few albums". De Vries recalled that tackling the song [...] "seemed to set something free in Madonna. She was straining at the leash a <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>to</b> find some other languages to speak, and 'Bedtime Story' was an embryonic moment that went a lot further on to the next few albums." [...] In a review for the Bedtime Stories album on a whole, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the song was [...] "the germ that would later inspire Madonna to seek out and conquer electronica with the likes of William Orbit and Mirwais".|$|E
500|$|... "Worst Episode Ever" [...] {{was written}} by Larry Doyle and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February4,2001. The episode was originally called [...] "The Fiver", {{a reference to a}} scene in the episode that was eventually removed. The episode title was then changed to [...] "Worst Episode Ever", a title which the staff were amused by. According to Doyle, [...] "Worst Episode Ever" [...] is the first episode in which Comic Book Guy has a major role. Because Comic Book Guy is usually sarcastic and unfriendly, the series' staff found it hard to make the character seem likable. For example, Hank Azaria, who plays Comic Book Guy among other characters in the series, had a difficult time trying to make the character sound sincere. [...] "Comic Book Guy only ever pronounces things sarcastically", Azaria said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It was hard {{to find a way to}} sound believable and have him say sincere things. It took a lot of different takes." [...] Executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said, [...] "It's tough when you take a character like Comic Book Guy or Krusty or Moe, to make them suddenly sympathetic and vulnerable. You have to cheat the character a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> open them up emotionally a little more." ...|$|E

2500|$|Malfoy {{grew into}} one of the series' most popular {{characters}} due to Felton's performances and Felton quickly became synonymous with the character to many female fans, much to Rowling's dismay. [...] "I'm trying to clearly distinguish between Tom Felton, who is a good looking young boy, and Draco, who, whatever he looks like, is not a nice man. It’s a romantic, but unhealthy, and unfortunately all too common delusion of girls ... it actually worried me a <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>to</b> see young girls swearing undying devotion to this really imperfect character ... I mean, I understand the psychology of it, but it is pretty unhealthy." [...] Rowling has also noted that Malfoy [...] "is certainly stylish in the film." ...|$|E

[...] From this point, the road passes {{to the east}} of the Ancora Psychiatric Hospital and intersects Center Drive before coming to Lake Drive. Following this intersection, it passes between several small sized lakes within heavily forested areas before heading through some farm fields. Here, the road intersects CR 721 (East Central Avenue).

Little Golden Books published Gremlins 2: The New Batch: Gizmo to the Rescue in July 1990. In the United Kingdom, William Heinemann Ltd. had published two tie-in picture books from Buzz Books in August 1990 which contains photographs and scenes {{taken from the}} film. They were titled Don't Get Wet and Midnight Feast. Buzz Books had also released other picture books that are particularly suitable for children such as Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends, Fireman Sam, TUGS, The Flintstones, The Animals of Farthing Wood, Looney Tunes, Bugs Bunny, Joshua Jones and Rupert. David Bischoff wrote a novel based on the film published by Avon Books in June 1990. A unique aspect {{of the novel is}} how Bischoff adapts the sequence where the film breaks. In the novel, the Brain Gremlin subdues and locks Bischoff in his bathroom before taking the reins for a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> explain that the Gremlins take over {{at this point in the}} film, his displeasure at Bischoff using the nickname [...] "Mr. Glasses" [...] instead of his official name, and begins a treatise on politics before Bischoff breaks his way out of the bathroom with an axe and subdues the Brain Gremlin. The novel then continues where the film picked up after the film break.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{producers}} of the album was Guy Roche, who produced two tracks ("What a Girl Wants" [...] and [...] "I Turn to You") and co-wrote one of them ("What a Girl Wants"), along with Shelly Peiken. [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] was later re-recorded for its single release, replacing the [...] "lighter" [...] version for a more [...] "funky" [...] R version. Peiken also re-wrote with Roche the single version for the track [...] "Come on Over", first produced by Johan Aberg, Paul Rein and Aaron Zigman. According to herself, [...] "We're {{going to give it}} more of an edge, R it up a little, maybe rock it out a little, give it a lot of different new directions and get it out there." [...] Aguilera also recorded a cover of All-4-One's song [...] "I Turn to You", written by Diane Warren. Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers (who would eventually broke into the scene as the producers who launched Rihanna's career) wrote and produced two tracks, while the then up-and-coming Robin Thicke co-wrote and co-produced [...] "When You Put Your Hands on Me". Franne Golde (who previously worked with Whitney Houston) also wrote a song for Aguilera. At the final stages, producer and songwriter David Frank presented a song called [...] "Genie in a Bottle", which Aguilera almost didn't record, [...] "because {{there were a lot of}} other artists out there that were after this song, so we had to fight a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> get it," [...] she claimed. With Heather Holley, Aguilera also co-wrote a track called [...] "I Will Be", which she said was inspired by Mariah Carey's [...] "Vanishing". Producer of the track [...] "So Emotional" [...] revealed that Aguilera in-between recordings [...] "she was only listening to Mariah Carey and Brandy, putting on her walk man and practicing their riffs and runs, before she did her ad-libs.|$|E

60|$|Just as he {{had about}} {{made up his mind}} that {{there was nothing to do}} but to try to find his way home, his keen little ears caught the faintest rustle of dry leaves.

No Wood Mouse who wants to live long is ever heedless of rustling leaves. As still as if he couldn't move, Whitefoot sat staring at the place from which that faint sound had seemed to come. For two or three minutes he heard and saw nothing. Then another leaf rustled a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> one side. Whitefoot turned like a flash, his feet gathered under him ready for a long jump for safety.|$|E

It comes back to me that what I was most full of while your face signed to me and your voice then so graciously confirmed it, and while too, as I've said, Long walked away--what I was most full of, as a consequence of another go, just ended, at Lady John, was, once more, this same Lady John's want of adjustability to the character you and I, in our associated speculation of the morning, had so candidly tried to fit her with. I was still even then, you see, speculating--all on my own hook, alas!--and it had just rolled over me with renewed force that she was nothing whatever, not the least <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>to</b> our purpose.

6000|$|Yet he was far, {{he could}} still remind himself, from supposing {{that she had been}} grossly remunerated. He was wholly sure she hadn't; for if there were people who took {{presents}} and people who didn't she would be quite on the right side and of the proud class. Only then, on the other hand, her disinterestedness was rather awful--it implied, that is, such abysses of confidence. She was admirably attached to Maggie--whose possession of such a friend might moreover quite rank as one of her [...] "assets"; but the great proof of her affection had been in bringing them, with her design, together. Meeting him during a winter in Rome, meeting him afterwards in Paris, and [...] "liking" [...] him, as she had in time frankly let him know from the first, she had marked him for her young friend's own and had then, unmistakably, presented him in a light. But the interest in Maggie--that was the point--would have achieved but little without her interest in HIM. On what did that sentiment, unsolicited and unrecompensed, rest? what good, again--for it was much like his question about Mr. Verver--should he ever have done her? The Prince's notion of a recompense to women--similar in this to his notion of an appeal--was more or less to make love to them. Now he hadn't, as he believed, made love the least <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Assingham--nor did he think she had for a moment supposed it. He liked in these days, to mark them off, the women to whom he hadn't made love: it represented-- and that was what pleased him in it--a different stage of existence from the time at which he liked to mark off the women to whom he had. Neither, with all this, had Mrs. Assingham herself been either aggressive or resentful. On what occasion, ever, had she appeared to find him wanting? These things, the motives of such people, were obscure--a little alarmingly so; they contributed to that element of the impenetrable which alone slightly qualified his sense of his good fortune. He remembered to have read, as a boy, a wonderful tale by Allan Poe, his prospective wife's countryman-which was a thing to show, by the way, what imagination Americans COULD have: the story of the shipwrecked Gordon Pym, who, drifting in a small boat further toward the North Pole--or was it the South?--than anyone had ever done, found at a given moment before him a thickness of white air that was like a dazzling curtain of light, concealing as darkness conceals, yet of the colour of milk or of snow. There were moments when he felt his own boat move upon some such mystery. The state of mind of his new friends, including Mrs. Assingham herself, had resemblances to a great white curtain. He had never known curtains but as purple even to blackness--but as producing where they hung a darkness intended and ominous. When they were so disposed as to shelter surprises the surprises were apt to be shocks.|$|E
