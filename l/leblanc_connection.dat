40|$|Four-phase {{transmission}} {{lines have been}} recently proposed and studied {{as an alternative to}} the traditional threephase lines. The identification of the best transformer typology to link the three-phase and four-phase system sections is still an open problem, despite some specific solutions were proposed. However, these solutions were not included in a general framework yet. Resorting to the classic Parton’s theory of phase transformation and to a rigorous mathematical approach, this study provides a general framework for the specific problem in study. After having recalled the underlying principles of the Parton’s theory of phase transformation, by formulating proper optimisation problems and solving them using a rigorous mathematical procedure, this study derives several solutions for three-tofour phase transformation, some of which were never proposed yet. This way, both traditional solutions (T-connection, <b>Leblanc</b> <b>connection,</b> Scott connection) and more recent proposals are described together with the new solutions within one common framework...|$|E
