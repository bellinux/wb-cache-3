Eddie Gilbert and Rick Steiner defended the titles against Varsity Club members Kevin Sullivan and Dan Spivey. As the match started, Spivey {{attacked}} Steiner outside the floor and drove him into the ringpost, thus putting him out of action. This gave control of the match to Spivey and Sullivan, who double-teamed Gilbert throughout the match. Steiner recovered and climbed on the apron for a false tag. This caused a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion,</b> which caused Steiner to deliver a Lariat, which he called Steiner-Line, to Sullivan, allowing Gilbert to pin Sullivan with a Sunset Flip to retain the titles.|$|E

There is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> concerning the North Korean Ch'ŏnma-ho main battle tank which is sometimes {{considered to be an}} upgrade of Type 62 light tank. This is incorrect as the Ch'ŏnma-ho main battle tank is based on the Soviet T-62 main battle tank. This originated from the fact that many times tanks like Type 59 and Type 62 are listed as T-59 and T-62. This leads to many confusions which in turn lead to, for example, listing the Albania as T-62 main battle tank operator and calling the Ch'ŏnma-ho main battle tank an upgrade of Type 62 light tank. It's not clear which nations still have them in service, although based on available knowledge it seems that all original users still have it either on active or reserve status except for North Korea which didn't have them in service as of 1995.|$|E
