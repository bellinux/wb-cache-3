25|$|A {{secondary}} buyout {{is a form}} of {{leveraged buyout}} where both the buyer and the seller are private equity firms or financial sponsors (i.e., a leveraged buyout of a company that was acquired through a leveraged buyout). A secondary buyout will often provide a clean break for the selling private equity firms and its <b>limited</b> <b>partner</b> investors. Historically, given that secondary buyouts were perceived as distressed sales by both seller and buyer, <b>limited</b> <b>partner</b> investors considered them unattractive and largely avoided them.|$|E
25|$|Private equity {{fundraising}} {{refers to}} the action of private equity firms seeking capital from investors for their funds. Typically an investor will invest in a specific fund managed by a firm, becoming a <b>limited</b> <b>partner</b> in the fund, rather than an investor in the firm itself. As a result, an investor will only benefit from investments made by a firm where the investment is made from the specific fund {{in which it has}} invested.|$|E
50|$|The Institutional <b>Limited</b> <b>Partners</b> Association (ILPA) is a trade {{association}} for institutional <b>limited</b> <b>partners</b> {{in the private}} equity asset class.|$|R
50|$|Like {{shareholders}} in a corporation, <b>limited</b> <b>partners</b> have <b>limited</b> liability. This {{means that}} the <b>limited</b> <b>partners</b> have no management authority, and (unless they obligate themselves by a separate contract such as a guaranty) are not liable for the debts of the partnership. The limited partnership provides the <b>limited</b> <b>partners</b> a return on their investment (similar to a dividend), {{the nature and extent}} of which is usually defined in the partnership agreement. General Partners thus bear more economic risk than do <b>limited</b> <b>partners,</b> and in cases of financial loss, the GPs will be the ones which are personally liable.|$|R
50|$|A limited {{partnership}} (有限合伙) is formed {{by a combination}} of general <b>partners</b> and <b>limited</b> <b>partners</b> where the <b>limited</b> <b>partners</b> bear the liabilities for the partnership's debts to the extent of their capital contributions.|$|R
500|$|As {{the market}} for private equity matured, so too did its {{investor}} base. [...] The Institutional <b>Limited</b> <b>Partner</b> Association was initially founded as an informal networking group for <b>limited</b> <b>partner</b> investors in private equity funds in the early 1990s. [...] However the organization would evolve into an advocacy organization for private equity investors with more than 200 member organizations from 10 countries. [...] As {{of the end of}} 2007, ILPA members had total assets under management in excess of $5 trillion with more than $850 billion of capital commitments to private equity investments.|$|E
500|$|Dan Topping, Larry MacPhail, and Del Webb {{purchased}} the Yankees from Ruppert's estate in 1945. Topping and Webb forced MacPhail {{out of the}} Yankees ownership group due to his confrontational behavior after the 1947 World Series. In 1964, Topping and Webb sold the team to CBS, during which time the franchise struggled. Selling the team at a loss, CBS sold the team to a group headed by George Steinbrenner in 1973. While Steinbrenner initially owned {{less than half of}} the team, he bought out many of his partners, eventually owning 70% of the team. John McMullen, one of Steinbrenner's limited partners, said, [...] "There is nothing in life quite so limited as being a <b>limited</b> <b>partner</b> of George Steinbrenner." ...|$|E
500|$|Less than {{a decade}} into its {{ownership}} of the Yankees, CBS moved to sell the team in 1972. In eight years, the team posted an $11million loss under CBS; losing money in all but two years. Along with the decrease in attendance, the Yankees' television revenues fell by more than 80 percent from their peak, and in 1973 were more than $1million below what the Mets earned from their broadcasting agreement. A group of investors, led by Cleveland-based shipbuilder George Steinbrenner, purchased the club from CBS on January 3, 1973 for $10million. Despite an initial promise that he would [...] "stick to building ships" [...] and remain in the background, Steinbrenner {{proved to be a}} hands-on owner, clashing with Burke and forcing him out of his leadership position. Describing the level of control displayed by the lead owner, investor John McMullen stated, [...] "There is nothing in life quite so limited as being a <b>limited</b> <b>partner</b> of George Steinbrenner." ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{one or more}} persons called <b>limited</b> <b>partners,</b> who {{contribute}} a sum/sums of money as capital, or property valued at a stated amount. <b>Limited</b> <b>partners</b> are not liable for the debts and obligations of the firm beyond the amount contributed.|$|R
50|$|These {{are where}} {{one or more}} general {{partners}} enter or allow <b>limited</b> <b>partners</b> to go into business with them. <b>Limited</b> <b>partners</b> often called sleeping <b>partners</b> have <b>limited</b> liability where general partners have full liability arranged in their agreement of partnership.|$|R
50|$|In {{a limited}} {{partnership}} the general partners manage the firm while the <b>limited</b> <b>partners</b> may not. And should <b>limited</b> <b>partners</b> do so, then they become personally {{liable for the}} debts of obligations of the firm {{in the same manner}} as a general partner.|$|R

2500|$|Lexington is a {{dedicated}} secondaries investor {{and like many}} of its peers has limited ability to make new commitments to private equity funds. [...] While in certain instances this impacts the firm's desirability to general partners as a replacement <b>limited</b> <b>partner,</b> Lexington does make strategic commitments to newly formed private equity funds. The firm also manages equity co-investment vehicles that invest alongside global private equity sponsors. [...] Lexington’s secondary funds have committed to over 350 newly formed private equity funds while Lexington’s co-investment funds have committed to invest over $4.4 billion in 260 co-investments in the U.S., Europe and Asia.|$|E

50|$|Institutional investors {{investing}} as <b>limited</b> <b>partners</b> {{in private}} equity funds criticize the practice of club deals that results in holdings in the same investment through different funds.

2500|$|Some of the {{techniques}} that Romney employed during this temporary mission at Bain & Company were as follows: at the outset, he demanded unanimous approval from the partners at Bain & Company for his designation as CEO, and also demanded that each partner commit to staying {{at least a year}} so as to give the turnaround a fair chance. [...] He <b>limited</b> <b>partner</b> meetings to Saturdays, so that all of the weekdays could be devoted to taking care of client business. [...] Romney reduced the company's physical space, evaluated which partners were producing and which were not, arranged bridge financing, and focused on hiring top talent from top schools, while rescinding prior offers that were not up to standard.|$|E
