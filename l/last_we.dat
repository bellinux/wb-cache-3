25|$|However we find, in the Blackwell {{papers in}} the National Library of Ireland that, in August 1816, by Royal Ordinance dated 24 July of that same year, Jacques Bartholomew Blackwell, Chef d’Escadron, was {{appointed}} Governor of La Petite Pierre. A document issued, in July 1819, from the Grand chancellor of the Legion of Honour, to M. Blackwell, Chef d’Escadron, Lieutenant of the King, resident in Faubourg Saint Germaine, is the <b>last</b> <b>we</b> hear of James Bartholomew Blackwell. This document confirms him as Brevet-Officer of the Royal Order of the Legion of Honour, which would bring with it a yearly payment of 20 francs. His date of death remains a mystery; at best a speculation. It is likely however that his body is interned in Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.|$|E

And if this is indeed the <b>last</b> <b>we</b> see of William, well, I’m not going to complain!

500|$|Robinson {{settled in}} the village of Langrish, near Petersfield in east Hampshire. He died peacefully at Haslar Naval Hospital, Gosport, on 20 August 1965 and was laid to rest at St John's, the village church he had served for 20 years as warden. For unknown reasons, his grave was without a headstone until 1998, {{although}} a large plaque to him was dedicated by his sister in 1969 and surmounts the altar. Following investigations by the Naval VC Association, his grave was discovered and a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone erected. At the dedication ceremony, attended [...] by over 150 friends, relatives, Masons and servicemen, Admiral Derek Reffell gave the eulogy which stated: [...] "The admiral was a hero, but more importantly he was a naval man from the finest mould. Now at <b>last</b> <b>we</b> can accord him the dignity he deserves." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the Imperial Review in November 1805 stated, [...] "something should {{be said of the}} language. This undoubtedly is not its chief excellence. The style, in many places, is trailing, flat, and uninteresting,—deficient both in strength and animation. The author seldoms avails himself of any artificial ornaments [...] Though we feel ourselves compelled to make these observations, it is hardly necessary to add, that upon the whole we think very highly of this performance." [...] The review continues by comparing Madoc to Paradise Lost: [...] "were the style adorned by a little artificial colouring, and enriched with all the allowable decorations of poetry, Madoc would hardly yield to Paradise Lost. As it stands, it is certainly the second heroic production in the English language. Its leading characteristics are not fire and sublimity, but tenderness and humanity. Milton astonishes the head—Southey touches the heart. The first we may admire—the <b>last</b> <b>we</b> can love." ...|$|E

500|$|After twelve rehearsals, the {{orchestra}} {{made its debut}} at the Queen's Hall on 7 October 1932, conducted by Beecham. [...] After the first item, Berlioz's Roman Carnival Overture, the audience went wild, some of them standing on their seats to clap and shout. In The Sunday Times Ernest Newman wrote, [...] "Nothing so electrifying has been heard in a London concert room for years. The tone was magnificent, the precision perfect, the reading a miracle of fire and beauty, and the enthusiasm of the audience {{could not have been}} greater." [...] In The Times H C Colles said that the LPO was [...] "as fine an instrument as could be wished for"; Neville Cardus wrote in The Manchester Guardian, [...] "nothing more sumptuous and daring in orchestral playing could be heard in more than three other cities between New York and Vienna"; and W J Turner, of The Illustrated London News, praised {{the orchestra}}'s [...] "youthful dash and virtuosity... at <b>last</b> <b>we</b> have an independent orchestra which rivals the BBC Symphony Orchestra".|$|E
500|$|Morgan (Digital Spy) {{disapproved of}} the Babe's [...] "drawn out" [...] {{departure}} {{and noted that}} she [...] "lost count" [...] {{with the amount of}} chances Mick and Linda provided Babe with. She also described the character as a [...] "poisonous old cow" [...] and a [...] "cruel cook". Babe's departure appeared in an article published by Digital Spy, which compiled ten unmissable soap storylines airing the week the episode was broadcast. Its reporter, Kilkelly, warned that viewers could expect to see Babe's [...] "recent bad behaviour" [...] catching up with the Carter family. Lindsay (Metro) described Babe's final episode as [...] "dramatic" [...] and opined that he would [...] "certainly miss her antics and deliciously poisonous dialogue." [...] Kate White (Inside Soap) said that EastEnders should [...] "hang on" [...] to Babe, giving the reasons that [...] "she always makes things happen", [...] "she's genuinely very sinister" [...] and [...] "she's so entertaining", stating that her various scams show that she is [...] "totally fearless when it comes to taking on the locals" [...] and can be [...] "relied upon to generate entertaining storylines—something Walford has been short of lately". White {{went on to say that}} Babe [...] "can do more than [...] in a week with just one evil look" [...] and called her [...] "properly unhinged", saying that [...] "Babe is the sort of silent threat that many underestimate at their peril". Finally, White said that Badland had [...] "used every look and gesture to build up Babe's eccentric personality, and has been able to skip lightly frin dark to hilarious in a hearbeat. Babe has had us in stitches over the years, as well as frightening us silly. Surely you'd be mad to let go of a character that versatile?" [...] Writing about Babe's final words, where she curses the Carter family and The Queen Victoria, an Inside Soap writer said, [...] "The departing Aunt Babe, raging into the storm like some Disney witch, was the undoubted highlight of our soap week." [...] Tyler (Inside Soap) said that Babe's departure [...] "was the most wonderfully outrageous episode of EastEnders in months. Annette Badland's roar, as Babe cursed the entire Square, was camp, shameless, preposterous—and soap gold. We sincerely hope this isn't the <b>last</b> <b>we</b> see of her. Babe's revenge plot is too much fun to waste!" ...|$|E
500|$|Verne Gay of Newsday {{described}} it as [...] "another fine, fine Lost". [...] The San Diego Union-Tribunes Karla Peterson gave the episode an [...] "A", calling it [...] "one of those dense, chewy episodes in {{which a lot of}} stuff happened to a lot of people, and the foundation was laid for one hell of a season finale." [...] She praised Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Jorge Garcia, Elizabeth Mitchell and Jeremy Davies's work in [...] "Something Nice Back Home", while Tom Iacuzio of The Daytona Beach News-Journal deemed Jeremy Davies's performance deserving of an Emmy Award. [...] The Palm Beach Posts Kevin Thompson [...] "thought [...] Matthew [...] did a nice job conveying a wide range of emotions—scared, haunted, frustration, horny, jealousy, just to name a few." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "was partly a transitional passage in the Lost saga, a busywork episode designed to put all the characters in position for the year's big finale" [...] and [...] " [...] appendicitis [...] the kind of hardcore castaway survival plotline we haven't really seen since season 1. [...] Combined with a strong character-driven flash story, it was very old school Lost." [...] Jensen also [...] "liked how the episode neatly neutralized one of [...] least favorite season 4 moments, the Jack-Juliet smooch". [...] TV Guides Michael Ausiello wrote that [...] "Fox quietly solidified his status as one of the tube's most reliable and unshowy stalwarts" [...] and deemed him deserving of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV gave the episode a positive review, saying that he was [...] "shocked and baffled" [...] and writing that [...] "Lost … can give me an exciting, well-done episode while making me fear where the series is going … [...] ghosts aren't my thing." [...] The Huffington Posts Jay Glatfelter decided that [...] "what made this episode great was the fact that it just contained so much story [...] Jack's flashforward [...] this one of his most interesting 'centric' episodes. … Not only was Jack's story interesting for a change, but the inclusion of [...] other characters … and giving them great story and character development [...]" [...] Daniel of TMZ graded [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] as a [...] "B". [...] In his recap, he wrote that [...] "if that's the <b>last</b> <b>we</b> ever see of Claire again, that would be BEYOND awesome." ...|$|E
