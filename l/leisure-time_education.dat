40|$|Introduction One of {{the primary}} aims for {{physical}} education is to provide young people with the necessary skills, knowledge and competence to chose and participate in health-related physical activity in their <b>leisure-time.</b> Physical <b>education</b> stands in an advantageous position for promoting the benefits of extra-mural physical activity as it addresses young, diverse, and captive audiences (Fox & Biddle, 1989). Importantly, it is through physical education that young people experience a variety of physical activities and it is these experiences that may determine involvement in leisure-time. Nevertheless, there is a relatively little research outlining how physical education teachers or physical education programmes can effectively orient young people towards regular leisure-time physical activity outside of school. In the present study we propose and evaluate a theory of social cognition, known as the trans-contextual model, to explain the psychological processes by which young peopl...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} based on the {{findings}} of a broader research project entitled 'Childhood Participation and Citizenship Building', which examined the medium-term effects of intense experiences of participation in childhood within both the school environment and those of <b>leisure-time</b> and community <b>education.</b> The results presented in this article refer specifically to the memories subjects hold of their participation in these childhood experiences. The study combined quantitative (using a questionnaire) and qualitative approaches (conducting in-depth interviews). The results obtained contribute to strengthening the idea explicit or implicit in all pedagogies that seek to promote child participation that such participation is not only a right, but that it also contributes to the quality of educational experiences...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The current {{political}} agenda aims to promote active environments {{and physical activity}} while commuting to work, but research on it has provided mixed results. This study examines whether the proximity of green space and people's residence in different travel-related urban zones contributes to commuting physical activity. METHODS Population-based cross-sectional health examination survey, Health 2011 study, and geographical information system (GIS) data were utilized. The GIS data on green space and travel-related urban zones were linked to the individuals of the Health 2011 study, based on their home geocoordinates. Commuting physical activity was self-reported. Logistic regression models were applied, and age, gender, <b>education,</b> <b>leisure-time</b> and occupational physical activity were adjusted. Analyses were limited to those of working age, living in the core-urban areas of Finland and having completed information on commuting physical activity (n[*]=[*] 2 098).

25|$|Since the 1980s, {{the museums}} have {{experienced}} simultaneous trends toward popularization and aestheticization. The ensuing decades have {{been marked by}} a wave of new museum buildings whose avant-garde architecture has achieved international prominence. Contributing considerably to popularization was the exhibition concept of the Musée Sentimental, which focuses on the world of un-prosaic everyday culture and experience {{and led to a}} 1989 exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung). The annual Basel Museum Night tallies around a hundred thousand museum visits while the museums attract a total of approximately 1.4 million visitors throughout the year (as of 2006). The general population credits the museums with “a leading role in providing <b>leisure-time</b> opportunities for <b>education</b> and learning”. Museums operate in an environment that is increasingly subject to the conditions of both the leisure market and the free market, and are recognized as an important economic and locational factor. In contrast to the state, the use of private funds in the museum field has grown considerably. Funding from patrons or sponsors plays an increasingly significant role in the financing of exhibitions, parts of collections or entire museums and is thus highly sought after. This competitive situation is further reflected in the considerable institutional autonomy of the Basel-City museums, which are the only governmental enterprises in the canton operating under the private-sector influenced method of New Public Management.|$|R
40|$|Background: Lifestyle factors, {{including}} {{food and}} nutrition, physical activity, body composition and reproductive factors, and {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) are associated with breast cancer risk, but few studies of these factors have been performed in the Japanese population. Thus, the goals {{of this study were}} to validate the association between reported SNPs and breast cancer risk in the Japanese population and to evaluate the effects of SNP genotypes and lifestyle factors on breast cancer risk. Methods: A case-control study in 472 patients and 464 controls was conducted from December 2010 to November 2011. Lifestyle was examined using a self-administered questionnaire. We analyzed 16 breast cancer-associated SNPs based on previous GWAS or candidate-gene association studies. Age or multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were estimated from logistic regression analyses. Results: High BMI and current or former smoking were significantly associated with an increased breast cancer risk, while intake of meat, mushrooms, yellow and green vegetables, coffee, and green tea, current <b>leisure-time</b> exercise, and <b>education</b> were significantly associated with a decreased risk. Three SNPs were significantly associated with a breast cancer risk in multivariate analysis: rs 2046210 (per allele OR = 1. 37 [95 % CI: 1. 11 - 1. 70]), rs 3757318 (OR = 1. 33 [1. 05 - 1. 69]), and rs 3803662 (OR = 1. 28 [1. 07 - 1. 55]). In 2046210 risk allele carriers, leisure-time exercise was associated with a significantly decreased risk for breast cancer, whereas current smoking and high BMI were associated with a significantly decreased risk in non-risk allele carriers. Conclusion: In Japanese women, rs 2046210 and 3757318 located near the ESR 1 gene are associated with a risk of breast cancer, as in other Asian women. However, our findings suggest that exercise can decrease this risk in allele carriers...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the extent that {{different}} domains contribute to total sedentary (SED), light (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). We aimed to identify domain-specific physical activity (PA) patterns in school-aged children who were assessed by questionnaire and accelerometry. For the study, 298 German school children and adolescents aged 6 – 17 years wore an accelerometer for one week and completed a PA recall-questionnaire for the same period. Spearman coefficients (r) were used to evaluate the agreement between self-reported and objectively measured PA in five domains (transport, school hours, physical <b>education,</b> <b>leisure-time,</b> organized sports activities). School hours mainly contributed to the total objectively measured SED, LPA and MVPA (55 %, 53 % and 46 %, respectively), whilst sports activities contributed only 24 % to total MVPA. Compared to accelerometry, the proportion of self-reported LPA and MVPA during school hours was substantially underestimated but overestimated during leisure-time. The agreement of self-reported and objectively measured PA was low for total LPA (r = 0. 09, 95 % CI (confidence interval) : − 0. 03 – 0. 20) and total MVPA (r = 0. 21, 95 % CI: 0. 10 – 0. 32), while moderate agreement was only found for total SED (r = 0. 44, 95 % CI: 0. 34 – 0. 53), LPA during transport (r = 0. 59; 95 % CI: 0. 49 – 0. 67) and MVPA during organized sports activities (r = 0. 54; 95 % CI: 0. 38 – 0. 67). Since school hours mainly contribute to total SED, LPA and MVPA and self-reported LPA and MVPA during school were importantly underestimated compared to objectively measured LPA and MVPA, the application of objective measurements is compulsory to characterize the entire activity pattern of school-aged children...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Common {{variation}} in the CHRNA 5 -CHRNA 3 -CHRNB 4 gene region is robustly associated with smoking quantity. Conversely, the association between {{one of the most}} significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs 1051730 within the CHRNA 3 gene) with perceived difficulty or willingness to quit smoking among current smokers is unknown. METHODS: Cross-sectional study including current smokers, 502 women, and 552 men. Heaviness of smoking index (HSI), difficulty, attempting, and intention to quit smoking were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: The rs 1051730 SNP was associated with increased HSI (age, gender, and education-adjusted mean ± SE: 2. 6 ± 0. 1, 2. 2 ± 0. 1, and 2. 0 ± 0. 1 for AA, AG, and GG genotypes, respectively, p <. 01). Multivariate logistic regression adjusting for gender, age, <b>education,</b> <b>leisure-time</b> physical activity, and personal history of cardiovascular or lung disease showed rs 1051730 to be associated with higher smoking dependence (odds ratio [OR] and 95 % CI for each additional A-allele: 1. 38 [1. 11 - 1. 72] for smoking more than 20 cigarette equivalents/day; 1. 31 [1. 00 - 1. 71] for an HSI ≥ 5 and 1. 32 [1. 05 - 1. 65] for smoking 5 min after waking up) and borderline associated with difficulty to quit (OR = 1. 29 [0. 98 - 1. 70]), but this relationship was no longer significant after adjusting for nicotine dependence. Also, no relationship was found with willingness (OR = 1. 03 [0. 85 - 1. 26]), attempt (OR = 1. 00 [0. 83 - 1. 20]), or preparation (OR = 0. 95 [0. 38 - 2. 38]) to quit. Similar findings were obtained for other SNPs, but their effect on nicotine dependence was no longer significant after adjusting for rs 1051730. Conclusions: These data confirm the effect of rs 1051730 on nicotine dependence but failed to find any relationship with difficulty, willingness, and motivation to quit...|$|R

Home location in a pedestrian zone of a main centre (odds ratio[*]=[*] 1. 63; 95 % confidence interval[*]=[*] 1. 06 - 2. 51) or a pedestrian zone of a sub-centre (2. 03; 1. 09 - 3. 80) and higher proportion of cycling and pedestrian networks (3. 28; 1. 71 - 6. 31) contributed {{to higher levels of}} commuting physical activity. The contribution remained after adjusting for all the environmental attributes and individuals. Based on interaction analyses, women living in a public transport zone were almost two {{times more likely to be}} physically active while commuting compared to men. A high proportion of recreational green space contributed negatively to the levels of commuting physical activity (0. 73; 0. 57 - 0. 94) after adjusting for several background factors. Based on interaction analyses, individuals aged from 44 to 54 years and living in sub-centres, men living in pedestrian zones of sub-centres, and those individuals who are physically inactive during leisure-time were less likely to be physically active while commuting. Good pedestrian and cycling infrastructure may play an important role in promoting commuting physical activity among the employed population, regardless of educational background, leisure-time and occupational physical activity.
