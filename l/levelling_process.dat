60|$|An {{afternoon}} in the late November of 1903. Frost, gales, and abundant rains have more than half stripped the oaks of their yellow leaves. But the rain is over now, the sky once more a pure lucid blue above me--all around me, in fact, since I am standing high {{on the top of}} the ancient stupendous earthwork, grown over with oak wood and underwood of holly and thorn and hazel with tangle of ivy and bramble and briar. It is marvellously still; no sound from the village reaches me; I only hear the faint rustle of the dead leaves as they fall, and the robin, for one spied me here and has come to keep me company. At intervals he spurts out his brilliant little fountain of sound; and that sudden bright melody and the bright colour of the sunlit translucent leaves seem like one thing. Nature is still, and I am still, standing concealed among trees, or moving cautiously through the dead russet bracken. Not that I am expecting to get a glimpse of the badger who has his hermitage in this solitary place, but I am on forbidden ground, in the heart of a sacred pheasant preserve, where one must do one's prowling warily. Hard by, almost within a stone's-throw of the wood-grown earthwork on which I stand, are the ruinous walls of Roman Calleva--the Silchester which the antiquarians have been occupied in uncovering these dozen years or longer. The stone walls, too, like the more ancient earthwork, are overgrown with trees and brambles and ivy. The trees have grown upon the wall, sending roots deep down between the stones, through the crumbling cement; and so fast are they anchored that never a tree falls but it brings down huge masses of masonry with it. This slow <b>levelling</b> <b>process</b> has been going on for centuries, and it was doubtless in this way that the buildings within the walls were pulled down long ages ago. Then the action of the earth-worms began, and floors and foundations, with fallen stones and tiles, were gradually buried in the soil, and what was once a city was a dense thicket of oak and holly and thorn. Finally the wood was cleared, and the city was a walled wheat field--so far as we know, the ground has been cultivated since the days of King John. But the entire history of this green walled space before me--less than twenty centuries in duration--does not seem so very long compared with that of the huge earthen wall I am standing on, which dates back to prehistoric times.|$|E

After explaining the different quantitative weight of Aragonese colonists in the various Valencian areas, with very little presence in the north of Castelló, a review is made of Aragonese society in the 12 th century, focusing on those traits having an influence on the linguistic <b>levelling</b> <b>process</b> with their contemporary Catalan colonists in Valencian areas. Emphasis is made on the linguistic duality between Aragonese and Spanish in the Aragonese kingdom in the 12 th and 13 th centuries and on the different demographics, with greater population density north of the river Ebro.

40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) {{has become}} a {{powerful}} tool for ionospheric studies. In addition, ionospheric corrections are necessary for augmentation systems required for Global Navigation Satellite Systems use. Dual-frequency carrier-phase and code-delay GPS observations are combined to obtain ionospheric observables related to the slant total electron content (sTEC) along the satellite-receiver line-of-sight. This observable is affected by inter-frequency biases (IFB, often called differential code biases, DCB) due to the transmitting and the receiving hardware. These biases must be estimated and reduced from the data in order to calibrate the experimental sTEC obtained from GPS observations. For calibration purposes it is assumed that IFB stay constant over 1 - 3 days. Based on the analysis of single differences of the ionospheric observables obtained from pairs of co-located GPS receivers, this research addresses two major issues: 1) assessing the errors translated from the code-delay to the carrier-phase ionospheric observable by the so-called <b>levelling</b> <b>process</b> applied to reduce carrier-phase ambiguities from the data; and 2) assessing the short-term stability of receiver IFB.

40|$|Land {{levelling}} is {{an important}} process of the agriculutral land consolidation projects. The land <b>levelling</b> <b>process</b> starts by determining the appropriate levels of the terrain and solves the earthwork allocation for the predetermined terrain levels. The recent attempt, reported in the literature, to find an optimal process is a GIS-based approach which solves the transportation problem by determing the designed terrain level and optimal hauling distances that result in the lowest hauling cost. In this study, the Vogel approximation method (VAM) was adopted in initializing {{the solution to the}} transportation problems, and the optimizaion of the solutions obtained by the VAM was examined using the modified distribution method (MODI). To verify the reliability of this combined method, a case study was carried out based on the proposed land livelling project at the Lixian District of Beijing, China. The results show that the optimal average hauling distance calculated from the proposed linear programming model is 79. 53 m shorter than that estimated using the empirical method, and the unit cost calculated from the linear programming model is 33. 4 % lower than the experienced cost. The improvements in the optimization of the hauling distance show that the cost of the agricultural land levelling can be efficiently lowered if an appropriate linear programming model is used...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{automatic}} statistical approach for extracting 3 D blood vessels from time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) data. The voxels of the dataset {{are classified as}} either blood vessels or background noise. The observed volume data is modeled by two stochastic <b>processes.</b> The low <b>level</b> <b>process</b> characterizes the intensity distribution of the data, while the high <b>level</b> <b>process</b> characterizes their statistical dependence among neighboring voxels. The low <b>level</b> <b>process</b> of the background signal is modeled by a finite mixture of one Rayleigh and two normal distributions, while the blood vessels are modeled by one normal distribution. The parameters of the low <b>level</b> <b>process</b> are estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Since the convergence of the EM is sensitive to the initial estimate of the model parameters, an automatic method for parameter initialization, based on histogram analysis, is provided. To {{improve the quality of}} segmentation achieved by the proposed low level model especially in the regions of significant vascular signal loss, the high <b>level</b> <b>process</b> is modeled as a Markov random field (MRF). Since MRF is sensitive to edges and the intracranial vessels represent roughly 5 % of the intracranial volume, 2 D MRF will destroy most of the small and medium vessels. Therefore, to reduce this limitation, we employed 3 D MRF, whose parameters are estimated using the maximum pseudo likelihood estimator (MPLE), which converges to the true likelihood under large lattice.
