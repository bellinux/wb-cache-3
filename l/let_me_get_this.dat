"But I broke in, {{and says}} I, 'Beg your pardon, Mr. Longfellow, if you'll {{be so kind}} as to hold your yawp {{for about five minutes}} and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> grub ready, you'll do me proud.' Well, sir, after they'd filled up I set out the jug. Mr. Holmes looks at it, and then he fires up all of a sudden and yells: ...|$|E

Herbst wrote [...] "Mr. Patrick: <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> straight, {{are you saying that}} right now, without your bill being passed, anyone can assault someone in the bathroom without breaking the law? That's some kind of weird screwed-up loophole if so." ...|$|E

He would not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> a doctor. <b>This</b> morning when I saw his bones {{sticking}} out {{of his face and}} his great bright eyes looking at me I could stand no more of it. 'With your leave or without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor this very hour,' said I. 'Let it be Watson, then,' said he. I wouldn't waste an hour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him alive." ...|$|R

To Andy, you are {{the love of my life}} and my best friend. Thank you for being the shoulder for me to cry on, and the ear that listened to me complain throughout this process. Your patience and support is something that I cherish in you as a partner and your gift for knowledge is something that has made me a stronger person. I love you! Mom and dad, words cannot express how lucky I am to have such a wonderful set of parents. You have supported me throughout my college career, during good times and bad. Thank you for setting such good examples for me to follow as an adult, and for giving me the courage I needed to <b>get</b> through <b>this</b> process. I love you both. Sister’s Paula and Laura, thank you for being such great big sisters! You have allowed me grow into my own person, and have supported both my decisions, and my mistakes since childhood! Thank you for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> through <b>this</b> process at my own speed. And to everyone else, friends and coworkers, thank you! I thought this day would never come!...|$|R
60|$|Her {{whirling}} words {{expressed the}} {{feeling in my}} own mind. I had {{the same sense of}} being trifled with by these young people, who would not behave so conclusively toward each other as to justify our interference on the ground that they were in love, nor yet treat each other so indifferently as to relieve us of the strain of apprehension. I had lost all faith in accident by this time, and I was quite willing to leave them to their own devices; I was so desperate that I said I hoped they would get lost from us, as they had from me the night before, and never come back, but just keep on wandering round for ever. All sorts of vengeful thoughts went through my mind as I saw them leaning toward each other to say something, and then drawing apart to laugh in what seemed an indefinite comradery instead of an irrepressible passion. Did they think we were going to let this sort of thing go on? What did they suppose our nerves were made of? Had they no mercy, no consideration? It was quite like the selfishness of youth to wish to continue in that fool's paradise, but they would find out that middle age had its rights too. I felt capable of asking them bluntly what they meant by it. But when they docilely rejoined us {{at the end of the}} races, hurrying up with some joke about not <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> lost <b>this</b> time, and Miss Gage put herself at my wife's side and Kendricks dropped into step with me, all I had been thinking seemed absurd. They were just two young people who were enjoying a holiday-time together, and we were in no wise culpable concerning them.|$|R
6000|$|There is {{at least}} one {{peculiarity}} in the Browning Letters which tends to make their publication far less open to objection than almost any other collection of love letters which can be imagined. The ordinary sentimentalist who delights in the most emotional of magazine interviews, {{will not be able to}} get much satisfaction out of them, because he and many persons more acute will be quite unable to make head or tail of three consecutive sentences. In this respect it is the most extraordinary correspondence in the world. There seem to be only two main rules for this form of letter-writing: the first is, that if a sentence can begin with a parenthesis it always should; and the second is, that if you have written from a third to half of a sentence you need never in any case write any more. It would be amusing to watch any one who felt an idle curiosity as to the language and secrets of lovers opening the Browning Letters. He would probably come upon some such simple and lucid passage as the following: [...] "I ought to wait, say a week at least, having killed all your mules for you, before I shot down your dogs.... But not being Phoibos Apollon, you are to know further that when I did think I might go modestly on ... [Greek: ômoi], <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> out of <b>this</b> slough of a simile, never mind with what dislocated ankles." ...|$|R
