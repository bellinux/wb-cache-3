40|$|Despite their {{reputation}} for {{taking advantage of}} other people, previous research shows that psychopathic individuals are attractive for short-term relationships. Furthermore, individuals with psychopathic traits {{have been found to}} be attracted to other psychopathic persons in both short and <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships.</b> The current study (N = 258), is the first to extend the investigation further by examining whether these findings pertain to the affective (i. e., primary) or behavioural (i. e., secondary) aspects of psychopathy, and if this varies according to sex. Using a series of personality profiles, we found that men and women evaluated individuals higher in primary or secondary psychopathic traits unattractive for both short and <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships.</b> However, those individuals higher in primary and secondary psychopathic traits found similar partners attractive in short and <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships,</b> and this was strongest in women higher in primary psychopathic traits for <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships,</b> and in women higher in secondary psychopathic traits for short and <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships.</b> Results are discussed from an evolutionary theoretical perspective...|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{directed}} towards customer retention highly {{depend on the}} area in which company operates. Personalization is considered {{as one of the most}} effective means for service companies to develop <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships</b> with their customers. However, it still remains unclear how personalization should be expressed while developing <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships</b> with service customers. Thus, the aim of this study is to reason theoretically the effect of personalization on <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships</b> with service customers and to test it empirically on the example of high personal contact services. Theoretical studies reveal that personalized interaction between a service customer and a company is a three-dimensional construct, dimensions of which are personalized contact, personalized physical environment, and customer environment. Results of personalization in the context of the <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships</b> development are expressed through relationship quality (trust, satisfaction, and commitment) and customer loyalty (loyalty to a service company and loyalty to a certain employee). Hair salon services were chosen as a case for the empirical research. Results of the empirical research show that dimensions of personalized interaction influence both relationship quality dimensions and relationship results. The most significant dimension of personalized interaction while developing <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships</b> with customers of hair salons is personalized contact. The paper gives some practical insights for the development of <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships</b> with customers of hair salons...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{good sense}} of humour is {{commonly}} offered in written dating advertisements demon-strating that humour is an important quality to have when attracting a mate, but not all humour is the same. This study used vignettes {{in the style of}} a personal advertisement to measure the attrac-tiveness of affiliative and aggressive humour in different relationship contexts. The results dem-onstrated that affiliative humour was more attractive than aggressive humour in both relationship contexts but especially for <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships.</b> The results follow the pattern expected of af-filiative humour styles being more attractive for <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships</b> due to being linked to qualities that may be important in <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships</b> such as likelihood of cooperation, and aggressive humour styles not being favoured for <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships</b> due to being linked to qualities that may be detrimental in <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships.</b> A follow-up study confirmed that dif-ferent humour styles were associated with different perceived personality traits. Together these findings suggest that humour may be used to indicate an individual’s personality and that the at-tractiveness of a {{good sense of}} humour depends on both the type of humour and the type of rela-tionship being sought...|$|R

5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a <b>long-term</b> <b>relationship.</b> Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} expands upon {{existing}} developmental research on marital attitude change by examining how attitudes toward marriage and <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships</b> may vary across emerging adulthood. Utilizing five waves {{of data from}} the Center on Young Adult Health and Development’s College Life Study, discrete-time survival analysis and latent basis growth curve analysis are employed to assess the change—and predictors of such change—in three measures of relationship attitudes (desire for marriage, desire for <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships,</b> and importance of marriage and <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships)</b> of over 900 college students. Results indicate positive change in all three measures of attitudes, with most emerging adults desiring and placing importance on marriage and <b>long-term</b> <b>relationships</b> {{from the very beginning}} of college. Predictors of attitude change included sex, race, experience of parental death, student status, educational aspirations, and total number of sex partners.
