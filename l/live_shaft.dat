50|$|Filling a silo {{requires}} parking two tractors {{very close}} to each other, both running at full power and with <b>live</b> PTO <b>shafts,</b> one powering the silo blower and the other powering a forage wagon unloading fresh-cut forage into the blower. The farmer must continually move around in this highly hazardous environment of spinning shafts and high-speed conveyors to check material flows and adjust speeds, and to start and stop all the equipment between loads.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} {{two hundred}} years earlier St Helens was far more scarred and pitted by shallow mining operations, often quickly abandoned, left to flood and prone to collapse. The primitive mining techniques, and limited ability to pump out water meant many pits had short lifespans. Complaints to the Holland family, by then Lords of Sutton Manor, are recorded from 1611, particularly in Sutton Heath, about plans to expand out such short <b>lived</b> mine <b>shafts</b> across the town, decrying {{the destruction of the}} land and waste. Money and public demand prevailed over any reservations held and shallow mining operations expanded rapidly.|$|R
50|$|The {{colliery}} {{was originally}} opened as Arael Griffin {{on the site}} of an earlier balance shaft which had been sunk in 1863 by Thomas Phillips Price at Hafod Van. In 1892 John Lancaster and Co. began sinking two 352 yd shafts {{on the opposite side of}} the Ebbw Fach River. On 9 February 1895 four men lost their <b>lives</b> during the <b>shaft</b> sinking, when the boat in which they were riding capsized, and they fell to the shaft bottom.|$|R
40|$|Micro {{hydropower}} generated electricity {{can function}} as an effective tool for rural development. One of the barriers to smooth implementation of community/village micro hydropower schemes {{in the country is}} lack of appropriate hydraulic turbines, thus making the site specific costs of micro hydropower rather high, hence not easily affordable by the rural communities. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the use of a vehicle <b>live</b> axlepropeller <b>shaft</b> system to replace conventional turbines for micro hydropower generation. There are axle-propeller shafts of many vehicles that have fallen into disuse and are commonly found in many motor vehicle scrap yards. New ones are also entering the Kenyan market with the small vehicles (saloon cars; station wagons; panel Vans, Pick-ups, lorries/trucks, buses/coaches and minibuses/matatus) comprising the biggest percentage, for example in the year 2008, out of 121, 831 newly registered vehicles 65, 556 (53. 8...|$|R
5000|$|Construction of {{the main}} shafts began in October 1872, with sinking commencing in February 1873. Due to the {{required}} depth of the shafts to access the coal seams, the operation {{would prove to be}} both expensive and dangerous, and create the lifelong operational need to continually extract water due to high levels of ingress. The 167 men of the construction crew were not paid on time on a number of occasions, with final construction costs in May 1878 running to over Â£300,000, and seven men having lost their <b>lives.</b> The two <b>shafts</b> were built 180 ft apart: North to a depth of South to [...] This was [...] deeper than any other colliery in the South Wales Coalfield at the time, to allow access the Nine Feet Seam.|$|R
5|$|A louse's color {{varies from}} pale beige to dark gray; however, if feeding on blood, {{it may become}} {{considerably}} darker. Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are parthenogenetic, with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's egg is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' hair with specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond {{is very difficult to}} sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their eggs in parts of the body inaccessible to preening, such as the interior of feather <b>shafts.</b> <b>Living</b> louse eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead louse eggs are yellower. Lice are exopterygotes, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as nymphs. The young moult three times before reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.|$|R
40|$|SDI(HCR) - 1 : Please provide {{information}} on the expected effects of convectively transported heat from the planned SDI heater tests on the lower portion of the WIPP exhaust shaft. Background: Convectively transported heated air from the SDI tests could be conductively transferred to the halite along {{the perimeter of the}} exhaust shaft, potentially altering shaft geometry and disrupt or reduce the operational <b>lives</b> of the <b>shaft.</b> We would expect the area of greatest impact, if there were to be any, to be {{at the base of the}} exhaust shaft. Because the exhaust shaft is used by the SDI test as well as the rest of the underground facility, any impacts on the functionality of this shaft could impact waste disposal operations. DOE Response: Preliminary planning discussions for the SDI test have indicated the access drifts may be blocked off during the heating phase of the SDI test, preventing ventilation air from circulating through the test area. In this case, no heat from the SDI test will be added to the ventilation air and hence no heat from the SDI heater test will be transported by convection to the lower portion of th...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{associated with}} interference-fitted assemblies {{has shown that}} as recurring slip occurs (i. e. load to total slip, unloading and reload to total slip) there is an observed increase in the holding torque after each loading cycle. The aim of this work was to identify {{the reasons for this}} 'torque strengthening' phenomenon. The work also has industrial relevance in the optimum design of interference-fitted rolls used for the hot rolling of steel sections. Previous work has shown that the major contributors to the overall holding torque were the interface pressure, material properties and the coefficient of friction between component materials. In this work, neutron diffraction tests and crack compliance tests showed no correlation between the interface pressure and increased holding torque. Meanwhile, experimental holding torque tests on sample interference-fits showed that for each recurring holding torque failure (slip) in a test cycle, the holding torque increased. Subsequent wear investigations showed that the wear of the surfaces increased throughout the testing and once a specific type of wear had occurred through a 'ploughing' mechanism, significant damage could be done to the more expensive shaft component. These observations suggest that an effective increase in the coefficient of friction between shaft and hub is responsible for the increase in holding torque, while the same level of interface pressure is maintained throughout slipping. The research provides a basis for the optimisation of interference-fit design in order that the working <b>lives</b> of expensive <b>shafts,</b> which are prone to damage through ploughing, and brittle hubs, which are prone to sudden fracture, are maximised when experiencing recurrent slipping...|$|R
