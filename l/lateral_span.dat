50|$|The {{combination}} of both approaches (acoustic and infrared) assists in overcoming each system's own limitations while improving the overall capability to eliminate false declarations of gunshots and/or ambiguous declaration locations. Even when these combined systems are employed, shots fired from far enough away will not be detected because the amount of gunshot signal (both acoustic and Infrared) eventually fades into the background signals. For acoustic systems that require the supersonic shock wave for location determination, the bullet must still be traveling at supersonic speed when it passes the sensor, and it must pass the sensor within the <b>lateral</b> <b>span</b> of the shock wave. For infrared sensing of the flash upon weapon's discharge, the bullet path is not determined. By combining these two approaches the capability under various conditions anticipated in a combat scenario is improved.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An axially symmetric, gravity driven, {{steady flow}} of a {{grounded}} polar ice sheet with a prescribed temperature field is considered. The ice is treated as an incompressible, non-linearly viscous, anisotropic fluid, the internal structure (fabric) of which evolves as ice descends from the free surface to depth in an ice sheet. The evolution of the ice fabric is described by an orthotropic constitutive law which relates the deviatoric stress to the strain-rate, strain, and three structure tensors based on the current (rotating) principal stretch axes. The solution {{of the problem is}} constructed as a leading-order approximation derived from asymptotic expansions in a small parameter that reflects the small ratio of stress and velocity gradients in the lateral direction of the ice sheet to those in the thickness direction. Numerical simulations of the flow problem have been carried out for various sets of rheological parameters defining the limit strength of the anisotropic fabric in ice. The results of calculations illustrate the influence of the ice anisotropy, basal melt conditions and temperature field in ice on the glacier thickness and <b>lateral</b> <b>span,</b> and on the depth profiles of the flow velocity.

40|$|Measurements by Ulysses in the {{high-speed}} polar solar wind {{have shown the}} wind to carry some fine-scale structures in which the magnetic field reverses direction by having a switchback fold in it. The <b>lateral</b> <b>span</b> of these magnetic switchbacks, translated back to the Sun, is of {{the scale of the}} lanes and cells of the magnetic network in which the open magnetic field of the polar coronal hole and polar solar wind are rooted. This suggests that the magnetic switchbacks might be formed from network-scale magnetic loops that erupt into the corona and then undergo reconnection with the open field. This possibility motivated us to undertake the study reported here of the structure of Ha macrospicules observed at the limb in polar coronal holes, to determine whether a significant fraction of these eruptions appear to be erupting loops. From a search of the polar coronal holes in 6 days of image- processed full-disk Ha movies from Big Bear Solar Observatory, we found a total of 35 macrospicules. Nearly all of these (32) were of {{one or the other of}} two different forms: 15 were in the form of an erupting loop, and 17 were in the form of a single column spiked jet. The erupting-loop macrospicules are appropriate for producing the magnetic switchbacks in the polar wind. The spiked-jet macrospicules show the appropriate structure and evolution to be driven by reconnection between network-scale closed field (a network bipole) and the open field rooted against the closed field. This evidence for reconnection in a large fraction of our macrospicules (1) suggests that many spicules may be generated by similar but smaller reconnection events and (2) supports the view that coronal heating and solar wind acceleration in coronal holes and in quiet regions are driven by explosive reconnection events in the magnetic network...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{attractive}} applications of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) {{is found in the}} area of structural materials. Nanotubes have a unique combination of high strength, modulus, and elongation to failure, and therefore have potential to significantly enhance the mechanical properties of today's composites. This is especially attractive for the aerospace industry looking for any chance to save weight. This is why NASA has chosen to tackle this difficult application of SWNT. Nanotube properties differ significantly from that of conventional carbon fibers, and {{a whole new set of}} problems, including adhesion and dispersion in the adhesive polymer matrix, must be resolved in order to engineer superior composite materials. From recent work on a variety of applications it is obvious that the wide range of research in nanotubes will lead to advances in physics, chemistry, and engineering. However, the possibility of ultralightweight structures is what causes dreamers to really get excited. One of the important issues in composite engineering is aspect ratio of the fibers, since it affects load transfer in composites. Nanotube length was a gray area for years, since they are formed in bundles, making it impossible to monitor individual nanotube length. Even though bundles are observed to be tens and hundreds of microns long, they can be built of relatively short tubes weakly bound by Van der Waals forces. Nanotube length can be affected by subsequent purification and ultrasound processing, which has been necessary in order to disperse nanotubes and introduce them into a polymer matrix. Some calculations show that nanotubes with 10 (exp 5) aspect ratio may be necessary to achieve good load transfer. We show here that nanotubes produced in our laser system are as much as tens of microns long and get cut into lengths of hundreds of nanometers during ultrasound processing. Nanotube length was measured by AFM on pristine nanotube specimens as well, as after sonication. In each case great care was taken to measure individual nanotubes, rather than bundles. Pristine nanotubes were collected on quartz substrates placed directly in the laser oven and exposed for 0. 5 s. This results in an equal mix of bundles and individual nanotubes. Nanotube length measurements were limited practically by the <b>lateral</b> <b>span</b> of the AFM scanner, but nanotube length is certainly in excess of 20 micrometers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction New {{modalities}} like Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) allow non-invasive {{examination of}} the internal structure of biological tissue in vivo. The potential benefits and limitations of this new technology for the detection and evaluation of bladder cancer were examined in this study. Materials and methods Between January 2007 and January 2008, 52 patients who underwent transurethral bladder biopsy or TUR-BT for surveillance or due to initial suspicion of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder were enrolled in this study. In total, 166 lesions were suspicious for malignancy according to standard white light cystoscopy. All suspicious lesions were scanned and interpreted during perioperative cystoscopy using OCT. Cold cup biopsies and/or TUR-B was performed for all these lesions. For this study we used an OCT-device (Niris ®, Imalux ®, Cleveland, US), that utilizes near-infrared light guided through a flexible fibre-based applicator, which is placed into the bladder via the working channel of the cystoscope. The technology provides high spatial resolution {{on the order of}} about 10 - 20 μm, and a visualization of tissue to a depth of about 2 mm across a <b>lateral</b> <b>span</b> of about 2 mm in width. The device used received market clearance from the FDA and CE approval in Germany. The diagnostic and surgical procedure was videotaped and analyzed afterwards for definitive matching of scanned and biopsied lesion. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} determine the level of correlation between OCT interpretation and final histological result. Results Of 166 scanned OCT images, 102 lesions (61. 4 %) matched to the same site where the biopsy/TUR-BT was taken according to videoanalysis. Only these video-verified lesions were used for further analysis. Of all analyzed lesions 88 were benign (inflammation, edema, hyperplasia etc.) and 14 were malignant (CIS, Ta, T 1, T 2) as shown by final histo pathology. All 14 malignant lesions were detected correctly by OCT. Furthermore all invasive tumors were staged correctly by OCT regarding tumor growth beyond the lamina propria. There were no false negative lesions detected by OCT. Sensitivity of OCT for detecting the presence of a malignant lesion was 100 % and sensitivity for detection of tumor growth beyond the lamina propria was 100 % as well. Specificity of OCT for presence of malignancy was 65 %, due to the fact that a number of lesions were interpreted as false positive by OCT. Conclusion As a minimally invasive technique, OCT proved to have extremely high sensitivity for detection of malignant lesions as well as estimation of whether a tumor has invaded beyond the lamina propria. However, specificity of OCT within the bladder was impaired (65 %), possibly due to a learning curve and/or the relatively low spatial resolution and visualization depth of the OCT technology. Further studies and technical development are needed to establish an adequate surrogate for optical biopsy. </p...|$|E

40|$|Although {{extensive}} {{research has been}} conducted {{over the last several years}} in the areas of Core-Concrete Interaction (CCI) and debris coolability, two important issues warrant further investigation. The first issue concerns the effectiveness of water in terminating a CCI by flooding the interacting masses from above, thereby quenching the molten core debris and rendering it permanently coolable. This safety issue was investigated in the EPRI-sponsored Melt Attack and Coolability Experiments (MACE) program. The approach was to conduct large scale, integral-type reactor materials experiments with core melt masses ranging up to two metric tons. These experiments provided unique, and for the most part repeatable, indications of heat transfer mechanism(s) that could provide long term debris cooling. However, the results did not demonstrate definitively that a melt would always be completely quenched. This was due to the fact that the crust anchored to the test section sidewalls in every test, which led to melt/crust separation, even at the largest test section <b>lateral</b> <b>span</b> of 1. 20 m. This decoupling is not expected for a typical reactor cavity, which has a span of 5 - 6 m. Even though the crust may mechanically bond to the reactor cavity walls, the weight of the coolant and the crust itself is expected to periodically fracture the crust and restore contact with the melt. Although crust fracturing does not ensure that coolability will be achieved, it nonetheless provides a pathway for water to recontact the underlying melt, thereby allowing other debris cooling mechanisms to proceed. A related task of the current program, which is not addressed in this particular report, is to measure crust strength to check the hypothesis that a corium crust would not be strong enough to sustain melt/crust separation in a plant accident. The second important issue concerns long-term, two-dimensional concrete ablation by a prototypic core oxide melt. As discussed by Foit the existing reactor material database for dry cavity conditions is solely one-dimensional. Although the MACE Scoping Test was carried out with a two-dimensional concrete cavity, the interaction was flooded soon after ablation was initiated to investigate debris coolability. Moreover, due to the scoping nature of this test, the apparatus was minimally instrumented and therefore the results are of limited value from the code validation viewpoint. Aside from the MACE program, the COTELS test series also investigated 2 -D CCI under flooded cavity conditions. However, the input power density for these tests was quite high relative to the prototypic case. Finally, the BETA test series provided valuable data on 2 -D core concrete interaction under dry cavity conditions, but these tests focused on investigating the interaction of the metallic (steel) phase with concrete. Due to these limitations, there is significant uncertainty in the partition of energy dissipated for the ablation of concrete in the lateral and axial directions under dry cavity conditions for the case of a core oxide melt. Accurate knowledge of this 'power split' is important in the evaluation of the consequences of an ex-vessel severe accident; e. g., lateral erosion can undermine containment structures, while axial erosion can penetrate the basemat, leading to ground contamination and/or possible containment bypass. As a result of this uncertainty, there are still substantial differences among computer codes in the prediction of 2 -D cavity erosion behavior under both wet and dry cavity conditions. In light of the above issues, the OECD-sponsored Melt Coolability and Concrete Interaction (MCCI) program was initiated at Argonne National Laboratory. The project conducted reactor materials experiments and associated analysis to achieve the following technical objectives: (1) resolve the ex-vessel debris coolability issue through a program that focused on providing both confirmatory evidence and test data for the coolability mechanisms identified in MACE integral effects tests, and (2) address remaining uncertainties related to long-term 2 -D core-concrete interactions under both wet and dry cavity conditions. Data from the various tests conducted as part of the program are being used to develop and validate models and codes that are used to extrapolate the experimental findings to plant conditions. Achievement of these technical objectives will demonstrate the efficacy of severe accident management guidelines for existing plants, and provide the technical basis for better containment designs of future plants. The project completed three large scale CCI experiments to address the second technical objective defined above...|$|E

30|$|The {{surgical}} treatment of limb-length discrepancy (LLD) > 2.5  cm was initially described by Phemister using an open technique {{to create an}} epiphysiodesis of the longer limb to allow the shorter limb to catch up prior {{to the end of}} growth [1]. Since the epiphysiodesis created a permanent growth arrest, an accurate assessment of the patient’s bone age was required to determine the appropriate timing for surgery. Physician concerns about overcorrection often resulted in the procedure being performed later than the ideal recommended time causing an undercorrection. Subsequently, Blount and Clarke developed the technique of epiphyseal stapling by placing three staples on the medial and <b>lateral</b> side <b>spanning</b> the physis to prevent longitudinal growth [2]. The major advantage of the stapling technique was the potential to reverse the growth arrest by removing the staples. Initial problems with staple breakage were addressed by reinforcing the 90 -degree angles of the staples, but staple dislodgments and pain over the staples caused many physicians to abandon this method. With the improvement and widespread use of fluoroscopic imaging, physicians developed the technique of percutaneous epiphysiodesis using small curettes, drill bits and dental burs to ablate the physis [3, 4].|$|R

The wing was first tested on the single-seat Kellner-Béchereau E.1 on 1936, which was followed by two larger and more powerful two-seaters, the EC.4 and ED.5. Both of these were {{designed to meet the}} French Air Ministry's requirement for a pre-military trainer aircraft to be used by the clubs set up in the [...] "Aviation Populaire" [...] programme.|$|R
40|$|SnTe is a topological {{crystalline}} insulator that possesses spin-polarized, Dirac-dispersive surface states {{protected by}} crystal symmetry. Multiple surface states {{exist on the}} { 100 }, { 110 }, and { 111 } surfaces of SnTe, with the band structure of surface states depending on the mirror symmetry of a particular surface. Thus, to access surface states selectively, {{it is critical to}} control the morphology of SnTe such that only desired crystallographic surfaces are present. Here, we grow SnTe nanostructures using vapor-liquid-solid and vapor-solid growth mechanisms. Previously, SnTe nanowires and nanocrystals have been grown. 1 - 4 In this report, we demonstrate synthesis of SnTe nanoplates with <b>lateral</b> dimensions <b>spanning</b> tens of microns and thicknesses of a hundred nanometers. The top and bottom surfaces are either (100) or (111), maximizing topological surface states on these surfaces. Magnetotransport on these SnTe nanoplates shows high bulk carrier density, consistent with bulk SnTe crystals arising due to defects such as Sn vacancies. In addition, we observe a structural phase transition in these nanoplates from the high temperature rock salt to low temperature rhombohedral structure. For nanoplates with very high carrier density, we observe a slight upturn in resistance at low temperatures, indicating electron-electron interactions. Comment: Nano Lett., Article ASAP, 201...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{laterally}} confined granular flow experiments on steep slopes. We provide evidences {{for the existence}} of di_erent flow regimes with secondary flows. At moderate mass flow, we observe a first flow regime with a pair of longitudinal vortices which are localized close to the <b>lateral</b> walls and <b>span</b> progressively over the whole flow width with increasing flow rate. They are counter-rotative and induce a vertical upward motion of the grains at the wall. Upon a further increase of the mass flow rate, a transition is evidenced by a reversal of the rotation direction of the vortices which trigger in contrast a downward motion of the grains close to the lateral walls and an upward motion {{at the center of the}} channel. We argue that these flows bear some resemblance with the flow regimes reported recently in discrete element simulations...|$|R
40|$|The parafluvial hyporheic zone {{combines}} the heightened biogeochemical and microbial interactions {{indicative of a}} hyporheic region with direct atmospheric/terrestrial inputs {{and the effects of}} wet–dry cycles. Therefore, understanding biogeochemical cycling and microbial interactions in this ecotone is fundamental to understanding biogeochemical cycling at the aquatic–terrestrial interface and to creating robust hydrobiogeochemical models of dynamic river corridors. We aimed to (i)  characterize biogeochemical and microbial differences in the parafluvial hyporheic zone across a small spatial domain (6 <b>lateral</b> meters) that <b>spans</b> a breadth of inundation histories and (ii)  examine how parafluvial hyporheic sediments respond to laboratory-simulated re-inundation. Surface sediment was collected at four elevations along transects perpendicular to flow of the Columbia River, eastern WA, USA. The sediments were inundated by the river 0, 13, 127, and 398  days prior to sampling. Spatial variation in environmental variables (organic matter, moisture, nitrate, glucose,...|$|R
40|$|Available at SciVerse ScienceDirectCenter-pivot {{sprinkler}} irrigation became very popular. Hence, aimed at farmers advising, the simulation model DEPIVOT {{has been developed}} {{with the objective of}} design new systems or changes in systems in operation. The software consists of a simulation package developed in Visual Basic and data base in Access. The model comprises five main sub-models for: (a) computation of the gross irrigation requirements; (b) sizing of the <b>lateral</b> pipe <b>spans</b> through the hydraulics computation of the friction losses and respective operative simulation considering to the effects of topography and the possible requirements of an end gun; (c) selecting a sprinklers package with computation of pressure and discharge at each outlet and including the consideration of pressure regulators; (d) verification of the sprinklers package through estimation of runoff potential by comparing application and infiltration rates at selected locations along the lateral; and (e) estimating the expected uniformity performance indicators when in operation. The user verifies if performance is within target values set at start and may develop and compare alternative sprinkler packages until appropriate conditions are obtained. When the model is used for evaluation of systems under operation using data collected in farmers’ fields performance indicators are computed and, responding to farmers’ needs, the model may be used to design changes in the existing systems and to improve management. This paper describes the model and shows examples of applications to select a sprinkler package and assess the respective runoff potentia...|$|R
