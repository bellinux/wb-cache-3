5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case of}} Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, as in the case of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more <b>like</b> <b>music</b> than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E
5|$|It was {{difficult}} for crew members to perceive the film's quality {{during much of the}} production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements <b>like</b> <b>music</b> and sound design. Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially, but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting. According to Lee Unkrich, one of the original editors of Toy Story, a scene was cut out of the original final edit. The scene features Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently. Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the creators of the movie thought the audience would be loving Buzz and Woody at that point. Another scene, where Woody was trying to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie. Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} the second {{recorded}} during Kalmar's tenure, following Music for a Time of War (2011), which also included works by Britten and Vaughan Williams and which received Grammy Award nominations for Best Orchestral Performance and Best Engineered Album, Classical.

5|$|Cluj-Napoca is the {{residence}} of some well-known Romanian musicians. Examples of homegrown bands include the popular Romanian rock band Compact, the modern pop band Sistem—which {{finished third in the}} Eurovision Song Contest 2005, the rhythm and blues band Nightlosers, the alternative band Luna Amară, Grimus—the winners of the 2007 National Finals of Global Battle of the Bands, as well as a large assortment of electronic music producers, notably Horace Dan D. The Cheeky Girls also grew up in the city, where they studied at the High School of Choreography and Dramatic Art. While many discos play commercial house music, the city has an increasing minimal techno scene, and, to an extent jazz/blues and heavy metal/punk. The city's nightlife, particularly its club scene, grew significantly in the 1990s, and continues to increase. Most entertainment venues are dispersed throughout the city centre, spreading from the oldest one of all, Diesel Club, on Unirii Square. The list of large and fancy clubs continues with Obsession The Club and Midi, the latter being a venue for the new minimal techno music genre. These three clubs are classified as the top three clubs in the Transylvania-Banat region in a chart published by the national daily România Liberă. The Unirii area also features the Fashion Bar, with an exclusive terrace sponsored by Fashion TV. Some other clubs in the centre are Aftereight, Avenue, Bamboo, Decadence, Kharma and Molotov Pub. Numerous restaurants, pizzerias and coffee shops provide regional as well as international cuisine; many of these offer cultural activities <b>like</b> <b>music</b> and fashion shows or art exhibitions.|$|E

500|$|The Harris Theater {{was built}} to fill {{the need for a}} modern {{performance}} venue in downtown Chicago, which would be a new home for previously itinerant performing arts companies.

The need for a new theater was identified by the John D. and Catherine T.

Once the need was identified, the theater was the culmination of [...] "years of planning by Chicago's philanthropic, arts, business and government leaders" [...] including groups <b>like</b> <b>Music</b> of the Baroque, which now perform there regularly.

500|$|... "The Sweet Escape" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary pop music critics. In a review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the song as [...] "an irresistible [...] track, {{driven by a}} giddy 'wee-oh!' hook and supported by a nearly anthemic summertime chorus". John Murphy of musicOMH referred to [...] "The Sweet Escape" [...] as [...] "a lovely, summery bouncy pop song with a very infectious chorus". Murphy compared the song to Weezer's 2002 single [...] "Keep Fishin'", and Blenders Ben Sisario compared it {{to the work of}} The Beach Boys. Alex Miller from the NME compared the song to Madonna's early work but added that it sounded [...] "cringey and saccharine". Anna Britten from Yahoo! Music commented that it sounded <b>like</b> <b>music</b> from 1970, specifically that of soul group Chairmen of the Board. Bill Lamb of About.com called the song [...] "a welcome change from the over-produced 'Wind It Up'", but noted that it [...] "easily jets in one ear and out the other leaving little trace of its presence".

500|$|In 1972, {{while still}} {{a member of}} the band The Jackson 5, Michael Jackson {{released}} his first of what would be ten studio albums, Got to Be There. Four singles were taken from the album, although they were not promoted by music videos, and this pattern continued for his next three studio albums, Ben (1972), Music & Me (1973) and Forever, Michael (1975). Unlike in the past, Jackson released his debut music video for the lead single, [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough", from his 1979 album, Off the Wall. Jackson subsequently began releasing music videos for his singles to promote both the song itself and the album. His music videos from the 1980s [...] particularly the music videos for [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and Thriller [...] received heavy rotation on channels <b>like</b> <b>Music</b> Television (MTV). The popularity of his music videos that aired on MTV, such as [...] "Beat It", [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and Thriller [...] credited for transforming the music video from a promotional tool and into an art form [...] helped bring the relatively new channel to fame. Music videos such as [...] "Black or White" [...] and [...] "Scream" [...] made Jackson an enduring staple on MTV in the 1990s. Due to length, some of Jackson's music videos are considered to be short films. Some of them drew criticism for their violent and sexual content, others were lauded by critics and awarded Guinness World Records for their length, success and expense. From 1979 to 2003, Jackson released thirty-six music videos.|$|E

[...] Jason Ferguson of Harp described Quique as [...] "shimmered with a futuristic ethereality that was far more substantial than the electro-ambience of the era, but also much less assaultive than the shoegazers Seefeel was affiliated with early on." [...] and that the 2007 re-issue was [...] "a fitting tribute to a very unique sound." [...] The Los Angeles Times described the album as [...] "underrated" [...] and [...] "that even 20 years later sounds like nothing else." [...] The Sunday Times gave the Redux edition a positive review, referring to Quique as the group's [...] "finest moment" [...] and [...] "If you <b>like</b> <b>music</b> to have structure, Quique will drive you barmy; but if you consider the presence of the word [...] "texture" [...] in an album review to be a positive, you might well enjoy this languid landmark." [...] Cam Lindsay wrote in Exclaim! that [...] "While it doesn't feel like a timely release, the re-discovery of Seefeel (no word yet on a reunion) certainly verifies their relevance in today's music, especially in light of neo-gazers like Ulrich Schnauss and Tim Hecker." [...] In 1999, critic Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 34 on his list of [...] "The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties". In 2016, Pitchfork placed Quique at number 13 on its list of [...] "The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time".|$|E
