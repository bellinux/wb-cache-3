5|$|In the Spanish {{armament}} of 1790, Seymour {{was called}} to service {{in command of the}} ship of the line HMS Canada, opening his commission with a cruise off the Isle of Wight. Passing through shallow water, Seymour ordered the use of a <b>lead</b> <b>line</b> to measure the depth ahead, but was accidentally struck in the head by the lead weight while soundings were being taken. Although little immediate damage seemed to have been caused, during the firing of a salute several days later Seymour suddenly suffered a severely adverse reaction and had to be taken ashore for emergency medical treatment. The head injury rendered him unable to endure any loud noises or bright lights and {{for the next three years}} he lived as an invalid at his country estate in Hambleton. By 1793 he was sufficiently recovered to return to service, and escorted Lord Hood to the Mediterranean in HMS Leviathan. There Hood led the occupation, defence and ultimate withdrawal from Toulon during the Republican siege of the city. Following the collapse of the city's defences, Seymour was sent back to England with dispatches but returned shortly afterward to convoy Leviathan back to Britain.|$|E
25|$|Sea shanties are {{a type of}} work song {{traditionally}} sung by sailors. Derived {{from the}} French word 'chanter', meaning 'to sing', they may date from {{as early as the}} 15th century, but most recorded examples derive from the 19th century. Shanties were usually slow rhythmic songs designed to help with collective tasks on labour-intensive sailing and later steam ships. Many were call and response songs, with one voice (the shantyman) singing a <b>lead</b> <b>line</b> {{and the rest of the}} sailors giving a response together. There were derived from varied sources, including dances, folk songs, polkas, waltzes and even West African work-songs. Since different songs were useful for different tasks they are traditionally divided into three main categories, short haul shanties, for tasks requiring quick pulls over a relatively short time; halyard shanties, for heavier work requiring more set-up time between pulls; and Capstan shanties, for long, repetitive tasks requiring a sustained rhythm, but not involving working the lines. Famous shanties include, the 'Drunken Sailor' and 'Blow the Man Down'. There was some interest in sea shanties in the first revival from figures like Percy Grainger. In the second revival A. L. Lloyd attempted to popularise them, recording several albums of sea songs from 1965.|$|E
500|$|The only {{exception}} to this rule are ponies competing in <b>lead</b> <b>line</b> classes. Over 20 World Championships are awarded in different classes {{throughout the course of}} the Celebration, including the <b>Lead</b> <b>Line</b> Ponies World Championship, Park Performance, Four-Year-Old, Three-Year-Old, Two-Year-Old, Weanling, Trail Pleasure, Show Pleasure, and Lite Shod. The most anticipated class, however, is the World Grand Championship, the largest honor in the Tennessee Walking Horse breed. [...] Competition at the Celebration is traditionally opened each night by a white or gray Tennessee Walking Horse and rider carrying the American flag, during the singing of the American national anthem. The same flag horse often serves for years and is not allowed to compete in the Celebration itself or any other horse show during their tenure. [...] Over the course of the Celebration, over $650,000 in prizes is given out. The Celebration also includes attractions such as a dog show, barbecue cookout, and barn decorating contest.|$|E

40|$|The {{release of}} lead to {{drinking}} water from lead materials {{has been a}} source of concern for many years. At present, it is considered to lower the Dutch drinking water standard for lead from 50 mug/l to 10 or 15 mug/l, for toxicological reasons. This report intends to list the consequences of such a reduction, based on information provided by the water works. The conclusion of the report is that the current standard of 50 mug/l usually is not exceeded, but a lower standard of 10 or 15 mug/l will be exceeded when (non-tin-lined) <b>lead</b> <b>lines</b> are nog replaced. Replacement of <b>lead</b> service <b>lines</b> would probably cost about 250 to 300 million Dutch guilders. The replacement of lead household plumbing might cost a billion Dutch guilders.

2500|$|At an {{oversight}} {{hearing before the}} House Committee on Government Reform in early March 2004, Marc Edwards testified that his studies showed the change from chlorine to chloramine {{was the cause of}} the elevated lead levels. [...] He stated that the chloramine-treated water was leaching lead not only from the old <b>lead</b> <b>lines,</b> but also from brass fixtures in homes. [...] Brass is made with lead; even brass classified as [...] "lead free" [...] under the Safe Drinking Water Act can contain up to eight percent lead. [...] Edwards said that this could be the cause of the high lead levels in areas where WASA did not use <b>lead</b> <b>lines.</b> [...] He also cautioned that replacing <b>lead</b> service <b>lines</b> with copper could make the problem worse; newly installed copper lines could react with the chloramine {{in a way that would}} increase corrosion of the remaining <b>lead</b> <b>lines</b> in the system. The chief of the Washington Aqueduct disagreed, saying that tests taken after the chloramine treatment commenced didn't show any additional corrosiveness. He believed corrosion inhibitors, like orthophosphate, could be added to the water to prevent lead leaching. In the spring of 2004, a temporary switch from chloramine back to chlorine for annual pipe flushing caused a 25 to 30 percent drop in lead levels, lending credence to the chloramine theory. In one home that was tested by WASA before and after the switch, lead levels dropped tenfold.|$|R

50|$|Early depth {{sounding}} {{was achieved}} using <b>lead</b> <b>line</b> sounding (or sounding line), where a lead weight {{attached to a}} length of rope marked with depth values. As this method was mechanical in nature, the only correction that {{was applied to the}} sounding was the reduction of the sounding for tidal height. In the mid 20th century, sonar systems were developed to allow the measurement of underwater distances using the two way travel time of an acoustic pulse. This allowed the surveyor to take many more soundings in a given period of time and was less labor intensive than using a <b>lead</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of cumulative exposure and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense <b>lines</b> called <b>lead</b> <b>lines</b> at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These <b>lead</b> <b>lines,</b> caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|R
