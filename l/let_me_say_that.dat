2500|$|Two earlier {{versions}} of the poem can be found, the original typescript of the poem {{as well as that}} version with comments by Ezra Pound. In the typescript, the name of the poem is [...] "Gerousia", referring to the name of the Council of the Elders at Sparta. Pound, who was living in London in 1919, acted as Eliot's editor and influenced many of his works. When Eliot considered publishing the poem as the opening part of The Waste Land, Pound discouraged him from doing so saying, [...] "I do not advise printing Gerontion as preface. One don't miss it at all as the thing now stands. To be more lucid still, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I advise you NOT to print Gerontion as prelude." [...] The lines were never added to the text and remained an individual poem.|$|E
