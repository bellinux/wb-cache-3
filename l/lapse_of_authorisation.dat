40|$|With the {{development}} of modern computer networks, a new advanced channel for communication emerges. The future Swedish defence will use multiple systems connected with high-speed networks for information sharing. Within this environment, the issue <b>of</b> administration <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> is crucial. SaabTech Systems and SICS have in collaboration developed a model and a prototype for decentralised administration <b>of</b> <b>authorisations.</b> The model is based on delegation <b>of</b> <b>authorisations</b> extended with a component to define constraints on delegations. This enables efficient decentralised administration that reflects the management structure of an organization in a natural way, {{at the same time}} as it maintains centralised control on the distribution <b>of</b> <b>authorisations.</b> All authorisations must fulfil constraints defined by their sources of authority. The source of authority may, for instance, define in advance how a certain authorisation can be distributed and used, in terms of whom and when it can be delegated. The model supports several schemes for revocation of authorization...|$|R

40|$|In this {{position}} paper we highlight issues concerning management <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> in coalitions. We identify two main {{issues related to}} the administration <b>of</b> <b>authorisations</b> in dynamic coalitions. The first issue concerns /decentralisation of administration/, and we show how an existing framework developed at SICS addresses this issue. The second issue concerns /decentralisation <b>of</b> enforcement/ <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> and we describe a new approach to address this issue by extending the current access control models with the notion of entitlement. The idea is that both authorisations and entitlements are specified in access contracts that coalition partners agree upon. These contracts can be used for automating access decision making by those controlling access to coalition resources...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Attentional {{processes}} in children {{play a critical}} role in daily school demands and accomplishments. Studies on the association of attentional processes with school achievement and age in healthy school children are scarce. The aim of the present study was to identify correlations between dimensions of attentional performance, scholastic achievement and age. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An extensive testing battery was used to assess a wide range of attentional dimensions. A principal component analysis revealed three factors that are related to attentional performance (distractibility, <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> attention, cognitive speed). Age was negatively associated with distractibility, <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> attention and cognitive speed, indicating that distractibility and <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> attention decreased with age in healthy children and resulted in lower cognitive speed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Attentional {{processes in}} healthy children should be measured in relation to distractibility, <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> attention and cognitive speed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In many high-risk occupations, it is {{critical}} that a person remains alert at all times. There is much to be gained by being able to monitor a person on-line and detect <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> consciousness (LoC) so that remedial action can be taken (e. g., a rest break) to ensure that safety is maintained. In this study, 15 normal subjects were observed on two sessions while they performed a continuous tracking task for a period of 1 hour. EEG, eye movements, tracking performance data and a video of the subject were recorded during the session. This paper presents some preliminary results on the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>lapsing.</b> Only 4 <b>of</b> the 15 subjects did not have a LoC at some stage. Seven subjects had LoCs more than 45 times and 4 more than 100 times during the 2 hours. The mean rate <b>of</b> <b>lapsing</b> over all subjects was 29. 1 LoC/h. In contrast, lapses in performance were caused by both <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> consciousness (30. 1 %) and attention (69. 9 %). There was no correlation found between age of subject and number <b>of</b> <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> consciousness. Keywords—Alertness, <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> consciousness, visuomotor tracking...|$|R
