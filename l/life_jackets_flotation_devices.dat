50|$|The lake has boats {{available}} for hire, along with safety gear such as <b>life</b> saving <b>flotation</b> <b>jackets</b> and <b>devices.</b> Fishing is permitted with payment of a licensing fee. The lake has floating pontoon platforms for visitors and boaters, and ghats for sitting and relaxing. Landscaped parks, sight-seeing walking trails and jogging tracks, over-water bridges, bush land, children's swings and play area, visitor's car park and toilets, and other amenities are available. There is no entry fee {{to use these}} areas.|$|R
5000|$|The design label [...] "Foster Rowe" [...] emerged {{for a while}} as a {{collaboration}} with two other top kayak coaches, (Andy Middleton & Ray Rowe) [...] with products such as paddling <b>jackets,</b> personal <b>flotation</b> <b>devices</b> (PFDs) and tow-systems designed for leading edge performance.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} pet {{buoyancy}} aids have become quite popular. A web search or {{visit to a}} pet supply store will reveal many types and brands of pet buoyancy aids including full <b>life</b> <b>jackets,</b> vests, and <b>flotation</b> collars. The purpose, design, and composition of these buoyancy aids {{are very similar to}} the human version with the major difference being that pet buoyancy aids are not usually required by law, also they are generally not certified by the Coast Guard or any other government department.|$|R

2500|$|Although most pet <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> are passive devices, {{there is}} at least one {{automatically}} inflated <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> available for pets (made by Critter’s Inflatable, LLC). [...] An automatic <b>flotation</b> <b>device</b> is generally more expensive than a foam <b>life</b> <b>jacket,</b> but, like automatic PFDs designed for humans, they are less bulky to wear when not inflated, and when inflated may provide more buoyancy than foam devices. [...] Automatic pet <b>flotation</b> <b>devices</b> are popular in the bulldog community, and also for water therapy where extra support may be needed under the head.|$|R
2500|$|A {{personal}} <b>flotation</b> <b>device</b> (abbreviated as PFD; {{also referred}} to as a <b>life</b> <b>jacket,</b> <b>life</b> preserver, life belt, Mae West, life vest, <b>life</b> saver, cork <b>jacket,</b> buoyancy aid or [...] flotation suit) is a piece of equipment designed to assist a wearer to keep afloat in water. The wearer may be either conscious or unconscious.|$|R
5000|$|The Park {{stands behind}} a [...] "no flotation" [...] policy which restricts {{the use of}} <b>life</b> <b>jackets,</b> noodles, tubes and other <b>flotation</b> <b>devices</b> in the swim area. Explanations for the {{restrictions}} are readily offered by any lifeguard or ranger staff member.|$|R
50|$|While the USCG {{does not}} certify {{personal}} <b>flotation</b> <b>devices</b> for animals, many manufacturers produce <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> for {{dogs and cats}}. Every year dogs and cats die from drowning, either {{because they do not}} know how to swim, or because they tire out from overexposure or old age, or have a medical complication such as a seizure, or become unconscious.|$|R
50|$|Marston rowed a {{boat for}} Norm through Lodore and Grand canyons in 1947. On that trip, Dock and Garth {{were the first}} father-son team to each row a boat on the same trip through the Grand Canyon. Dock swam Dubendorff Rapid without a <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> or air mattress. It was the first record of anyone {{intentionally}} swimming a Grand Canyon rapid free of any <b>flotation</b> <b>device.</b>|$|R
50|$|Recreational boating deaths {{could be}} {{dramatically}} reduced with {{increased use of}} Personal <b>flotation</b> <b>devices</b> (PFDs) or <b>life</b> <b>jackets.</b> Wear rates in 2003 were around 22.4%, although state and federal laws requiring children to wear flotation were more common, and therefore children's wear rates were much higher than those for adults. Relatively few children die in boating accidents; the more likely victim is an adult male in the mid-afternoon in a boat (under 20 feet length overall) who is not wearing a PFD.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigators}} {{also revealed}} that {{the one and only}} cabin crew member, the Tunisian crew, didn't inform the passengers that the seat cushion {{could be used as a}} <b>flotation</b> <b>device.</b> This may have been the cause of the high number of drownings among the deceased. One of the main duties of the cabin crew member is to brief passengers about safety equipment on board. The passengers could have used the seat cushions for flotation as an alternative to <b>life</b> <b>jackets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flotation</b> <b>devices</b> {{are also}} found in near water-edges and at {{swimming}} pools. They may {{take the form of}} a simple vest, a jacket, a full-body suit (one piece coverall), or their variations suited for particular purposes. They are most commonly made of a tough synthetic fiber material encapsulating a source of buoyancy, such as foam or a chamber of air, and are often brightly colored yellow or orange to maximize visibility for rescuers. Some devices consist of a combination of both buoyancy foam and an air chamber. Retroreflective [...] "SOLAS" [...] tape is often sewn to the fabric used to construct <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> and PFDs to facilitate a person being spotted in darkness when a search light is shone towards the wearer.In the US, federal regulations require all persons under the age of 13 to wear a <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> (PFD) when in a watercraft under 12 meters long. State regulations may raise or lower this number and must be followed when in that state's jurisdiction.|$|R
25|$|At 9:23a.m., the VTS {{ordered the}} crew to inform the {{passengers}} to wear personal <b>flotation</b> <b>devices.</b> When the crew replied that the broadcasting equipment was out of order, the VTS told them to personally order the passengers to wear <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> and more clothing. At 9:25a.m., the VTS asked the captain to decide quickly whether to evacuate the ship, stating {{that they did not}} have enough information to make the decision. When the captain inquired about the rescue, the VTS replied that patrol boats were due to arrive in 10 minutes and a helicopter in one minute. The captain then replied that there were too many passengers for the helicopter.|$|R
50|$|In August 2008, Jazz Air {{removed all}} <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> from its {{aircraft}} {{in order to}} lower fuel costs. According to the airline, passengers are to use floating seat cushions {{in the event of}} an emergency over water. The airline also stated that the probability of a water landing on the regional airline routes was almost zero, as there is no operation over great bodies of water except for the Great Lakes and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and that in all circumstances, the airline always remains within 50 nmi km from land, as stipulated in the law, which removes the obligation from carrying any <b>flotation</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R

50|$|On {{the night}} of December 8, 2006, as Picton Castle was roughly 760 mi {{south-east}} of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the ship encountered bad weather; a wave swamped the ship, sweeping overboard one of the professional crew, later identified as 25-year-old lead seaman Laura Gainey, daughter of Bob Gainey. She was not wearing a <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> or a survival suit but, due to the warm water temperatures of 22 C and her excellent physical condition, was expected to survive for up to 36 hours. She was able to call out while being swept overboard, and crew on the ship threw <b>flotation</b> <b>devices</b> and radar reflectors into the water to aid her and mark her position. Subsequent searching by Picton Castle, assisted by aircraft of the United States and Canadian Coast Guards, and nearby merchant vessels, was unsuccessful and called off after three days.|$|R
