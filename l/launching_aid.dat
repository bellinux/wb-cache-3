5000|$|Edward Abbott and Leslie Baynes {{had already}} {{separately}} {{designed and built}} sailplanes when they joined forces in 1931 as Abbott-Baynes Sailplanes to produce Baynes' Scud I and II designs. The idea of adding an engine to a sailplane to make it self-launching, but mounted {{in such a way}} that propeller and engine could be retracted at altitude to produce an aerodynamically clean glider came from Sir John Carden, who had already collaborated with Abbott and Baynes on other projects. [...] Baynes' Scud 3 was designed specifically to include such a <b>launching</b> <b>aid</b> but was also capable of high performance engineless flight. Without an engine it was known as the Abbott-Baynes Scud 3; with the engine, as the Carden-Baynes Auxiliary. [...] Since the engine could be removed or retrofitted the nomenclature sometimes became confused. The Auxiliary is historically significant as the first sailplane with a retractable engine and propeller. [...] CG Grey, respected editor of The Aeroplane, wrote after the first flight of the Scud 3, piloted by Dr Dewsbery [...] "Dewsbery now holds the certainly unique position of being the first aviator to retract his motor and airscrew while flying." ...|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} {{essential}} challenges that cities and {{villages in the}} Federal Republic of Germany are faced with: the weak economic basis, which has been declining {{in the last few}} years; the large-space nature of political systems, which has been accelerated by the European Union and eastern and western Europe coming together; and new urban and regional policy systems, whose development is being shaped on the European level. The value of consolidated areas is being enhanced by their increased importance and increasing competition from (European) metropolises as this is expressed by the national urban and regional policy. This forces the rural regions to be especially insistent upon their interests by forming regional initiatives. This supports the co-operation between cities and villages within one region and their institutions with regard to politics, economics and finances. The region under investigation has its two medium centres Neustadt near Coburg and Sonneberg. They initiated a regional development strategy to work towards a reversal from short-term measures towards medium- and long-term strategies for regional policy. This instrument was intended not only to utilise the stimulation produced by reunification and link it to ideas for regional development. It was also important to take an independent path in comparison to the possibilities for action that consolidated areas have. A number of strategies and measures can contribute to a strengthening of regional development {{from a wide variety of}} partial areas. For instance, agriculture could be supported by promoting direct marketing, intensifying sales to local restaurants in the sense of regional economic flow or by being orientated towards quality ecological products. With regard to the labour market and the economy, improving paths of information and communication or promoting training and further education could play an important role just as much as a co-ordinated policy on commercial areas such as is being stepped up by Neustadt and Sonneberg. The future development of the region under investigation will decisively depend upon how much it is capable of motivating the regional protagonists to act jointly and constructively. The current buzzwords here are the much-discussed terms if "intermunicipal cooperation" and "public-private partnerships". There will be significant opportunities for improving the region's competitiveness only if the cities and villages cease to think in terms of competing with one another and when the enterprises, associations and interest groups are made aware of their responsibility for the region. For this purpose, it is important to tackle the existing problems with regard to cooperation among cities. Furthermore, the projected staff office for regional management has to receive the appropriate amount of <b>launching</b> <b>aid</b> from the Free States and municipalities...|$|E

The criteria currently employed in WTO and EU proceedings are consistent with correct accounting for the opportunity cost of capital when markets are complete and frictionless, but fail in the presence of payoff-relevant market incompleteness where the interval between bid and ask prices may not be finessed away. An economic definition of subsidy must necessarily capture opportunity cost, and we develop a definition that fully incorporates government’s opportunity cost in both complete and incomplete market settings.

5000|$|Meanwhile, though, it {{had become}} common {{knowledge}} that Li Huaiguang despised several officials that Emperor Dezong trusted — the chancellor Lu Qi and other ministers Zhao Zan (趙贊) and Bai Zhizhen (白志貞) — {{and that he would}} recommend to Emperor Dezong that those officials be removed. When Lu heard this, he believed that he had to prevent a meeting between Emperor Dezong and Li Huaiguang at all costs, and therefore suggested to Emperor Dezong order Li Huaiguang to attack Chang'an at once. Emperor Dezong agreed, and ordered Li Huaiguang to rendezvous with Li Sheng, Li Jianhui (李建徽), and Yang Huiyuan (楊惠元) to attack Chang'an. Li Huaiguang, angry that he was not even able to meet the emperor, began to resent Emperor Dezong. He stopped his army's movement and submitted petitions accusing Lu and the others of crimes and further accusing them of being responsible for the Jingyuan mutiny. Emperor Dezong was forced to demote and exile Lu, Bai, and Zhao. Li Huaiguang also submitted a petition accusing Zhai Wenxiu of crimes, and Emperor Dezong executed Zhai in response. [...] Only after these events occurred did Li Huaiguang rendezvous with Li Sheng, Li Jianhui, and Yang, in spring 784. Meanwhile, when Emperor Dezong sought aid from the Tibetan Empire, the Tibetan chancellor Shang Jiezan (尚結贊) refused to launch forces unless he could get an explicit cosigning of the aid request by Li Huaiguang, citing the Tibetan Empire's own laws about how it would only <b>launch</b> troops in <b>aid</b> if the supreme commander of the state seeking aid also agreed with the aid request. Li Huaiguang was vehemently against seeking Tibetan aid, however, citing how Tibetan troops would surely pillage the region and also seek excessive rewards, and he refused to cosign the aid request, and Shang refused to <b>launch</b> <b>aid</b> troops. Emperor Dezong's trusted advisor Lu Zhi, believing Li Huaiguang {{to be on the verge}} of rebellion and fearing that Li Huaiguang would take over the troops under Li Sheng, Li Jianhui, and Yang, urged that those three armies be separated from Li Huaiguang's army and take up position elsewhere; Emperor Dezong repositioned Li Sheng, but believing that relocating Li Jianhui and Yang as well would bring further resentment from Li Huaiguang, did not move them.|$|R
