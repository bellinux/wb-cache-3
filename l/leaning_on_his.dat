25|$|For example, in the Rishabaandhika or the Vrishabavahana murthy pose, we see Shiva {{standing}} {{with one leg}} youthfully crossed across the other and his arm elegantly flexed and raised as if resting or leaning on something.

25|$|The fight {{took place}} in October 2013, Klitschko's third undefeated {{consecutive}} opponent. The bout was marred with over 160 clinches, most initiated by Klitschko, followed by several repeated roughhouse tactics throughout the match against Povetkin. This included <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> opponent and pushing {{his head down and}} throwing Povetkin to the canvas, which resulted in the referee scoring some as knockdowns. Klitschko won by unanimous decision scoring a knockdown in round 2 from a flush jab, and 3 knockdowns in round 7 including one prompted from a big right uppercut. All 3 judges scored it 119–104 on the scorecards. Klitschko landed 139 of 417 punches (33%) and Povetkin connected on 59 of 283 (21%).|$|E
2500|$|In Christmas on Bear Mountain, Scrooge was a bearded, bespectacled, {{reasonably}} wealthy old duck, visibly <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> cane, {{and living}} in isolation in a [...] "huge mansion".

2500|$|... 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel give {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} Saul's death. In 1 Samuel, {{and in a}} parallel account in 1 Chronicles 10, as the defeated Israelites flee, Saul asks his armour bearer to kill him, but he refuses, and so Saul falls upon his own sword. In 2 Samuel, an Amalekite tells David he found Saul <b>leaning</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> spear after the battle and delivered the coup de grâce. David has the Amalekite put to death for rejoicing {{in the death of}} the anointed king.|$|E
