25|$|The {{band was}} a lot of fun. I think there was great rapport between the people in it. And none of us wanted to leave. We were always getting sort of offers from other bands for much more money than we were making with Woody, and it was always <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> left, you were a rat. You were really letting down the team.|$|E
25|$|Curiously, around half of {{the protein}} {{products}} of transferred genes aren't even targeted back to the chloroplast. Many became exaptations, taking on new functions like participating in cell division, protein routing, and even disease resistance. A few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome—most became nonfunctional pseudogenes, though a few tRNA genes still work in the mitochondrion. Some transferred chloroplast DNA protein products get directed to the secretory pathway though {{it should be noted}} that many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's cell membrane, and therefore topologically outside of the cell, because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol, you have to cross the cell membrane, just <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were headed for the extracellular space. In those cases, chloroplast-targeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway.|$|E
500|$|... "Push the Button" [...] was conceptualised after {{group member}} Keisha Buchanan {{developed}} an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin. Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian {{that she made}} advances towards the man, but {{he was unaware of}} her intentions: [...] "I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd be like, that movie sounds great, let me know what it's <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go see it. I knew he liked me too but he just wasn't getting what I was trying to say." [...] Austin advised Buchanan to tell the man to [...] "push that button" [...] or she would eventually move on.|$|E

500|$|Amber and Ginger would re-appear {{in later}} episodes of the series. They first {{returned}} {{in the season}} 13 episode [...] "Brawl in the Family", in which they track down Homer and Ned. In the DVD commentary for said episode, current show runner Al Jean praised [...] "Viva Ned Flanders", but stated that he thought the ending was [...] "loose". He said, [...] "Usually, <b>like,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> leave a wife like, in Vegas, they track you down". [...] "Brawl in the Family" [...] was produced to [...] "resolve" [...] the ending to [...] "Viva Ned Flanders". In the season 18 episode [...] "Jazzy and the Pussycats", the Simpson family attend Amber's funeral, after it is revealed that she has died of a drug overdose while waiting in line to ride a rollercoaster.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical meaning behind [...] "Give It Away" [...] is {{centered}} on the philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior. The song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase [...] "give it away", which is taken from an experience Kiedis had with his former girlfriend—punk rock singer Nina Hagen—in the early 1980s. Hagen was several years Kiedis' senior and became a role-model during his drug addiction to heroin: [...] "she realized how young and inexperienced I was then, so she was always passing on gems to me, not in a preachy way, just by seizing on opportunities." [...] When Kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked, and commented to Hagen that it was [...] "really cool". Upon expressing this, Hagen immediately told him to keep it. Her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable, and explained to Kiedis that [...] "if you have a closet full of clothes {{and you try to}} keep them all, your life will get very small. But if you have a full closet and someone sees something they <b>like,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> give it to them, the world is a better place." ...|$|E

2500|$|American writer George Saunders, {{when asked}} for a {{literary}} influence said [...] "There's a Russian writer named Isaac Babel that I love. I can drop in anywhere in his works, read a few pages, and go, Oh yeah, language. It's almost <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were tuning a guitar and you heard a beautifully tuned one and you say, Yeah, that's what we want. We want something that perfect. When I read him, it recalibrates my ear. It {{reminds me of the}} difference between an OK sentence and a really masterful sentence. Babel does it for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jamaican male sexual {{identity}} {{has long been}} defined in opposition to homosexuality. According to Dr. Kingsley Ragashanti Stewart, a {{professor of anthropology at}} the University of the West Indies, [...] "A lot of Jamaican men, if you call them a homosexual, ... will immediately get violent. It's the worst insult you could give to a Jamaican man." [...] Dr. Stewart believes that homophobia influences almost every aspect of life and shapes the everyday language of ghetto youth. [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> say, 'Come back here,' they will say, 'No, no, no don't say 'come back'.' You have to say 'come forward,' because come back is implying that you're 'coming in the back,' which is how gay men have sex." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2014, it was {{reported}} that Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions had bought the rights to the film under the Stage 6 Films banner, with Michael London and his company Groundswell Productions producing the feature. The film was originally picked up by New Line Cinema in November 2011, but the script was shopped elsewhere when production did not get off the ground. The screenplay was written by Joshua John Miller and M.A. Fortin, and was directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson. Miller's father, Jason Miller, was an actor and writer who appeared as Father Karras in The Exorcist. The script for The Final Girls was in part inspired by The Exorcist, with Miller pointing out, [...] "I grew up watching my dad in The Exorcist, and there's something haunting, strange, confusing, and a little bit unnatural to see your parent constantly die in a film. But it's something that also becomes iconic, and we tried to deconstruct what the effects of that would be, as well as what it would be <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had a second chance, but your second chance was inside of a movie?" [...] Miller and Fortin also served as executive producers, alongside Darren M. Demetre.|$|E
2500|$|Blomkamp {{wanted the}} aliens to {{maintain}} both humanistic and barbaric {{features in the}} design of the creatures. According to Terri Tatchell, the director's writing partner, [...] "They are not appealing, they are not cute, and they don't tug at our heartstrings. He went for a scary, hard, warrior-looking alien, which is much more of a challenge." [...] The look of the alien, with its exoskeleton-crustacean hybrid and crab-like shells, was meant to initially evoke a sense of disgust from viewers but as the story progresses, the audience was meant to sympathize with these creatures who had such human-like emotions and characteristics. Blomkamp established criteria for the design of the aliens. He wanted the species to be insect-like but also bipedal. The director wanted the audience to relate to the aliens and said of the restriction on the creature design, [...] "Unfortunately, they had to be human-esque because our psychology doesn't allow us to really empathize with something unless it has a face and an anthropomorphic shape. <b>Like</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> see something that's four-legged, you think it's a dog; that's just how we're wired... If you make a film about an alien force, which is the oppressor or aggressor, and you don't want to empathize with them, you can go to town. So creatively that's what I wanted to do but story-wise, I just couldn't." ...|$|E
