25|$|In 2004, Dr Xun Zhou, a {{research}} fellow at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, published doubts regarding the authenticity of the Kaifeng community. Zhou asserts that the apparent presence of the Jews was largely a Western cultural construct, which grew following the publication by James Finn of The Jews in China (1840) and The Orphan Colony of Jews in China (1874) whose initial research was based upon the accounts of the 17th century Jesuit missionaries. She maintains that the community had no Torah scrolls until 1851, when they suddenly appeared to be sold to eager Western collectors. She also states that drawings of the synagogue were doctored in the West because the original did not <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>one,</b> and that the Kaifeng community claimed to have kept some Jewish practices since before they are known to have begun. Xun Zhou's conclusion is that the Kaifeng community was not Jewish in any meaningful sense.|$|E
500|$|Several props {{included}} large {{screens and}} LED lights that {{were placed in}} a three-wall room, omitting the front wall in order to shoot the video. Suzuki explained that the scenery is not in fact [...] "a night club", as she believed that it has [...] "no story" [...] and only works by the [...] "feel-good" [...] vibe of the song itself; however, she did note how the lights made it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>one.</b> Nakata made a cameo appearance in the visual, appearing in the static televisions that {{were placed in the}} room. Length-wise, it took Akihisa one day to complete filming, with the entire crew and Suzuki spending majority of the entire day, and finishing at approximately 3am.|$|E

Originally, the script called for the {{antagonist}} to be an African American [...] "Louis Farrakhan-like" [...] character, but Fox was concerned that the show's increasing popularity with black viewers would be damaged by this, and Gordon agreed to make the villains into, in his words, [...] "cartoonish neo-Nazis". Gastown, Vancouver stood in for many of the exterior shots that were supposed to be Brooklyn. No Jewish synagogue would rent out their space for the episode, so Shaughnessy Heights United Church was renovated to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>one.</b> This included completely redecorating the pews, carpet, and light fixtures, as well as crafting a Jewish altar. The episode's title is a reference to the Jewish mourning prayer service (...) [...] [...] "Kaddish" [...] has been critically examined for its themes concerning love and hate.|$|E

500|$|For [...] "Top Hat, White Tie and Tails", {{probably}} Astaire's {{most celebrated}} tap solo, {{the idea for}} the title song came from Astaire who described to Berlin a routine he had created for the 1930 Ziegfeld Broadway flop Smiles called [...] "Say, Young Man of Manattan," [...] in which he gunned down a chorus of men – which included teenagers Bob Hope and Larry Adler – with his cane. Berlin duly produced the song from his trunk and the concept of the film was then built around it. In this number Astaire had to compromise on his one-take philosophy, as Sandrich acknowledged: [...] "We went to huge lengths to make the 'Top Hat' number <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>one</b> take, but actually it's several." [...] Astaire's remarkable ability to change the tempo within a single dance phrase is extensively featured throughout this routine and taken to extremes – as when he explodes into activity from a pose of complete quiet and vice versa. This routine also marks Astaire's first use of a cane as a prop in one of his filmed dances. The number opens with a chorus strutting and lunging in front of a backdrop of a Parisian street scene. They make way for Astaire who strides confidently {{to the front of the}} stage and delivers the song, which features the famous line: [...] "I'm stepping out, my dear, to breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class," [...] trading the occasional tap barrage with the chorus as he sings.The dance begins with Astaire and chorus moving in step. Astaire soon lashes out with a swirling tap step and the chorus responds timidly before leaving the stage in a sequence of overlapping, direction-shifting, hitch steps and walks. In the first part of the solo which follows, Astaire embarks on a circular tap movement, embellished with cane taps into which he mixes a series of unpredictable pauses. As the camera retreats the lights dim and, in the misterioso passage which follows, Astaire mimes a series of stances, ranging from overt friendliness, wariness, surprise to watchful readiness and jaunty confidence. Jimmy Cagney attended the shooting of this scene and advised Astaire, who claims to have ad-libbed much of this section. The chorus then returns in a threatening posture, and Astaire proceeds to dispatch them all, using an inventive series of actions miming the cane's use as a gun, a submachine gun, a rifle and, finally, a bow and arrow.|$|E
