CLP allows a user to direct a ReFlex capable device to send or receive messages. CLP is used by Advantra's ReFLEX devices.

40|$|Abstract. Time-stamping protocols, which {{assure that}} a {{document}} was existed {{at a certain}} time, are applied to some useful and practical applications such as electronic patent applications and so on. There are two major time-stamping protocols, the simple protocol and the <b>linking</b> <b>protocol.</b> In the former, a time-stamp authority issues a time-stamp token that is the digital signature of the concatenated value of a hashed message and the present time. In the latter, the time-stamp authority issues a time-stamp token that is the hash value of the concatenated value of a hashed message and the previous hash value. Although security requirements and analysis for above time-stamping protocols has been discussed, there are no strict cryptographic security notions for them. In this paper, we reconsider the security requirements for timestamping protocols and define security notions for them, in a universally composable security sense, which was proposed by Canetti. We also show that these notions can be achieved using combinations of a secure key exchange protocol, a secure symmetric encryption scheme, and a secure digital signature scheme...|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} CRC-based framing was {{developed}} by StrataCom, Inc. {{in order to improve}} the efficiency of a pre-standard Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) <b>link</b> <b>protocol.</b> This technology was ultimately used in the principal <b>link</b> <b>protocols</b> of ATM itself {{and was one of the}} most significant developments of StrataCom. An advanced version of CRC-based framing was used in the ITU-T SG15 G.7041 Generic Framing Procedure (GFP), which itself is used in several packet <b>link</b> <b>protocols.</b>|$|R

40|$|We present two new {{approaches}} to improving the integrity of network broadcasts and multicasts with low storage and computation overhead. The first approach is a leapfrog <b>linking</b> <b>protocol</b> for securing the integrity of packets as they traverse a network during a broadcast, {{such as in the}} setup phase for link-state routing. This technique allows each router to gain confidence about the integrity of a packet before passing it on to the next router; hence, allows many integrity violations to be stopped immediately in their tracks. The second approach is a novel key predistribution scheme that we use in conjunction with a small number of hashed message authentication codes (HMACs), which allows end-to-end integrity checking as well as improved hop-by-hop integrity checking. Our schemes are suited to environments, such as in ad hoc and overlay networks, where routers can share {{only a small number of}} symmetric keys. Moreover, our protocols do not use encryption (which, of course, can be added as an optional security enhancement). Instead, security is based strictly on the use of one-way hash functions; hence, our algorithms are considerably faster than those based on traditional public-key signature schemes. This improvement in speed comes with only modest reductions in the security for broadcasting, as our schemes can tolerate small numbers of malicious routers, provided they donâ€™t form significant cooperating coalitions. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} monitor the {{effectiveness}} of HPV vaccination in Canada the linkage of multiple data registries may be required. These registries {{may not always be}} managed by the same organization and, furthermore, privacy legislation or practices may restrict any data linkages of records that can actually be done among registries. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a secure protocol for linking data from different registries and to allow on-going monitoring of HPV vaccine effectiveness. A secure <b>linking</b> <b>protocol,</b> using commutative hash functions and secure multi-party computation techniques was developed. This protocol allows for the exact matching of records among registries and the computation of statistics on the linked data while meeting five practical requirements to ensure patient confidentiality and privacy. The statistics considered were: odds ratio and its confidence interval, chi-square test, and relative risk and its confidence interval. Additional statistics on contingency tables, such as other measures of association, can be added using the same principles presented. The computation time performance of this protocol was evaluated. The protocol has acceptable computation time and scales linearly with the size of the data set and the size of the contingency table. The worse case computation time for up to 100, 000 patients returned by each query and a 16 cell contingency table is less than 4 hours for basic statistics, and the best case is under 3 hours. A computationally practical protocol for the secure linking of data from multiple registries has been demonstrated in the context of HPV vaccine initiative impact assessment. The basic protocol can be generalized to the surveillance of other conditions, diseases, or vaccination programs...|$|E
