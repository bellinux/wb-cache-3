25|$|A. Nakagawa et. al. {{invented the}} device design concept of non-latch-up IGBTs in 1984. The {{invention}} {{is characterized by}} the device design setting the device saturation current below the <b>latch-up</b> current, which triggers the parasitic thyristor. This invention realized complete suppression of the parasitic thyristor action because the maximum collector current was limited by the saturation current and never exceeded the <b>latch-up</b> current. After the invention of the device design concept of non-latch-up IGBTs, IGBTs evolved rapidly and the design of non-latch-up IGBTs became a de facto standard.|$|E
25|$|Practical devices {{capable of}} {{operating}} {{over an extended}} current range were first reported by Baliga et al. in 1982. A similar paper was also submitted by J. P. Russel et al. to IEEE Electron Device Letter in 1982. The applications for the device were initially regarded by the power electronics community to be severely restricted by its slow switching speed and <b>latch-up</b> of the parasitic thyristor structure inherent within the device. However, it was demonstrated by Baliga and also by A. M. Goodman et al. in 1983 that the switching speed could be adjusted over a broad range by using electron irradiation. This was followed by demonstration of operation of the device at elevated temperatures by Baliga in 1985. Successful efforts to suppress the <b>latch-up</b> of the parasitic thyristor and the scaling of the voltage rating of the devices at GE allowed the introduction of commercial devices in 1983, which could be utilized {{for a wide variety}} of applications.|$|E
2500|$|Complete {{suppression}} of the parasitic thyristor action and the resultant non-latch-up IGBT operation for the entire device operation range was achieved by A. Nakagawa et al. in 1984. The non-latch-up design concept was filed for US patents. To test the lack of <b>latch-up,</b> the prototype 1200V IGBTs were directly connected without any loads across a 600V constant voltage source and were switched on for 25 microseconds. The entire 600V was dropped across the device and a large short circuit current flowed. The devices successfully withstood this severe condition. This was the first demonstration of so-called [...] "short-circuit-withstanding-capability" [...] in IGBTs. Non-latch-up IGBT operation was ensured, for the first time, for the entire device operation range. In this sense, the non-latch-up IGBT proposed by Hans W. Becke and Carl F. Wheatley was realized by A. Nakagawa et al. in 1984. Products of non-latch-up IGBTs were first commercialized by Toshiba in 1985.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the 14 nm Intel Broadwell 5 th {{generation}} core series 5005 U-i 3 and 5200 U-i 5 was mounted on Dell Inspiron laptops, MSI Cubi and Gigabyte Brix barebones and tested with Windows 8 and CentOS 7 at idle. Heavy-ion-induced hard- and catastrophic failures {{do not appear}} to be related to the Intel 14 nm Tri-Gate FinFET process. They originate from a small (9 m 140 m) area on the 32 nm planar PCH die (not the CPU) as initially speculated. The hard failures seem to be due to a SEE but the exact physical mechanism has yet to be identified. Some possibilities include <b>latch-ups,</b> charge ion trapping or implantation, ion channels, or a combination of those (in biased conditions). The mechanism of the catastrophic failures seems related to the presence of electric power (1. 05 V core voltage). The 1064 nm laser mimics ionization radiation and induces soft- and hard failures as a direct result of electron-hole pair production, not heat. The 14 nm FinFET processes continue to look promising for space radiation environments...|$|R
40|$|Within the PROBA- 2 {{microsatellite}} mission, a miniaturized single-frequency GPS receiver {{based on}} commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology is employed for onboard navigation and timing. A rapid electronic fuse protects against destructive single-event <b>latch-ups</b> (SEL) and enables a quasi-continuous receiver operation despite the inherent sensitivity to space radiation. While limited to single-frequency C/A-code tracking with a narrow-band frontend, the receiver {{is able to}} provide precision navigation services through processing of raw GPS measurements on ground {{as well as a}} built-in real-time navigation system. In both cases, ionospheric path delays are eliminated through a combination of L 1 pseudorange and carrier phase measurements, which also offers a factor-of-two noise reduction relative to code-only processing. By comparison with satellite laser ranging (SLR) measurements, a 0. 3 -m (3 D rms) accuracy is demonstrated for the PROBA- 2 reduced dynamic orbit determinations using post-processed GPS orbit and clock products. Furthermore, the experimental onboard navigation system is shown to provide real-time position information with a 3 D rms accuracy of about 1 m, which notably outperforms the specification of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS). In view of their lower hardware complexity, mass budget and power requirements as well as the reduced interference susceptibility, legacy C/A-code receivers can thus provide an attractive alternative to dual-frequency receivers even for demanding navigation applications in low Earth orbit...|$|R

The MDT-ASD is an 8 -channel drift tube read-out ASIC fabricated in a commercial 0. 5 Pm CMOS process (AMOS 14 TB). The chip contains a 53 bit register which holds the setup information and an associated shift register of the same length plus some additional control logic. 10 test devices were exposed to a 160 MeV proton beam with a fluence of 1. 05 · 109 p·cm- 2 ·s- 1 up to t 4. 4 · 1012 p·cm- 2 per device. After a total fluence of 4. 46 · 1013 p ·cm- 2, 7 soft SEEs (non-permanent bit flips in the registers) and 0 hard/destructive SEE (e. g. <b>latch-ups,</b> SEL) had occurred. The simulated fluence for 10 years of LHC operation at nominal luminosity for worst case location MDT components is 2. 67 · 1011 h·cm- 2 The rate of SEUs in the ASD setup register for all of ATLAS, derived from these numbers, is 2. 4 per day.

40|$|Scientific {{instruments}} for challenging and cost-optimized space missions {{have to reduce}} their resource requirements while keeping the high performance levels of conventional instruments. In this context {{the development of an}} instrument front-end ASIC (0. 35 mu m CMOS from austriamicrosystems) for magnetic field sensors based on the fluxgate principle was undertaken. It is based on the combination of the conventional readout electronics of a fluxgate magnetometer with the control loop of a sigma-delta modulator for a direct digitization of the magnetic field. The analogue part is based on a modified 2 - 2 cascaded sigma-delta modulator. The digital part includes a primary (128 Hz output) and secondary decimation filter (2, 4, 8, [...] ., 64 Hz output) as well as a serial synchronous interface. The chip area is 20 mm(2) and the total power consumption is 60 mW. It has been demonstrated that the overall functionality and performance of the magnetometer front-end ASIC (MFA) is sufficient for scientific applications in space. Noise performance (SNR of 89 dB with a bandwidth of 30 Hz) and offset stability (< 5 pT degrees C- 1 MFA temperature, < +/- 0. 2 nT within 250 h) are very satisfying and the linear gain drift of 60 ppm degrees C- 1 is acceptable. Only a cross-tone phenomenon must be avoided in future designs even though it is possible to mitigate the effect to a level that is tolerable. The MFA stays within its parameters up to 170 krad of total ionizing dose and it keeps full functionality up to more than 300 krad. The threshold for <b>latch-ups</b> is 14 MeV cm(2) mg(- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Trabajo presentado al "AMICSA 2012 " celebrado del 27 al 28 de Agosto del 2012 en Noordwijk (Holanda). [...] et al. The {{design of}} mixed-signal ASICs {{requires}} a detailed {{knowledge of the}} behaviour of the technology which exceeds the needs of digital designs. For space applications, with its extended temperature and radiation environment, {{the job of the}} mixed-signal designer is more difficult as in most cases commercial foundries do not have or make available data on the behaviour of their devices under those new conditions. The first step has been to develop a plan to assess and characterize a commercial (AMS) 0. 35 μm CMOS technology when exposed to radiation or to temperatures below the standard industrial or automotive ranges. Development of a RHBD digital library is also in progress. The results is being initially applied in the design of two ASICs for instrumentation for missions to Mars. Three different characterization test chips have been designed with several objectives in mind: a) evaluate the behaviour of the individual devices at temperatures down to - 110 C; b) verify the algorithms to map the geometries of enclosed layout transistors; c) evaluate the impact of Total-Ionization-Dose (TID) on devices (Vth drift, leakage) and heavy-ions on single-event-effects (SEE). Each chip contained five multiplexed arrays of 4 x 4 transistors, allowing access to a maximum of 80 transistors using only 17 package pins. Temperature tests have been performed at IMSE-USE, and INTA. TID tests {{have been made in the}} facilities of the Laboratorio de Radiofísica of the Universidad de Santiago de Compostela (Spain) (LR-USC). Prior to the SEE tests, which have been made at the Heavy-Ion Irradiation Facility in the University of Louvain-la-Neuve (HIF-UCL), the SEE test system was debugged using a Californium (Cf- 252) source at the Centro Nacional de Aceleradores of the University of Sevilla (CNA-US). Test results show that with the standard layout procedures for leakage reduction in NMOS transistors, the leakage and voltage drifts caused by radiation up to 300 krad are acceptable with slightly increased design margins for threshold voltage. Drift effects are more pronounced in transistors with close to minimum dimensions, and in transistors with thick oxide, intended to operate with 5 V supply. The behaviour at low temperatures did not show significant deviations from that predicted by the foundry models. LET threshold values were measured in the first test chip using shift-register chains with cells constructed using different layout styles. SEU LET threshold for the standard library cells was in the range of 5. 5 MeV/mg/cm 2; for SRs built using ringed-drain NMOS and improved substrate and guard connections, LET threshold increased to 15. 6 MeV/mg/cm 2, and to 35. 2 MeV/mg/cm 2 when fully enclosed layouts were used. <b>Latch-ups</b> were observed only in the logic implemented with the standard library, with a LET threshold in the order of 9 MeV/mg/cm 2, but was not observed in the custom-designed digital cells up to a LET of 67. 7 MeV/mg/cm 2.

50|$|The <b>latch-up</b> {{does not}} have to happen between the power rails - it can happen at any place where the {{required}} parasitic structure exists. A common cause of <b>latch-up</b> is a positive or negative voltage spike on an input or output pin of a digital chip that exceeds the rail voltage by more than a diode drop. Another cause is the supply voltage exceeding the absolute maximum rating, often from a transient spike in the power supply. It leads to a breakdown of an internal junction. This frequently happens in circuits which use multiple supply voltages that do not come up in the required sequence on power-up, leading to voltages on data lines exceeding the input rating of parts that have not yet reached a nominal supply voltage. Latch-ups can also be caused by an electrostatic discharge event.|$|E
50|$|Buffers {{can be used}} {{to isolate}} {{capacitance}} on one segment from another and/or allow I²C to be sent over longer cables or traces. Buffers for bi-directional lines such as I²C must use one of several schemes for preventing <b>latch-up.</b> I²C is open-drain, so buffers must drive a low on one side when they see a low on the other. One method for preventing <b>latch-up</b> is for a buffer to have carefully selected input and output levels such that the output level of its driver is higher than its input threshold, preventing it from triggering itself. For example, a buffer may have an input threshold of 0.4 V for detecting a low, but an output low level of 0.5 V. This method requires that all other devices on the bus have thresholds which are compatible and often means that multiple buffers implementing this scheme cannot be put in series with one another.|$|E

50|$|Slow {{changes of}} {{power supply voltage}} do not cause {{significant}} disturbances, but rapid changes can make unpredictable trouble. If a voltage exceeds parameters in the controller's data sheet by 150 percent, it can cause the input port or the output port to get hung in one state, known as CMOS <b>latch-up.</b> Without internal current control, <b>latch-up</b> causes the microcontroller to burn out. The standard solution {{is a mix of}} software and hardware changes. Most embedded systems have a watchdog timer. This watchdog should be external to the microcontroller so that {{it is likely to be}} immune to any plausible electromagnetic interference. It should reset the power supply, briefly switching it off. The watchdog period should be half or less of the time and power required to burn out the microcontroller. The power supply design should be well-grounded and decoupled using capacitors and inductors close to the microcontroller; some typical values are 100uF and 0.1uF in parallel.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, {{other types}} of buffers exist that {{implement}} current amplifiers or {{keep track of the}} state (i.e. which side drove the bus low) to prevent <b>latch-up.</b> The state method typically means that an unintended pulse is created during a hand-off when one side is driving the bus low, then the other drives it low, then the first side releases (this is common during an I²C acknowledgement).|$|E
50|$|A <b>latch-up</b> {{is a type}} {{of short}} circuit which can occur in an {{integrated}} circuit (IC).

50|$|In space, {{high energy}} {{ionizing}} particles exist {{as part of}} the natural background, referred to as galactic cosmic rays (GCR).

The high energies associated with the phenomenon in the space particle environment generally render increased spacecraft shielding useless in terms of eliminating SEU and catastrophic single event phenomena (e.g. destructive <b>latch-up).</b> Secondary atmospheric neutrons generated by cosmic rays can also have sufficiently high energy for producing SEUs in electronics on aircraft flights over the poles or at high altitude.
