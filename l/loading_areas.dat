25|$|In the past, ferries were {{equipped}} for vehicle transport, at {{a charge of}} $3 per automobile. A vehicle ban was approved in 1992, after the Whitehall Terminal was destroyed and subsequently rebuilt without vehicle <b>loading</b> <b>areas,</b> but the September 11 attacks ended vehicle crossings at the temporary terminal as well. It has been proposed to bring car boarding back due to rising tolls on the Verrazano Bridge, but the plan was seen as unlikely due {{to the amount of}} effort needed to screen every car.|$|E
25|$|After {{control of}} Las Vegas Boulevard was {{transferred}} from the state to Clark County, county officials decided to improve access and increase safety around the sign for photo-seekers. On December 8, 2008, site improvements were completed in the median allowing official public access to the welcome sign for the first time. The $400,000 project included a parking lot with 12 parking spaces and two <b>loading</b> <b>areas</b> for buses and limousines, {{as well as a}} paved walkway leading from the parking to the sign viewing area.|$|E

50|$|The {{thinking}} {{behind the}} car {{was similar to that}} of Renault chairman Pierre Lefaucheux at this time: the 171 was intended to satisfy similar marketplace objectives to those addressed by the Renault Colorale. It first appeared formally at the Paris Motor Show in 1949, but sales started only in 1950 of two different “Pick-up” versions, designed to take a ton of load. The “Pick-up Normal” version, with an advertised starting price of 991,500 Francs, had its <b>load</b> <b>area</b> behind the vehicle's cabin but between the two rear wheels, giving a <b>load</b> <b>area</b> that was unencumbered by wheel arches but relatively narrow. With the “Pick-up Large” version the <b>load</b> <b>area</b> extended to the full width of the cabin, but with the intrusion of the wheel arches. The bodywork of the <b>load</b> <b>area</b> did not extend beyond the cabin width on either version.|$|R

50|$|Freight {{warehouses}} and <b>loading</b> <b>areas</b> {{in the station}} hardly increased in the late 19th century despite an increase of about 20 percent of traffic since 1878.

50|$|The {{next stage}} of {{development}} was forced {{as a result of}} the Second World War. In order to save material and labour, railway vehicle designs were simplified. As covered wagons the Gmhs Bremen appeared as a successor to the Ghs Oppeln, and the Glmhs Leipzig followed the Gl Dresden. These so-called wartime classes (Kriegsbauart) were also welded, and had <b>loading</b> <b>areas</b> of 23.6 m² and 29.1 m² respectively. More robust variants of these wagon classes were procured after the war by the Deutsche Bundesbahn and the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB).|$|E
50|$|The Spiegelau Forest Railway transported logs to the <b>loading</b> <b>areas</b> at Spiegelau or at Klingenbrunn, {{where they}} were loaded onto {{standard}} gauge track and dispatched {{in the direction of}} Zwiesel. The lines were very steep and winding. Tracks were laid on robust railway embankments. Tracks were frequently lifted at a particular site, loaded onto a train and relaid elsewhere. At the Betriebswerk in Spiegelau the forestry commission built a locomotive turntable in the early 1920s. At Sagwassersäge there was a wye track and Klingenbrunn had a terminal loop.|$|E
