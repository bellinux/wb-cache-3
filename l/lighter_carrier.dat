40|$|This article {{describes}} the challenges in focusing nanoparticles (< 30 nm) into tightly collimated beams, and provide guidelines for designing aerodynamic lens systems for nanoparticles. The major difficulties of focusing nanoparticles arise from their low inertia and high diffusivity. Because of their low inertia, nanoparticles tend to closely follow gas streamlines; their high diffusivities lead to beam broadening and diffusional deposition. We have identified the min-imum particle size that can be focused to the axis with a single lens when diffusion is neglected, assuming that the flow is continuum and subsonic. We show that <b>lighter</b> <b>carrier</b> gases are preferred for focusing small particles, and that multiple lenses operating at sub-optimal Stokes numbers can be designed to focus particles smaller than was recognized previously. There exists a maximum pressure under which particles can be optimally focused, while particle dif-fusion and pumping requirements are minimized. Finally, we de-scribe the procedure for designing aerodynamic lens systems for focusing nanoparticles, and present {{a case study of}} designing a sin-gle aerodynamic lens to focus 5 nm particles...|$|E
40|$|Using first-principles calculations, {{we study}} the {{electronic}} properties of few-layer phosphorene focusing on layer-dependent behavior of band gap, work function and band alignment and carrier effective mass. It is found that few-layer phosphorene shows a robust {{direct band gap}} character, and its band gap decreases {{with the number of}} layers following a power law. The work function decreases rapidly from monolayer (5. 16 eV) to trilayer (4. 56 eV), and then slowly upon further increasing the layer number. Compared to monolayer phosphorene, there is a drastic decrease of hole effective mass along the ridge (zigzag) direction for bilayer phosphorene, indicating a strong interlayer coupling and screening effect. Our study suggests that 1). Few-layer phosphorene with a layer-dependent band gap and a robust direct band gap character is promising for efficient solar energy harvest. 2). Few-layer phosphorene outperforms monolayer counterpart in terms of a <b>lighter</b> <b>carrier</b> effective mass, a higher carrier density and a weaker scattering due to enhanced screening. 3). The layer-dependent band edges and work functions of few-layer phosphorene allow for modification of Schottky barrier with enhanced carrier injection efficiency. It is expected that few-layer phosphorene will present abundant opportunities for a plethora of new electronic applications...|$|E
