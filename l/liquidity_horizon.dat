40|$|The recent {{incremental}} risk charge {{addition to the}} Basel (1996) market risk amend- ment requires banks to estimate, separately, the default and migration risk of their trading portfolios that are exposed to credit risk. The new regulation requires the total regulatory charges for trading books to be computed as {{the sum of the}} market risk capi- tal and the {{incremental risk}} charge for credit risk. In contrast to Basel II models for the banking book no model is prescribed and banks can use internal models for calculating the incremental risk charge. In the calculation of incremental risk charges a key compo- nent is the choice of the <b>liquidity</b> <b>horizon</b> for traded credits. In this paper we explore the e¤ect of the <b>liquidity</b> <b>horizon</b> on the incremental risk charge. Speci�cally we consider a sample of 28 bonds with di¤erent rating and liquidity horizons to evaluate the impact of the choice of the <b>liquidity</b> <b>horizon</b> for a certain rating class of credits. We �find that choosing the <b>liquidity</b> <b>horizon</b> for a particular credit there are two important effects that needs to be considered. Firstly, for bonds with short liquidity horizons there is a miti- gation effect of preventing the bond from further downgrades by trading it frequently. Secondly, there is the possibility of multiple defaults. Of these two effects the multiple default effect will generally be more pronounced for non investment grade credits as the probability of default is severe even for short liquidity periods. For medium investment grade credits these two effects will in general o¤set and the incremental risk charge will be approximately the same across liquidity horizons. For high quality investment grade credits the effect of the multiple defaults is low for short liquidity horizons as the frequent trading effectively prevents severe downgrades. ...|$|E
40|$|Asset market {{liquidity}} risk {{is a significant}} and perplexing subject and though the term {{market liquidity}} risk is used quite chronically in academic literature it lacks an unambiguous definition, let alone understanding of the proposed risk measures. To this end, this paper presents a review of contemporary thoughts and attempts vis-à-vis asset market/liquidity risk management. Furthermore, this research focuses on the theoretical aspects of asset liquidity risk and presents critically two reciprocal approaches to measuring market liquidity risk for individual trading securities, and discusses the problems that arise in attempting to quantify asset market liquidity risk at a portfolio level. This paper extends research literature related to the assessment of asset market/liquidity risk by providing a generalized theoretical modeling underpinning that handle, from the same perspective, market and liquidity risks jointly and integrate both risks into a portfolio setting without a commensurate increase of statistical postulations. As such, we argue that market and liquidity risk components are correlated in most cases and can be integrated into one single market/liquidity framework that consists of two interrelated sub-components. The first component is attributed {{to the impact of}} adverse price movements, while the second component focuses on the risk of variation in transactions costs due to bid-ask spreads and it attempts to measure the likelihood that it will cost more than expected to liquidate the asset position. We thereafter propose a concrete theoretical foundation and a new modeling framework that attempts to tackle the issue of market/liquidity risk at a portfolio level by combining two asset market/liquidity risk models. The first model is a re-engineered and robust <b>liquidity</b> <b>horizon</b> multiplier that can aid in producing realistic asset market liquidity losses during the unwinding period. The essence of the model is based on the concept of Liquidity-Adjusted Value-at-Risk (L-VaR) framework, and particularly from the perspective of trading portfolios that have both long and short trading positions. Conversely, the second model is related to the transactions cost of liquidation due to bid-ask spreads and includes an improved technique that tackles the issue of bid-ask spread volatility. As such, the model comprises a new approach to contemplating the impact of time-varying volatility of the bid-ask spread and its upshot on the overall asset market/liquidity risk. ...|$|E
5000|$|According to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's July 2015 {{consultation}} document regarding CVA calculations, if CVA is calculated using 100 timesteps with 10,000 scenarios per timestep, 1 million simulations {{are required to}} compute the value of CVA. Calculating CVA risk would require 250 daily market risk scenarios over the 12-month stress period. CVA has to be calculated for each market risk scenario, resulting in 250 million simulations. These calculations have to be repeated across 6 risk types and 5 <b>liquidity</b> <b>horizons,</b> resulting in potentially 8.75 billion simulations.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIncrease {{of credit}} {{derivative}} transaction volumes and credit related exposures in trading books, contingent {{effect of the}} recent financial crisis along with insufficient measure of so called Value At Risk calculations raised new methodologies for credit risk models as well as input parameters such as transition probability matrices. Conditional transition probability matrices {{are one of the}} main inputs of the credit risk models and it is required to estimate for short <b>liquidity</b> <b>horizons.</b> This study presents conditional transition probability matrices for sovereigns using factor modeling approaches under various symmetric and asymmetric distribution assumptions. Asymmetric models are found to provide superior results over the symmetric models for both in sample and out of sample results. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is applicable for quarterly sovereign transitions where rating movements are not observed frequently. Finally the model incorporates the dependence of the business cycles to the estimated credit cycle indices using main macroeconomic factors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In 2009 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision {{released}} the final guidelines for computing capital for the Incremental Risk Charge, {{which is a}} complement to the traditional Value at Risk intended to measure the migration risk and the default risk in the trading book. Before Basel III banks will have {{to develop their own}} Incremental Risk Charge model following these guidelines. The development of such a model that computes the capital charge for a portfolio of corporate bonds is described in this thesis. Essential input parameters like the credit ratings of the underlying issuers, credit spreads, recovery rates at default, <b>liquidity</b> <b>horizons</b> and correlations among the positions in the portfolio will be discussed. Also required in the model is the transition matrix with probabilities of migrating between different credit states, which is measured by historical data from Moody´s rating institute. Several sensitivity analyses and stress tests are then made by generating different scenarios and running them in the model and the results of these tests are compared to a base case. As it turns out, the default risk contributes for the most part of the Incremental Risk Charge...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{the concept}} of capital market is {{analysed}} using Fractal Market Hypothesis which is a modern, complex and unconventional alternative to classical finance methods. Fractal Market Hypothesis is in sharp opposition to Efficient Market Hypothesis and it explores the application of chaos theory and fractal geometry to finance. Fractal Market Hypothesis is based on certain assumption. Thus, it is emphasized that investors did not react immediately to the information they receive and of course, {{the manner in which}} they interpret that information may be different. Also, Fractal Market Hypothesis refers to the way that <b>liquidity</b> and investment <b>horizons</b> influence the behaviour of financial investors...|$|R
40|$|Studying Foreign {{flows and}} the {{liquidity}} of six Asian markets we {{provide evidence of}} two empirical regularities: On the one hand, foreign trade has a negative but transitory impact on the overall liquidity of the market on a daily basis. This finding is shown consistent with two hypotheses: that foreign investors demand liquidity more aggressively than locals, and, to a lesser extent, that foreigners incorporate market-wide information. On the other hand, the overall share of foreign ownership in the market is positively related to improved liquidity, as shown {{in a sample of}} emerging markets, after controlling for a set of confounding factors. Overall, the results portray foreign investors as aggressive liquidity demanding, and nevertheless having a positive effect on the <b>liquidity</b> in short <b>horizon...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we analyse whether the Ricardian {{equivalence}} hypothesis is a valid approximation for Spain’s economic reality or whether there exist deviations from that situation which would be {{more in line with}} the conventional Keynesian perspective of the effects of debt on private consumption-savings decisions. Our aim is to contribute to the rather sparse empirical literature on the subject for the Spanish case. The analysis is based on annual aggregate data for Spain covering the years 1955 to 2000, and uses both the structural and the Euler equation approaches to test the neutrality proposition, and is thus to be considered as a generalization of foregoing work on the Spanish economy. The findings indicate that support for Ricardian equivalence is mixed, while we also find very little support for the Keynesian specification of consumption and fiscal policy.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} there is a natural {{trade-off}} when designing market based executive compensation. The benefit of market based pay is that the stock price aggregates speculators 2 ̆ 019 dispersed information and there-fore takes a picture of managerial performance before the long-term value of a firm materializes. The cost is that informed speculators 2 ̆ 019 willingness to trade depends on trading that is unrelated to any information about the firm. Ideally, the CEO should be shielded from shocks that are not informative about his actions. But since information trading is impossible without non- nformation trading (due to the 2 ̆ 01 dno-trade 2 ̆ 01 d theorem), shocks to prices caused by the latter are an unavoidable cost of market based pay. This trade-off generates a number of insights about the impact of market conditions, e. g. <b>liquidity</b> and trading <b>horizons,</b> on optimal market based pay. A more liquid market leads to more market based pay while short-term trading makes it more costly to provide such incentives leading to lower CEO effort and worse firm performance on average. The model is consistent with recent evidence showing that market based CEO incentives vary with market conditions, e. g. bid-ask spreads, the probability of informed trading (PIN) or the dispersion of analysts 2 ̆ 019 forecasts...|$|R
40|$|The prior {{literature}} {{finds that}} stock splits worsen liquidity, {{as measured by}} percent effective spread, over a short horizon (60 to 180 days) after the split. We innovate by examining a long-horizon window after the split and by using new proxies for percent spread constructed from daily data. This allows us to track the liquidity of thousands of stock splits taking place from 1963 through 2003. We find that both the percent spread of NASDAQ split firms and the spread proxies of NYSE/AMEX split firms temporarily increase, but return to even with the control firms in 5 to 12 months. This provides a missing link supporting the signaling theory of splits. We also find that split firms are experiencing gains in <b>liquidity</b> at loner <b>horizons.</b> The percent spread of NASDAQ split firms becomes significantly {{lower than that of}} the control firms in 12 to 39 months. The spreads for NYSE/AMEX split firms become lower than the spreads for the control firms in 12 to 24 months. The NYSE/AMEX results are robust to three different liquidity proxies. This suggests a net benefit of splitting, which provides a missing link supporting both the trading range theory and the optimal tick size theory. All three theories could be true {{at the same time and}} our findings provide new evidence supporting all three theories...|$|R
