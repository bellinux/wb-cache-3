[...] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.|$|E

While Westmore estimated that a fully staffed production would have around 50 makeup artists, First Contact had to make do with fewer than ten people involved in preparation, and at most 20 artists a day. Despite the long hours, Westmore's teams began to be more creative with the prosthetics even as they decreased their preparation times. [...] "They were using two tubes, and then they were using three tubes, and then they were sticking tubes in the ears and up the nose," [...] Westmore explained. [...] "And we were using a very gooey caramel coloring, maybe using a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but by the time we got to the end of the movie we had the stuff dripping down the side of [...] faces—it looked like they were leaking oil! So, at the very end , they're more ferocious." ...|$|E

[...] "I just wrote that song then and handed it {{over to her and}} sung a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> just to show her the melody, and it fit like a gown."

5000|$|Paquette has {{discussed}} two avenues {{that led to}} the development of his story. The first was that of an old European legend, circa 15th century, of religious sects scooping up individuals to be cared for by the group for a year before being killed. The second is closer to Paquette’s past. “I came to film school, Concordia University’s Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema, to do my Bachelor’s and while I was there I got to know the director of the program. He was this old Polish guy, single, very kind of gruff,” Paquette says. “I loved him to death. He was the smartest film guy I ever had and I didn’t know a lot of people in Montreal so I took to hanging out with him. He wouldn’t really open up to a lot about his past but you’d get <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and you start to piece it together. He’d given up a lot in Poland to come here.” ...|$|R

There's first a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> left nearly wild, not quite wild; there's a cart and rider's track through it among the copse; and then, standing simply on the wild moss-troopers' ground, the scattered ruins of a great abbey, seen so dimly, that they seem to be fading out of sight, in color as in time.|$|E

Of course, there has been a terrible lot of exaggeration, and heaps of fellows go gassing about secret service jobs, {{all the way up the}} coast from here to Scotland, who haven't the least idea what the thing means. But there is a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> done, and in my humble way they find me an {{occasional}} job or two down here.

60|$|She {{admired the}} car, she admired the colour {{of the car}}, she admired the lamps {{of the car and}} the door of the car and the little {{fittings}} of the car. She admired the horn. She admired the twist of the horn. She admired Clarence and the uniform of Clarence and she admired and coveted the great fur coat that he held ready for his employer. (But if she had it, she said, she would wear the splendid fur outside to show every <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.)</b> And when the car at last moved forward and tooted--she admired the note--and vanished softly and swiftly through the gates, she was left in the porch with Mr. Brumley still by sheer inertia admiring and envying. She admired Sir Isaac's car number Z 900. (Such an easy one to remember!) Then she stopped abruptly, as one might discover that the water in the bathroom was running to waste and turn it off.|$|E
60|$|When that divine {{took his}} leave, {{not a little}} discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women, Laura {{repeated}} her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to Helen, who {{felt that there was}} a great deal of cogency in most of the latter. There must be some jealousy against Pen. She felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners, who had taken a mean revenge of him--nothing more likely. Altogether, the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed. Pen, who was plunged in his shame and grief in London, and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother's sorrow, would have wondered, had he seen how easily she bore the calamity. Indeed, calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again: and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust, depend upon it that she won't repine, and only take a very <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> for herself, provided you will eat the remainder in her company.|$|E
5000|$|Although some techno futurists still disparage the {{gorgeous}} Play, it qualified as a futurist work simply by redefining {{the concept of}} [...] "commercial." [...] Clubs would never take a CD mega, and no way could these anonymously sung tracks crack any hit-based radio format. So Moby's handlers swamped the mass market through the side door, placing swatches of all 18 songs (most many times) on movie and TV soundtracks and in ads {{for the likes of}} Volkswagen, Baileys Irish Cream and American Express. FM exposure followed. But the main reason this album will sound familiar the way Beethoven's Ninth does to a classical ignoramus is that <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> have seeped into most Americans' brains. For this be grateful, because those bits are intensely pleasurable as melody or texture or sometimes beat, and because Moby has ordered, paced, and segued them and their intimate surroundings into something that suggests a surging and receding whole. A Treacherous Three rap powers [...] "Bodyrock," [...] but most of the identifiable sources are little-known blues and gospel singers first archived by folklorist Alan Lomax. Folk purists might will claim this re-use cheapens them. But here's betting musical folk like the singers themselves are plenty proud somewhere.|$|R

See, too, that she lacks for nothing which we can give her who is our guest. Let the white lord, Mauriti, accompany her to the hut and be shown that next to it in which he and Macumazahn will sleep, so that he may be sure that she is safe, and attend to the horses if he wills.

Moral courage is in self-respect and the sense of duty; physical courage is a matter of health or organization. Are these predispositions likely to fail in a community of instructed freemen?

6000|$|... § VII. Such as they are, or were, these {{cornices}} {{were soon}} considered essential {{parts of the}} [...] "order" [...] to which they belonged; and the same wisdom which endeavored to fix the proportions of the orders, appointed also that no order should go without its cornice. The reader has probably heard of the architectural division of superstructure into architrave, frieze, and cornice; parts which have been appointed by great architects to all their work, in the same spirit in which great rhetoricians have ordained that every speech shall have an exordium, and narration, and peroration. The reader will do well to consider {{that it may be}} sometimes just as possible to carry a roof, and get rid of rain, without such an arrangement, as it is to tell a plain fact without an exordium or peroration; but he must very absolutely consider that the architectural peroration or cornice is strictly and sternly limited {{to the end of the}} wall's speech,--that is, to the edge of the roof; and that it has nothing whatever to do with shafts nor the orders of them. And he will then be able fully to enjoy the farther ordinance of the late Roman and Renaissance architects, who, attaching it to the shaft as if it were part of its shadow, and having to employ their shafts often in places where they came not near the roof, forthwith cut the roof-cornice to pieces and attached a bit of it to every column; thenceforward to be carried by the unhappy shaft wherever it went, in addition to any other work on which it might happen to be employed. I do not recollect among any living beings, except Renaissance architects, any instance of a parallel or comparable stupidity: but one can imagine a savage getting hold of a piece of one of our iron wire ropes, with its rings upon it at intervals to bind it together, and pulling the wires asunder to apply them to separate purposes; but imagining there was magic in the ring that bound them, and so cutting that to pieces also, and fastening a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to every wire.|$|E
