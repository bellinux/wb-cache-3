40|$|In a standpipe/wet riser system, landing valves are the {{terminating}} fixed {{components to}} which firefighters connect flexible hoses and nozzles. Traditionally, landing valves are simple isolating valves, but pressure-reducing valves are now available. A <b>landing</b> <b>valve</b> with an integrated fixed-ratio pressure-reducing devices {{has been used}} in Hong Kong. This Note examines the water pressure available at the landing valves in a proposed standpipe/wet riser installation in an example tall residential building in Hong Kong, under various operating conditions. Improvements to the relevant Hong Kong code of practice are recommended. The Note further details the locations in a building where pressure-reducing landing valves have been used inappropriately, and indicates issues to be addressed in their application. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{affirms the}} prime {{importance}} of automatic sprinklers in tall {{buildings and the}} importance of ensuring operating sprinklers / fire hydrants / <b>landing</b> <b>valves</b> in the farthest building corners can be provided with undisturbed water supply of sufficient flow / pressure. In the worst scenario, all fixed fire pumps inside the building may fail to operate, and the smaller header tank at roof can run out of water. This issue has not been resolved worldwide in normal fires as well as those caused by terrorist and arsonist attack. (6) Portable pumps will be delivered to refuge floors for relaying water into building’s fire fighting systems. It is proposed to install mains for compressed air and water to supply portable / fixed impulse fire extinguishing devices, to supplement the ordinary fire fighting systems and enable the most effective choice when water shortage becomes critical. These can greatly enhance fire safety of the tallest buildings against attacks from terrorist / arsonist...|$|R
50|$|At 7:09, the airship made a sharp full-speed {{left turn}} to the west around the landing field because the ground crew was not ready. At 7:11, it {{turned back toward the}} <b>landing</b> field and <b>valved</b> gas. All engines idled ahead and the airship began to slow. Captain Pruss ordered aft engines full astern at 7:14 while at an {{altitude}} of 394 ft, to try to brake the airship.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a large diameter high pressure quick acting propulsion valve and valve actuator is described. The valve {{is the heart of}} a major test facility dedicated to conducting full scale performance tests of aircraft <b>landing</b> systems. The <b>valve</b> opens in less than 300 milliseconds releasing a 46 -centimeter- (18 -in. -) diameter water jet and closes in 300 milliseconds. The four main components of the valve, i. e., valve body, safety shutter, high speed shutter, and pneumatic-hydraulic actuator, are discussed. This valve is unique and may have other aerospace and industrial applications...|$|R
50|$|Design {{engineers}} {{have found the}} combination of electroless nickel’s functional properties to be very appealing for aerospace use. Due to the obvious reliability issues associated with this market segment, a long term, thorough evaluation of electroless nickel has been on going and had made for slow progress. Successful testing and application {{for a number of}} years resulted in a better understanding of when and how to specify electroless nickel. It is widely used in engine assemblies, servo <b>valves,</b> <b>landing</b> gear, turbine blades and the like. Unlike hard chrome, compressive stressed high phosphorus deposits do not significantly reduce the fatigue strength of these critical components. For this reason and reasons stated above, its continued application appears secure.|$|R
30|$|The {{designed}} rainwater harvesting reservoir had {{a storage}} capacity of 7548  m 3, catchment area of 8  ha, command area of 2  ha, and water area of 5445  m 2. The reservoir occupied 6.8  % {{of the total}} catchment. The reservoir was not lined because the S&P loss (3  mm/day) was low. Lining is recommended where S&P loss is more than 10  mm/day (Srivastava et al. 2004). As water was stored at upstream of the valley, the potential energy of reservoir water {{was enough to make}} gravity flow irrigation to the lower valley <b>land.</b> A gate <b>valve</b> was used to regulate water flow to the downstream channel, which involved no energy cost. However, a suction mode pump was used to deliver the reservoir water at hilltop and hillslope land.|$|R
50|$|Another benefit was {{initially}} unexpected. Braking effect is greatly reduced at high speeds; {{the coefficient of}} friction between a tyre and concrete is about 0.7 to 1.0 at 30 mph, but decreases dramatically to 0.3 to 0.5 at 120 mph. This means that {{it is much easier}} to skid when first landing, a fact that led pilots to hold off on the brakes until the aircraft was firmly down, and then slowly increase pressure to avoid skids. With Maxaret, they simply applied full braking as soon as they touched down, knowing that the system would prevent skids. As a result, braking distances even in perfect conditions were greatly improved, on the order of 30%. A later modification allowed the brakes to be applied before <b>landing,</b> with the <b>valve</b> only applying the brakes when the wheel spun up at least once.|$|R
40|$|Application of {{solenoid valve}} {{actuators}} in internal combustion engines can facilitate operations such as {{variable valve timing}} for improved efficiency and emission. Unfortunately, smooth solenoid <b>valve</b> <b>landing</b> is hard to achieve due to limited control authority, limited bandwidth, and time varying disturbances. The resultant valve impact causes unacceptable noise and component wear on the engine. To solve this ``soft seating" problem, the controller is further divided into approach and landing sub-controllers. The landing controller causes the valve to follow a smooth trajectory for a low-impact landing in the last portion of the valve flight. Before armature landing starts, the approach controller complements the landing control by setting a consistent initial condition for the landing trajectory. This thesis focuses on developing a cycle-adaptive approach controller that utilizes information from the repetitive operations of the engine valve. Additionally, a novel way of using induced voltages to identify disturbance pressure magnitudes is introduced...|$|R
40|$|A key {{component}} of switch-mode hydraulic circuits is a high-speed two-position three-way valve with a variable duty cycle. This paper presents a new valve architecture that consists of two valve spools that are axially driven by crank-slider mechanisms. By phase shifting the two crank links, which are on a common crankshaft, the duty cycle of the valve is adjusted. The two spools split and re-combine flow such that two switching cycles occur per revolution of the crankshaft. Because the spools move in a near-sinusoidal trajectory, the peak spool velocities are achieved at mid-stroke where the <b>valve</b> <b>land</b> transitions across the ports, resulting in short valve transition times. The spool velocity is lower during {{the remainder of the}} cycle, reducing viscous friction losses. A dynamic model is constructed of this new valve operating at 120 Hz switching frequency in a switch-mode circuit. The model is used to illustrate design trade-offs and minimize energy losses in the valve. The resulting design solution transitions to the on-state in 5 % of the switching period and the combined leakage and viscous friction in the valve dissipate 1. 7 % of the total power at a pressure of 34. 5 MPa and volumetric flow rate of 22. 8 L/min...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2014. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisors: Perry Li, Thomas Chase. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 182 pages. The research {{described in this}} dissertation focuses {{on the development of}} innovative on/off valves for high performance, high efficiency control of fixed displacement hydraulic pumps and motors. On/off valves, the hydro-mechanical equivalent of transistors, enable the application of digital control techniques found in electrical systems to hydraulics. These techniques, such as pulse-width-modulation (PWM), have the potential of combining the low cost, high bandwidth characteristics of valve control with the efficiency of variable displacement machines. Effective control of hydraulic systems using PWM requires that the on/off valve simultaneously exhibits fast switching speed, large flow area, and low actuation power. The valves developed in this dissertation exploit continuous rotary motion to achieve the desired, and traditionally competing, operating characteristics. A helical land is used to mechanically embed the desired PWM functionality into the valve spool. The rotary motion of the valve performs the switching functionality while its axial motion determines the PWM duty ratio. Several unique rotary valve concepts are presented in this dissertation for switched-mode pump and pump/motor circuits. An analysis framework is developed that predicts valve performance and typical losses which can be used for design and optimization. Physics based dynamic models of switched-mode pump and motor circuits are also developed for simulating system pressures and flow rates and for validating the analytical models. In addition, guidelines for sizing the valve sleeve based on fatigue considerations are formulated to aid prototype design. Prototype hardware is fabricated and extensively tested to validate the analysis, performance, and predicted efficiency of the proposed valves. The research in this dissertation verifies that helical <b>land</b> rotary <b>valves</b> used in switched-mode hydraulic circuits are capable of exceeding the efficiency of comparable metering valve circuits at moderate PWM frequencies. In two comparable systems, the switched-mode circuit achieved 84 % efficiency at 50 % output flow compared to 50 % efficiency in the bleed off circuit. Analysis also shows that substantial gains in efficiency and switching frequency can be attained with improvements in valve configuration, circuit configuration, and valve geometry. Additional suggestions for further improving efficiency in switched-mode hydraulic systems are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{traditional}} {{internal combustion}} engines, a camshaft acts on the valve stems {{to open and}} close the valves. Valve timing is fixed relative to piston position. On the other hand, if a valve is flexibly controlled by a variable valve actuation (VVA) system, we can achieve significant improvements in fuel efficiency, engine performance, and emissions. One of the most advanced variable valve actuation systems is the VVA operated by an electromechanical actuator without a camshaft, the so-called bi-positional electromechanical valve drive (EMVD). Existing EMVDs characteristically use a spring to provide the required mechanical power for operating a valve. The use of a spring provides many benefits {{to the design of}} the system, but it also results in difficult design challenges. The large holding force against the spring at the ends of the stroke suggests the use of a normal-force electromagnetic actuator, which, from a servomechanical point of view, is considerably inferior to a shear-force actuator. Furthermore, the large holding force generates a large jerk at {{the beginning and the end}} of a stroke and makes it difficult to achieve soft <b>valve</b> <b>landing.</b> An innovative electromechanical valve drive (EMVD) design is proposed, which incorporates a nonlinear mechanical transformer and a shear-force actuator. This allows not only fast but also smooth valve motion, almost zero seating velocity, zero holding power, and improved control with acceptable electric power. This proposed concept is modeled, analyzed, simulated, designed, and implemented. Experimental results show the beneficial features of the promising proposed concept. by Woo Sok Chang. Thesis (Ph.
