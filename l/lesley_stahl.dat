[...] Upon hearing Speakes' remark, Haig scribbled out a note which was passed to Speakes, ordering {{him to leave the}} dais immediately.

500|$|But {{there was}} also {{speculation}} over how long Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration. Not long after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, at a reception for mayors, Reagan greeted his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce in 1981 by saying [...] "How are you, Mr Mayor? How are things in your city?" [...] Former CBS White House correspondent <b>Lesley</b> <b>Stahl</b> recounted that, in her final {{meeting with the president}} in 1986, Reagan did not seem to know who Stahl was, and that she came close to reporting that Reagan was senile, {{but at the end of}} the meeting, Reagan had regained his alertness. However, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, a physician employed as a reporter for The New York Times, noted that [...] "the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy," [...] and all four of Reagan's White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer's while he was president. Dr. John E. Hutton, Reagan's primary physician from 1984 to 1989, said the president [...] "absolutely" [...] did not [...] "show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer's." [...] His former Chief of Staff James Baker considered [...] "ludicrous" [...] the idea that Reagan slept during cabinet meetings. Other staff members, former aides, and friends said they saw no indication of Alzheimer's while he was president. Reagan did experience occasional memory lapses, though, especially with names. Reagan's doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992 or 1993, several years after he had left office. For example, Reagan repeated a toast to Margaret Thatcher, with identical words and gestures, at his 82nd-birthday party on February 6, 1993.|$|E

The episode was [...] "ripped from the headlines" [...] of the Garson matter. Correspondent <b>Lesley</b> <b>Stahl</b> reported the Garson story for CBS’s 48 Hours on February 18, 2005. In addition, Frieda Hanimov was compared to whistle-blower Erin Brockovich, and Warner Brothers purchased the rights to a movie entitled The Frieda Hanimov Story.|$|E
2500|$|Imus's {{behavior}} has often drawn {{the attention of}} the press. He famously called Rush Limbaugh [...] "a fat, pill-popping loser" [...] and a [...] "drug-addled gas bag", Gwen Ifill a [...] "cleaning lady" [...] and <b>Lesley</b> <b>Stahl</b> a [...] "gutless, lying weasel." [...] His comedic exchange of quips ("fat pig") regarding his show's former news reader, Contessa Brewer, made news, as did Brewer's response ("cantankerous old fool"). When Tucker Carlson brought up Brewer on the program in 2005, Imus hung up on him, calling him [...] "a bowtie-wearing little pussy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schorr [...] "remained {{silent in}} the face of false suspicions that another CBS correspondent, <b>Lesley</b> <b>Stahl,</b> had given the (Pike) report to The Voice". Roger Mudd stated in his {{autobiography}} that Schorr personally spread rumours that Stahl had leaked the paper, while Stahl in her autobiography stated that she was [...] "flabbergasted" [...] at the accusation from Schorr and the resulting furor within CBS as the executives were [...] "deciding what to do" [...] with her over the serious journalistic breach she was accused of, while Nora Ephron reports that Stahl considered a slander suit against Schorr. Schorr later donated his profits from the sale of the Pike papers to the Reporters' Committee on the Freedom of the Press.|$|E
2500|$|Brodhead, in an {{interview}} with <b>Lesley</b> <b>Stahl</b> of 60 Minutes, stated that [...] "Duke has a rule and many, many, many other universities observe the same rule, which is that when a student is indicted for a crime that has an element of violence, we often separate the student from the university because you don't know at that time what harm [...] might be done either in the community or to the student. It isn’t a judgment of guilt. It isn't a disciplinary measure. And what we've done is to use the interim to try {{to understand the nature of}} the case better. Weighing a lot of things [...] the presumption of innocence, the nature of the charges, the need of the students to get on with their life. Once the facts took the turn they did in December, then we had to rebalance those things. Then at that point it just seemed to us that simple fairness meant that we had to allow the students to come back." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, five unnamed {{civilian}} {{contractors and}} the widows of contractors Walter Kasza and Robert Frost sued the USAF and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Their suit, {{in which they}} were represented by George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, alleged they had been present when large quantities of unknown chemicals had been burned in open pits and trenches at Groom. Biopsies taken from the complainants were analyzed by Rutgers University biochemists, who found high levels of dioxin, dibenzofuran, and trichloroethylene in their body fat. The complainants alleged they had sustained skin, liver, and respiratory injuries due to their work at Groom, and that this had contributed to the deaths of Frost and Kasza. The suit sought compensation for the injuries they had sustained, claiming the USAF had illegally handled toxic materials, and that the EPA had failed in its duty to enforce the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (which governs handling of dangerous materials). They also sought detailed information about the chemicals to which they were allegedly exposed, hoping this would facilitate the medical treatment of survivors. Congressman Lee H. Hamilton, former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told 60 Minutes reporter <b>Lesley</b> <b>Stahl,</b> [...] "The Air Force is classifying all information about Area 51 in order to protect themselves from a lawsuit." ...|$|E
2500|$|ABC Evening News began airing in 1953, {{hosted by}} John Charles Daly. [...] Daly {{had been a}} {{well-known}} CBS radio correspondent, though today he is best remembered as the emcee of CBS's long-running game show, What's My Line?, which he hosted while serving as ABC's anchorman. [...] Daly left ABC in 1960 and was succeeded by a frequently expanding list of successors that included John Cameron Swayze, Bill Laurence, Bill Sheehan, Ron [...] Cochran, a young Peter Jennings, and Bob Young. [...] In 1968, Frank Reynolds became anchor of the program, and it soon expanded from 15 minutes to 30 minutes. [...] A year later, Howard K. Smith joined as co-anchor, reporting from Washington. [...] In early 1971, Harry Reasoner left CBS News and replaced Reynolds as the New York anchor. [...] Reasoner became the sole anchor in 1975, and Smith provided commentaries. [...] In 1976, Barbara Walters joined the program as Reasoner's co-anchor in New York, thus becoming {{the first woman to}} serve as a regular network news anchor. (Marlene Sanders had previously served as an occasional substitute anchor). Other women who would occasionally appear in daytime and weekend anchor roles in earlier days were Pauline Frederick of ABC and NBC and Nancy Dickerson of NBC. From the early 1970s forward, females such as <b>Lesley</b> <b>Stahl</b> of CBS, Carole Simpson of ABC and Jessica Savitch of NBC began to appear in significant on-camera newscasting roles. [...] Reasoner was very unhappy with the addition of Walters, and the two did not work well together. [...] In 1978, a year after Roone Arledge became President of ABC News, the ABC Evening News was [...] succeeded by ABC World News Tonight with a trio of anchors: Frank Reynolds, Peter Jennings and Max Robinson. Jennings assumed solo anchor responsibility in 1983 following Reynolds's death.|$|E
