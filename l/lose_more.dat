5|$|Eight of {{the eleven}} member Big Ten {{institutions}} will return at least 75 percent of their offensive production during the 2009–10 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, unless underclassmen declare for the 2009 NBA Draft. Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio State will return 90 percent of their total offensive production. The Buckeyes could return 100 percent of their scoring contingent next season. All five first-team All-Conference honorees were sophomores and are all projected to return as juniors. Overall, the Big Ten could return 80.5 percent of its offensive production from 2008 to 2009, and no team should <b>lose</b> <b>more</b> than half of its total scoring unit next year.|$|E
5|$|For a {{short time}} during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds {{temporarily}} changed his demeanor {{at the behest of}} a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, {{in the midst of a}} slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team <b>lose</b> <b>more.</b> In spite of his protest that they would not appreciate the results, his teammates insisted, and Bonds complied, maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{may reduce}} host life {{expectancy}} if the infestation is heavy, but most {{seem to have}} little effect on their host. The habit of dust bathing in domestic hens is probably {{an attempt by the}} birds to rid themselves of lice. Lice may transmit microbial diseases and helminth parasites, but most individuals spend their whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to transfer to a new host opportunistically. Ischnoceran lice may reduce the thermoregulation effect of the plumage; thus heavily infested birds <b>lose</b> <b>more</b> heat than others.|$|E

5|$|Quimby {{accepted}} each Academy Award for Tom and Jerry's without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage. The cartoons {{were also}} released with Quimby {{listed as the}} sole producer, following the same practice {{for which he had}} condemned Ising. When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division. As the studio began to <b>lose</b> <b>more</b> revenue due to television, MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call. Hanna and Barbera found the no-notice closing puzzling because Tom and Jerry had been so successful.|$|E
5|$|In late 1959, James Lawson {{and other}} members of the NCLC's {{projects}} committee met with department store owners Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch counters. Both men declined, saying that they would <b>lose</b> <b>more</b> business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small groups of students purchased items at the stores and then sat at their lunch counters and attempted to order food. Their goal was to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch counters, the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were low-key and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them.|$|E
5|$|On 31 January, {{an attempt}} was made to free Missouri with the {{assembled}} collection of tug boats and salvage ships. This attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, owing to an anchor from a previous wreck that had become embedded in Missouris hull. The extreme force generated by the tugs caused several two-inch cables made from wire rope to break, and the failed attempt also revealed that Missouri needed to <b>lose</b> <b>more</b> weight if the next attempt was to be successful. In light of this, some additional changes were made for the next attempt, which included cutting the anchors and chains off the battleship—after they had been re-added at Wallin's request—and the inclusion of additional pontoons to help lighten Missouri even more. A second attempt was tentatively scheduled for 1 February.|$|E

25|$|But in 1935, Pathé went bankrupt. In {{order to}} finance the company's {{continued}} expansion, Pathé's board of directors (which still included Charles Pathé) voted in 1930 to issue shares worth 105 million francs. But with the depression deepening, only 50 percent of the shares were purchased. One of the investor banks collapsed due to financial difficulties unrelated to Pathé's problems, and Pathé was forced {{to follow through with}} the purchase of several movie theater chains it no longer could afford to buy. Although the company continued to make a profit (as noted above) for a time, it soon began to <b>lose</b> <b>more</b> money than it could bring it.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} early attacks by Quntana and Alberto Contador on stage 15 to Aramon Formigal blew the race apart, causing Froome to be {{isolated}} from his teammates and to <b>lose</b> <b>more</b> than 2 {{and a half minutes}} on his rival. He gained most of that time back on the stage 19 time trial to Calp with a dominant performance, but was unable {{to make up the difference}} in the penultimate stage, finishing second overall in the end by just 1:23 behind Quintana.

Shortly after Germany uses the first superbomb in warfare against Petrograd, the only Confederate superbomb is set off in Philadelphia, by General Potter. However, the bomb detonates on the outskirts of the city west of the Schuylkill River and doesn't affect any US Government buildings.|$|E

25|$|Despite never {{recovering}} {{the ground}} it lost from its CBS days, even sliding into the lowest {{third in the}} ratings by 1977, ratings for The Edge of Night improved slightly during the early 1980s, thanks {{in no small part}} to the overall rise of ABC's soap opera lineup and to the fresh new characters such as Steve, Draper, Logan, Deborah, April, Raven, and Damian. While the numbers were less solid, The Edge of Night still pulled in ratings in the 5.0 range and improved its position on the ratings list, peaking at 11th in both 1981 and 1982. However, from 1982 on, ratings fell as even more ABC affiliates dropped the show in favor of the aforementioned syndicated offerings: At the end of the 1981-82 television season, The Edge of Night pulled in a 5.0 rating, but with the resulting pre-emptions, the show's rating dropped to a 3.8 in 1983. This caused Procter and Gamble to <b>lose</b> <b>more</b> money on the program with each passing year.|$|E
25|$|Snails usually prefer juicy {{leaves and}} {{vegetables}} over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed {{as it will}} quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% wheat bran while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use oats, corn meal, soybean meal, or chicken mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed oyster shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their body weight. Active snails deprived of food will <b>lose</b> <b>more</b> than one-third of their weight before they starve to death—a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.|$|E
25|$|After {{enduring}} {{a difficult}} {{start to the}} 2016/2017 season where he failed to get beyond {{the second round of}} the first eight ranking events, Fu came back from 5–2 down to defeat Jamie Jones in the quarter-finals of the UK Championship. At 5–4 up on Ronnie O'Sullivan in the semis, Fu got a huge kick on a red when in the balls and also missed a green with the rest later on as O'Sullivan levelled and then made a 130 break in the deciding frame to win. Before the end of 2016, Fu reached the final of the Scottish Open, with his closest game being a 4–3 victory over Neil Robertson in the fourth round as Fu did not <b>lose</b> <b>more</b> than a frame in his other five matches. In the final John Higgins opened the match with three centuries, before Fu added one of his own. He came from 4–1 down by winning eight frames in a row to land his third ranking tournament title. Throughout the tournament, Fu made 11 centuries and 21 more breaks over 50 in seven matches.|$|E

25|$|Those aboard Collapsible B {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} night. The boat gradually sank lower {{into the water}} as the air pocket underneath it leaked away. The sea began to get up towards dawn, causing the boat to rock in the swell and <b>lose</b> <b>more</b> of its precious air. Lightoller organised {{the men on the}} hull to stand in two parallel rows {{on either side of the}} centreline, facing the bow, and got them to sway in unison to counteract the rocking motion caused by the swell. They were directly exposed to the freezing seawater, first up to their feet, then to their ankles and finally to their knees as the boat subsided in the water. For some, the ordeal proved too much and one by one they collapsed, fell into the water and died. The victims possibly included John George Phillips, the first radio officer, and the third class passenger David Livshin, whose body was taken to the Carpathia on the following morning. About 30 people were left alive by the morning and were transferred into other lifeboats before being rescued by Carpathia.|$|E
25|$|The {{functional}} view on {{the evolution}} of feathers has traditionally focused on insulation, flight and display. Discoveries of non-flying Late Cretaceous feathered dinosaurs in China, however, suggest that flight could not have been the original primary function as the feathers simply would not have been capable of providing any form of lift. There have been suggestions that feathers may have had their original function in thermoregulation, waterproofing, or even as sinks for metabolic wastes such as sulphur. Recent discoveries are claimed to support a thermoregulatory function, at least in smaller dinosaurs. While feathers have been suggested as having evolved from reptilian scales, there are numerous objections to that idea, and more recent explanations have arisen from the paradigm of evolutionary developmental biology. Theories of the scale-based origins of feathers suggest that the planar scale structure was modified for development into feathers by splitting to form the webbing; however, that developmental process involves a tubular structure arising from a follicle and the tube splitting longitudinally to form the webbing. The number of feathers per unit area of skin is higher in smaller birds than in larger birds, and this trend points to their important role in thermal insulation, since smaller birds <b>lose</b> <b>more</b> heat due to the relatively larger surface area in proportion to their body weight. The miniaturization of birds also {{played a role in the}} evolution of powered flight. The coloration of feathers is believed to have evolved primarily in response to sexual selection. In one fossil specimen of the Parave Anchiornis huxleyi, the features are so well preserved that the melanosome (pigment cells) structure can be observed. By comparing the shape of the fossil melanosomes to melanosomes from extant birds, the color and pattern of the feathers on Anchiornis could be determined. Anchiornis was found to have black-and-white-patterned feathers on the forelimbs and hindlimbs, with a reddish-brown crest. This pattern is similar to the coloration of many extant bird species, which use plumage coloration for display and communication, including sexual selection and camouflage. It is likely that non-avian dinosaur species utilized plumage patterns for similar functions as modern birds before the origin of flight. In many cases, the physiological condition of the birds (especially males) is indicated by the quality of their feathers, and this is used (by the females) in mate choice.|$|E
