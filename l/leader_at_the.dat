5|$|Burton and Roosevelt had a {{complicated}} history. Burton, as a <b>leader</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1900 Republican National Convention, was perhaps instrumental in Roosevelt's securing his party's nomination. Roosevelt's last {{appointment to the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (whose jurisdiction, at the time, included appeals from Kansas) had been William Cather Hook, a choice favored by Burton's political opponents: Senator Chester I. Long (R-KS) and Governor Willis J. Bailey (R-KS). When the next vacancy opened on the Eighth Circuit, Burton and his allies favored the appointment of Charles Blood Smith. D.W. Mulvane was unsuccessful in pressing Smith's candidacy in a June 1903 meeting with Roosevelt.|$|E

5|$|Factionalism {{returned}} {{in full force}} as the Progressive Conservatives fell from power in 1963, and while Diefenbaker's performance as Opposition Leader was heralded, his second loss at the polls prompted opponents within the party force him to a leadership convention in 1967. Diefenbaker stood for re-election as party <b>leader</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last moment, but only attracted minimal support and withdrew. He remained an MP {{until his death in}} 1979, two months after Joe Clark became the first Tory Prime Minister since Diefenbaker.|$|E

5|$|After Høybråten {{announced}} that he would not seek reelection as party leader of KrF, Hareide quickly emerged as the leading candidate to succeed Høybråten, after the two other apparent candidates, Dagrun Eriksen and Hans Olav Syversen, announced they would not run. Hareide is considered to belong to the socially liberal wing of the party, and conservative members of the party have demanded {{that at least one of}} the deputy leaders be from the party's conservative wing if they are to support Hareide. Hareide supported the efforts to eliminate the rule which requires Christian Democratic party representatives to declare a Christian faith, and a vote gave a clear majority to abolish that rule two years later. Hareide was unanimously voted in as new party <b>leader</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2011 convention on 30 April 2011. Hareide declined the nomination as parliamentary leader, and Hans Olav Syversen was elected to this position.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1866, Sprigg was {{instrumental}} in organizing the Democratic Party of West Virginia, after which time he continued {{to serve as a}} <b>leader</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> party's state and regional conventions. He attended the Democratic Party's state convention held in Charleston in June 1870, where he represented the Tenth Senatorial District on the Committee on Resolutions. Sprigg was unanimously nominated as the party's candidate for Attorney General of West Virginia, initially without his knowledge. He commenced his campaign for attorney general at the state party's Tenth Senatorial District convention in Moorefield. Sprigg ran against incumbent Aquilla B.

While she originally stated she would step down as premier if she {{decided to run for}} the leadership after announcing her candidacy Dunderdale said she will only step down if someone challenges her for the leadership. On January 10, 2011, an hour before nominations were set to close in the leadership election Brad Cabana, a blogger and a former mayor in Saskatchewan, filed his nomination papers becoming Dunderdale's only challenger. The next day however the PC Party's credentials committee announced that Cabana was ineligible to enter the race because he was unable to collect the 50 signatures needed by PC party members to be nominated. Cabana appealed the party's decision but it was announced on January 27, 2011, that the rules committee upheld the previous ruling by the credentials committee.

5|$|For , Rindt's {{partner at}} Lotus was John Miles; Graham Hill {{had left the}} team to drive for Rob Walker's {{customer}} franchise. Rindt became the clear team <b>leader.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> first Grand Prix {{of the season in}} South Africa, he qualified fourth, but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with Chris Amon and Jack Brabham, the latter of whom went on to win for the final time in his career. At the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix, Lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design. Instead of one conventional front radiator, the Lotus 72 featured two, one {{on each side of the}} cockpit. Further innovations included torsion bar suspension in place of the widely used coil-springs, and all four brakes mounted inboard to reduce unsprung weight. During its first practice session, the left semi-axle of the car broke, sending Rindt into a spin. The car also proved ineffective in the race; Rindt retired after nine laps.|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti {{investigate}} the execution-style {{shooting death of}} a Chinese college student. A friend in his dormitory (Bai Ling) says the victim was a student <b>leader</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tiananmen Square protest and had been hunted ever since. The detectives go to Washington, D.C. {{to talk to the}} Chinese embassy about the murder, but they deny any knowledge of the incident. Secret Service agent Gruszynski (Ed Lauter) confronts Lewis and Crosetti and tells them not to waste the embassy's time, but agrees to give the detectives a tour of Washington before they go. Crosetti is excited to see the landmarks but Lewis, who believes the Secret Service agent knows who committed the murder, remains confrontational with Gruszynski. When Gruszynski still refuses to help, Crosetti and a frustrated Lewis leave Washington.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{imposing}} palaces {{were built}} in the main Mycenaean centers of the mainland. The earliest palace structures were megaron-type buildings, such as the Menelaion in Sparta, Lakonia. Palaces proper are datable from c. 1400 BC, when Cyclopean fortifications were erected at Mycenae and nearby Tiryns. Additional palaces {{were built in}} Midea and Pylos in Peloponnese, Athens, Eleusis, Thebes and Orchomenos in Central Greece and Iolcos, in Thessaly, the latter being the northernmost Mycenaean center. Knossos in Crete became also a Mycenaean center, where the former Minoan complex underwent a number of adjustments, including the addition of a throne room. These centers were based on a rigid network of bureaucracy where administrative competencies were classified into various sections and offices according to specialization of work and trades. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax (Linear B: wa-na-ka) in Mycenaean Greek terms. All powers were vested in him, as the main landlord and spiritual and military <b>leader.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time he was an entrepreneur and trader and was aided by a network of high officials.|$|E
