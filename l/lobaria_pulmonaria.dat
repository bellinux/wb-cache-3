50|$|<b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> {{has been}} found to have {{moderate}} anti-inflammatory effects, and strong anti-ulcerative effects in rats.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{doctrine}} of signatures, <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> is sometimes used to treat respiratory infections, {{although there is no}} peer-reviewed data to support the efficacy of this treatment.|$|E
50|$|There are 79 {{discovered}} {{species of}} lichens, {{three of which}} are on the Red List of lichens in Croatia. These are Bryoria fuscescens (with status VU - sensitive family), <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> (with status EN - endangered family) and genus Usnea (status VU). The research discovered several localities rich in lichen species like wild forest of beech in area of Kuti and wider area of Budinjak, Sv. Gera. Old orchards in grassland are explored as well.Following families are found {{and put on the}} Red List of Croatia: Baeomyces rufus (almost endangered species - NT), Dibaeis baeomyces (VU), <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> (VU), Menegazzia terebrata (VU) i Solorina saccata (VU).|$|E
50|$|Scarce plants include: the hay-scented buckler-fern (Dryopteris aemula) {{and wood}} spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides), the {{wild service tree}} (Sorbus torminalis), crab apple (Malus sylvestris) and aspen (Populus tremula). The 70 {{different}} epiphytic lichens found include: Phyllopsora rosei, the pollution-sensitive <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria.</b> Around 85 different mosses and liverworts are found in this site including Nowellia curvifolia.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a rich}} Lobaria {{community}} including tree lungwort (<b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria)</b> which grow on the oaks. A {{number of}} species are confined to north Cornwall and Devon, these include Bombyliospora pachycarpa, Graphina ruziana, Lecidea carollii, Melaspilea ochrothalamia, Pannaria rubiginosa, Parmeliellia atlantica and Parmeliellia plumbea. Other notable lichens include the blue-grey Stricta limbata and the yellow-orange Pseudocyphellaria crocata.|$|E
50|$|Members of the {{suborder}} Peltigerineae {{produce a}} wide range of secondary compounds, some of which are useful to humans in medicine and dyeing. Former uses include using Peltigera canina (dog lichen) as a remedy for the bite of a mad dog and <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> (tree lungwort) as a remedy for lung diseases because of its supposed resemblance to lung tissue.|$|E
5000|$|Historically in {{traditional}} medicine of Europe, <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> was collected {{in large quantities}} as [...] "Lungwort", due to its lung-like appearance (the doctrine of signatures suggesting that herbs can treat body parts that they physically resemble). Similarly, Peltigera leucophlebia {{was used as a}} supposed cure for thrush, due to the resemblance of its cephalodia to the appearance of the disease.|$|E
50|$|Dictyochloropsis reticulata is {{a species}} of green algae in the Microthamniales. It is a known as a photobiont (photosynthetic symbiont) with several lichen species, like <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria,</b> {{but also as a}} {{free-living}} soil alga as well. Phylogenetic analysis of rRNA sequence data revealed that the species shares a sister group relationship with two other green algae that lack motile stages, Chlorella saccharophila and C. luteoviridis.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) on Bryher. The Shipman Head and Shipman Down SSSI was first {{designated}} in 1971 and covers over 40 ha {{of the northern}} part of the island. Waved maritime heath grows over shallow podzolic soils which are underlain by Hercynian granite. Rare plants include the Red Data Book (RDB) Orange Bird’s-foot (Ornithopus pinnatus) and the nationally scarce Hairy Bird’s-foot trefoil (Lotus subbiflorus). Lichens include (<b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria)</b> and (Teleoschistes flavicans).|$|E
50|$|In October, 1972 a fire on Kittern Hill burnt {{though the}} shallow peaty soil to the granite. Bleached stones and {{blackened}} gorse stems {{can still be}} seen and the vegetation has not recovered sufficiently to equal the waved heath elsewhere on Scilly. Heath is on the hills {{on both sides of}} “the neck” and in the south of the island the nationally rare orange bird’s-foot (Ornithopus pinnatus) can be found as can rare lichen species such as <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> and golden-hair lichen (Teloschistes flavicans).|$|E
50|$|<b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> {{is a large}} epiphytic lichen {{consisting}} of an ascomycete fungus and a green algal partner living together in a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterium—a symbiosis involving members of three kingdoms of organisms. Commonly known by various names like tree lungwort, lung lichen, lung moss, lungwort lichen, oak lungs or oak lungwort, it is sensitive to air pollution and is also negatively affected by habitat loss and changes in forestry practices. Its population has declined across Europe and L. pulmonaria is considered endangered in many lowland areas. The species {{has a history of}} use in herbal medicines, and recent research has corroborated some medicinal properties of lichen extracts.|$|E
50|$|Effective {{methods of}} inactivating prions {{in the soil}} are {{currently}} lacking, {{and the effects of}} natural degradation mechanisms on prion infectivity are largely unknown. An improved understanding of the processes affecting the mobility, persistence and bioavailability of prions in soil is needed for the management of prion-contaminated environments. A system for estimating the prion-binding capacity of soil on farms using simple soil analysis may allow an estimate of the prion risk in the environment, and whether altering prion binding by the use of soil amendments may help to mitigate the infectious prions. Lichens, specifically, Parmelia sulcata, Cladonia rangiferina and <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria,</b> may have potential for reducing the number of prions because some lichen species contain proteases that show promise in breaking down the prion. Further work to clone and characterize the proteases, assess their effects on prion infectivity, and determine which component organism or organisms present in lichens produce or influence the protease activity is warranted and is currently under investigation.|$|E
50|$|The thallus of L. scobiculata has broad, concave {{and rounded}} lobes, rather wider than in <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria.</b> The upper surface has large shallow {{depressions}} (scrobiculate, hence the specific name). Blue-grey soredia, the asexual reproductive bodies, are always present along ridges {{and on the}} margins. The thallus has a blue-grey colour and pliable texture when hydrated but assumes a light grey or yellow-grey colour and papery texture when dehydrated. The underside is covered by light brown tomentum and rhizines except on raised areas that correspond to the depressions on the upper surface. Fungal fruit bodies (ascocarps), rarely present, are small dark red discs with a thick inflexed margin. Thallus lobes grow away from the substrate in irregular patches as in L. pulmonaria but unlike the more regular rounded and flattened colonies of L. quercizans, L. amplissima and L. virens. The algal symbiont is the cyanobacterium Nostoc, {{in contrast to the}} green algae in most other species of Lobaria.|$|E
50|$|The {{success of}} foliose lichen, {{especially}} old-growth forestlichen {{is dependent on}} the amount of light in the surrounding environment whichdictates a delicate balance between growth potential and desiccation damage. <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> is an old-growth forest lichen which was transplanted to three differentboreal forest stands to assess its biomass and area growth. The three standshad different amounts of light exposure, moistening and nutrient additions. Thethree forest habitats included (1) even-aged young and closed canopy stand, (2)old forest with gaps, (3) open clear-cut areas with sparse regeneration ofscattered trees with no self shading branches. Each of these environments offeredvarying amounts of light exposure. Growth of L. pulmonaria was highest in opensites, in which the species normally does not occur naturally. Lack of lightseems to be a strong limiting factor for the growth of L. pulmonaria. However,there is no simple relationship between site factors and light especiallybecause lichens desiccate at different times of the day. At the same time, L.pulmonaria has a low tolerance to prolonged high light, during desiccationtimes it can neither repair damage nor acclimate.|$|E
50|$|This site {{comprises}} {{a mosaic}} of broadleaved woodland, scrub, bracken, mires and unimproved grassland which provides the habitat for several species of butterfly which are now scarce in Britain. The site is also important for its lichens. The ground flora includes a number of species normally found only in ancient woodland such as woodruff (Galium odoratum) and wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa). Wood horsetail (Equisetum sylvaticum), which is rare in Somerset, is abundant and widespread on this site also being found {{in the areas of}} bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). The epiphytic lichen flora is also typical of ancient woodland and includes species such as <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria.</b> The nationally scarce Opegrapha corticola and the nationally rare Chaenotheca stemonea also occur. The woodland rides and glades provide ideal habitat for the nationally scarce wood white (Leptidea sinapsis) butterfly, this site having by far the strongest colony known in Somerset. The grassland provides habitat for the nationally scarce marsh fritillary (Eurodryas aurinia) butterfly. The breeding birds include nightingale (Luscinia megarhyches), redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) and wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix). Adder (Vipera berus), grass snake (Natrix helvetica), slowworm (Anguis fragilis) and common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) have all been recorded from the site.|$|E
50|$|The {{common alder}} is {{important}} to wildlife all year round and the seeds are a useful winter food for birds. Deer, sheep, hares and rabbits feed on the tree and it provides shelter for livestock in winter. It shades the water of rivers and streams, moderating the water temperature, and this benefits fish which also find safety among its exposed roots in times of flood. The common alder is the foodplant of the larvae {{of a number of}} different butterflies and moths and is associated with over 140 species of plant-eating insect. The tree is also a host to a variety of mosses and lichens which particularly flourish in the humid moist environment of streamside trees. Some common lichens found growing on the trunk and branches include tree lungwort (<b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria),</b> Menneguzzia terebrata and Stenocybe pullatula, the last of which is restricted to alders. Some 47 species of mycorrhizal fungi have been found growing in symbiosis with the common alder, both partners benefiting from an exchange of nutrients. As well as several species of Naucoria, these symbionts include Russula alnetorum, the milkcaps Lactarius obscuratus and Lactarius cyathula, and the alder roll-rim Paxillus filamentosus, all of which grow nowhere else except in association with alders. In spring, the catkin cup Ciboria amentacea grows on fallen alder catkins.|$|E
5000|$|The {{woodland}} {{is between}} Crackington Haven and Millook and runs for approximately 2 mi between the coastal path and the shore. Of international importance for its lichen communities, the ″dwarf ″ woodland at Dizzard Point (...) grows on exposed, unstable cliffs with a canopy dominated by sessile oak (Quercus petraea). Other woodland trees recorded are pedunculate oak (Q. robur), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and wild service-tree (S. torminalis). The maximum {{height of the}} canopy is from one to eight metres depending on exposure to the salt-laden, unpolluted winds and the trees are covered with Lobarion communities of lichens; the main species are <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria,</b> Lobaria scrobiculata, Parmeliella atlantica, Parmeliella plumbea and Pseudocyphellaria crocata, which is known from only one other site in England and Wales. Other lichens rarities include Bombyliospora pachycarpa, Graphina ruiziana, Lecidea carollii, Melaspilea ochrothalmia and Pannaria rubiginosa. The ground flora consists of a base rich plant community with ramsons (Allium ursinum), lords and ladies (Arum maculatum) and meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) in the wetter areas. Otherwise the ground flora is heath-like with ling (Calluna vulgaris) and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) as the dominate species, and cow wheat (Melampyrum pratense) and hay-scented buckler-fern (Dryopteris aemula) also occurring. Management by the National Trust includes the removal of invasive sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and maintenance of the coastal footpath from where the wood can be observed {{as there is no}} public access.|$|E
40|$|During 2007 and 2008 epiphytic and {{terrestrial}} lichen {{communities were}} surveyed in the Žumberak-Samoborsko gorje Nature Park (NW Croatia); 84 taxa were recorded including, Lecanora thysanophora, which {{was new to}} Croatia, and four, Bryoria fuscescens, <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria,</b> Usnea subfloridana and Usnea hirta, which are red data species in Croatia...|$|E
40|$|Transplantation {{experiments}} with Neckera pennata and <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> {{were conducted in}} nemoral Woodland Key Habitat and managed forest (in total 38 trees) in Latvia.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to analyse the effect of landscape structure (habitat size and exposure to farmland) on the occurrence and abundance of <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria,</b> a foliose cyanolichen. Since the agrarian revolution during the 19 th century the agricultural landscape has become increasingly fragmented resulting in isolated meadows and wood-pastures surrounded by farmland. <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> is one of the species being affected by this habitat change, much due to their dispersal limitations, specific habitat demands and susceptibility to air pollution. 36 localities of two different size classes ( 4. 5 ha) and two different exposure classes (exposed or unexposed to farmland) were studied. The occurrence, size of lichen thallus and height of lichen patches on tree trunks were significantly positively affected by habitat size and negatively affected by habitat exposure. The implications of these findings for strategies to manage and conserve L. pulmonaria in a fragmented landscape are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Study of {{anatomical}} and morphological {{structure of}} <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> showed that fungal {{component of the}} lichen constitutes the most part of its thalli.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A physio-ecological {{study of}} <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> (L.) Hoffm. {{was done to}} {{determine}} if geographic variation occurred within the species. <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> was collected from Table Mountain, Oak Creek, and Lost Prairie, located in the Coast Range, Willamette Valley, and Cascade Range respectively in Western Oregon. During 1971 and 1972 experiments were conducted to determine physical and chemical characteristics, thallus water content-water potential relations, and metabolic oxygen exchange rates in relation to light intensity, temperature, relative water content (RWC), and water potential. No differences were observed in the morphology, thallus area-density, presence of stictic and norstictic acids, chlorophyll concentrations, or metabolic response to temperature among the three populations of L. pulmonaria. However, results of other experiments indicated the possibility that L. pulmonaria has evolved intraspecific differences between the Oak Creek population and the montane groups. The Oak Creek population, situated in the most xeric habitat, showed a slow decrease in water potential as the plant lost water (- 0. 9 bars /...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> is {{a widely}} used as an {{indicator}} species of undisturbed old-growth forests ecosystems, but the knowledge about its habitat ecology is still highly fragmented. To quantify the distribution, habitat preference and host tree specificity of <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> we utilised data from databases and field surveys in Estonia. The number of L. pulmonaria localities is {{the highest in the}} densely forested regions, concentrated mainly in small forest patches defined as ‘ecologically highly valuable’. The species grows mostly on deciduous trees, particularly on aspen (Populus tremula). L. pulmonaria is most common in oligo-mesotrophic boreal, eutrophic boreo-nemoral and in eutrophic paludifying forests, and prefers forests with an average age of trees more than 100 years. In addition, we found that younger stands could be suitable habitats for L. pulmonaria if the structure of the stand is comparable to mature stands. In spite of the many localities of L. pulmonaria in Estonia, the species is still threatened because (1) the rotation period of tree stands is short, (2) it is abundant in forest types which are rare or under strong economic pressure, (3) and it prefers host trees which have a restricted distribution in Estonia or are not favoured in forest management practice. ...|$|E
40|$|Epiphytic {{bryophyte}} and {{lichen species}} distribution was studied in representative natural old-growth broad leaved forests in Latvia. Overall 120 epiphytic bryophyte and lichen species {{were found in}} 13 forest stands. Seven Latvian red-listed bryophyte (Antitrichia curtipendula, Lejeunea cavifolia, Metzgeria furcata, Neckera complanata, Neckera pennata, Dicranum viride, Jamesoniella autumnalis) and four red-listed lichen species (<b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria,</b> Opegrapha viridis, Pertusaria pertusa, Thelotrema lepadinum) were recorded. The relationships of total epiphytic bryophyte and lichen species richness and red-listed epiphytic bryophyte and lichen species richness with substrate factors (phorophyte species, DBH (diameter at breast height), tree bark crevice depth and tree bark pH) were evaluated. ...|$|E
40|$|Lichens {{associated}} with old forest are commonly {{assumed to be}} negatively affected by tree logging or natural disturbances. However, in this study performed in a spruce-dominated sylvopastoral landscape in the Swiss Jura Mountains, we found that genetic diversity of the epiphytic old-forest lichen <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> depends {{on the type of}} disturbance. We collected 923 thalli from 41 sampling plots of 1 ha corresponding to the categories stand-replacing disturbance (burnt), intensive logging (logged) and uneven-aged forestry uneven-aged), and analysed the thalli at six mycobiont-specific microsatellite loci.

40|$|The {{present study}} reports 223 species and three {{subspecies}} of lichens from forest rocky communities of mountain Olovgora, {{which is the}} highest point of the Vetreny Poyas ridge (Arkhangelsk Region, NW Russia). A total of 82 species are new for the mainland area of Arkhangelsk Region. The species Bryoria glabra has been reported {{for the first time}} for European Russia. Two recorded lichen species, Cladonia bellidiflora and <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria,</b> are in the Red Data Book of Arkhangelsk Region. The occurrence of old-growth forests, high heterogeneity of conditions, presence of an altitudinal gradient and the proximity to the sea lead to the rich diversity of lichens in this area. ...|$|E
40|$|Premise of the study: Microsatellite loci were {{developed}} for the threatened haploid lichen fungus <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> to increase the resolution to identify clonal individuals, and to study its population subdivision. Methods and Results: We developed 14 microsatellite markers from 454 DNA sequencing data of L. pulmonaria and tested for cross-amplification with L. immixta and L. macaronesica. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to 23. Nei's unbiased gene diversity, averaged over loci, ranged from 0. 434 to 0. 517 in the three studied populations. Conclusions: The new markers will increase the genetic resolution in studies that aim at disentangling clones in L. pulmonaria and may be useful for closely related species within Lobaria sect.

40|$|Grazing {{marks from}} snails are {{frequently}} observed in {{populations of the}} old forest epiphyte <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria.</b> However, grazing marks are more numerous in thalli from deciduous broadleaved forests than in thalli from boreal Picea abies forests, due to higher populations of lichen-feeding molluscs in deciduous stands. Here we tested for deleterious effects of snails on the lichens by transplanting 600 more or less grazed L. pulmonaria thalli from deciduous forests to snail-free P. abies forests. Subsequent measurements showed that growth rates were as high in thalli with many grazing marks as those without, suggesting that growth of mature lobes of L. pulmonaria are not inhibited by the recorded grazing pressure imposed by lichen feeding snails...|$|E
40|$|Vegetative diaspores of <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> were transplanted to {{previously}} uncolonized trees. The {{early development}} of the corticated but otherwise non-stratified isidioid soredia was studied mainly by low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. Anchoring hyphae developed from cortical hyphae after 2 - 4 months and later apical or lateral pseudomeristematic growth zones were formed. After 15 months the growth zones further differentiated into 0 · 5 -mm-broad lobes and revealed a stratified thallus typical for this foliose epiphytic lichen species. The experiment showed that the small population size of L. pulmonaria was limited by the low reproductive potential of the species and that it might fail to compensate for a relatively high disturbance, natural or anthropogenic, in the stan...|$|E

40|$|Indicator {{species are}} often used to detect forest with a long {{temporal}} continuity. However, only species restricted to such forests because of their poor dispersal capacity should be used as continuity indicators. The dispersal capacity of one species suggested as a continuity indicator, the lichen <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> has been studied recently in southern Sweden. The results of that study suggest that L. pulmonaria has very poor long-range dispersal capacity, and hence would be a suitable indicator of forest continuity. It is important {{to pay attention to}} the dispersal capacity and dispersal strategy of different species when planning for nature conservation. If the focal species are short-distance dispersers, the efforts should be concentrated at protecting and enlarging biotopes where the species is found today...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe growth {{inhibition}} of stictic acid, a secondary metabolite {{isolated from the}} lichen <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria</b> (L.) Hoffm.

40|$|Cephalodia were {{investigated}} on young and mature thalli of <b>Lobaria</b> <b>pulmonaria.</b> Cephalodia originate from contact between hyphae and cyanobacteria {{on the upper}} or lower cortex or, less frequently, in the apical zone. Young thalli were found to associate with cyanobacteria even in the anchoring zone. Cephalodia formed on the young thalli or the anchoring hyphae share the same phenotypic characteristics. In spite of being composed of paraplectenchymatous hyphae, the cortex of mature thalli preserves a considerable plasticity, enabling the formation of cephalodia. The cyanobacterial incorporation process begins with cortical hyphae growing out towards adjacent cyanobacterial colonies, enveloping them and incorporating them into the thallus. The incorporation process is the same on the upper and the lower cortex. Early stages of cephalodia are usually found in young lobes, whereas in the older parts of the thallus only mature cephalodia are foun...|$|E
