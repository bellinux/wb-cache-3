An {{experimental}} study {{of the effects of}} fire and grazing was carried out in the Sakaraha area (S. W. Madagascar).

Three burning treatments (no burning, early burning and <b>late</b> <b>burning)</b> and two grazing treatments (grazed, ungrazed) were compared.

As expected, the standard errors of these estimates were consistently smaller in the OLS models relative to the GLS models (paired permutation test, P = 0.016), although the magnitude of these differences were slight (average standard error reduction in the OLS models = 13.6 %), suggesting that the OLS estimates did not greatly inflate the risks of Type I errors. Note {{that some of these}} tests imply differences in the effects of early versus <b>late</b> season prescribed <b>burning,</b> with <b>late</b> season <b>burning</b> resulting in the greater consumption of total fuels (in agreement with Knapp et al.

40|$|Future {{automotive}} fuels {{are expected}} to contain significant quantities of bio-components. This poses a great challenge to the designers of novel low-CO 2 internal combustion engines because biofuels have very different properties to those of most typical hydrocarbons. The current article presents results of firing a direct-injection spark-ignition optical research engine on ethanol and butanol and comparing those to data obtained with gasoline and iso-octane. A multihole injector, located centrally in the combustion chamber, was used with all fuels. Methane was also employed by injecting it into the inlet plenum to provide a benchmark case for well-mixed “homogeneous” charge preparation. The study covered stoichiometric and lean mixtures (λ = 1. 0 and λ = 1. 2), various spark advances (30 – 50 ° CA), a range of engine temperatures (20 – 90 °C), and diverse injection strategies (single and “split” triple). In-cylinder gas sampling at the spark-plug location and at a location on the pent-roof wall was also carried out using a fast flame ionization detector to measure the equivalence ratio of the in-cylinder charge and identify the degree of stratification. Combustion imaging was performed through a full-bore optical piston to study the effect of injection strategy on <b>late</b> <b>burning</b> associated with fuel spray wall impingement. Combustion with single injection was fastest for ethanol throughout 20 – 90 °C, but butanol and methane were just as fast at 90 °C; iso-octane was the slowest and gasoline was between iso-octane and the alcohols. At 20 °C, λ at the spark plug location was 0. 96 – 1. 09, with gasoline exhibiting the largest and iso-octane the lowest value. Ethanol showed the lowest degree of stratification and butanol the largest. At 90 °C, stratification was lower for most fuels, with butanol showing the largest effect. The work output with triple injection was marginally higher for the alcohols and lower for iso-octane and gasoline (than with single injection), but combustion stability was worse for all fuels. Triple injection produced a lower degree of stratification, with leaner λ at the spark plug than single injection. Combustion imaging showed much less luminous <b>late</b> <b>burning</b> with tripe injection. In terms of combustion stability, the alcohols were more robust to changes in fueling (λ = 1. 2) than the liquid hydrocarbons...|$|E
40|$|Supernovae of Type IIn (narrow line) {{appear to}} be explosions that had strong mass loss before the event, so that the optical {{luminosity}} is powered by the circumstellar interaction. If the mass loss region has an optical depth $>c/v_s$, where $v_s$ is the shock velocity, the shock breakout occurs in the mass loss region and a significant fraction of the explosion energy can be radiated. The emission from the superluminous SN 2006 gy and the normal luminosity SN 2011 ht can plausibly be attributed to shock breakout in a wind, with SN 2011 ht being a low energy event. Superluminous supernovae of Type I may derive their luminosity from interaction with a mass loss region of limited extent. However, the distinctive temperature increase to maximum luminosity has not been clearly observed in Type I events. Suggested mechanisms for the strong mass loss include pulsational pair instability, gravity-waves generated by instabilities in <b>late</b> <b>burning</b> phases, and binary effects.

40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition offers {{the possibility to}} reduce the fuel consumption of gasoline passenger car engines. However, the combustion strategy is limited to low loads due to pressure oscillations at higher loads. A strategy for extending the homogeneous charge {{compression ignition}} load range is charge stratification, using, for example, late direct injection to prolong the combustion duration and reduce the rate of pressure rises and pressure oscillations. In this study, local temperatures and fuel concentrations near top dead centre in a gasoline engine operating in homogeneous charge compression ignition mode were measured using two-wavelength planar laser-induced fluorescence, and the following combustion was analysed using high-speed video to investigate the effects of fuel and temperature stratification on combustion in order to explain the ringing inhibiting effect of charge stratification for fuels displaying single-stage ignition. The extent of spatial distribution of combustion timing correlated well with the extent of fuel and temperature stratification. Furthermore, the gas was leaner and hotter in early igniting regions, while it was richer and colder in late igniting regions. The dampening effects of charge stratification on the combustion speed and pressure oscillations are probably due to rich conditions in the <b>latest</b> <b>burning</b> regions (where combustion is usually most intense) slowing down combustion, which explains why the strategy only works when the global air-to-fuel ratio is not excessively lean...|$|R

The stellar sequences were evolved through the advanced burning phases up to the end of core oxygen burning. We present a careful analysis of the physical characteristics of the stellar models. In particular, we investigate the effect of the still unsettled reaction ^ 12 C(α,γ) ^ 16 O on the advanced evolution by using recent compilations of this rate. We find that this rate has {{a significant impact on the}} evolution not only during the core helium burning phase, but also during the <b>late</b> <b>burning</b> phases, especially the shell carbon-burning. We have also considered the effect of different treatment of convective instability based on the Ledoux criterion in regions of varying molecular weight gradient during the hydrogen and helium burning phases.

The objective of this work is to evaluate duel fuel operation of CI diesel engines with simplest possible change of hardware. Here the effort {{has been made to}} determine the performance and emission characteristics of CNG and neem blends in CI engine. The maximum achievable neem biodiesel replacement by natural gas was found to vary with engine loads. The experiments are carried out for five different flow rates starting from minimum to maximum flow rate position. The engine showed very similar performance compared to diesel operation near up to 90 % of rated load with up to 54 % replacement of diesel by CNG being possible. The maximum flow rate position is one at which the engine starts knocking. Exhaust gas analysis showed that with higher diesel replacement the level of CO 2 generation decreased and CO emission was found to increase. The <b>late</b> <b>burning</b> of the mixture with higher diesel replacement levels of CNG had caused more fuel to remain partially unburned increasing the formation of CO and decreasing the proportion of CO 2.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of three experimental fire regimes on the fecundity, ovule development and seedfall of two common wet-dry tropical savanna eucalypts, Eucalyptus miniata and Eucalyptus tetrodonta, in northern Australia. Both species flower early in the dry season and ovule development occurs during the dry season. This coincides with a period of frequent fires. The three fire regimes considered were applied for four years between 1990 and 1994. These regimes were (i) Unburnt, (ii) Early, fires lit early in the dry season, and (iii) Late, fires lit late in the dry season. The treatments were applied to nine catchments (15 - 20 km 2) with each fire regime replicated three times. Fire intensity typically increases as the dry season proceeds. Therefore, early dry season fires generally differ from late dry season fires in both their intensity and their timing {{in relation to the}} reproductive phenology of the eucalypts. Late dry season burning significantly reduced the fecundity of both species, whereas Early burning had no significant effect. Ovule success was significantly reduced by the Early burning for both species. The <b>Late</b> <b>burning</b> significantly reduced ovule success in E. tetrodonta, but not in E. miniata. The results suggest that fire intensity and fire timing may both be important determinants of seed supply. Fire intensity may be a determinant of fecundity, whereas fire timing in relation to the reproduction phenology may {{have a significant impact on}} ovule survival. Both fire regimes resulted in a substantial reduction in seed supply compared with the Unburnt treatment. This may have a significant impact on seedling regeneration of these tropical savanna eucalypts...|$|E
40|$|Wildfires are {{critical}} in miombo forests across the African continent causing loss of biodiversity, human properties and increasing climate change impacts. Within a broader project {{which seeks to}} develop a strategy to reduce wildfires in miombo woodlands of Tanzania, {{we report on the}} preliminary findings based on initial field data collected in situ to set a baseline for further work. The project covers three miombo biomes in three districts (Handeni, Kilosa and Kilwa) in Eastern Tanzania covering nine forest reserves managed under different authorities namely, central government, local districts and village communities. The aim of the current study were therefore, to describe species composition and structure of the forest communities, profile initial carbon stock in trees, herbaceous layer and soil within permanent survey plots, in effort to examine the potential of using fire reduction strategy as a potential tool of carbon sequestration in miombo woodlands [...] The research team used permanent forest plots to collect vegetation and soil data. Simlarly available models were used to estimate carbon stocking. More than 200 species of trees and shrubs totaling 506 individual trees (dbh > 4 cm) were recorded and Kilosa site contributed the largest proportion (40. 7 %) to the tree abundance total. This was followed closely by Kilwa (35. 6 %) and Handeni (20. 7 %). Species richness and diversity varied considerably within and between the study sites. Kilwa had the highest species richness and Handeni the lowest. Analysis of community assemblages revealed strongly distinct forest communities both at local and regional level between Kilwa and other sites. Carbon stocks in trees and soil were significantly different among sites and were higher than previously reported for other miombo woodland elsewhere in Tanzania. On the average tree carbon ranged from 21. 42 - 44. 12 t/ha, the highest stock reported in Kilosa site due to assemblage of large trees. The general picture of carbon stock indicated that early burning is better for carbon storage than <b>late</b> <b>burning</b> or no burning. The lack of fire reduction strategy overrides the dynamics of forest stand structure and the potential for carbon sequestration by these forests as wildfires appear to be critical across the study area. There is dire need for a comprehensive strategy to reducing forest fires across the miombo biomes which together will help mitigate climate change impacts in Tanzania. CCIA...|$|E
40|$|Cylinder {{pressure}} {{analysis is}} widely used in the experimental investigation of combustion processes within gasoline engines. A pressure record can be processed to reveal detail of charge burning, {{which is a good}} indicator of combustion quality. The thesis describes the evaluation of an approximate technique for calculating the mass fraction of the charge that has burnt; a novel approach for determining heat loss to the block; the development of a powerful system for combustion analysis; and the investigation of the correlation between the crank angle location of the 50 % mass burnt and minimum timing advance necessary to obtain the maximum engine torque. A detailed examination has been carried out into the uncertainties in the determination of the mass fraction burnt as suggested by Rassweiler and Withrow. A revised procedure has been developed which does not require a priori identification of the combustion end point, and a new approach is suggested to calculate the polytropic indices necessary for the pressure processing. This particular implementation of the analysis is able to identify <b>late</b> <b>burning</b> and misfiring cycles, and then take appropriate steps to ensure their proper analysis. The problems associated with the assumption of uniform pressure; alignment of the pressure changes to the volume changes; pressure sampling rate; clearance volume estimation; and calibrating the acquired pressure to absolute are also evaluated. A novel method is developed to ascertain, directly from the pressure history, the heat loss to the cylinder block. Both experimental and simulated data are used to support the accuracy of the suggested heat loss evaluation, and the sensitivity of the method to its inputs is examined. The conversion of procedures for combustion analysis into a format suitable for undertaking high speed analysis is described. The analysis techniques were implemented so that the engine can be considered to be on-line to the analysis system. The system was entitled Quikburn. This system can process an unlimited number of cycles at a particular running condition, updating the screen every 1. 5 seconds. The analysis system has been used to study the potentially beneficial correlation between the location of the 50 % mass burnt and MBT. The correlation is examined in detail, and found to be valid except under lean fueling conditions, which is seen to be caused by slow flame initiation. It is suggested that the optimum location of the 50 % mass burnt {{can be used as a}} reference setting for the ignition timing, and as an indicator of combustion chamber performance. An engine simulation was employed to verify that changes in bum shape account for the small variation seen in the optimum 50 % bum locations at different operating conditions of the engine. The bum shape changes also account for the range of optimum locations of the 50 % mass burnt encountered in different engines...|$|E
30|$|The {{degree of}} spatial {{heterogeneity}} also {{has implications for}} an ongoing debate concerning the need for mechanical thinning prior to the reintroduction of prescribed fire in Sierran mixed conifer forests. Arguments in favor of pre-fire thinning {{are based on the}} notion that a century of fire exclusion has led to the homogenization of previously heterogeneous stands, and the application of fire without preceding silvicultural treatments will perpetuate these changes in forest structure (Bonnicksen and Stone 1981, 1982; Bonnicksen 1989). Here we show that there is only weak evidence for pervasive spatial autocorrelation both before and after prescription burning for measures of fire effects relevant to managers, and that spatial autocorrelation had trivial effects when comparing the outcomes of early versus <b>late</b> season <b>burning</b> in a Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest.|$|R
40|$|Nine {{pastures}} totaling 492 acres were summer grazed by yearling Hereford steers. Five pastures {{were burned}} April 24, 1974; four were not burned. Burned and nonburned pastures had 0, 40, or 80 lbs. of nitrogen per acre applied aerially May 2, 1974. Stocking rates were determined with herbage production data from experimental plots under similar treatments. Under equal fertilization and stocking rates, burned pastures produced more {{average daily gain}} and gain per acre than nonburned pastures. Fertilizing and heavier stocking tended to reduce average daily gains, but increase gain per acre. Steers on the early-season, intensively grazed pasture, gained the most per day (2. 09 lbs.) and produced a high gain per acre (96 lbs.). Range condition was higher on burned pastures. On unburned pastures, range condition decreased as fertilizer rate increased. High feed grain prices have forced beef producers to use forages to lower beef production costs. The native bluestem grasses have long provided {{a major portion of}} the forage for the Flint Hills beef producer and methods of increasing native grass production are being studied. <b>Late</b> spring <b>burning</b> (<b>late</b> April) has increased steer gains and improved range condition.

40|$|The Serengeti-Mara savanna {{environment}} in East Africa {{is characterized by}} changing levels of woody cover and a dynamic fire regime. The relative proportion of woodland to grassland savanna affects animal habitat, biodiversity, and carbon storage, and is regulated by {{factors such as the}} fire regime (frequency, intensity, seasonality), and precipitation. The main objectives of this dissertation are to determine recent changes in woody cover at a regional scale and identify fire regimes and climate associated with these changes. Understanding these relationships is important for the assessment of future trajectories of woody cover under changing climate. Required spatially coherent data layers can only be obtained at the regional scale through the analysis of remote sensing data. Woody cover changes between 2000 and 2005 were derived from field data and a time series of MODIS satellite imagery at 500 m spatial resolution. Data layers on the controlling variables (fire frequency, seasonality, intensity and rainfall) were developed using a combination of remote sensing and model-based approaches. Burned areas were mapped using daily MODIS imagery at 250 m resolution. Outputs were used to make the requisite layers depicting fire frequency and seasonality. Fire intensity was derived using a model based on empirical relationships, mainly estimating fire fuel load as a function of rainfall and grazing. The combined data layers were analyzed using regression and decision tree techniques. Results suggest woody cover in central and northern Serengeti National Park continued to increase after 2000. Woody cover decreases were strongest in the wider Maswa Game Reserve area (MSW) under low precipitation conditions and <b>late</b> season <b>burning.</b> Woody cover losses in burned areas were also higher in the low fire frequency region of the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MNR). Fire seasonality was the most important fire regime parameter controlling woody cover in burned woodland savanna areas while fire intensity was most relevant for grassland savanna areas. Continued <b>late</b> season <b>burning</b> in drought years might cause further decrease of woody cover in MSW. MNR is expected to continue to be dominated by grassland savanna at similar fire frequency and browsing levels...|$|R
40|$|Many {{protected}} {{areas around the}} world face degradation {{in the face of}} poverty, maladapted agricultural practices and population growth in their surroundings. This research uses a multidisciplinary approach to study this complex problem {{in the context of a}} montane ecosystem. The study area comprises Ngel Nyaki and Kurmin Danko Forest Reserves on the Mambilla Plateau in Eastern Nigeria and the surrounding landscape, comprising pastoral lands, farmland, villages and homesteads. Ongoing degradation of the Forest Reserves through their illegal use as grazing areas by the local Fulani pastoralists indicates that the exclusionary protection of the forest is not working. It may be that a participatory forestry approach to conservation would be more successful. The research presented in this thesis uses a variety of methods (interviews, remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) and ecological monitoring) to evaluate the current situation in the study area with the aim of determining the likelihood of such a participatory approach to conservation being successful. Satellite images from the years 1988, 2000 and 2009 were used to quantify changes in forest cover to measure deforestation and regeneration rates. Interviews were used to understand the Fulani's pastoral management systems, land ownership status, cattle movements and living situation. Data from interviews and observations as well as from satellite imagery were combined in a GIS to approximate stocking rates and property boundaries and to identify the level of livelihood diversification the different Fulani families have undergone. As grass and water availability have been identified as the main environmental factors determining grazing and cattle movements, environmental data was collected to determine changes in the rates of grass productivity and streamflow over the course of one dry season. The study found that the extent of natural forest is decreasing all over the study area, on privately owned properties, commonly owned properties and in the Forest Reserves. Evidence of human impacts such as charred grassland by <b>late</b> <b>burning</b> and cattle tracks were clearly visible throughout the reserves, with the exception of the core forest area, indicating ongoing intensive use and management of the reserve for cattle grazing. The stocking rates in dry and wet seasons have been found likely to exceed carrying capacities, which results in overgrazing and a reduction in vegetation cover. The Fulani in the study area have already undergone a transition from relying purely on livestock and livestock products to relying on a mix of livestock, agriculture and silviculture. This transition shows potential for forest transition according to the 'forest transition theory', which, supported by the right policy incentives could be transformed into landscape scale conservation of endemic flora and fauna. xii Biomass productivity and water availability in wet and dry seasons were found to be highly asymmetric, which seriously restricts the number of suitable cattle management systems. Data indicate that tall riverine vegetation may have effects on stream water availability during the dry season. The findings of this section point to the need of carefully reassessing the current management of tall riverine vegetation on the Mambilla plateau, also in view of the sustainability of the water supply for pastoral livelihoods...|$|E

Tests were performed {{for a range of}} engine load, two engine speeds, various air-fuel ratio and with a fixed ignition timing. To isolate liquid fuel effects due to the poor atomization and vaporization of the fuel when using a carburetor, a specially conditioned homogeneous, pre-vaporized mixture system (HMS) was developed. The results from carburetor and HMS are compared. To verify the existence of liquid fuel in the manifold, and to obtain an estimate of its mass, a carburetor-mounted liquid fuel injection (CMLFI) system was also implemented. Stop-injection tests performed with the CMFLI system show that 60 - 80 cycles worth of liquid fuel is held in the intake manifold depending on operating condition. The results of the comparison show that the liquid fuel in the intake manifold does not have a statistically significant influence on the averaged HC emissions. In addition, the cycle-resolved HC emissions for both systems follow the same trends and are comparable in magnitude. Heat release analysis showed little difference between fuel mixture delivery system. These results suggest that under steady state operation the HC emissions for this engine are not sensitive to the presence of liquid fuel in the intake manifold. The ring pack contribution to the engine-out HC emissions was estimated using a simplified ring pack gas flow model; the model was tested against the experimentally measured blowby. The tests were performed using the homogeneous fuel mixture system. The integrated mass of HC leaving the crevices from the end of combustion (the crank angle that the cumulative burn fraction reached 90 %) to exhaust valve closing was taken to represent the potential contribution of the ring pack to the overall HC emissions; post-oxidation in the cylinder will consume some of this mass. Time-resolved exhaust HC concentration measurements were also performed, and the instantaneous HC mass flow rate was determined using the measured exhaust and cylinder pressure. At high load the model predicts that the ring pack returns approximately three times as much HC mass to the cylinder as is measured in the exhaust, indicating that the HC emissions are dominated by the ring pack contribution. At the lightest load condition tested, the ring pack model predicts less mass returning to the cylinder from the ring pack than is observed in the exhaust, clearly indicating that another HC mechanism is significantly contributing to the exhaust HC emissions. The integrated exhaust HC mass from the time-resolved HC measurement was found to correlate inversely with the IMEP on a cycle-by-cycle basis, which strongly suggest that incomplete combustion is materially contributing to the exhaust HC emissions. A statistical analysis showed that the correlation was significant. The intermediate load condition represents a combination of these two extremes. The ensemble-average ring pack model results indicate that the mass returned to the cylinder from the ring pack is slightly higher than the amount measured in the exhaust. But, a conditional sampling analysis indicates that there are sub-groups, i. e. late-burning cycles, for which this is not true. There is expected to be some in-cylinder post-oxidation of the ring pack HC mass at this condition, and the <b>late</b> <b>burning</b> cycles were not found to excessively contribute to the HC emissions, which both strongly suggests that there are other mechanisms besides the ring pack that are significantly contributing to the HC emissions at this condition. The most likely mechanism is incomplete combustion. The contribution of fuel adsorption in engine oil and its subsequent desorption following combustion to the engine-out hydrocarbon (HC) emissions was studied by comparing steady state and cycle-resolved HC emission measurements from operation with a standard full-blend gasoline, and with propane, which has a low solubility in oil. Experiments were performed at two speeds and three loads, and for different mean crankcase pressures. The crankcase pressure was found to impact the HC emissions, presumably through the ringpack mechanism, which was largely unaltered by the different fuels. The average and cycle-resolved HC emissions were found to be in good agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the two fuels. Further, the two fuels showed the same response to changes in the crankcase pressure. The experiments were supported by a numerical analysis. The simulation of the liquid-gas phase equilibrium of the fuel-oil system showed the solubility of propane in the oil was approximately an order of magnitude lower than for gasoline. Further the numerical analysis of the adsorption-desorption of the fuel in the oil along the cycle showed that the oil layer contribution is very small compared with the ring pack contribution. This suggests that the effect of fuel adsorption in the oil is not significant for small air-cooled utility-type engines...|$|E
30|$|There is {{a concern}} that that early season {{prescribed}} burns, which are often conducted before the main historic fire season and coincide with the active period for many plant and animal species, may more negatively (or less positively) affect arthropod communities than late season prescribed burns. However, in our study, we found few significant differences between burning season treatments. In fact early season burn treatment had effects that were generally intermediate between that of the unburned control and the late season burn treatment. The likely explanation for this result is that early season burns were of lower intensity and patchier than late season burns and that these intensity-related effects were more important than direct effects of the timing of burning in relation to arthropod phenology. This result is consistent with observed effects of early and <b>late</b> season <b>burning</b> on vegetation (Schwilk et al. 2006, Knapp et al. in press).|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to our study, {{other studies have}} reported reductions in S. orbiculatus with fire. <b>Late</b> spring <b>burning</b> in tallgrass prairie reduced S. orbiculatus due to lower carbohydrate reserves because plants had already leafed out (Hulbert [1984]) which is different than our early spring burns and no apparent reductions. Furthermore, two successive years of spring burning in April in a forested corridor of Kansas reduced S. orbiculatus canopy cover from 40 % to 9 % but did not alter shrub species richness (Abrams [1988]). Thus, burning {{later in the season}} or burning a site repeatedly for successive years may result in reductions of S. orbiculatus. However, at our research sites, most burning is done in the early spring and may not be possible in late spring due to Schedonorus arundinaceus (tall fescue) greenup and alteration of fire behavior (McGranahan et al. [2012]). Furthermore, {{it can be difficult to}} graze and burn complete pastures for successive years (Ansley et al. [2010]).|$|R
30|$|Fire is an {{important}} feature of many forest ecosystems, although the quantification of its effects is compromised by the large scale at which fire occurs and its inherent unpredictability. A recurring problem {{is the use of}} subsamples collected within individual burns, potentially resulting in spatially autocorrelated data. Using subsamples from six different fires (and three unburned control areas) we show little evidence for strong spatial autocorrelation either before or after burning for eight measures of forest conditions (both fuels and vegetation). Additionally, including a term for spatially autocorrelated errors provided little improvement for simple linear models contrasting the effects of early versus <b>late</b> season <b>burning.</b> While the effects of spatial autocorrelation should always be examined, it may not always greatly influence assessments of fire effects. If high patch scale variability is common in Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests, even following more than a century of fire exclusion, treatments designed to encourage further heterogeneity in forest conditions prior to the reintroduction of fire will likely be unnecessary.|$|R

3000|$|To {{determine}} the effects of spatial autocorrelation on an assessment of fire effects, we contrasted the results of tests that compared early versus <b>late</b> season <b>burning</b> using ordinary least-squares regression (OLS) and a spatial generalized least squares regression (GLS). The OLS model assumes no spatial autocorrelation among samples, potentially leading to excessive reductions in standard errors of the parameter estimates (and thereby inflating the probability of Type I errors), while the GLS model included spatial structure into the error term of the regression (Pinheiro and Bates 2000). For the GLS model, we used a spherical spatial error structure, with the inclusion of a nugget effect where needed (Cressie 1993). Our response variables were the change in a forest attribute (e.g., paired differences of stem densitypre-fire − stem densitypost-fire) as predicted by season of burning. Season of burning contrasts are presented relative to early season burning. Parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood and model comparisons were performed using AICc, the Akaike information criterion corrected for sample size (Burnham and Anderson 2002). Model selection is typically done by referencing the model with the lowest AICc value. Here, to emphasize the inclusion of spatially autocorrelated errors, we made our selection relative to the GLS model (Δ AICc [...]...|$|R
30|$|Native {{plants in}} {{sagebrush}} ecosystems {{have been shown}} to respond positively to fire in previous studies in which plants had been released from domestic grazing pressure. In mountain big sagebrush communities of Lava Beds National Monument following removal of domestic cattle, Champlin (1983) observed significant increases in basal area of bluebunch wheatgrass and Sandberg bluegrass two years after burning. Conversely, he found decreases in basal area of Thurber’s needlegrass immediately following fire. In an area where domestic grazing had been eliminated 15 years previously, Sapsis (1990) found that both fall and spring burning reduced the frequency of invasive annual grasses in basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. tridentata)-blue-bunch wheatgrass communities at John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, and increased reproductive effort of perennial grasses following fall burns. Wright and Klemmedson (1965) found that early summer burns damaged squirreltail and Thurber’s needlegrass, but that only Thurber’s needlegrass was harmed by <b>late</b> summer <b>burning.</b> Sandberg bluegrass was not affected by either season of burn. In Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young) communities in eastern Oregon, Davies and Bates (2008) found that the cover and density of Thurber’s needlegrass was no different than in adjacent unburned areas two years following fire.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{timing of}} {{initiation}} of human {{impacts on the}} global climate system is actively debated. Anthropogenic effects on the global climate system are evident since the Industrial Revolution, but humans may have altered biomass burning, and hence the climate system, for millennia. We use the specific biomarker levoglucosan to produce the first high-temporal resolution hemispheric reconstruction of Holocene fire emissions inferred from ice core analyses. Levoglucosan recorded in the Greenland North Greenland Eemian ice core significantly increases since the last glacial, resulting in a maximum around ~ 2. 5 ka and then decreasing until the present. Here we demonstrate that global climate drivers fail to explain <b>late</b> Holocene biomass <b>burning</b> variations and that the levoglucosan maximum centered on ~ 2. 5 ka {{may be due to}} anthropogenic land clearance. 1...|$|R
40|$|Pre-supernova (SN) outbursts from {{massive stars}} may {{be driven by}} hydrodynamical wave energy {{emerging}} from {{the core of the}} progenitor star during <b>late</b> nuclear <b>burning</b> phases. Here, we examine the effects of wave heating in stars containing little or no hydrogen, i. e., progenitors of type IIb/Ib SNe. Because there is no massive hydrogen envelope, wave energy is thermalized near the stellar surface where the overlying atmospheric mass is small but the optical depth is large. Wave energy can thus unbind this material, driving an optically thick, super-Eddington wind. Using 1 D hydodynamic MESA simulations of ∼ 5 M_ He stars, we find that wave heating can drive pre-SN outbursts composed of a dense wind whose mass loss rate can exceed ∼ 0. 1 M_/ yr. The wind terminal velocities are a few 100 km/ s, and outburst luminosities can reach ∼ 10 ^ 6 L_. Wave-driven outbursts may be linked with observed or inferred pre-SN outbursts of type Ibn/transitional/transformational SNe, and pre-SN wave-driven mass loss is a good candidate to produce these types of SNe. However, we also show that non-linear wave breaking in the core of the star may prevent such outbursts in stars with thick convective helium-burning shells. Hence, only a limited subset of SN progenitors are likely to experience wave-driven pre-SN outbursts. Comment: Submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome...|$|R
