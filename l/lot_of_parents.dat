According to the World Bank (2002), aggregate household spending on tutoring at the pre-university level represents the largest household education expense (even compared to spending on private school tuition and fees). According to the Economist Intelligence Unit (1996), {{it is not}} uncommon for households with children in the secondary education level to spend up to 25 % of annual income on tutoring. Observing a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> deciding to invest in tutoring does not necessarily imply that there are corresponding high returns to tutoring. There may be imperfect information on payoffs, especially given that some of the returns are long-term, and that parents’ decisions may be affected by peer effects rather than by information on payoffs. It is therefore important to find out if such an investment pays off in terms of better education outcomes or if these resources would be better spent on improving the quality of the formal schooling system. This paper, therefore, fits in the larger literature on the effectiveness of public versus private educational investment on education achievement and outcomes.

This international evolution causes national family law to be improved, which reinforces the rights of a child.

Children of emigrants were found to be better off economically than children of non-migrant parents, while children with mothers or both parents abroad benefited the most from remittances, and therefore enjoyed the greatest expansion in their capabilities.
