40|$|Accounting about 70 % {{of vehicle}} miles on roadways, highway driving is a {{critical}} issue in traffic safety deployment. Of the various maneuvers that comprise the highly complex driving task, each one requires understanding on the connections between driving states, vehicle performance and drivers' actions. This paper attempts to flesh out a complete picture of driving maneuvers on highways. Eighteen drivers participated in this study. They drove an instrumented vehicle on highways to accumulate 2, 600 km naturalistic driving data. The data were segmented and classified into 11 maneuver groups manually. Analysis on the maneuvers revealed that: 1) A maneuver transition probabilities model was proposed. According to this model, 7 typical driving patterns were drawn based on the transition probabilities. Transition events pertaining to approaching/following/lane changing accounted for 95 % of all the highway transition events. 2) The durations were 7. 6 / 6. 6 s and 7. 1 / 7. 0 s for free left/right <b>lane</b> <b>changes</b> and overtake from left/right <b>lane</b> <b>changes,</b> respectively. The numbers were 22. 5, 21. 4 and 16. 3 s for far, middle and near following maneuvers, respectively. Statistical significances were found within both groups. 3) How drivers behave in each maneuver was analyzed. Drivers drove faster in free <b>lane</b> <b>changes</b> than did in overtake <b>lane</b> <b>changes.</b> For overtake <b>lane</b> <b>changes,</b> two driving patterns were observed: accelerate to <b>change</b> <b>lane</b> and decelerate to <b>change</b> <b>lane...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} {{capacity and}} {{the efficiency of}} the U.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of <b>lane</b> <b>changes</b> {{has been proven}} to be useful for collision avoidance support in road vehicles. This paper proposes an interactive multiple model (IMM) -based method for predicting <b>lane</b> <b>changes</b> in highways. The sensor unit consists {{of a set of}} low-cost Global Positioning System/inertial measurement unit (GPS/IMU) sensors and an odometry captor for collecting velocity measurements. Extended Kalman filters (EKFs) running in parallel and integrated by an IMM-based algorithm provide positioning and maneuver predictions to the user. The maneuver states <b>Change</b> <b>Lane</b> (CL) and Keep Lane (KL) are defined by two models that describe different dynamics. Different model sets have been studied {{to meet the needs of}} the IMM-based algorithm.

25|$|Virtually all {{vehicles}} (except many motorcycles {{and commercial}} semi-tractors) have a turn-indicator self-cancelling feature that returns the lever to the neutral (no signal) {{position as the}} steering wheel approaches the straight-ahead position after a turn has been made. Beginning in the late 1960s, indicating for a <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> was facilitated {{by the addition of}} a spring-loaded momentary signal-on position just shy of the left and right detents. The signal operates for however long the driver holds the lever partway towards the left or right turn signal detent. Some recent vehicles have an automatic lane-change indication feature; tapping the lever partway towards the left or right signal position and immediately releasing it causes the applicable turn indicators to flash three to five times.|$|E
25|$|Sequential turn {{signals are}} a feature on some cars wherein the turn-signal {{function}} {{is provided by}} multiple lit elements that illuminate sequentially rather than simultaneously: the innermost lamp lights and remains illuminated, the next outermost lamp lights and remains illuminated, followed by the next outermost lamp and so on until the outermost lamp lights briefly, at which point all lamps extinguish together and, after a short pause, the cycle begins again. The visual effect is one of outward motion {{in the direction of}} the intended turn or <b>lane</b> <b>change.</b> Sequential turn signals have been factory-installed only on cars with red combination stop/turn lamps. They were factory fitted to 1965– through 1971-model Ford Thunderbirds, to 1967–1973 Mercury Cougars, to Shelby Mustangs between 1967 and 1970, to 1969 Imperials, to the Japanese-market 1971–1972 Nissan Cedric, and to Ford Mustangs since 2010.|$|E
25|$|The PIT {{begins when}} the {{pursuing}} vehicle pulls alongside the fleeing vehicle {{so that the}} portion of the pursuer's vehicle forward of the front wheels is aligned with {{the portion of the}} target vehicle behind the back wheels. The pursuer gently makes contact with the target's side, then steers sharply into the target. The pursuer must also accelerate or its bumper will slide off of the target vehicle. As soon as the fleeing vehicle's rear tires lose traction and start to skid, the pursuer continues to turn in the same direction until clear of the target. This is more of a committed <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> than an actual turn. The target will turn in the opposite direction, in front of the pursuer, and will spin out. The PIT may be done from either side, but consideration must be given to where both cars will end up.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{a section}} of highway with narrow paved {{shoulders}} is rumble-stripped, informed cyclists tend to avoid it, but unsuspecting cyclists occasionally have serious accidents. [...] Much bicyclist opposition to rumble strips stems from situations in which no quantitative data was used to justify their installation, or installation was not in accordance with guidelines. Rumble strips on narrow shoulders force cyclists into the travel lanes, where it is less safe to ride. Furthermore, this scenario forces drivers to make an otherwise unnecessary <b>lane</b> <b>change</b> to go around cyclists {{and there is a}} correlation with frequency of lane changes and accidents. [...] "According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 9 percent (533,000) of all accidents occurred when vehicles were changing lanes or merging."
