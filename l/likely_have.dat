5|$|In 2005, astrobiologist Chris McKay {{argued that}} if methanogenic life did {{exist on the}} surface of Titan, it would <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> a {{measurable}} effect on the mixing ratio in the Titan troposphere: levels of hydrogen and acetylene would be measurably lower than otherwise expected.|$|E

50|$|Prior {{to living}} in Volhynia, the Strefling family <b>likely</b> <b>had</b> the surname Striefler and lived in the Saarland Bundesländer (Province) of Germany {{on the border with}} France.

5|$|Agamemnons general {{condition}} in 1802 was so poor that, had hostilities with France not recommenced, she would <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been hulked or broken up. Instead, after Britain's {{entry into the}} Napoleonic Wars, she was brought out of ordinary in 1804, recommissioned under Captain John Harvey on 31 July, and went to join the Channel fleet under Admiral William Cornwallis.|$|E
5|$|Despite Nelson's {{fondness for}} the ship, she was {{frequently}} {{in need of}} repair and refitting, and would <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been hulked or scrapped in 1802 had war with France not recommenced. She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, as part of Nelson's weather column, where she forced the surrender of the Spanish four-decker Santísima Trinidad. Agamemnons later career was served in South American waters off Brazil.|$|E
5|$|During growth, through {{thickening}} {{the tooth}} morphology {{changed so much}} that, had the association of young and adult skeletons on the Dry Island bonebed not proven they belonged to the same taxon, the teeth of juveniles would <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different species.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the process}} that was {{to lead to the}} 1996 Doctor Who film, Universal Television had Amblin Entertainment produce a writers' bible which {{detailed}} John Leekley's proposed pilot and episodes of a new series. The new series would have established a new continuity rather than following on from the classic series, and the bible reused many elements from the classic series. It is unclear whether clearance could have been obtained for all the episodes detailed, as the costs would <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> fallen to the BBC.|$|E
5|$|For {{several days}} in November, a trough was present across the west-central Atlantic Ocean. On November10, three ships {{reported}} a cyclonic circulation northeast of Bermuda, with peak winds of 70mph (110km/h). It was a large system, and would <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been classified a subtropical cyclone in the satellite era. The storm moved northeastward and weakened, degenerating into a trough on November12 before being merging with another system.|$|E
5|$|Grand Duke Vytenis' origins are {{relatively}} well-established; {{he was the}} son of Butvydas, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give Traidenis as the ancestor, this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson Boleslaw-Yuri would have violated canon law, since the two would have been related by blood, and this violation would <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been noticed by the pope.|$|E

5|$|King Edward died in 1553, {{followed}} by the accession of Mary I of England, who opposed the Protestant reformers. Vermigli was placed under house arrest for six months, and his Catholic opponents at Oxford would <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> had him executed, as Cranmer eventually was in 1556. Despite this risk, he agreed to a public disputation with Cranmer against the new Catholic establishment, but this never came to fruition because Cranmer was imprisoned. Vermigli was able to receive permission from the Privy Council to leave England, and was advised by Cranmer to do so.|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{began his}} legal career at {{international}} law firm Jones, Day, Cockley and Reavis in Cleveland, Ohio, {{where he worked}} from 1961 to 1967. He was highly regarded {{at the law firm}} and would most <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been made a partner but later said he had long intended to teach. He became {{a professor of law at}} the University of Virginia in 1967, moving his family to Charlottesville.|$|E
5|$|Seeking a {{union with}} the United States was not a {{referendum}} option, despite the idea having some currency amongst locals. With the Cold War looming, U.S. interest in Newfoundland were centered primarily on its strategic importance to the defence of North America. The Americans' ability to maintain bases on the island satisfied those concerns - after receiving assurances that the Canadian government would honour the leases for bases on Newfoundland, the U.S. State department had no further interest in the political future of Newfoundland. President Harry S. Truman's administration had little incentive to pursue annexation. With respect to foreign policy, such a territorial ambition would have only served to antagonize two key allies. With respect to domestic policy, the administration would not <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been able to convince Congress to offer statehood to Newfoundland due to its small population and geographical isolation from the then-48 existing states, and would not <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been able to convince Newfoundlanders to accept territorial status {{as an alternative to}} admission as a U.S. state.|$|E

5|$|The Banu Nadir began rousing the nomads of Najd. The Nadir {{enlisted the}} Banu Ghatafan by paying them {{half of their}} harvest. This contingent, the second largest, added a {{strength}} of about 2,000 men and 300 horsemen led by Unaina bin Hasan Fazari. The Bani Assad also agreed to join, led by Tuleha Asadi. From the Banu Sulaym, the Nadir secured 700 men, though this force would <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been much larger had not some of its leaders been sympathetic towards Islam. The Bani Amir, who had a pact with Muhammad, refused to join.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} toes, and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
5|$|The later Upanishads, {{numbering}} about 95, {{also called}} minor Upanishads, are dated {{from the late}} 1st-millennium BCE to mid 2nd-millennium CE. Gavin Flood dates many of the twenty Yoga Upanishads to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period. Patrick Olivelle and other scholars date seven of the twenty Sannyasa Upanishads to <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been complete sometime between the last centuries of the 1st-millennium BCE to 300 CE. About half of the Sannyasa Upanishads were likely composed in 14th- to 15th-century CE.|$|E

5|$|With the {{discovery}} and observation of planetary systems around stars {{other than the}} Sun, it is becoming possible to elaborate, revise or even replace this account. The level of metallicity—an astronomical term describing the abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than 2 (helium)—is now thought to determine {{the likelihood that a}} star will have planets. Hence, it is thought that a metal-rich population I star will <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> a more substantial planetary system than a metal-poor, population II star.|$|E
5|$|By the 2000s, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters needed {{upgrades}} to its building {{systems and}} facilities. The company {{spent two years}} deciding whether to renovate its current building or to move to cheaper, more modern space in Center City. In 2006 Rohm and Haas decided {{to stay in the}} current building and spend up to US$25 million on renovations. The building's architecture and layout were the main reason for the company to stay. The building allows single departments to stay together on the same floor, while in a Center City skyscraper departments would <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> to be spread out over several floors.|$|E
5|$|During the English {{winter of}} 1884–85, Peel was {{included}} in the team which toured Australia under the management of Alfred Shaw, Arthur Shrewsbury and James Lillywhite. English teams that toured Australia at this time were not composed exclusively of the best cricketers in England. The 1884–85 English team, like most earlier tours, contained only professional cricketers; less usually, the team contained nine players who, critics judged, would <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been in a full-strength England side. Much of the cricket was overshadowed by off-field clashes with the Australian team that had toured England in 1884; the disputes mainly concerned each team's share of match receipts. Peel was required to bowl a large number of overs; in minor matches, mainly played against the odds (where the opposition teams included more players than the English team), he took 321 wickets at an average of less than five. In first-class matches, he was the leading wicket-taker with 35 wickets, but his average of 19.22 was relatively high.|$|E
