The resulting signal is transferred to time-channel electronics timed by the firing of the high energy light source allowing time discrimination of the signal thereby enabling the light scattered and suppressed by the model to be distinguished from the walls and holders around the apparatus...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} ultra violet (UV) <b>light</b> <b>shielding</b> behaviour of Australian grown bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens). Optical reflectance showed that untreated bamboo plant has UV absorption properties. To reveal {{the origin of}} the UV absorption property, its chemical components were extracted using several polar and non-polar solvents. The extracts in most of the polar and non-polar solvents showed UV absorption property. Protic polar solvents showed better ability to extract UV absorbing chemicals than aprotic and non-polar solvents, except hexane. The chemical components of bamboo were analysed by FT-IR spectroscopy and the findings were correlated with the UV absorbance characteristics. The results confirmed that the UV absorption ability of bamboo originates from nothing but lignin. It is thus indicated that the conventional methods to manufacture bamboo fibres, such as complete degumming or viscose methods, that involve the removal of lignin, cannot retain the unique UV absorption property of bamboo plant in bamboo fibres...|$|E

30|$|The {{metallic}} coating {{process is a}} critical step in nanoprobe fabrication. A thin film of an optically opaque metal such as aluminum, silver, or gold is coated along the outside walls of the tapered optical fiber tip to form an optical light pipe free of defects, which would permit photons {{to escape from the}} tapered sides of the optical fiber. An optical aperture to allow evanescent wave excitation is formed at the tip's apex by angled evaporation. Silver has been used in nanoprobe fabrication [9]. It has high reflectivity in the visible and IR range and very stable in aqueous solutions as long as oxidizing agents or complexing agents are not present. But a silver layer will oxidize rapidly under ordinary atmospheric conditions and will not exhibit a high reflectance below 400 nm. Therefore, it is desirable to use the nanoprobe right after metal evaporation. Otherwise, the <b>light</b> <b>shielding</b> will deteriorate or even the coating will peel off after a few days in air.|$|E

Dose equivalent estimates for the skin, ocular lens, and vital organs for 0. 5 to 20 g/sq cm of aluminum shielding were predicted. For relatively <b>light</b> <b>shielding</b> (less than 2 g/sq cm), the skin and ocular lens 30 -day exposure limits are exceeded within several hours of flare onset.

40|$|Summary of Research {{that was}} part of the grant: NASA NAG 5 - 13405 : Magnetic Characterization of Micro Shutters for James Web Space Telescope (JWST) Period: May 1 2003 -October 31 2005 The above funding {{resulted}} in following major achievements related to microshutter system for JWST. 1. The original rectangular pattern of magnetic material was changed into magnetic striped pattern to prevent unnecessary twisting during the actuation. The Original geometry favored magnetic remanence vector being oriented along the longer side of the shutter and thus resulting torque caused out of plane twist. Stripe pattern minimizes the out of plane motion and thus prolongs the life-time of microshutter device. 2. We built a new magnetic system (magnetic rotisserie) allowing an accelerated life test of microshutters at various temperatures. This system identified that shutter are capable to withstand as many as several millions of actuating cycles. Our system also identified fabrication related features, like bowing with temperature, collisions with the frame due to misalignment, delaminating of the <b>light</b> <b>shields</b> due to uncontrolled voltage release and poorly fabricated <b>light</b> <b>shields...</b>|$|R

40|$|A few {{extremely}} halophilic Archaea (Halobacterium salinarum, Haloquadratum walsbyi, Haloferax mediterranei, Halorubrum vacuolatum, Halogeometricum borinquense, Haloplanus spp.) possess gas vesicles that bestow buoyancy on the cells.

We have extensive information on the properties of gas vesicles in Hbt. salinarum and Hfx. mediterranei and the regulation of their formation. Different functions were suggested for gas vesicle synthesis: buoying cells towards oxygen-rich surface layers in hypersaline water bodies to prevent oxygen limitation, reaching higher light intensities for the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, positioning the cells optimally for light absorption, <b>light</b> <b>shielding,</b> reducing the cytoplasmic volume leading to a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio (for the Archaea) and dispersal of endospores (for the anaerobic spore-forming Bacteria).

There only has been little research on gas vesicles in natural communities of halophilic microorganisms, and the few existing studies failed to provide clear evidence for their possible function.
