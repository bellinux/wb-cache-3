5|$|When Ra.One {{undergoes}} final tests, Akashi notices unusual glitches but {{chooses to}} ignore them. When {{the game is}} officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID Lucifer and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Akashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer will die. He uses a wireless technology (which Jenny had introduced in a conference) to enter the real world, a process which causes the mainframe to malfunction. Akashi informs Shekhar, who partially understands the situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Meanwhile, Ra.One murders Akashi and assumes his appearance; he goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity card. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes it look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> accident.|$|E
25|$|Three wheeled {{motorcycles}} {{without the}} ability to lean have {{no need to be}} countersteered, and an initial steer torque in one direction does not automatically result in a turn in the other direction. This includes sidecar rigs where the car is rigidly mounted on the bike. The three wheeled BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster uses two front wheels which do not lean, and so it steers <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began on}} November 2010, taking place entirely in New York City {{on a budget}} of $85million ($75million after tax rebates). Production {{designer}} Kristi Zea visited several upscale hotels and high-rise residences to research the design elements to incorporate into the opulent surroundings of the tower and Shaw's penthouse. Zea created an amalgamation of the elements she saw during her research to create a sophisticated lobby design for the tower. For Shaw's penthouse, Zea took inspiration from a top-floor apartment in the Trump International Hotel and Tower at Central Park West in Columbus Circle. Zea populated the apartment {{with an assortment of}} art pieces to represent Shaw's status, based on specific artists and works that Ratner suggested. Zea decided to use modern-classic reproduction designs by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Francis Bacon, Cy Twombly, and Andy Warhol. Explaining her decision, Zea said [...] "These days, it seems wealthy people want to have wall power. They want to have art on their walls that means something and shows people, just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>car,</b> that, 'I'm rich, I'm smart and I know what I'm doing.'" ...|$|E

A French journalist long familiar with the continent wrote that [...] "Gabon is an extreme case, verging on caricature, of neocolonialism. Bongo's international relations and affairs were dominated by his, and by extension Gabon's, relations with France, Gabon falling within the ambit of Françafrique. With its oil, {{a fifth of the}} world's known uranium (Gabonese uranium supplied France's nuclear bombs, which French president Charles de Gaulle tested in the Algerian deserts in 1960), big iron and manganese deposits, and plenty of timber, Gabon was always important to France.

2500|$|Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Pearse {{continued}} to work on constructing a tilt-rotor flying-machine for personal use – sometimes described as {{a cross between a}} windmill and a rubbish-cart.

2500|$|Critics {{were not}} as kind, however. A review of Brando's {{performance}} in the opening assessed that Brando was [...] "still building his character, but at present fails to impress." [...] One Boston critic remarked of Brando's prolonged death scene, [...] "Brando looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> in midtown Manhattan searching for a parking space." [...] He received better reviews at subsequent tour stops, but what his colleagues recalled was only occasional indications of the talent he would later demonstrate.

2500|$|Clarity {{can also}} be [...] "enhanced" [...] by filling the {{fracture}} much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> windshield crack can be treated. Such diamonds are sometimes called [...] "fracture filled diamonds". Reputable vendors must disclose this filling and reputable filling companies use filling agents which show a flash of color, commonly orange or pink, when viewed closely. There is a significant price discount for fracture-filled diamonds. The GIA will not grade fracture-filled diamonds, {{in part because the}} treatment is not as permanent as the diamond itself. Reputable companies often provide for repeat treatments if heat causes damage to the filling. The heat required to cause damage is that of a blowtorch used to work on settings, and it is essential to inform anyone working on a setting if the diamond is fracture-filled, so they can apply cooling agents to the diamond and use greater care while working on it.|$|E
2500|$|Two acquaintances of Markhasev, Sara Peters and Michael Chang, {{testified against}} {{him at the}} grand jury. Peters and her boyfriend, Eli Zakaria (who refused to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not {{incriminate}} himself), were with Markhasev {{on the night of}} the murder and were high on cocaine and heroin. She testified they had stopped to use the pay phone at a park-and-ride lot about [...] from where Cosby had pulled over to fix his flat tire. Peters testified that while Zakaria was on the phone, Markhasev walked off without saying where he was going. Within a few minutes, Peters heard a loud noise <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> backfiring, and Markhasev ran back to the car, saying, [...] "Let's go. We've got to get out of here. Let's go." [...] Markhasev refused to tell them what had happened, but they stopped at a wooded area that matched the description of where the murder weapon was later discovered.|$|E

[...] "I was just trying to get down. The play was over. Say 'Uncle'. Do the right thing. Get to second-and-10 and live to play another down. I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was really too bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You screw up the play and I'm trying to do the right thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something. I start to slide and I slide in the worst spot I possibly could—right into Brandon Moore.

50|$|A furnace can be {{lit by a}} small {{pilot flame}} or in some older models, by hand. Most pilot flames {{nowadays}} are lit by an ignition transformer (much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>car's</b> spark plugs). The pilot flame in turn lights up the main flame. The pilot flame uses natural gas while the main flame can use both diesel and natural gas. When using liquid fuels, an atomizer is used, otherwise, the liquid fuel will simply pour onto the furnace floor and become a hazard. Using a pilot flame for lighting the furnace increases safety and ease compared to using a manual ignition method (<b>like</b> <b>a</b> match).|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} {{did have}} a few bumps along the way. The first major problem was finding cars to be used has police cars in the film.

Director Carlo Ausino was then forced to use camera tricks to make them {{seem to be going}} much faster. To help out director Carlo Ausino also took one of the prop cars home to paint in order to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> police <b>car</b> for the film. Someone gave an anonymous tip to the police that a suspicious person was painting <b>a</b> <b>car</b> to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> police <b>car.</b> Because terrorism was high in Italy at the time the police showed up at the director's home wondering what he was doing.|$|R
