5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi <b>lays</b> a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first <b>lays</b> a sticky silk anchor, and then <b>lays</b> out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E

5|$|The queen only <b>lays</b> 10–20 eggs in {{the very}} early stages of the colony, but <b>lays</b> as many as 1,000 a day when the colony is several years old. At maturity, a primary queen has a great {{capacity}} to lay eggs. In some species, the mature queen has a greatly distended abdomen and may produce 40,000 eggs a day. The two mature ovaries may have some 2,000 ovarioles each. The abdomen increases the queen's body length to several times more than before mating and reduces her ability to move freely; attendant workers provide assistance.|$|E

Normani shares the chorus, as she sings on top of the rock cliff, shown earlier in the video. Camila seductively <b>lays</b> down and grabs her hair, in similarity to Ally.

40|$|<b>Lay</b> judges fulfill {{important}} {{functions for}} {{the justice system}} of a country. In the European Union member states, scholars have analysed the use of <b>lay</b> judges in criminal cases. However, {{little is known about}} <b>lay</b> participation in civil justice. The paper introduces commonly cited reasons to have <b>lay</b> judges as well as the principal forms of <b>lay</b> participation and then surveys the EU countries for its implementation in civil cases. Mixed tribunals, involving <b>lay</b> judges under the leadership of a professional judge, are relatively frequent. Several countries have special labour courts or commercial courts with <b>lay</b> members and others have single <b>lay</b> judges, or all-lay judge panels. Roughly a third of the 28 EU member states have no <b>lay</b> participation in civil justice but only three of those have no <b>lay</b> judges in any branch of the courts. Almost all the reasons for including <b>lay</b> decision makers are served somehow by the existing forms, including providing different experiences and perhaps expert knowledge. The article concludes, citing non-EU states and <b>lay</b> participation in criminal and administrative courts as further evidence, that <b>lay</b> judges {{in one form or another}} are an element of European legal systems...|$|R
