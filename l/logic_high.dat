5000|$|The {{structure}} of the figures themselves can be directly translated into binary numbers, such as those used by modern computers, with passive lines representing the numeral 0 (or logic low) and active lines representing the numeral 1 (or <b>logic</b> <b>high).</b> This structure is exploited in computation of more figures {{by means of the}} XOR function used widely in computer science and electrical systems; when two figures are [...] "added" [...] to form a new figure (where points in the lines of the same elements are summed, divided by two, and the remainder taken), the logical operation obtains the new figure by determining which lines are different. The lines that have different numbers of points results in a line with one point (<b>logic</b> <b>high),</b> and lines with the same number of points results in a line with two points (logic low). The result of adding two figures is usually interpreted to mean the interaction between the two parties (the parent figures) or the present situation (when one parent represents the past and the other parent represents the future).|$|E
50|$|Whether or not {{a circuit}} {{experiences}} a soft error depends on {{the energy of the}} incoming particle, the geometry of the impact, the location of the strike, and the design of the logic circuit. <b>Logic</b> circuits with <b>higher</b> capacitance and <b>higher</b> <b>logic</b> voltages are less likely to suffer an error. This combination of capacitance and voltage is described by the critical charge parameter, Qcrit, the minimum electron charge disturbance needed to change the <b>logic</b> level. A <b>higher</b> Qcrit means fewer soft errors. Unfortunately, a higher Qcrit also means a slower logic gate and a higher power dissipation. Reduction in chip feature size and supply voltage, desirable for many reasons, decreases Qcrit. Thus, the importance of soft errors increases as chip technology advances.|$|R

50|$|Another {{improvement}} to many flash ADCs is {{the inclusion}} of digital error correction. When the ADC is used in harsh environments or constructed from very small integrated circuit processes, there is a heightened risk that a single comparator will randomly change state resulting in a wrong code. Bubble error correction is a digital correction mechanism that prevents a comparator that has, for example, tripped high from reporting <b>logic</b> <b>high</b> if it is surrounded by comparators that are reporting logic low.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} signals {{were generated}} by an FPGA, {{which was the}} master for the communication with a DS2432 (EEPROM) chip, and measured with a logic analyzer. A <b>logic</b> <b>high</b> on the 1-wire output, means {{the output of the}} FPGA is in tri-state mode and the 1-wire device can pull the bus low. A low means the FPGA pulls down the bus. The 1-wire input is the measured bus signal. On input sample time high, the FPGA samples the input for detecting the device response and receiving bits.|$|E
50|$|On {{the basis}} of outputs, {{comparators}} can also be classified as open drain or push-pull. Comparators with an open-drain output stage use an external pull up resistor to a positive supply that defines the <b>logic</b> <b>high</b> level.

50|$|The {{heart of}} an I2L circuit {{is the common}} emitter open {{collector}} inverter. Typically, an inverter consists of an NPN transistor with the emitter connected to ground and the base biased with a forward current. The input is supplied to the base as either a current sink (low logic level) or as a high-z floating condition (<b>high</b> <b>logic</b> level). The output of an inverter is at the collector.

50|$|In digital circuits, the {{contamination}} delay (denoted as tcd) is the {{minimum amount of}} time from when an input changes until any output starts to change its value. This change in value {{does not imply that}} the value has reached a stable condition. The contamination delay only specifies that the output rises (or falls) to 50% of the voltage level for a <b>logic</b> <b>high.</b> The circuit is guaranteed not to show any output change in response to an input change before tcd time units (calculated for the whole circuit) have passed. The determination of {{the contamination}} delay of a combined circuit requires identifying the shortest path of contamination delays from input to output and by adding each tcd time along this path.|$|E
50|$|In {{synchronous}} counters, {{the clock}} inputs {{of all the}} flip-flops are connected together and are triggered by the input pulses. Thus, all the flip-flops change state simultaneously (in parallel). The circuit below is a 4-bit synchronous counter. The J and K inputs of FF0 are connected to HIGH. FF1 has its J and K inputs connected to the output of FF0, and the J and K inputs of FF2 {{are connected to the}} output of an AND gate that is fed by the outputs of FF0 and FF1.A simple way of implementing the logic for each bit of an ascending counter (which is what is depicted in the adjacent image) is for each bit to toggle when all of the less significant bits are at a <b>logic</b> <b>high</b> state. For example, bit 1 toggles when bit 0 is logic high; bit 2 toggles when both bit 1 and bit 0 are logic high; bit 3 toggles when bit 2, bit 1 and bit 0 are all high; and so on.|$|E
5000|$|More complex {{analysis}} than fan-in and fan-out {{is required}} when two different logic families are interconnected. Fan-out is ultimately {{determined by the}} maximum source and sink currents of an output and the maximum source and sink currents of the connected inputs; the driving device {{must be able to}} supply or sink at its output the sum of the currents needed or provided (depending on whether the output is a <b>logic</b> <b>high</b> or low voltage level) by all of the connected inputs, while maintaining the output voltage specifications. For each logic family, typically a [...] "standard" [...] input is defined by the manufacturer with maximum input currents at each logic level, and the fan-out for an output is computed as the number of these standard inputs that can be driven in the worst case. (Therefore, it is possible that an output can actually drive more inputs than specified by fan-out, even of devices within the same family, if the particular devices being driven sink and/or source less current, as reported on their data sheets, than a [...] "standard" [...] device of that family.) Ultimately, whether a device has the fan-out capability to drive (with guaranteed reliability) a set of inputs is determined by adding up all the input-low (max.) source currents specified on the datasheets of the driven devices, adding up all the input-high (max.) sink currents of those same devices, and comparing those sums to the driving device's guaranteed maximum output-low sink current and output-high source current specifications, respectively. If both totals are within the driving device's limits, then it has the DC fan-out capacity to drive those inputs on those devices as a group, and otherwise it doesn't, regardless of the manufacturer's given fan-out number. However, for any reputable manufacturer, if this current analysis reveals that the device cannot drive the inputs, the fan-out number will agree.|$|E
