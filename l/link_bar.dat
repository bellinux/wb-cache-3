50|$|For {{vehicles}} with {{leaf spring suspension}} such as pickup trucks, the leaf spring is sometimes eliminated and replaced with a multiple-bar linkage. These bars are typically in a trailing arm configuration and the air spring may be situated vertically between a <b>link</b> <b>bar</b> or the axle housing and a point on the vehicle's frame. In other cases, the air bag is situated {{on the opposite side}} of the axle from the main link bars on an additional cantilever member. If the main linkage bars are oriented parallel to the longitudinal (driving) axis of the car, the axle housing may be constrained laterally with either a Panhard rod or Watt's linkage. In some cases, two of the link bars may be combined into a triangular shape which effectively constrains the vehicles axle laterally.|$|E

30|$|In {{previous}} type LTCC supports, {{the front}} <b>link</b> <b>bar</b> was the double <b>link</b> <b>bar,</b> and the rear <b>link</b> <b>bar</b> {{was the single}} <b>link</b> <b>bar.</b> The rear bar was fixed {{in the middle of}} the support base, which resulted in blocking the operator’s sight and difficulty in observing the effects of top coal caving and discharge.|$|E
30|$|There was no {{passage from}} the front {{to the rear of}} the support.

30|$|The working {{principle}} of the beam pumping units is as follow: firstly, the motor converts the electrical energy into the rotational motion. Secondly, after twice reduction by the gearbox and the four-bar linkage, the rotary motion transforms into a linear reciprocating motion. At last, by the horse head, the beam hanger and the polished rod, the sucker rod drives the deep oil well pump. The core component of the beam pumping units is the four-bar linkage that is composed of the crank, the <b>link</b> <b>bar,</b> the rear arm, the connection line between the gearbox shaft and the shaft of the support. The four-bar linkage has the function that transforms the rotary motion of the gearbox into the reciprocating motion required to operate the downhole pump. The geometric parameters of the four-bar linkage have extremely important impact to the contour size and the working performance of the beam pumping units.|$|E

25|$|The main {{suspension}} cables {{in older}} bridges were often made from chain or <b>linked</b> <b>bars,</b> but modern bridge cables {{are made from}} multiple strands of wire. This not only adds strength but improves reliability (often called redundancy in engineering terms) because {{the failure of a}} few flawed strands in the hundreds used pose very little threat of failure, whereas a single bad link or eyebar can cause failure of an entire bridge. (The failure of a single eyebar was found to be the cause of the collapse of the Silver Bridge over the Ohio River.) Another reason is that as spans increased, engineers were unable to lift larger chains into position, whereas wire strand cables can be formulated one by one in mid-air from a temporary walkway.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is twofold: to present {{mathematical}} expressions for the kinematics of an articulated mechanism and to perform numerical experiments with the implemented code. The system of rigid parts is made of two slender bars and a disk. In the original configuration, a constant counterclockwise rotation rate is imposed on the disk. In the modified version, this angular velocity varies linearly with the rotation angle to produce an average rate that is nearly {{the same as the}} constant case. Angles, velocities and accelerations are analyzed for a 90 -degree turn of the disk. The numerical solutions show the inversion of the <b>linking</b> <b>bar</b> sense of rotation along with the start of deceleration for both bars. The paper and pencil solution of the original problem that may lead to a wrong conclusion is explained. Equations are derived from first principles and the code is placed under version control.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} understanding the mechanical behavior of particulate/granular media using the power of lattice based techniques. In the lattice type model, a particulate assembly is simulated as a lattice/truss network. Nodes are relocated at contacts between a particle and its neighbors/boundaries and are <b>linked</b> by <b>bars</b> to each other. Each particle {{is replaced by a}} lattice within its microstructure and particles interact through load transfer at nodes. Constraints are prescribed at the nodes of the lattice to simulate active, deactivated, and reactivated contacts. An assembly of particles is thus transformed into a lattice/truss and is analyzed using standard methods of structural mechanics under appropriate boundary conditions. When a particulate assembly develops into a mechanism (deformation with zero incremental load), further deformation is simulated through a framework that describes the kinematics of the particles (sliding, rolling, and rotation of particles). This framework is formed by introducing nodes at the particle centroids and <b>linking</b> them with <b>bars.</b> <b>Bars</b> <b>linking</b> particles with a non-sliding contact are assigned large stiffnesses relative to <b>bars</b> <b>linking</b> particles with a sliding contact. Numerical tests are conducted on two dimensional assemblies of disks, arranged as very loose and very dense packings under simple shear loading conditions. The results concord with the results of numerical tests conducted using the discrete element method at low strain levels and with photoelastic experiments up to large shear strain levels. The model is applied to study the effects of initial imperfections caused by particles with low elastic modulus. A dense assembly of disks, with 25 % of the particles having an elastic modulus 1 / 100 th of the elastic modulus of the remaining particles, resulted in a decrease of 67 % for the shear modulus of the whole assembly. The lattice type model is conceptually simple but has some powerful features that can account for initial particle imperfections, anisotropy, and particle crushing...|$|R

40|$|A new {{computerised}} dimensional synthesis {{method is}} described in the paper. To synthesis of a four bar mechanism, knowledge of function, path, motion generation method is required.
