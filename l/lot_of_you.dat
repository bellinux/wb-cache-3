Jennings moderated the final debate among the Democratic presidential candidates in March, and anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: Who Is Ross Perot? and a subsequent 90-minute town forum with Perot and a studio audience in June. On September 9, 1992, ABC {{announced that it}} would be switching the format of its political coverage to give less recognition to staged sound bites. [...] "We're aware that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> are turned off by the political process and that many of you put {{at least some of the}} blame on us," [...] Jennings told viewers on World News Tonight. [...] "We'll only devote time to a candidate's daily routine if it is more than routine. There will be less attention to staged appearances and sound bites designed exclusively for television." [...] After Bill Clinton was elected as president in November 1992, Jennings featured the new administration in two of his specials for children; he anchored President Clinton: Answering Children's Questions in February 1993; and Kids in the Crossfire: Violence in America in November 1993, a live special from a Washington, D.C. junior high school which featured Attorney General Janet Reno and rapper MC Lyte.|$|E

Brian decided to leave the band in July, so we've {{had plenty of time to}} let the initial shock die down. We're aware that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> already knew, so we apologize for not announcing this sooner. There were many reasons. He thought long and hard about his decision, and he came to the conclusion that he would like to do other things than play bass for the band. We respect him for it. We'd be lying to say that we're not all completely bummed that Brian won't be a part of Relient K anymore. And though we know things won't be the same without him, it must be said that we have always valued our friendships with him more than our on-stage relationship.|$|E
