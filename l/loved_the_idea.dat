It would appear as a segment of Mighty Mouse Playhouse on the network's 1966–67 Saturday morning schedule; the series was renamed Mighty Mouse and the Mighty Heroes in recognition of the new segment.|$|E
25|$|The Wuppertal Suspension Railway had a forerunner: in 1824, Henry Robinson Palmer of England {{presented}} a railway system which differed from all previous constructions. It {{was a low}} single-rail suspension railway on which the carriages were drawn by horses. Friedrich Harkort, a Prussian industrial entrepreneur and politician, <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> He saw big advantages for the transportation of coal to the early industrialised region {{in and around the}} Wupper valley. Harkort had his own steel mill in Elberfeld; he built a demonstration segment of the Palmer system and set it up in 1826 on the grounds of what is today the Wuppertal tax office. He tried to attract public attention to his railway plans.|$|E

She and several friends, including Ellen Gates Starr, traveled in Europe from December 1887 through {{the summer of}} 1888. After watching a bullfight in Madrid, fascinated by what she saw as an exotic tradition, Addams condemned this fascination and her inability to feel outraged at {{the suffering of the}} horses and bulls. At first, Addams told no one about her dream to start a settlement house; but, she felt increasingly guilty for not acting on her dream. Believing that sharing her dream might help her to act on it, she told Ellen Gates Starr. Starr <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> and agreed to join Addams in starting a settlement house.|$|E

Martens previously directed for the Marvel Netflix series Luke Cage. [...] "Uprising" [...] {{is part of the}} first [...] "pod" [...] of eight episodes for the season, subtitled Ghost Rider. When the series' writers were first breaking the story for the episode, Lilla Zuckerman suggested that a blackout would be a perfect opportunity for Ghost Rider to break into a prison and murder criminals. The other writers <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> but the situation did not fit into the episode. The idea later became the basis for the episode [...] "Lockup".|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} episode came when the writers were helping break the story for the episode [...] "Uprising", which includes large-scale blackouts. Lilla said that a blackout would be a perfect opportunity for Ghost Rider to break into a prison and murder criminals. The series' writers room all <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of seeing Ghost Rider walking through a prison as all the inmates run back into their cells, but the situation did not fit into the episode. Several weeks later, when the room began discussing the fifth episode of the season, they had established that Ghost Rider's uncle Eli Morrow was in prison and from there {{decided to use the}} Ghost Rider prison break {{as the basis for the}} new episode.|$|E

Sam Neill was ultimately cast as Grant {{three or four weeks}} before filming began. Neill said that [...] "it all happened real quick. I hadn't read the book, knew nothing about it, hadn't heard anything about it, and {{in a matter of weeks}} I'm working with Spielberg." [...] Janet Hirshenson, the film's casting director, felt that Jeff Goldblum would be the right choice to play Ian Malcolm after reading the novel. Jim Carrey also auditioned for the role. According to Hirshenson, Carrey [...] "was terrific, too, but I think pretty quickly we all <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Jeff." ...|$|E
500|$|Millar and Gough <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{of casting}} John Schneider as Jonathan Kent, as they felt {{he gave the}} show a {{recognizable}} face from his days as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard. Gough felt that Schneider's experience portraying Bo Duke added belief {{that he could have}} grown up running a farm. Schneider was initially uninterested, but after reading the pilot script he saw the potential for bringing back [...] "real parenting" [...] to television. Schneider particularly saw his character as a means to replace the [...] "goof" [...] father-figures that had become prevalent on television. He also saw his character as a means to keep the show grounded in reality, specifically by making sure that Jonathan's life is clearly displayed for the audience, by performing a daily routine on the farm.|$|E

500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Devil and Homer Simpson", {{was written}} by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks {{the same as the}} devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney {{produced}} film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Flanders being the Devil because he is the one you would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer {{did a good job of}} playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular", which aired in the show's seventh season.|$|E

500|$|Becky {{became the}} 50th barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn in June 2008. Kelly opined that the character's ex-con {{personality}} {{would give her}} an advantage behind the bar, explaining: [...] "The previous producer, Steve Frost, <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a barmaid who could lose her temper and throw a punch. Becky's an ex-con so she can fight dirty like nobody else." [...] The character's chain smoking tendencies often play out onscreen when she is experiencing stress, something which drew off-screen criticism for her disregard of littering the streets with her cigarette butts. ITV publicity has described Becky as having many different levels to her persona, stating that she loves drinking cider, and that she isn't bothered by how she looks—though when she dresses up she [...] "dresses to the nines" [...] with big earrings, gold rings, logo belts and hair pieces. She dislikes anyone ordering her about, as she cannot handle being told what to do.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "New Rules" [...] was {{directed}} by Henry Scholfield, who also shot Lipa's previous visual, [...] "Lost in Your Light". The singer invited Scholfield {{for a cup of}} tea in London in order to discuss her ideas for the clip. Lipa had saved a picture of model Naomi Campbell holding another woman in her back during a campaign in the 1980s as a [...] "reference point", explaining that, [...] "I <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of girls looking after each other like that, holding each other, that sense of humility, that sense of strength." [...] Lipa also had the idea of including a group of flamingos into the clip, as she considered them a good representation of female friendship. The director contacted Teresa Barcelo to choreograph the dance routine and bring that [...] "narrative of togetherness and empowerment" [...] into it.

500|$|Alex's {{friendships with}} her fellow {{trainees}} also form {{the crux of}} the character as well as the series, especially her friendship with her roommate and best friend Shelby. Johanna Braddy, who plays Shelby, told TV Guide that Shelby's friendship with Alex {{is a big part of}} Quantico. Safran talked to Entertainment Weekly that the idea for their friendship came from the similarity between the characters. He said [...] "So for Alex and Shelby, you know, as roommates and as friends, we just really <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of these two people from two different parts of the world, all these things that don't touch upon each other, but they actually at their core are both very driven, successful, smart, and kind humans that find each other." [...] One of the other characters Alex is very close to, other than Shelby, was Simon, who is killed in the finale.

The episode was originally {{going to be about}} [...] "weight loss" [...] and be one of the very first episodes of the second season aired. However, after [...] "The Dundies" [...] and [...] "The Fire", series creator and developer Greg Daniels decided to hold the episode off and combine it with elements of [...] "The Client". When [...] "Performance Review" [...] was being formulated, Wilmore had [...] "four different ideas that were scrunched together to make an episode". One of the ideas was on a card that said [...] "Thursday Friday". After inquiring about the meaning, Wilmore <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> and noted that it [...] "would be great" [...] in the episode and a [...] "real funny thing to pull on Dwight". Originally, the episode contained a subplot wherein Pam attempts to get a new chair approved by Michael. The scenes, in fact, were shot, but were never aired.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{helped to}} solidify the {{different}} personalities of The Lone Gunmen. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz explained, [...] "Up , they {{were sort of}} interchangeable in the information they delivered. But then Vince, who loved the characters and really wanted a chance to dig more deeply into them, created a back story and they became a lot more interesting." [...] Actor Dean Haglund, who played Langly, said of the episode, [...] "What we read in the script wasn't really our origins as we'd imagined it. I'd thought we were all in a university garage band together or something. Bruce [...] thought he was a photocopier repair man." [...] Much of the episode's action focused on Byers, played by Bruce Harwood. This experience was different for him, and he noted, [...] "I don't think I'd ever done an episode where I was the lead character. But I felt like the lead because it was my story about falling in love with this woman and then dragging these other two schmucks into the disaster that followed." [...] Vince Gilligan was particularly happy with his characterization of Byers, later admitting, [...] "I just <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Byers working for the government and being this very gung-ho pro-government guy.
