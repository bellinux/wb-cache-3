5|$|Oakwood was {{designed}} by John C.

The plan consisted of roads, man-made lakes, dense vegetation, and rolling hills, covering about , including the modern sections A through Q. Sidney also designed the original superintendent's house and receiving tomb, neither of which exist today. For all Sidney's extensive planning, the first plots were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> seemingly haphazard manner by the first superintendent, Robert Fergusson.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{defensive}} formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, and the Peach Orchard. On the Union right, Confederate demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill. All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the grounds}} were donated to the local parish after Beckford's death and consecrated as a {{cemetery}} in 1848.

5|$|The Royal Crescent is {{a row of}} 30 terraced houses <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{sweeping}} crescent in {{the city}} of Bath, England. Designed by the architect John Wood, the Younger and built between 1767 and 1774, it is among the greatest examples of Georgian architecture {{to be found in the}} United Kingdom and is a Grade I listed building. Although some changes have been made to the various interiors over the years, the Georgian stone façade remains much as it was when it was first built.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, a large plot of {{land was}} sold to Edmund Nuttall & Co. for the {{construction}} of 1,200houses. The houses were never built, but the land later became the site of Trafford Park Village, known locally as The Village. The announced arrival of the Westinghouse factory acted a spur to development, and in 1899, Trafford Park Dwellings Ltd was formed, with the aim of providing housing for the anticipated influx of new workers. Nuttall's land was acquired, and by 1903 more than 500 houses had been built, rising to over 700 when the development was completed in 1904. In 1907 it was estimated that the population of the Village was 3,060. The development was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> grid pattern, with the roads numbered instead of being named. Avenues numbered 1 to 4 run north–south, streets numbered 1 to 12 run east–west.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, {{the archaeologists}} {{returned}} {{to search for}} the settlement that they believed was associated with the graves. There are examples elsewhere, such as at Garton Green Lane Crossing in the Yorkshire Wolds, of 7th-century graves associated with prehistoric monuments, and it was initially thought that the Street House graves were a similar example. However, the excavation uncovered another twelve graves. It was realised that the cemetery was far larger than first thought, so the following year an archaeological survey of the entire site was attempted. A total of 109 graves was found {{by the end of the}} 2007 dig, forming a complex monument <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> unique square fashion around a central mound, a bed burial and a building that had possibly served as a mortuary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of Bethlehem is its old city. The old city {{consists}} of eight quarters, <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mosaic style, forming {{the area around the}} Manger Square. The quarters include the Christian an-Najajreh, al-Farahiyeh, al-Anatreh, al-Tarajmeh, al-Qawawsa and Hreizat quarters and al-Fawaghreh — the only Muslim quarter. Most of the Christian quarters are named after the Arab Ghassanid clans that settled there. Al-Qawawsa Quarter was formed by Arab Christian emigrants from the nearby town of Tuqu' in the 18th century. There is also a Syriac quarter outside of the old city, whose inhabitants originate from Midyat and Ma'asarte in Turkey. The total population of the old city is about 5,000.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{structures}} upon the basal platform underwent two consecutive construction phases during the Early Classic, except Temple 22 which underwent three phases of construction. The structures upon the basal platform all date to the Early Classic period and were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> symmetrical arrangement {{over the course of}} three centuries. This forms the greatest concentration of pure Early Classic architecture at Tikal, using construction methods distinct from that of the major Late Classic temples around the Great Plaza. The Early Classic construction involved the complete finishing of the basal platform as a distinct architectural unit before the additional structures were built upon it.|$|E

5|$|On April 23, 2008, amid {{complaints}} {{directed toward}} CIA president Tim Ryan, the school's teachers' union approved {{a vote of}} no confidence, with a vote of 85 to 9. The faculty described poor equipment, falling academic standards, and little support in the administration for complaints as causes. The largest complaints, <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> thirteen-item list, included outdated technology, poorly-designed uniforms, poor-quality classes and dining hall meals, excessive tuition, students admitted with no chance of succeeding, substandard school-brand kitchen equipment, overcrowded classes and residence halls, complicated schedules, and poor record-keeping. The document described President Ryan as taking an autocratic style, ignoring staff input, and retaliating against criticism. Ryan later met with union representatives and described coming improvements in scheduling and curriculum. Immediately after the faculty's vote of no confidence, {{the board of trustees}} unanimously voted to their confidence and support of Ryan and extended his contract.|$|E
5|$|Post WWII {{the large}} number of GI's returning, President John A. Hannah's push to expand {{resulting}} in a large increase in enrollment quickened in the pace of development south of the river. The driving factor in campus development of was the automobile this the south featuring buildings and streets generally <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> grid system with more land dedicated to parking lots. This growth resulted in the largest residence hall system in the United States. 16,000 students live in MSU's 23 undergraduate halls, one graduate hall, and three apartment villages. Though MSU has not built a new resident hall since 1967, it has modernized several of its dormitories. In 2007, MSU opened the Residential College in Arts & Humanities in a newly renovated Snyder-Phillips Hall, the location of MSU's first residential college, Justin Morrill College.|$|E

5|$|Downtown Flagstaff lies {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} Mars Hill, the location of Lowell Observatory. Streets in the downtown area are <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> grid pattern, parallel to Route 66 and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Rail Line, running east–west through the city. Milton Road branches off from Route 66 west of downtown, and travels south, adjacent to the Northern Arizona University campus, to the junction of Interstate 17 and Interstate 40. Milton Road becomes I-17. A road called Beulah Boulevard, which also runs south, becomes State Route 89A, and travels through Oak Creek Canyon to Sedona. Traveling north from downtown, Fort Valley Road (U.S. 180) connects with the Museum of Northern Arizona, Arizona Snowbowl, and Grand Canyon National Park. Traveling east from downtown, Route 66 and the railroad run in parallel toward East Flagstaff (and beyond), at the base of Mount Elden. Much of Flagstaff's industry is located east of downtown, adjacent to the railroad tracks, as well as in East Flagstaff.|$|E
5|$|Penn sent three commissioners to {{supervise}} the settlement and to set aside 10,000 acres (40km²) for the city. The commissioners bought land from Swedes at the settlement of Wicaco, and from there began {{to lay out the}} city toward the north. The area went about a mile along the Delaware River between modern South and Vine Streets. Penn's ship anchored off the coast of New Castle, Delaware, on October 27, 1682, and he arrived in Philadelphia a few days after that. He expanded the city west to the bank of the Schuylkill River, for a total of 1,200 acres (4.8km²). Streets were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gridiron system. Except for the two widest streets, High (now Market) and Broad, the streets were named after prominent landowners who owned adjacent lots. The streets were renamed in 1684; the ones running east-west were named after local trees (Vine, Sassafras, Mulberry, Cherry, Chestnut, Walnut, Locust, Spruce, Pine, Lombard, and Cedar) and the north-south streets were numbered. Within the area, four squares (now named Rittenhouse, Logan, Washington and Franklin) were set aside as parks open for everyone. Penn designed a central square at the intersection of Broad and what is now Market Street to be surrounded by public buildings.|$|E
5|$|The square {{was laid}} out {{to the south of}} Leicester House and {{developed}} in the 1670s. The area was originally entirely residential, with properties <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar style to nearby Pall Mall. In 1687, {{the northern part of the}} square became part of the new parish of St Anne, Soho. The Jocelyn Sidney, 7th Earl of Leicester took ownership of the property in 1728 and it was briefly the residence of Frederick, Prince of Wales from 1742 until Leicester's death the following year. The poet Matthew Prior lived at what is now No.21 around 1700 and artist William Hogarth resided at No30 between 1733 and 1764, where he produced some of his best known works including Gin Lane. The magistrate Thomas de Veil, later to found Bow Street Magistrates' Court, lived at No40 between 1729 and 1737; this location is now the Odeon West End. The painter Joshua Reynolds lived at No47 from 1760 until his death in 1792; this location is now Fanum House, once the Automobile Association head office.|$|E
