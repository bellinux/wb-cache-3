She was decommissioned on 27 March 1947 {{to enter the}} Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk, Virginia, and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1962. After being stricken, approximately 5,000 tons of equipment were stripped from Massachusetts for use on other naval vessels, including both of the explosively driven catapults used to launch float planes.|$|E

5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to {{challenge}} {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 men had been <b>left</b> <b>there</b> by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged from the camp but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.|$|E
5|$|About {{two months}} into the siege of the Peñol de Cerquín, the {{majority}} of Spanish soldiers in Honduras were concentrated around the fortress. Small groups were scattered elsewhere, and both Gracias a Dios and Santa María de Comayagua were dangerously vulnerable, with almost no soldiers <b>left</b> <b>there.</b> Seeing {{the vulnerability of the}} Spanish positions across the greater province, Lempira declared a general uprising. The whole region south of the Peñol rose up, as well as neighbouring parts of El Salvador around San Salvador and San Miguel, where they caused serious damage to the Spanish. The Comayagaua Valley joined the revolt, as did the mountain regions around San Pedro, and outlying areas around Trujillo.|$|E

5|$|After Isaacs <b>left,</b> <b>there</b> was {{a period}} of {{managerial}} instability, with three chief executives in three years. Isaacs's successor, Genista McIntosh, resigned in May 1997 after five months, citing ill-health. Her post was filled by Mary Allen, who moved into the job from the Arts Council. Allen's selection did not comply with the Council's rules for such appointments, and following a critical House of Commons Select Committee report on the management of the opera house she resigned in March 1998, as did the entire board of the opera house, including the chairman, Lord Chadlington. A new board appointed Michael Kaiser as general director in September 1998. He oversaw the restoration of the two companies' finances and the re-opening of the opera house. He was widely regarded as a success, and there was some surprise when he left in June 2000 after less than two years to run the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Carleton ordered {{most of the}} British army to sail upriver toward Sorel on June 9, {{but they}} did not {{actually}} leave until he joined them on June 13. A detachment of 1200 men under Fraser marched up the northern shore toward Berthier and Montreal. The British fleet arrived at Sorel late on the 14th; the Americans had <b>left</b> <b>there</b> just that morning. Elements of the British army entered Montreal on June 17, and also arrived at Fort Saint-Jean {{in time to see the}} last Americans (the very last one reported to be Benedict Arnold) push away from its burning remnants.|$|E
5|$|Montagu, having {{delivered}} the Scottish embassy to Newcastle, <b>left</b> <b>there</b> on 14 May, either with Lords Greystoke and Willoughby or picking them up en route with other supporters, {{to seek out}} the Lancastrians. The next day, at Hexham- having crossed the Tyne 'either at Bulwell or Corbridge'- he attacked the rebels in their camp which was {{on the south side of}} Devil's Water river. Montagu, his army swelled with new recruits from Newcastle, and men raised by Montagu's brother, the Archbishop of York, may have had up to 10,000 men. Leading his army 'forward at the charge,' Montagu's attack soon became a rout, with the Lancastrian army dissolving and attempting escape over the bridge. Lords Roos, Hungerford, Findern, and Tallboys survived the battle only to be executed, on Montagu's order- and probably in his presence- with the Duke of Somerset in Newcastle. Following Hexham, Montagu ordered the largest number of beheadings the civil wars had yet seen.|$|E

5|$|Only just {{escaping}} capture, Blücher {{crossed the}} forest of Vertus and took up positions at Étoges with Prince Urusov's division, which had been <b>left</b> <b>there</b> in reserve. Russian General Udom, with 1,800 men and 15 cannon, was instructed to cover the position, by occupying the park at Étoges. Udom's men were exhausted after the long retreat and fighting and, seeing that night had fallen, thought themselves in safety. However, Doumerc's cuirassiers, formed unseen in the night, surprised these men and a single charge was enough to send the panicked men fleeing. Prince Urusov, 600 men and eight artillery pieces were captured during this action, with the French sailors' regiment from Lagrange's division subsequently entering the village of Étoges. Blücher abandoned this position too and made a hasty retreat towards Vertus and Bergères. He then opted for a speedy night march {{and the next day}} he managed to bring his remaining men to Châlons, where he was joined by Yorck's and Sacken's corps.|$|E
5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and molding throughout the house.

The woodwork in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the chair rail. The east rear room is divided in two, with one of the divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs rooms have molded chair rails and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|E
5|$|Earp was {{a lifelong}} gambler {{and was always}} looking for a quick way to make money. After leaving Tombstone, Earp went to San Francisco, where he reunited with Josephine Earp. She became his common-law wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining {{interests}} and a saloon. They <b>left</b> <b>there</b> to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons–Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many to believe that he fixed the fight. They moved briefly to Yuma, Arizona, before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. In partnership with Charlie Hoxie, they opened a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $80,000 (about $2 million in 2017 dollars). Returning to the lower 48, they opened another saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles. Earp made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood and tried to get his story told. He was portrayed in film only once before he died, and very briefly, in the 1923 film Wild Bill Hickok.|$|E
