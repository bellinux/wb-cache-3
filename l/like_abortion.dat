The state was originally {{thought to be a}} swing state in 2008 for a number of reasons. New Hampshire is considerably more fiscally conservative than its neighbors in New England and has a strong disdain for taxes, giving the Republicans an edge in the state. However, like the rest of New England, it is considerably more liberal on social issues <b>like</b> <b>abortion</b> and gay rights, which helps the Democrats. Also, McCain was very popular among Republicans {{based on the fact that}} he won both the 2000 and 2008 primaries here. In 2008, Obama lost the primary to Hillary Clinton.

25|$|In England, senior Church {{appointments}} are Crown appointments; the Church {{carries out}} state {{functions such as}} coronations; Anglican representatives have an automatic role on Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education; and 26 diocesan bishops have seats in the House of Lords, where they are known as the Lords Spiritual {{as opposed to the}} lay Lords Temporal. The Lords Spiritual have a significant influence when they vote as a bloc on certain issues, notably moral issues <b>like</b> <b>abortion</b> and euthanasia (where their views differ from the majority of the population). A of state-funded schools in England are religious school, too, and most are controlled by the Church of England, with significant numbers of state-funded Catholic, Muslim, and Jewish schools as well. The Anglican Church also has specific legal rights and responsibilities in solemnised marriages that are different from other faith organisations. Non-religious couples can have a civil wedding with no religious elements, but non-religious humanist weddings are not yet legally recognised in their own right. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all schools, but parents can remove their children from these lessons, and sixth formers have the right to opt out.|$|E

Three years later, Robb was the only senator from a Southern state to oppose the Defense of Marriage Act. In stating his opposition to the bill, which his friends and supporters urged him to support, he said the following, [...] "I feel very strongly that this legislation is wrong. Despite its name, the Defense of Marriage Act does not defend marriage against some imminent, crippling effect. Although we have made huge strides in the struggle against discrimination based on gender, race, and religion, it is more difficult to see beyond our differences regarding sexual orientation. The fact that our hearts don't speak in the same way is not cause or justification to discriminate." [...] Some have speculated that his position on gay rights, along with his positions on other hot-button issues <b>like</b> <b>abortion,</b> alienated the generally conservative voters of Virginia and contributed to his eventual defeat.|$|E
