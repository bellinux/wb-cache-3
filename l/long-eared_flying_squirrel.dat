50|$|The <b>long-eared</b> <b>flying</b> mouse (Idiurus macrotis), or <b>long-eared</b> scaly-tailed <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel,</b> is {{a species}} of flying mouse from western and central Africa. It is not {{actually}} a :squirrel, nor a :mouse, {{though it is a}} rodent. Not much is known about them because they are very hard to keep alive in captivity.|$|R
5000|$|To achieve gliding flight, it uses two {{membranes}} (patagia) which fold up {{when not}} in use. When the limbs are stretched wide in a star-shape, the membranes become taut and allow the rodent to glide from tree to tree. Being arboreal, Idiurus spends all of its time in the trees, living in hollow trunks in groups of 2 to 40. Limit information {{suggests that it is}} mainly frugivorous. [...] It has a long tail in proportion to its body, sporting two lines of raised scales, and patches of scaly skin to help it grip trees, but the rest of its body is furry. The tail is longer than the body and is also used to balance, like a primate's tail. <b>Long-eared</b> scaly-tailed <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> are about 20 cm long and weigh 30g. In comparison, the body of a common household mouse is approximately 10 cm long and its tail is approximately 5 cm.|$|R

Northern <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels,</b> Glaucomys sabrinus are larger and have belly hair that is dark at the base and white at the tip.

50|$|Humboldt's <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> (Glaucomys oregonensis) is one {{of three}} species of the genus Glaucomys, the only <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> found in North America. Using genetic analyses, Arbogast et al.

Humboldt's <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> are found in coniferous and mixed coniferous forests from southern British Columbia to southern California. They are similar in appearance to the northern <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel,</b> however, they are generally smaller and have darker pelage. They are good gliders but clumsy walkers on the ground. They feed on a variety of plant material as well as tree sap, fungi, insects, carrion, bird eggs and nestlings. They mostly breed once a year in a cavity lined with lichen or other soft material. Unlike most members of their family, <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> are strictly nocturnal.|$|R

Two species of giant squirrels, the Indian giant squirrel and the grizzled giant squirrel, and two species of <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel,</b> the large brown <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> and the small Travancore <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel,</b> were found to occur in Karnataka. Indian giant squirrels and large brown <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> were more widely distributed than the other two species. The distributional range included the forests of the Western and Eastern Ghats. However, their distribution was confined only to forests with tall trees. Indian giant squirrels and large brown <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> occur in both deciduous and evergreen forests. Small Travancore <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> occupied high-rainfall evergreen forests on western slopes in the Western Ghats, and the grizzled giant squirrels occupy riverine forests.

We demonstrate that <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> produce ultrasonic emissions through recorded bursts of broadband noise and time-frequency structured frequency modulated (FM) vocalizations, some of which were purely ultrasonic. Squirrels emitted three types of ultrasonic calls in laboratory recordings and one type in the field.

Thus exclusion or removal of <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> from red-cockaded woodpecker cavities and clusters may be warranted in small woodpecker populations (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2003).

Most studies of southern <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> use of red-cockaded woodpecker cavities have been conducted during spring (e. g., Harlow and Lennartz 1983, Rudolph et al. 1990 a, Loeb 1993) and no studies have examined the effects of long term <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> control on subsequent cavity use.

50|$|Prior to the 21st century, the {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> was frequently debated.

Due to their close ancestry, the morphological differences between <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> and tree squirrels reveal insight into the formation of the gliding mechanism. Compared to squirrels of similar size, <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels,</b> northern and southern <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> show lengthening in bones of the lumbar vertebrae and forearm, whereas bones of the feet, hands, and distal vertebrae are reduced in length.

40|$|Reproductive {{success of}} the {{endangered}} Picoides borealis (Red-cockaded Woodpecker) {{is thought to be}} reduced by the presence of Glaucomys volans (Southern Flying Squirrels); hence, these squirrels are often removed when found inside woodpecker cavities.

In this study, using simulated Red-cockaded Woodpecker clusters (pseudo-clusters), we tested the first assumption regarding squirrels reoccupying nest cavities.
