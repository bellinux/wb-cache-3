5|$|After {{returning}} from Mexico, Raynolds resumed mapping the U.S.–Canada border {{which he had}} been surveying before the war, then embarked on a project to develop water resources for the nation's growing capital of Washington, D.C. Raynolds traveled the Great Lakes for several years surveying and mapping shorelines while identifying potential lighthouse locations. After promotion to first lieutenant and then captain, in 1857 he was assigned to design and supervise the construction of lighthouses along the Jersey Shore and the Delmarva Peninsula regions. in the late 1850s Raynolds supervised construction of the Fenwick Island <b>Light</b> <b>in</b> Delaware and the Cape May <b>Light</b> <b>in</b> New Jersey. In 1859, he made alterations to the Jupiter Inlet <b>Light</b> <b>in</b> Jupiter, Florida.|$|E

5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of <b>light</b> <b>in</b> a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than <b>light</b> <b>in</b> the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E
