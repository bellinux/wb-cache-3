5|$|By the 1870s, Chicago {{had become}} the main {{financial}} center for the West, but in October 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed {{the majority of the}} wooden structures within city. The city was rebuilt on large plots of land in a new grid network and followed new city ordinances that prohibited construction in wood. These factors encouraged the building of taller properties in new innovative designs, which, <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> saw a range of businesses and services being packed into single buildings.|$|E
5|$|During Gage's {{administration}} political tensions rose {{throughout the}} American colonies. As a result, Gage began withdrawing {{troops from the}} frontier to fortify urban centres <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City and Boston. As the number of soldiers stationed in cities grew, {{the need to provide}} adequate food and housing for these troops became urgent. Parliament passed the Quartering Act of 1765, permitting British troops to be quartered in vacant houses, barns, and outbuildings, but not private residences.|$|E

5|$|It {{became the}} largest film {{production}} ever in New York State. The decision to film in Williamsburg, Brooklyn near the Passover holiday caused some controversy, as critics {{believed that this}} was culturally insensitive, and would cause problems with parking. The filming company decided {{to work with the}} community and then agreed to adjust its production activities for Passover. The producers had assembled a 200-person crew for the 10-day shoot in Rochester, with a total number of 250 local crew members and 150 local extras. The prominent scenes were shot mostly on Main Street of Rochester and were digitally remastered to look <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City.|$|E
5|$|Production {{originated}} at {{the studios}} of PBS affiliate WHYY-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. WHYY offered Nickelodeon their newly opened production wing to use, and Nickelodeon felt Philadelphia was a better location to initially produce Double Dare because of its lower production costs, instead of cities <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> or Los Angeles where national television production is more common. The 65-episode first season was recorded in a 23-day period beginning September 18, 1986. Double Dare premiered on Nickelodeon on October 6, 1986. New episodes aired weekdays at 5:30p.m. ET during the original series' run on Nickelodeon. After {{the success of the}} first 65 episodes, a second 65-episode season was ordered.|$|E
5|$|Shona {{sculpture}} in has survived {{through the ages}} and the modern style is a fusion of African folklore with European influences. World-renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence {{a new generation of}} artists, particularly Black Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The eastern {{market for}} {{ice in the}} U.S. was also changing. Cities <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> Baltimore and Philadelphia saw their {{population}} boom {{in the second half}} of the century; New York tripled in size between 1850 and 1890, for example. This drove up the demand for ice considerably across the region. By 1879, householders in the eastern cities were consuming two thirds of a ton (601kg) of ice a year, being charged 40 cents ($9.30) per 100 pounds (45kg); 1,500 wagons were needed just to deliver ice to consumers in New York.|$|E

5000|$|What Cheer? Brigade {{was formed}} in 2005, drawing {{inspiration}} from street brass bands in other cities <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York's</b> Hungry March Band and San Francisco's Extra Action Marching Band.

His revue Patch, Patch, Patch ran at the West Bank Cafe in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City in 1979 and featured Chip Zien. The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Times reviewer, Mel Gussow, wrote: [...] "The title song ... {{refers to a}} life's passage. According to Alan Menken ... after age 30 it is a downhill plunge." ...|$|R
25|$|The first tactile {{encoding}} of hangul {{was developed}} by Rosetta Sherwood Hall in 1894. It used a cell 4 dots wide by 2 dots high, <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Point. 6-dot braille was adapted to Korean by Park Du-seong in 1926. There have since {{been a number of}} revisions. The current form was announced in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Large American cities <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and Los Angeles tend to {{have many}} {{distinct}} ambulance services, {{each with its own}} paint scheme and using all of the ambulance types mentioned above. Pedestrians and drivers in such cities must be alert for ambulances of many shapes, sizes, and colors. Most ambulances certified for emergency response in the U.S. are marked with the Star of Life for ready identification by the public.|$|E
25|$|Folk music, {{which often}} carried {{the stigma of}} left-wing {{associations}} during the 1950s Red Scare, was driven underground and carried along {{by a handful of}} artists releasing records. Barred from mainstream outlets, artists like Seeger were restricted to performing in schools and summer camps, and the folk-music scene became a phenomenon associated with vaguely rebellious bohemianism in places <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City (especially Greenwich Village), North Beach, and in the college and university districts of cities like Chicago, Boston, Denver, and elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Dolgoff was {{a member}} of the Chicago Free Society Group in the 1920s, Vanguard Group member and editor of its {{publication}} Vanguard: A Journal of Libertarian Communism in the 1930s, and co-founded the Libertarian League in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> in 1954. He wrote articles for anarchist magazines as well as books as the editor of highly acclaimed anthologies, some of which are listed below. He was active in many causes, and attended groups <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York's</b> Libertarian Book Club regularly.|$|R
50|$|The musical {{variety of}} Marshall's radio show {{included}} {{a mix of}} Soul and Motown with the contemporary sounds of the day. This was during an era when Urban Contemporary Radio stations <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York's</b> WBLS, or Philadelphia's WUSL-FM played only new music by artists like the Gap Band, Luther Vandross, or L.L. Cool J. Oldies formats were restricted to Sunday nights. The freedom of the college radio format allowed Marshall to feature artists like The Temptations, Four Tops, Wilson Pickett, and Sly & the Family Stone alongside Cameo, Run D.M.C., Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, and Al B Sure!. This format was soon adopted and credited to mainstream radio stations <b>like</b> WRKS-FM, <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> or Philly's WDAS-FM in 1988 as Urban Adult Contemporary.|$|R

25|$|The movie {{takes place}} everywhere, {{and it takes}} place nowhere. It's a city built of pieces of cities. A corner from one place, another from some place else. So, you don't really know where you are. A piece will look like a street in London, but {{a portion of the}} {{architecture}} looks <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> but the bottom of the architecture looks again like a European city. You're there, but you don't know where you are. It's like every time you travel, you'll be lost.|$|E
25|$|Match Game PM ran {{until the}} end of the 1980–81 TV season. For its last two seasons, the show's {{affiliate}} count went down significantly due in large part to a daily syndicated version that debuted in September 1979, although some markets, <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> kept both shows on the air. WCBS-TV ran the daily syndicated version as WABC-TV continued to air episodes of Match Game PM into its final season. The show aired 230 episodes over six seasons, and remains the longest-running version to air in syndication.|$|E
25|$|Millions {{of dollars}} were spent {{replacing}} the old terminal, which hosted a half-dozen airlines before its demolition. In the mid 1980s and early 1990s, major carriers, such as Piedmont, Northwest Airlines, Continental, and USAir all flew mainline jets into Worcester. In addition, smaller carriers, <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Air and Presidential Airways also had jet service. The small terminal had two ground level jetways built {{to accommodate the}} growth. But one by one, those carriers left. A succession of second-tier air carriers {{have come and gone}} over the last decade.|$|E
50|$|Harden's is a UK {{restaurant}} guide, publishing print, {{online and}} mobile reviews and ratings for both London and UK restaurants. <b>Like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York's</b> Zagat Survey (which {{no longer has}} a London edition), the ratings and reviews {{are based on the}} results of a reader survey (and were at one point also based on the personal visits of brothers and founders Richard and Peter Harden).|$|R

25|$|Coincident {{with the}} {{construction}} of railways in the region, the age of the wooden sailing ship began to come to an end, being replaced by larger and faster steel steam ships. The Maritimes had long been a centre for shipbuilding, and this industry was hurt by the change. The larger ships were also less likely to call on the smaller population centres such as Saint John and Halifax, preferring to travel to cities <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and Montreal. Even the Cunard Line, founded by Maritime-born Samuel Cunard, stopped making more than a single ceremonial voyage to Halifax each year.|$|E
25|$|The {{period between}} 1865 and 1920 {{was marked by}} the {{increasing}} concentration of people, political power, and economic activity in urban areas. In 1860, there were nine cities with populations over 100,000 and by 1910 there were fifty. These new large cities were not coastal port cities (<b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> Boston, and Philadelphia) but laid inland along new transportation routes (like Denver, Chicago, and Cleveland). The first twelve presidents of the United States had all been born into farming communities, but between 1865 and 1912 the Presidency was filled by men with backgrounds of representing businesses and cities.|$|E
25|$|Jersey City {{recently}} launched United Rescue, an emergency medical first-responder program that leverages citizen volunteers and GPS mobile app-based technology to reduce emergency response times for ambulatory calls, {{and is expected}} to make Jersey City EMS response time the fastest in the country. In October 2015 Jersey City officially legalized Airbnb, even while cities <b>like</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> resist the homesharing service. Fulop has also been a proponent of using data to make government more transparent and accountable, launching a data portal in October 2015 making available a wide range of information about Jersey City and utilizing data mapping and visualization tools to make the information meaningful.|$|E
