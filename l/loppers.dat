50|$|The main {{distinction}} among <b>loppers</b> {{is between}} bypass and anvil types. Bypass <b>loppers</b> operate like scissors, {{except that they}} generally only have one blade that moves past a jaw or hook that has an approximately square edge that is not typically sharpened and is usually concave or hook shaped in order keep branches from slipping out of the jaws. The jaws of bypass <b>loppers</b> may be straight, curved, or one curved with one straight. Anvil <b>loppers</b> have a single sharpened blade, with a straight or sometimes curved edge, that closes against a similarly contoured flat anvil like surface {{on the other side}} of the jaws, usually made of a softer metal than the blade.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loppers</b> are a larger, two-handed, long-handled {{version for}} {{branches}} thicker than pruning shears can cut.|$|E
50|$|Both {{types of}} lopper {{generally}} have a sprung adjusting screw at the fulcrum, {{which can be}} used to tighten the blades as they loosen in use. With bypass <b>loppers,</b> it is also useful for releasing material jamming the blades. Anvil <b>loppers</b> usually have a screw for adjusting or detaching the plate, {{so that it can be}} moved to compensate for wear or replaced entirely.|$|E

50|$|Anvil <b>loppers</b> {{have the}} {{disadvantage}} of tending to crush rather than cut, sometimes leaving an untidy wound, more vulnerable to infection. Their main advantages are of relative strength and of being less likely to jam with fibrous material. Very hard or resilient branches can sometimes deflect a bypass lopper so that material either binds between the blades or even levers them apart, which can be dangerous both to the tool and the operator.|$|E
50|$|They {{are usually}} {{operated}} with two hands, and with handles typically between 30 cm & 91 cm long to give good leverage. Some have telescopic handles {{which can be}} extended to a length of two metres, {{in order to increase}} leverage and to reach high branches on a tree. <b>Loppers</b> are mainly used for the pruning of tree branches with diameters less than 5 cm. Some of the newer lopper designs have a gear or compound lever system which increases the force applied to the blades, or a ratchet drive.|$|E

50|$|Arborists, orchardists, and gardeners use various {{garden tools}} and tree cutting tools {{designed}} for the purpose, such as hand pruners, <b>loppers,</b> or chainsaws. Additionally in forestry bush saws are commonly used and these are often attached to poles that reach up to 5-6m, {{this is a more}} efficient way of pruning than with ladders. These bush saws on polls have also been motorized as chainsaws which is even more efficient. Older technology used Billhooks, Kaiser blades and pruning knives. Although still used in some coppicing they are not used so much in commercial forestry due to the difficulty of cutting flush with the stem. Flush cuts lead to good wood, non-flush or bark damaging cuts (which are more likely with a swung blade than a sawed one) put the tree at risk of entry cords from forest pathogens.|$|E

Pneumatic hand tools {{have been used}} for many decades. These tools help users accomplish tasks with much less effort than is required with manual tools. However, one significant drawback of pneumatic tools compared with manual hand tools is that the user is disconnected from the output forces the tool is creating. This has various safety and functionality issues. A pair of pneumatic powered <b>loppers</b> was developed to demonstrate the potential of force-multiplying, pneumatically powered hand tools with haptic control. A purely mechanical control system was tested and found to provide proportional feedback over the range of operating conditions. The work required to cut through different sizes of dowels and branches was also calculated and tested against the prototype to determine the amount of compressed air needed to operate the <b>loppers.</b> It was determined that the <b>loppers</b> could have an onboard, high pressure tank that could provide enough energy for average homeowner use. For commercial use a larger external tank would be required...|$|E

40|$|Pruning {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crop techniques that influences the longevity of the tree, and quantitative and qualitative aspects of crop production. Nowadays though, this crop technique results to be the main costs, second only to the harvesting of the fruits. Nowadays the tools that are used for pruning of olive trees are <b>loppers</b> (traditionally made out of wood, but currently made out of aluminum). For the cutting hand saws or pneumatic chainsaws are used. The pruning done in this matter results to be tiresome, due to the ladders transport up and down, together with various tools, and because of the problems related to the workers’ safety who have to work holding themselves in balance on unsteady ladders. In this paper the fine tuning of a movable platform specifically for agriculture is studied, to thereby facilitate the pruning of olive trees and harvesting of the fruits. The research had been realized in three different phases, the first regards the planning of the machine’s fine tuning, the second regards its certification according to the European laws CEE 89 / 392, in compliance with the decrees 91 / 368, 93 / 44 and 93 / 68 and finally the third phase regards the experimental tests that will be carried out, comparing the system with the traditional pruning system using <b>loppers...</b>|$|E

40|$|For generations, {{the harvest}} of native flora and fauna by Māori was guided by tikanga. In the art of weaving, the {{sustainability}} of the culture was greatly dependant on the careful practice of harvest to ensure the maintenance of resources for future generations – also known as kaitiakitanga. One {{of the most important}} weaving materials was the kiekie (Freycinetia banksii). Under tikanga, the traditional method of harvest was to use a hand wrench. This method, it was argued, encouraged vigorous replenishment of the harvested stem, thus mediating human impacts on the resource. However, over the last decade it has arisen that a minority of harvesters may be adopting non-traditional techniques which involve the removal of the entire leaf head. Consequently, patches are slow to recover, and in some cases, the affected stems perish. Despite these observations, there is {{little in the way of}} quantitative data. As a result, Te Roopu Raranga Whatu o Aotearoa instigated this research to investigate harvesting practices and their impacts on kiekie. Over 1. 5 years, I tested whether traditional harvest was the most appropriate method by measuring how different harvesting techniques affected the recovery of harvested stems at two sites – one at Te Kotuku Whakaoka (Lake Brunner) on the west coast of the South Island, and the second in the Kaimai Ranges, west of Rotorua, in the North Island. Sixty stems at each site were treated with one of three different harvest regimes – a traditional hand wrench that removed approx. one-third of the stem tip biomass and was conducted over two different seasons ((1) spring and (2) autumn), and (3) a non-traditional harvest technique removing 100 % of the stem tip biomass with <b>loppers.</b> An additional investigation was conducted to evaluate the recovery of kiekie after goat browse. To simulate herbivory, 50 % of the total leaf area of the stem tip was removed from twenty of the sixty treatment stems. Results showed that the herbivory treatments significantly slowed new leaf production on the stems, when compared to controls. Overall, costs of harvest were higher for the non-traditional method than the traditional techniques. Nontraditionally harvested stems had a poorer recovery, with 20 % dying, and only 27 % of the remaining stems regenerating with an average of 1. 73 side shoots. In comparison, the two traditionally hand wrenched stems produced an average of 2. 35 (Spring Wrench) and 2. 55 (Autumn Wrench) side shoots. Findings also showed that traditionally hand wrenched stems are recovering back lost resources. One and a half years after harvest, the Spring Wrench shoots had recovered 70 % of the removed biomass (dry weight). Average leaf lengths of the three longest shoot leaves on all side shoots per wrench stem were at ~ 38 % of mature leaf size. One year after harvest Autumn Wrench shoots had recovered 2. 7 % of the removed biomass (dry weight) and shoot leaves were at ~ 19 % of mature leaf size. Consequently, both are capable of photosynthate synthesis and supply. Measurements did indicate however, that recovery may be sped up in the Autumn Wrench stems which produced more new shoot leaves on all side shoots than the Spring Wrench stems one year after harvest (32. 1 and 26. 9 shoot leaves respectively); although these results apply to a short research period and could be enhanced by a longer-term study. The findings validate the concerns of weavers regarding the negative impacts of non-traditional harvest on the sustainability of kiekie resources. Furthermore, there is support for tikanga regarding kiekie harvest. The regeneration of stocks shows that of all the harvest techniques investigated, the traditional modes of harvest are the most effective means of mediating the impacts of human harvest on kiekie...|$|E
