5|$|Following Allied {{victory in}} the Battle of the Atlantic – through {{long-range}} aircraft, radar, code decryption, and better escort tactics – the need to camouflage ships from submarines greatly decreased, and diffused lighting research became a <b>low</b> <b>priority.</b> The work was halted when the war ended.|$|E
5|$|At the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, {{research}} into implosion had been proceeding under Seth Neddermeyer, but his division {{had worked with}} cylinders and small charges, and had only produced objects that looked like rocks. Their research was accorded a <b>low</b> <b>priority,</b> owing to expectations that a gun-type nuclear weapon design would work for both uranium-235 and plutonium, and implosion technology would not be required.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{importance}} to the Australian and New Zealand economies, Nauru and Ocean islands had been allocated a <b>low</b> <b>priority</b> for the limited military assets which were available to protect the Australia Station and both islands were undefended in December 1940.

Bush felt that more aggressive leadership was required, and spoke to Harvey Bundy and Generals Marshall, Somervell, and Styer about his concerns. He wanted the project placed under a senior policy committee, with a prestigious officer, preferably Styer, as overall director.|$|E
5|$|But {{the emperor}} {{rejected}} an outright invasion. Just {{coming off a}} disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a <b>low</b> <b>priority</b> affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275–76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's main {{newspapers}} {{are owned by}} the government and political parties in the ruling coalition, although some major opposition parties also have their own, which are openly sold alongside regular newspapers. A divide exists between the media in the two halves of the country. Peninsular-based media gives <b>low</b> <b>priority</b> to news from the East, and often treats the eastern states as colonies of the Peninsula. The media have been blamed for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians. The country has Malay, English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies.|$|E

The company from the 594th Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment remained at Jacquinot Bay until it was replaced by the 41st Australian Landing Craft Company on 15 February 1945.|$|E
5|$|The IJN's faulty anti-submarine {{doctrine}} {{also contributed}} to Japan's shipping losses. The Navy had placed a <b>low</b> <b>priority</b> on protecting merchant shipping from submarine attack {{before and during the}} early years of the war and convoys were not routinely assembled until 1943. The Grand Escort Headquarters was formed in late 1943 to coordinate convoys and implement a standard doctrine. The Escort-of-Convoy headquarters was also established in April 1944 to provide a pool of senior commanders who were available to command convoys, though none had any experience with convoy operations or anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
5|$|The V7 {{client is}} {{the seventh and}} latest {{generation}} of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It was released on March22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very <b>low</b> <b>priority,</b> allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses Trac for managing its bug tickets so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.|$|E

Cannon chiefs Menahem Golan and his cousin Yoram Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year option period, plus a percentage of any film’s revenues. However, the rights would revert to Marvel if a film was not made by April 1990.|$|E

Fans of the manga series responded negatively to its anime adaptation, criticizing the alterations made to the characterizations and stories. Japanese website New Akiba, hosted a petition intended to show fans' dissatisfaction and to ask Madhouse and Nippon Television to be more faithful to the original work. In North America, it was also not well received, according to Viz Media's representative Amy Mar who said the show is of <b>low</b> <b>priority</b> since {{it has not been}} among the most-watched on VizAnime.|$|E

5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, Copernicus crater, Tsiolkovskiy crater on the far side, among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as <b>low</b> <b>priority.</b>|$|E
5|$|By July 1944, Oppenheimer had {{concluded}} that plutonium {{could not be used}} in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. Although Teller was head of the T-1 (Implosion and Super) Group, Bethe considered that Teller was spending too much time on the Super, which had been given a <b>low</b> <b>priority</b> by Bethe and Oppenheimer. In June 1944, Oppenheimer created a dedicated Super Group under Teller, who was made directly responsible to Oppenheimer, and Peierls became head of the T-1 (Implosion) Group. In September, Teller's group became the F-1 (Super and General Theory) Group, part of the Enrico Fermi's new F (Fermi) Division.|$|E
5|$|Leet's group reached Manila in July 1945, {{where they}} met with the {{intelligence}} staff of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur's Army Forces, Pacific. Following the surrender of Japan the mission traveled to Japan and visited various research establishments including Tokyo Imperial University, Waseda University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, the Institute for Materials Research, Tokyo Shibaura Denki (Toshiba), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the National Research Council, and the Board of Technology. The mission, which included Karl Compton, interviewed over 300 Japanese scientists and produced reports on Japanese research into radar, rockets, and other developments, including chemical and biological warfare. The Manhattan Project Intelligence Group, {{under the command of}} Philip Morrison, arrived in Japan in September 1945 and examined Japan's wartime nuclear weapons program. The group concluded that lack of uranium ore and <b>low</b> <b>priority</b> had doomed the Japanese effort. They reported that, contrary to American belief, Japan's nuclear physicists were competent.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} his {{experience}} in World War I, Kenney {{had a great deal}} of respect for Japanese fighters. He decided to conserve his bombers, and concentrate on attaining air superiority over New Guinea. Kenney switched the bombers to attacking by night unless fighter escorts could be provided. SWPA had a <b>low</b> <b>priority,</b> and simply could not afford to replace losses from costly daylight missions. What he needed was an effective long-range fighter, and Kenney hoped that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning would fit the bill, but the first ones delivered to SWPA were plagued with technical problems. Kenney had Charles Lindbergh teach his P-38 pilots how to extend the range of their aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. VI {{had a brief}} {{overseas}} career. One of {{the early}} units was experimentally fitted to a Hurricane Mk. IIc, and {{this led to a}} production of a single flight of such designs starting in July 1942. These conversions were given such a <b>low</b> <b>priority</b> that they were not complete until the spring of 1943. Some of these aircraft were sent to Calcutta where they claimed a number of Japanese bombers. An experimental fit on Hawker Typhoon iA R7881 was carried out, with the system packed into a standard underwing drop tank. This was available in March 1943 and underwent lengthy trials lasting into 1944, but nothing came of this work.|$|E
5|$|A Folding@home {{participant}} installs {{a client}} program {{on their personal}} computer. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very <b>low</b> <b>priority,</b> using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. The client connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home {{with the ability to}} efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.|$|E

30|$|This {{suboptimal}} scheduling solution has {{the same}} characteristics as the optimal solution resulting from the optimization problem given by (17). Indeed, the optimal sharing is done in a priority-based principle. Similarly, the NPS mechanism respects the same priority-based approach, yet forces the LP users to share the subbands with the HP users by using the inverted priority order, that is the highest priority user of the LP group coexists with the <b>lowest</b> <b>priority</b> user of the HP group, and the <b>lowest</b> <b>priority</b> user of the LP group coexists with the highest priority user of the HP group.|$|R
5000|$|Exec 8 was {{primarily}} a batch processing system that gave applications (called [...] "tasks") very fine control of CPU scheduling priority for its threads (called [...] "activities"). Processor switching was preemptive, with higher priority threads gaining control of the processor currently running the <b>lowest</b> <b>priority</b> thread of any program. Except in realtime systems, even the <b>lowest</b> <b>priority</b> tasks got some processor time. It was a multiprogramming and multiprocessing operating system with fully symmetric processor management. A test-and-set instruction built into the hardware allowed very efficient and fine-grained locking both within the OS and within multi-threaded applications.|$|R
