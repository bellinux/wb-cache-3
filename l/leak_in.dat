5|$|Hood {{was laid}} down at Chatham Dockyard on 12 August 1889 and was {{launched}} on 30 July 1891, the Viscountess Hood christening her. She finished her sea trials in May 1893 and was commissioned on 1 June 1893 {{at the cost}} of £926,396. Her assignment to the Mediterranean Fleet was delayed when she sprang a <b>leak</b> <b>in</b> her forward compartments on 7 June as a result of faulty riveting and excessive strain on the hull when she had been docked. Repairs took only two days, and the ship left Sheerness for the Mediterranean on 18 June.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Riverkeeper was alerted of a sewage <b>leak</b> <b>in</b> the kill, noting {{high levels}} of {{bacteria}} indicating the presence of fecal matter. A New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) investigation found nearby private sewer pipes and manholes {{to be filled with}} sludge; they were cleaned and plans have been instated to ensure that sewers would stay clear henceforth. An oil spill was observed in the kill in 2016 and DEC staff were again sent to respond. The DEC installed booms to absorb the oil and began an investigation into the spill's source, which was unknown as of December 6.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} {{was caused}} by a gas <b>leak</b> <b>in</b> a 30-year-old building. It severely damaged a nearby nine-story apartment building, causing it to collapse. Mónica Fein, mayor of Rosario, asked residents to avoid the area because of the risk that more buildings might collapse, and to ease the work of disaster management personnel. The streets were covered with broken glass from damaged buildings. Gas and electricity were immediately disconnected, and the national government sent an Argentine Federal Police task force to the scene.|$|E

5|$|After these incidents, the US Congress and NASA {{considered}} {{whether to}} abandon the programme {{out of concern for}} the astronauts' safety, but NASA administrator Daniel Goldin decided to continue. The next flight to Mir, STS-86, carried David Wolf aboard Atlantis. During the orbiter's stay, Titov and Parazynski conducted a spacewalk to affix a cap to the docking module for a future attempt by crew members to seal the <b>leak</b> <b>in</b> Spektrs hull. Wolf spent 119 days aboard Mir with the EO-24 crew and was replaced during STS-89 with Andy Thomas, who carried out the last US expedition on Mir. The EO-25 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-27 in January 1998 before Thomas returned to Earth on the final Shuttle–Mir mission, STS-91.|$|E
5|$|Damage in New Jersey was minor. The state Emergency Management office {{reported}} two gas leaks in Gloucester County. In Burlington, Temple B'nai Israel's synagogue building, built during 1801, sustained {{some water}} damage when tremor-caused {{openings in the}} roof allowed standing water to <b>leak</b> <b>in,</b> and about 20 bricks fell, damaging a congregant's car. In Camden, a vacant house partially collapsed, and government buildings were evacuated, with city workers given the option of returning home for the day. Due to damage done by the quake, the municipal government of Woodbury reported that the historic Colonel George Gill Green Opera House, which was built during 1880, would be razed, but instead it was renovated to provide housing for senior citizens. No other infrastructure damage {{was reported in the}} state.|$|E
5|$|During the U.S. Navy carrier {{air attack}} on Kure on 24 July 1945, Settsu was {{attacked}} by 30 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters near Etajima. She was struck by one bomb that killed two men and wounded another two; five near misses started a serious <b>leak</b> <b>in</b> the starboard engine room. Captain Masanano Ofuji decided to run his ship aground on Etajima to prevent her from sinking. All of Settsus 25mm guns were subsequently removed and the ship {{was used as a}} floating barracks. Four days later, the ship was again attacked by carrier aircraft that hit her twice more with bombs. She was abandoned the next day. Settsu was stricken from the navy list on 20 November and her hulk was raised in June 1946 and towed to Kure where scrapping was completed in August 1947.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of her}} career, U-16 {{operated}} in the Adriatic out of Kotor patrolling off the Albanian coast. The U-boat sank one small sailing ship in November and seized another in December. U-16 carried Field Marshal Svetozar Borojević of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an observer while performing diving tests after engine repairs in January 1916. A water <b>leak</b> <b>in</b> March flooded U-16s batteries and put the U-boat out of action for about six weeks of repairs. While operating off Vlorë in mid-October 1916, U-16 sank an Italian destroyer acting as a convoy escort. U-16 was sunk in the ensuing action, but sources are not clear on the exact cause of her sinking. In all U-16 sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 711. She was the only U-10-class submarine sunk during the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{under the}} terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Novara and the rest of the fleet was {{surrendered}} to the Allied powers as war prizes; Novara was awarded to France in the post-war distribution of ships. She sprang a <b>leak</b> <b>in</b> the Adriatic and put into Brindisi, Italy, where she sank on 29 January 1920. She was refloated in early April 1920. The ship was renamed Thionville and incorporated into the French fleet after repairs. Thionville was assigned to the torpedo school for use as a training ship, a role she filled until 1 May 1932. The ship was then disarmed and converted into a barracks ship based in Toulon. She remained there until 1941, when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Kentuckian resumed cargo {{service with}} American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though {{the company had}} {{abandoned}} its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, Kentuckian continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal with a few incidents that interrupted what was a mostly uneventful twenty years. In September 1928, a day after sailing from San Francisco, Kentuckian was rammed by the General Petroleum tanker Los Alamos near Point Sur, California, in a thick fog. Kentuckian had a <b>leak</b> <b>in</b> her number two cargo hold and damage to her port bilge keel and returned to San Francisco for repairs. In early April 1933, a fire broke out in Kentuckians number two cargo hold, {{which resulted in the}} delay of the ship at Panama from 8 to 14 April. Kentuckian made her way to Los Angeles over the next ten days, where surveyors examined the ship and her general cargo.|$|E

5|$|On 26 April 2007, Norway {{signed a}} NOK150 million joint-development {{agreement}} with Saab {{to cooperate in}} the development programme of the Gripen, including the integration of Norwegian industries {{in the development of}} future versions of the aircraft. In June of the same year, Saab also entered an agreement with Thales Norway A/S concerning the development of communications systems for the Gripen fighter. This order was the first awarded under the provisions of the Letter of Agreement signed by the Norwegian Ministry of Defence and Gripen International in April 2007. As a result of the United States diplomatic cables <b>leak</b> <b>in</b> 2010, it was revealed that US diplomats had become concerned with cooperation between Norway and Sweden on the topic of the Gripen, and had sought to exert pressure against a Norwegian purchase of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} propshaft seal sprung a major <b>leak</b> <b>in</b> the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's pressure hull, {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, Triton could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the Tritons fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from Tritons high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.|$|E
5|$|Ellet and Stephens {{continued}} {{writing to}} Griswold's ex-wife, urging {{her to have}} the divorce repealed. Myers was finally convinced and filed in Philadelphia on September 23, 1853. The court, however, had lost records of the divorce and had to delay the appeal. Adding to Griswold's troubles, that fall, a gas <b>leak</b> <b>in</b> his home caused an explosion and a fire. He was severely burned, losing his eyelashes, eyebrows, and seven of his finger nails. That same year, his 15-year-old daughter, Emily, nearly died in Connecticut. A train she was riding on had fallen off a drawbridge into a river. When Griswold arrived he saw 49corpses in a makeshift morgue. Emily had been pronounced dead when pinned underwater but a doctor was able to revive her. On February 24, 1856, the divorce appeal went to court, with Ellet and Stephens providing lengthy testimony against Griswold's character. Neither Griswold nor Myers attended and the appeal was dismissed. Embarrassed by the ordeal, McCrillis left Griswold in New York and moved in with family in Bangor, Maine.|$|E
