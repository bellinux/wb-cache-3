5|$|GCHS {{underwent}} a major remodeling project during the 2005–2006 school year. An open courtyard had previously {{existed in the}} central section of the school which had gone largely unused. School officials met and decided to enclose the courtyard and transform the space into a multi-purpose atrium tetrastylum. After nearly a year, construction was completed. The new multi-purpose area was used for additional seating during lunchtime, as well as conferences, banquets, and additional uses. The atrium featured a projection screen, a flat-screen HDTV, additional storage closets, a small elevated stage area, several unique design features, and additional entrances/exits to classrooms. The renovation was, however, largely regarded by students and residents of Garden City as a waste of resources, owing {{to the construction of}} the current high school. One of the main reasons for the enclosure of the courtyard was to provide adequate room for most of its students in a lunchroom of some sort. However, at the time, the high school espoused an open lunch policy, and consequently a majority of its close to 2,000 students left campus for lunch. Administrators responded to this in the 2007–2008 school year by closing <b>lunch</b> <b>to</b> freshmen, and the following year by closing <b>lunch</b> <b>to</b> sophomores who do not have special identification cards.|$|E

He {{responds}} to all of Leslie's questions with his usual chauvinistic answers, annoying her to the point that she admits she took him out because they matched on HoosierMate. A delighted Tom teases Leslie {{the rest of the day}} by pretending they are a couple, but she finally silences him by kissing him. Chris notices the kiss and warns Leslie that he has a strict policy against workplace dating.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of spare parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing spare parts and equipment, maintenance personnel often spend {{the better part of}} their duty day looking for other ways to profit. American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free <b>lunch</b> <b>to</b> the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work {{at least half of the}} duty day.|$|E

5|$|A further {{delay in}} {{construction}} {{was announced in}} 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because of a government rearmament drive. Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, kitchen and the library tower, began in 1955 {{at a cost of}} £200,000. This money was donated to the college by the Nuffield Foundation upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation. Until it was required for books, the fellows of the college used the upper floor as a Senior Common Room. The tower was completed in 1956, and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park) was finished in 1960. Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by royal charter in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity. The charter was presented to the college by the Duke of Edinburgh on 6June 1958, at the first <b>lunch</b> <b>to</b> be served in the hall.|$|E
5|$|Before Sky made a formalised bid, Murdoch asked Chisholm {{to speak}} to Dyke about making a joint offer. The events of that meeting are vague, but what is clear was that Chisholm came to the {{decision}} of not working with ITV. He instead chose to pursue an alliance with the BBC, aware of the cultural importance of Match of the Day. In February 1992, Quinton met Murdoch over <b>lunch</b> <b>to</b> go over his expectations, {{with the idea of}} a Premier League dedicated channel high on his priority. ITV had in the same month revealed plans to offer the league £80m over four years in exchange for exclusive rights. Dyke believed their deal would fend off BSkyB, but the BBC's quiet stance weakened ITV's position.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{returned}} with the second new ball after <b>lunch</b> <b>to</b> remove Tom Dollery with another yorker, leaving England at 4/97. This dismissal mirrored that of Washbrook’s in that Dollery failed to detect Johnston’s variation ball, and thus played for swing when there was none. Late in the day, Johnston took the catch as Lindwall removed Evans, who had taken a wild slash to leave England at 7/216. In the final minutes of play, Johnston extracted an edge from Compton on 64, but Tallon dropped the catch. On the second morning, Tallon dropped Comptonthen on 73for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston, who eventually ended the England innings on 363 by removing Young. Compton had added a further 81 after being dropped from Johnston's bowling to end unbeaten on 145. Johnston had bowled the most overs of the Australians and been the most economical.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Hitler {{had come}} into power, he had started to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933 he {{contracted}} Paul Troost to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor {{on the progress of}} the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to <b>lunch,</b> <b>to</b> the architect's great excitement. Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he had been looking for a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.|$|E

Tony rushes to his son's aid and the rich man, Mr. Sears gets out the car and attempts to comfort the father. The father rejects him and rushes home, carrying his son in his arms. At home, Tony Prolo and his wife attend to their son and pray for his health.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} {{political}} consciousness started after {{the establishment of}} the Bombay Presidency Association on 31 January 1885. The Bombay Millowners' Association was formed in February 1875 by Dinshaw Maneckji Petit in order to lourdes central school protect interests of workers threatened by possible factory and tariff legislation by the British. The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Bombay from 28–31 December 1885. The Bombay Municipal Act was enacted in 1888 which gave the British Government wide powers of interference in civic matters. The Victoria Terminus of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, one of the finest stations in the world, was completed in May 1888. The concept of Dabbawalas (lunch box delivery man) originated in the 1890s when British people who came to Bombay did not like the local food. So the Dabbawala service was set up to bring <b>lunch</b> <b>to</b> these people in their workplace straight from their home. On 11 August 1893, a serious communal riot took place between the Hindus and Muslims, when a Shiva temple was attacked by Muslims in Bombay. 75 people were killed and 350 were injured. In September 1896, Bombay was hit by a bubonic plague epidemic where the death toll was estimated at 1,900 people per week. Around 850,000, amounting to half of the population, fled Bombay during this time. On 9 March 1898, there was a serious riot which started with a sudden outbreak of hostility against the measures adopted by Government for suppression of plague. The riot led to a strike of dock and railway workers which paralysed the city for a few days. The significant results of the plague was the creation of the Bombay City Improvement Trust on 9 December 1898 and the Haffkine Institute on 10 January 1899 by Waldemar Haffkine. The Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion scheme, the first planned suburban scheme in Bombay, was formulated in 1899–1900 by the Bombay City Improvement Trust to relieve congestion in the centre of the town, following the plague epidemics. The cotton mill industry was adversely affected during 1900 and 1901 due to the flight of workers because of the plague.|$|E

25|$|England's bowlers {{performed}} {{well on the}} final day, and took 5 wickets in the first session ensuring the 323 run target was well out of Pakistan's reach. The run out of Mohammad Yousuf for a single figure score was a key moment in the innings – in fact, Pakistan lost 3 of their top order batsmen to run outs during the game.

25|$|Australia removed Root and Pietersen to rash strokes on {{the third}} morning to see the score 3/66.
