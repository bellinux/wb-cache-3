40|$|Feather pecking still {{presents}} {{a major problem}} in organic laying hen farming. In order to identify important risk factors during the laying period as well as during the rearing period in an exploratory epidemiological approach, we followed birds from 23 organic rearing units in Austria and Germany to 46 <b>laying</b> <b>units.</b> Management and housing conditions were recorded during one day visits in the 16 th to 18 th and 30 th to 40 th week of age, respectively. As an indicator of feather pecking, feather conditions of random samples of 30 hens per laying farm were assessed. Average feather scores from 0 (best) to 3 (worst) were calculated. The average score of 0. 73 (± 0. 44) was not significantly different from the score of 0. 77 (± 0. 33) from 54 conventional farms assessed in the same way (p= 0. 247). 73 % of the total variance in feather score between the different organic farms could be explained by 6 variables. About 79 % of the explained variation was due to rearing conditions. The major risk factors for poor plumage were little elevated perch space, few drinking places and no regular scattering of grain during the rearing period, as well as poor litter quality during the laying period. It is concluded that these are feasible starting points for improved prevention strategies against feather pecking...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} three gravel-bed {{rivers in}} north-eastern Italy (Brenta, Piave, Tagliamento) having similar bioclimate, geology and fluvial morphology, but affected by different intensities of anthropogenic disturbance related particularly to hydropower dams, training works and instream gravel mining. Our {{aim was to}} test whether a corresponding difference in the interactions between vegetation and geomorphological patterns existed among the three rivers. In equally spaced and sized plots (n= 710) we collected descriptors of geomorphic conditions, and presence-absence of woody species. In the less disturbed river (Tagliamento), spatial succession of woody communities from the floodplain to the channel followed a profile where higher elevation floodplains featured more developed tree communities, and lower elevation islands and bars were covered by pioneer communities. In the intermediate-disturbed river (Piave), islands and floodplains lay at similar elevation and both showed species indicators of mature developed communities. In the most disturbed river (Brenta), all these patterns were simplified, all geomorphic <b>units</b> <b>lay</b> at similar elevations, were not well characterized by species composition, and presented similar persistence age. This indicates that in human-disturbed rivers, channel and vegetation adjustments are closely linked in the long term, and suggests that intermediate levels of anthropogenic disturbance, such as those encountered in the Piave River, could counteract the natural, more dynamic conditions that may periodically defragment vegetated landscapes in natural rivers...|$|R
40|$|The Swan Peak Formation in the Bear River Range of {{northern}} Utah and southeastern Idaho varies in thickness from 0 feet to over 400 feet. It {{consists of three}} units: (1) a lower unit of interbedded quartzites, shales, and limestones; (2) A middle unit of interbedded quartzites and shales; (3) An upper unit of nearly homogeneous quartzites. The different sedimentary structures, ichnofossils, body fossils, and mineral compositions of each unit represent different environments of deposition. The lower unit probably was deposited in a shallow-shelf environment, and its sediments grade upward into probably shoreface-, tidal-flat-, and lagoonal deposits of the middle unit. The upper unit {{is believed to be}} a shallow-marine sand deposited by south-flowing currents. The lower and middle uits of the Swan Peak Formation consist of a progradational suite of nearshore lithologies formed during the regression of the sea that terminated the early Paleozoic Sauk Sequence. The formation lies disconformably beneath the Ordovician Fish Haven Dolomite, and rests conformably on the underlying Ordovician Garden City Formation. The upper and middle units thin eastward and south-eastward to a feather edge, whereas the lower unit is thickest along an east-west trending belt and thins northward and southward.

40|$|The {{responses}} of single cortical neurons were measured {{as a function}} of the binocular disparity of dynamic random dot stereograms for a large sample of neurons (n = 787) from V 1 of the awake macaque. From this sample, we selected 180 neurons whose tuning curves were strongly tuned for disparity, well sampled and well described by one-dimensional Gabor functions. The fitted parameters of the Gabor functions were used to resolve three outstanding issues in binocular stereopsis. First, we considered whether tuning curves can be meaningfully divided into discrete tuning types. Careful examination of the distributions of the Gabor parameters that determine tuning shape revealed no evidence for clustering. We conclude that a continuum of tuning types is present. Second, we investigated the mechanism of disparity encoding for V 1 neurons. The shape of the disparity tuning function can be used to distinguish between position-encoding (in which disparity is encoded by an interocular shift in receptive field position) and phase-encoding (in which disparity is encoded by a difference in the receptive field profile in the 2 eyes). Both position and phase encoding were found to be common. This was confirmed by an independent assessment of disparity encoding based on the measurement of disparity sensitivity for sinusoidal luminance gratings of different spatial frequencies. The contributions of phase and position to disparity encoding were compared by estimating a population average of the rate of change in firing rate per degree of disparity. When this was calculated separately for the phase and position contributions, they were found to be closely similar. Third, we investigated the range of disparity tuning in V 1 {{as a function of}} eccentricity in the parafoveal range. We find few cells which are selective for disparities greater than +/- 1 degrees even at the largest eccentricity of approximately 5 degrees. The preferred disparity was correlated with the spatial scale of the tuning curve, and for most <b>units</b> <b>lay</b> within a +/-pi radians phase limit.

40|$|Terrestrial and lagoonal to shallow marine paleoenvironments are {{preserved}} in the Lower Paleogene outliers scattered along the eastern English Channel coast (Dieppe-Hampshire Basin). Stratigraphic studies in this Paleocene-Eocene (P-E) interval reference area (Dupuis et al., 1998; Aubry et al., 2005) are especially useful in reconstructing sea level changes. Nine regional units can be delineated and traced along the coast transect. They are separated by eight hiatuses of diverse durations and variable lateral continuity and structured in three transgressive sets of units. The lower one belongs to the Thanetian (NP 7 to NP 9 a). The two others encompass the “Sparnacian” and the Early Ypresian (s. s.) (NP 11). The second set comprises the successive Mortemer Fm, Ailly Mb and Craquelins Mb. The first Major Sea Level Drop (MSLD 1) resulted in the erosion of large channels filled up by the fluviatile-palustrine Mortemer Fm. The upper bed of this later Fm bears the CIE onset pointing to the P-E boundary. The transgression continued with the lagoonal-shallow marine Ailly Mb yielding the Apectodinium acme. The overlying Craquelins Mb is a glauconitic clay only recognized along the Varengeville outlier and in the Sotteville-sur-Mer and Eu sections; it coincides {{with the end of}} the Apectodinium acme and marks a maximum flooding of the transgression. The third set starts after the MSLD 2 which formed a regional erosional surface. On it <b>lays</b> a complex <b>unit</b> of very shallow marine sands often rich in “avelannes”, very well rounded small flint pebbles, appearing for the first time in the stratigraphic record (“Sables Fauves”, Blackheath Beds, Oldhaven Mb, etc.). Of variable thickness, this unit marks the base of the marine Ypresian (s. s) (Varangeville Fm, London Clay Fm, etc.). The two MSLDs are of different natures. MSLD 1 is widely reported in the studied area where the uppermost Paleocene fluvial channels can be observed (Cap d'Ailly, Newhaven, Dormaal, Erquelinnes, Flines-les-Râches, Therdonne, Le Quesnoy-Rivecourt, etc.). The regular size of the channels and their rather uniform distribution suggest that the incision of fluvial networks was dependent to a broad uplift due to the magmatic activity of the NAIP (North Atlantic Igneous Province). The subsequent cooling of the intrusion caused the thermal subsidence controlling the transgressive trend of the succession (Knox, 1996) later perturbed by the MSLD 2. Of independent (?) origin, MSLD 2 is related to a sea shore abrasion surface the effects of which vary from almost no erosion to large denudations resulting in unconformities over rejuvenated (?) tectonic structures (Bray anticline, etc.). The MSLD 1 context suggests a scenario for some global events around the P-E boundary. The NAIP driven uplift emerged a large area around the hot spot. This may have triggered both the organic matter oxidation of those regions and the destabilization of the sea slopes clathrates, adding a contribution to the release of thermogenic methane from the intrusions in the Norvegian Sea (Svensen et al, 2004). This interpretation may also explain the position of the CIE shortly after the incision of the channels and the beginning of the transgression...|$|R
