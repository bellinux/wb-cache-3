25|$|The {{substance}} of a lymph node consists of lymphoid follicles in an outer portion called the cortex. The inner {{portion of the}} node is called the medulla, which is surrounded by the cortex on all sides except for a portion known as the hilum. The hilum presents as a depression {{on the surface of}} the lymph node, causing the otherwise spherical lymph node to be bean-shaped or ovoid. The efferent <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel</b> directly emerges from the lymph node at the hilum. The arteries and veins supplying the lymph node with blood enter and exit through the hilum.|$|E
25|$|A {{lymph node}} is an {{organized}} collection of lymphoid tissue, {{through which the}} lymph passes on its {{way back to the}} blood. Lymph nodes are located at intervals along the lymphatic system. Several afferent lymph vessels bring in lymph, which percolates through the substance of the lymph node, and is then drained out by an efferent <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel.</b> There are between five and six hundred lymph nodes in the human body, many of which are grouped in clusters in different regions as in the underarm and abdominal areas. Lymph node clusters are commonly found at the base of limbs (groin, armpits) and in the neck, where lymph is collected from regions of the body likely to sustain pathogen contamination from injuries.|$|E
5000|$|The lymph {{capillaries}} {{drain the}} lymph to larger contractile lymphatics, which have valves {{as well as}} smooth muscle walls. These are called the collecting lymphatics. As the collecting <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel</b> accumulates lymph from more and more lymph capillaries in its course, it becomes larger and is called the afferent <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel</b> as it enters a lymph node. Here the lymph percolates through the lymph node tissue and is removed by the efferent <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel.</b> An efferent <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel</b> may directly drain {{into one of the}} (right or thoracic) lymph ducts, or may empty into another lymph node as its afferent <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel.</b> Both the lymph ducts return the lymph to the blood stream by emptying into the subclavian veins ...|$|E
40|$|The {{localization}} of absorbing <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> was {{studied in}} the normal guinea pig pancreas by light microscopy (serial semithin sections) and transmission electron microscopy (ultrathin sections). Absorbing <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> were observed both in the interlobular and intralobular areas {{where they can be}} localized close to the adenomeres. <b>Lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> were also seen in the interlobular areas located next to the islets of Langerhans and to groups of endocrine cells (n = 8 - 10) not showing a vascular organization comparable with islets of Langerhans. All <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> in the pancreas are absorbing <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels,</b> characterized by a very thin endothelial wall, anchoring filaments and the absence of a definitive basal membrane.

40|$|Whereas <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> in some {{endocrine}} glands {{have been}} thoroughly investigated, data on these vessels in human parathyroid glands are often contradictory and deficient in available literature. Therefore, {{the aim of}} this study was to histomorphologically investigate whether <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> could be found in human parathyroid glands postnatally and, if so, whether their presence was age- and gender-dependent. A total of 44 parathyroid glands from subjects of both genders, aged 4 - 90 years, were studied. The glands were divided into three groups. Those from the 1 st and the 2 nd age group demonstrated similar morphological structure of parenchyma with predominant chief cells with pale-staining cytoplasm, while the frequency of <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> was lower in the 2 nd group. Unlike in these groups, chief cells with dark- staining cytoplasm predominated in the glandular parenchyma of the 3 rd age group where <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> were not found in any of the examined glands. The frequency of <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> in parathyroid glands was almost the same for both genders. Histomorphologic occurrence of <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> coincided with the presence of endocrine cells with pale-staining cytoplasm, which allowed the assumption that <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> were also one of the signs of functional activity of human parathyroid glands...|$|R
50|$|When an efferent <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel</b> {{leaves a}} lymph node, it may carry lymph to another lymph node by {{becoming}} its afferent <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel</b> or unite with other efferent vessels {{to become a}} lymph trunk. The lymph trunks drain into the lymph ducts, which in turn return lymph to the blood by emptying into the respective subclavian veins.|$|E

40|$|Retraction clefting {{is known}} to appear in various types of tumors, but it has only {{recently}} been recognized as a specific histological phenomenon. Previously, it was considered merely a laboratory procedure artifact, but lately, {{there have been some}} assumptions that peritumoral retractions actually represent lymphatic spaces. In our study, we analyzed neoplastic glands in 52 specimens of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using D 2 - 40 antibody, to highlight lymphatic endothelium and thereby differentiate actual <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> or lymphovascular invasion from periacinar retractions. Our results showed that the number of <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> was significantly lower in tumorous tissue compared to adjacent normal prostatic tissue. On the other hand, the number of <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> in tumorous tissue was significantly higher than the number of <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> mimicking periacinar retractions. Overall, the number of <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> mimicking periacinar clefts was particularly low. These results are in accordance with our previous studies, which had shown that periacinar clefting appears due to lack of basal cells and stromal changes around tumorous acini. Also, these results support our hypothesis that retractions do not represent <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> but should be considered a distinct entity, which is proven to be helpful both as diagnostic and predictive factor...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The present work {{deals with}} {{innervation}} patterns along collector lymphatic vessels from cervical, mesenteric, and femoral regions, and lymph capillaries in young and elderly subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Morphological and morphometric analysis of nerve fibers along <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> {{was performed by}} immunohistochemistry for PGP 9. 5, NPY, TH, ChAT, VIP, SP, and dopamine. Nerves containing NPY and TH were frequent, whereas immunoreactivity for ChAT and VIP were few. SP-positive fibers were widely distributed in the medial and endothelial layers. Dopamine neurotransmitters were observed {{in a few short}} nerve fibers. A more diffuse presence of nerve fibers in mesenteric and femoral <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels,</b> compared to cervical ones, was detected. In <b>lymph</b> capillary <b>vessels,</b> a few nerve fibers positive for neuropeptides and neurotransmitters were detected, whereas no dopamine and VIP immunoreactive fibers were detected. A wide reduction of all specific nerve fibers analyzed was detected in <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> from elderly subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The presence on <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve systems can be declared. The differences observed in lymphatic vessel innervation patterns may note the involvement in lymph flow regulation, calling attention in aging, when nerve fibers reduction may cause functional default of <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels...</b>|$|R
50|$|Lymph trunk is a <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel</b> {{that carries}} lymph, and is formed by {{confluence}} of many efferent lymph vessels. It in turn drains {{into one of}} the two lymph ducts (right lymph duct and the thoracic duct).|$|E
50|$|Generally, lymph flows {{away from}} the tissues to lymph nodes and {{eventually}} to either the right lymphatic duct or the largest <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel</b> in the body, the thoracic duct. These vessels drain into {{the right and left}} subclavian veins respectively.|$|E

50|$|Lymph that {{enters the}} <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> from the {{interstitial}} spaces usually does not flow backwards along the vessels {{because of the}} presence of valves.

40|$|The {{number and}} size of the <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> in the rabbit ovary appear to be disproportionate {{to the size of the}} organ. From a cursory {{examination}} of the ovary, it is difficult to see why such a relatively small organ should require such an extensive drainage system. The author was unable to find references to detailed work concerned with the lymphatics of the rabbit ovary, but Wislocki and Dempsey (1939) described the lymphatics in the ovary of the Rhesus monkey, and Andersen (1926) has given a detailed account of the development of the <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> in the sow’s ovary during the formation of the corpora lutea. This Investigator remarked upon the extensive network of <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels,</b> and she suggested that they might be concerned with carrying off endocrine products. The purpose of this Investigation was to ascertain whether the lymphatics were subservient to some function of the ovary other than drainage. During the preliminary histological studies it was very difficult to distinguish between small veins and <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels,</b> and because of this fact, it became necessary to study the veins, and also the arteries, in order to be able to distinguish <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> from blood vessels. finis paper presents evidence for the existence of direct connections between the blood <b>vessels</b> and <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> in the rabbit ovary. So far as the author is aware, such connections have not previously been described...|$|R

40|$|Lymphatic {{vessels of}} the pulp were traced {{in the teeth}} of dogs. At the coronal surface the lymph {{capillaries}} originated as blind begin-ninigs in the pulp proper near the zone of Weil, whereas they are found adjacent to the odonttoblastic layer on the lateral surfaces. These capillaries emptied into collecting <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> that coursed apically to exit through the apical foramens to finally drain into the alveolar lymphatic vessel. The existence of large <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> in the dental pulp has been established by a number of earlier investigators. 1, 2, 3 They agree that large lymphatic structures accompany the venous drainage in passage through the pulp and into the peripheral collecting vessels. However, the disposition of <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> from their capillaries is not understood. The descriptions of these <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> in cur-rent text and reference books are brief. The existence of these <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> has been questioned by some authors. 4, 5 The knowledge that the lymphatic sys-tem {{plays an important role in}} the normal and pathologic states necessitates a detailed study of the relationship between the <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> and capillaries and the surrounding pulpal tissues. Material and Methods Eleven dogs of indeterminate age were used in this investigation. At the time of autopsy the heads were removed and fixed in an alcohol-acetic acid-formalin solution.

50|$|In anatomy, lymphatic vessels (or lymph vessels or lymphatics) are thin-walled, valved {{structures}} that carry lymph. As {{part of the}} lymphatic system, lymph vessels are complementary to the cardiovascular system. Lymph vessels are lined by endothelial cells, and have {{a thin layer of}} smooth muscles, and adventitia that bind the lymph vessels to the surrounding tissue. Lymph vessels are devoted to the propulsion of the lymph from the lymph capillaries, which are mainly concerned with absorption of interstitial fluid from the tissues. Lymph capillaries are slightly larger than their counterpart capillaries of the vascular system. Lymph vessels that carry lymph to a lymph node are called the afferent <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel,</b> and one that carries it from a lymph node is called the efferent <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel,</b> from where the lymph may travel to another lymph node, may be returned to a vein, or may travel to a larger lymph duct. Lymph ducts drain the lymph into one of the subclavian veins and thus return it to general circulation.|$|E
50|$|Lymph {{vessels are}} {{channels}} {{larger than the}} lymph capillaries that have thicker walls, valves in their lumen and smooth muscles in their walls, thus <b>lymph</b> <b>vessel</b> lymphangion is muscular and capable of contracting on its own. Additionally the lymph in it is propelled forward only because of force exerted on its walls from the exterior. Such forces include skeletal muscle contractions and arterial pulsations. Also, the inspiration during respiration provides a suction pressure within the lumen.|$|E

Usually, prevalent symptoms include canker sores or ulcers in the mouth and on the genitals, and inflammation {{in parts of the}} eye. In addition, patients experience severe headache and papulopustular skin lesions as well. The disease was first described in 1937 by a Turkish dermatologist, Dr. Hulusi Behçet. Behçet's disease is most prevalent in the Middle East and the Far East regions; however, it is rare in America regions.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{were made}} on the lymph system of the normal lungs, {{as well as the}} lungs with adhesions in the pleura and those with the {{occluded}} <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels,</b> in dogs. It was shown that the system of <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> which drain the lymph from each lobe of the lung and empty into the ascending vessel in the mediastinum varied in pattern with each lobe and each lung. Development of adhesions in the pleura in experimental animals caused regeneration of the <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> in the parts where adhesions had developed. Occlusion of the <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> by ligation or acusection caused the lymph flow in the outgoing vessels from the lung to flow backward into the lung for at least a certain period of time. In view {{of the results of the}} present experiments, it would seem that in surgical extirpation of cancerous growths different procedures for excision and evidement should be employed depending on the location of tumors to be extirpated. It would, moreover, seem to be necessary to develop some new surgical procedure to treat patients who have developed adhesions in the pleura. The results of the experiments on occlusion of the <b>lymph</b> <b>vessels</b> suggest that there may be a possibility of metastasis of cancer cells taking place from a part of the lung to another through the backward flow of the lymph...|$|R
