In essence, the sound was captured by a microphone and translated into light waves via a <b>light</b> <b>valve,</b> a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit. The sound reaching this ribbon would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm, focusing the resulting light waves through the slit, {{where it would be}} photographed {{on the side of the}} film, on a strip about a tenth of an inch wide.|$|E
2500|$|Brightness and {{contrast}} ratio: [...] Contrast ratio is {{the ratio of}} the brightness of a full-on pixel to a full-off pixel. The LCD itself is only a <b>light</b> <b>valve</b> and does not generate light; the light comes from a backlight that is either fluorescent or a set of LEDs. Brightness is usually stated as the maximum light output of the LCD, which can vary greatly based on the transparency of the LCD and the brightness of the backlight. In general, brighter is better, but there is always a trade-off between brightness and power consumption.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922, Georges Friedel {{described}} {{the structure and}} properties of liquid crystals and classified them in 3 types (nematics, smectics and cholesterics). In 1927, Vsevolod Frederiks devised the electrically switched <b>light</b> <b>valve,</b> called the Fréedericksz transition, the essential effect of all LCD technology. In 1936, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph company patented the first practical application of the technology, [...] "The Liquid Crystal Light Valve". In 1962, the first major English language publication on the subject [...] "Molecular Structure and Properties of Liquid Crystals", by Dr. George W. Gray. In 1962, Richard Williams of RCA found that liquid crystals had some interesting electro-optic characteristics and he realized an electro-optical effect by generating stripe-patterns in {{a thin layer of}} liquid crystal material by the application of a voltage. This effect is based on an electro-hydrodynamic instability forming what are now called [...] "Williams domains" [...] inside the liquid crystal.|$|E

Although the inclusion of a discussion of <b>light</b> <b>valves</b> by a panel on nonlinear optical materials at first seems odd, it is logical because <b>light</b> <b>valves</b> and photorefractive materials perform common functions...|$|R

The electromechanical and optical performances of such elements were determined both analytically and experimentally. It was found that fast switching (approximately 10 microseconds), high-contrast (10 or greater), fatigue-free operation over missions of cycles, and efficient utilization of input light could be obtained with membrane <b>light</b> <b>valves.</b> Several arrays of 64 elements were made on substrates with feedthroughs, allowing access to individual elements from the backside of the substrate.

It competes with other <b>light</b> <b>valve</b> {{technologies such as}} Digital Light Processing (DLP) and liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) for implementation in video projector devices such as rear-projection televisions. The use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) in optical applications, which is known as optical MEMS or micro-opto-electro-mechanical structures (MOEMS), has enabled the possibility to combine the mechanical, electrical and optical components in very small scale.|$|E
50|$|In {{this type}} of screens and projectors, the source light is first polarised by a filter in one {{direction}} and then passed on to another filter, filled with liquid crystals. By changing the voltage applied to this crystal filter, it will work as a switching polarising filter, giving different gray scales of the light coming out. The light is changed only once for each image frame. The <b>light</b> <b>valve</b> thus consists of the two polarising filters, where one has a voltage controlled switch function thanks to the properties of the liquid crystals. This type of valve {{is often referred to as}} a liquid crystal <b>light</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E

The first one is optically addressed spatial light modulator: optical information is converted into electric information through the medium of a photoconductivity material layer (amorphous silicon). The second type of valve is a VLSI chip covered with liquid crystal which can be optically addressed on each pixel and perform local electronic processing. The local switching of the liquid crystal allows the reading of the final state...|$|R

Undercut valves can both increase flow and decrease weight. Also, by using more than the traditional two valves per cylinder, smaller and <b>lighter</b> <b>valves</b> can be used. By reducing valvetrain mass, valves can close more rapidly with a given spring stiffness.|$|R

50|$|Once {{the ability}} to record stereo tracks became a {{commercial}} imperative for sound-transfer facilities the RCA system was abandoned as it was incapable of producing time-aligned stereo sound negatives, whereas the Western Electric/Westrex recorders with the ca. 1938 4-ribbon <b>light</b> <b>valve</b> (RA-1231, e.g., but not RA-1231A) were inherently capable of producing time-aligned sound negatives.|$|E

Two synthesizing methods are described: an optical synthesis utilizing 2 D perspective views and a synthesis based on calculating and writing of the interference pattern onto the hologram. The 2 D pictures and interference pattern are procreated by optoelectronic <b>light</b> <b>valves.</b> The hologram plate consists of photoemulsions for still holograms.

The Western Electric system continued to use the <b>light</b> <b>valve,</b> and, under successor ownership, is still used to this day.|$|E
50|$|Both variable-area {{systems and}} variable-density systems were marketed by both RCA and Western Electric, the Western Electric <b>light</b> <b>valve</b> being capable of {{producing}} either variable-density or variable-area depending on which ribbon axis was parallel to the film motion, and the RCA galvanometer was {{capable of producing}} either variable-area or variable-density depending upon the particulars of the optical system.|$|E
50|$|The first LCOS device {{originated}} in 1973, {{followed by a}} development of a liquid-crystal <b>light</b> <b>valve</b> ten years later. It was not until 1993, that a microdisplay with a resolution sufficient {{for use as a}} display was reported by DisplayTech (now Citizen Finedevices).

The most common problem with the single- or two-DMD varieties is a visible “rainbow” which some people perceive when moving their eyes. More recent projectors with higher speed (2x or 4x) and otherwise optimised color wheels have lessened this effect. Systems with 3 DMDs never have this problem, as they display each primary color simultaneously.|$|R

50|$|Simple {{types of}} LCDs {{such as in}} pocket calculators are built without an {{internal}} light source, requiring external light sources to convey the display image to the user. Most LCD screens, however, are built with an internal light source. Such screens consist of several layers.
