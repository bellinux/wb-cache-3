5|$|At its {{southern}} end {{near the mouth}} of the Don River, the parkway begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the boulevard. The Gardiner–Don Valley ramps provide access to the section of the Gardiner Expressway west of the parkway. There is no access either from or to the Gardiner east of the parkway. To travel east from the southbound lanes of the parkway, motorists must exit via the off-ramp to <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Boulevard, which meets the <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> at a signalized intersection.|$|E

Clear <b>Lake</b> <b>Shores</b> is regarded as [...] "The Yachting Capital of Texas", as the city has more boat slips than people. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 1,063.|$|R
5|$|The highway was {{designed}} to run along the <b>lake</b> <b>shore,</b> instead of Dundas Street to the north, because the numerous hills encountered along Dundas would have increased costs without improving accessibility. Middle Road, a dirt lane named because of its position between the two, was not considered since <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> and Dundas were both overcrowded {{and in need of}} serious repairs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Drive was reconstructed in 1996 {{so that it}} {{no longer}} cut through the Museum Campus. Previously the {{northbound}} lanes ran east of Soldier Field. After reconstruction both northbound and southbound lanes ran west of Soldier Field.|$|E

5|$|Service on the <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Limited {{consists}} of reserved coach seating and Viewliner sleepers, {{as well as}} amenities like a dining car service. As the Erie station is not equipped with a ticket office, nor Amtrak's Quik-Trak ticket machines, all tickets from the station have to be pre-paid. The station is, however, equipped with a waiting room and public restrooms. The Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority's Route 20A, the downtown circulator, provides service between the station and downtown Erie. The bus only operates, however, at the scheduled arrival time of the eastbound <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Limited.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula {{became the}} <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> and Michigan Southern Railway in 1869, and absorbed the Buffalo and Erie Railroad later that year. The Pennsylvania Railroad leased the Erie and Pittsburgh for 999years in 1870. On March5, 1902, nearly 10,000people turned out at Union Depot to greet Prince Henry of Prussia during his {{tour of the}} United States; the prince {{remained}} in Erie for approximately 10minutes before his train continued to Buffalo and Niagara Falls, New York. On December22, 1914, the <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> and Michigan Southern Railroad was merged with the New York Central.|$|E

5|$|Two {{weeks after}} taking over service, Amtrak added the Boston-New Haven Bay State, which {{restored}} {{service on the}} B as far west as Springfield. Never successful, it was ended on March 1, 1975. The MBTA began subsidizing Penn Central commuter rail service between Boston and Framingham – but not the lone commuter trip to Worcester – in January 1973. Penn Central discontinued the Worcester trip on October 27, 1975; in response, Amtrak revived the dormant New York-Chicago <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Limited on October 31, with a new section running Boston-Albany and thus restoring service to Pittsfield. The <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Limited stopped at the east-of-downtown station {{that had been used}} from 1965 to 1971.|$|E
5|$|After {{rounding}} Mission Point, M-185 continues north-northwesterly {{along the}} eastern shore of Mackinac Island, first passing Dwightwood Spring then the Arch Rock viewing area just beyond the mile1 marker. The next two miles (3.2km) of M-185 are relatively isolated and devoid of major landmarks as the highway rounds Hennepin Point and runs along Voyageur's Bay. Other than a few picnic tables, the only feature between Arch Rock and mile3 is the <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Nature Trail, a short interpretive trail on the inland side of the road. Just beyond mile3, Scott's Shore Road, a short gravel-surfaced connecting roadway between <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Road and Scott's Road, departs inland near Point St. Clair. M-185 is bounded by the interior woods {{on one side and the}} beaches and rocky shores on the other through this area.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak, the {{national}} passenger rail system, provides service to Cleveland, via the Capitol Limited and <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Limited routes, which stop at Cleveland Lakefront Station.

50|$|In 1955 the lake, and a minor {{part of the}} <b>lake</b> <b>shores,</b> were {{designated}} a national park. The park, including the lake, covers an area of 0.73 km² and is managed by the National Forestry Institute (INAB) in conjunction {{with representatives of the}} local population. 20% of the <b>lake</b> <b>shores</b> are government property and 80% is privately owned.|$|R

5|$|M-185 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the U.S. state of Michigan that circles Mackinac Island, a popular tourist destination on the Lake Huron side of the Straits of Mackinac, along the island's shoreline. A narrow paved road of , it offers scenic views of the straits that divide the Upper and the Lower peninsulas of Michigan and Lakes Huron and Michigan. It has no connection to any other Michigan state trunkline highways—as it is on an island—and is accessible only by passenger ferry. The City of Mackinac Island, which shares jurisdiction over the island with the Mackinac Island State Park Commission (MISPC), calls the highway Main Street within the built-up area on the island's southeast quadrant, and <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Road elsewhere. M-185 passes by several important sites within Mackinac Island State Park, including Fort Mackinac, Arch Rock, British Landing, and Devil's Kitchen. <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Road carries the highway next to the Lake Huron shoreline, running between the water's edge and woodlands outside the downtown area.|$|E

5|$|On December 29, 1876, {{a bridge}} over Ohio's Ashtabula River collapsed. The bridge {{had been built}} from metal cast at one of Stone's mills, and was {{carrying}} a train {{owned and operated by}} Stone's <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> and Michigan Railway. Ninety-two people died; it was the worst rail disaster in American history up to that point. Blame fell heavily on Stone, who departed for Europe to recuperate and left Hay in charge of his businesses. The summer of 1877 was marked by labor disputes; a strike over wage cuts on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad soon spread to the <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore,</b> much to Hay's outrage. He blamed foreign agitators for the dispute, and vented his anger over the strike in his only novel, The Bread-Winners (1883).|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Village {{for housing}} athletes {{during the games}} {{would have been a}} $1.1-billion series of newly {{constructed}} lakefront buildings that would have been converted to rental and condominium units after the games. The village was to be located immediately south of McCormick Place, which was expected to host 11 event venues, on a current truck parking lot between South <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Drive and the Illinois Central Railroad tracks in the Near South Side and Douglas community areas. At the time, the parking lot was being used to stage events at McCormick Place. The village was slated to have pedways over <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Drive. This location was meant to enable 88% of the Olympic athletes to be within 15 minutes of their competition venue.|$|E
5|$|A $2.5 {{million bond}} issue passed in 1922 for a stadium {{conceived}} by Burnham. Designed by architects Holabird & Roche and named Soldier Field for {{the veterans of}} World War I, cost overruns required another bond issue in 1926. By 1924, the breakwater wall stretched from 14th to 55th Streets. In 1926, Soldier Field and a portion of <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Drive were opened. Landfilling extended from 23rd Street to 56th Street; however, Promontory Point was not complete, prompting complaints regarding garbage, blowing sand and odors. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, landfill efforts continued to fill in Burnham Park and the adjacent Northerly Island. The South Development was named for Daniel Burnham on January 14, 1927, and support increased for a world's fair in the park. Construction was completed on <b>Lake</b> <b>Shore</b> Drive, with northbound lanes named for Leif Erikson, and southbound lanes for Christopher Columbus. In 1929, construction of the park at Promontory Point began. The Great Depression delayed work and prevented construction of nearshore islands. Burnham Park was chosen for {{the site of the}} Century of Progress world's fair and a yacht basin was built south of 51st Street.|$|E
