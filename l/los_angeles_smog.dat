A number of pigment blends containing at least one ozone fugitive chemical component were found to change their apparent color after exposure to ozone.

5000|$|He {{joined the}} California Institute of Technology (Caltech) as Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering in 1967. Shortly after joining Caltech, he became {{intrigued}} with <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles's</b> historic <b>smog,</b> which, at that time, was near record highs. Caltech biology professor Ari Haagen-Smit had, {{in the early}} 1950s, surmised that ozone, the principal gaseous component of smog, results from reactions involving volatile hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Seinfeld realized that modeling the formation of smog over an urban area like <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> would involve describing mathematically the three-dimensional transport, mixing, and chemical reactions in the atmosphere. A key component was describing the chemistry of the sunlight-driven hydrocarbon - NOx system. At the time of Haagen-Smit's classic papers, the actual mechanism of the underlying chemistry was unknown. The essential role of the hydroxyl (OH) radical in tropospheric chemistry was not established until about 1970. Seinfeld and his group formulated a chemical mechanism for ozone formation and in 1973 developed the first urban-scale atmospheric chemical-transport model, which {{was applied to the}} <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> basin. This work, published in three papers in the journal, Atmospheric Environment, initiated what emerged as an entire field of scientific endeavor devoted to the modeling of tropospheric pollution. Although he continued to conduct research on optimization for several years, in the early 1970s he formed a major research group on atmospheric chemistry, aerosols, and atmospheric modeling. [...] As of 2009, he has served as mentor to 73 PhD graduates, about half of whom occupy faculty positions in major universities.|$|R

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of 86 vapor-phase, semivolatile, and particle-phase aromatic compounds are measured during a severe <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> photochemical <b>smog</b> episode. The measurements {{are part of}} a larger experiment designed to acquire a nearly complete description of organic air pollutants for use in verifying the predictions of photochemical airshed models for organics. Compound classes formed by grouping all aromatic hydrocarbons having the same number of aromatic rings show progressively declining concentrations as the number of aromatic rings is increased. Examination of the partitioning of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) between the gas and particle phases shows the transition from purely gaseous PAH at low molecular weight to purely particle-phase PAH at high molecular weight, with compounds such as the mutagen cyclopenta[cd]pyrene present about equally in both gas and particle phases. Primary aromatics, both the vapor-phase mono-aromatics and the PAH, show evidence of depletion by atmospheric chemical reaction over downwind transport with apparent depletion rates generally increasing as the degree of substitution of the aromatic rings increases. In contrast, many nitro-PAH and some oxy-PAH accumulate during downwind transport, consistent with their likely formation as products of atmospheric chemical reactions. Historical data generally show that aromatics concentrations declined substantially from the 1950 s to the 1980 s, but that concentrations measured during the present 1993 experiment are very similar to those measured during the mid- 1980 s including the August episode of the 1987 SCAQS experiment.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of 143 non-aromatic hydrocarbons are quantified in 36 samples (32 urban and 4 background) collected during a severe <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> area photochemical <b>smog</b> episode. Gas phase, semivolatile, and particle phase organic compounds are viewed simultaneously across the carbon number range from C_ 2 to C_(36). Compound classes studied include the n-alkanes, branched alkanes, n-alkenes, branched alkenes, diolefins, alkynes, saturated cyclic hydrocarbons, unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons, biogenic hydrocarbons, petroleum biomarkers, and the unresolved complex mixture {{contained within the}} semivolatile and particle phase organics samples. The abundance of the n-alkanes falls almost exponentially with increasing n-alkane carbon number, {{and the distribution of}} the n-alkanes between the gas and particle phases follows vapor/particle partitioning theory. The {{concentrations of}} individual low molecular weight alkenes decline during transport across the urban area in about the order expected given their initial rates of reaction with the hydroxyl radical. Petroleum biomarker concentrations that act as tracers for particulate organics emitted from vehicle exhaust have declined substantially between 1982 and 1993, reflecting the increased penetration of catalyst-equipped cars into the vehicle fleet. The most pronounced change in vapor phase non-aromatic hydrocarbons concentrations between 1987 and 1993 is a reduction in the concentration of the lightest blending components of gasoline (e. g., butanes), reflecting new regulations that limit the Reid vapor pressure of gasoline...|$|R

The thermal analyses revealed that 50 – 80 % of the submicron aerosol mass is volatile at 220 °C. Inspection of the shapes of thermo-nephelograms (bscat vs temperature) also revealed that photochemically formed aerosols have distinctly different thermo-nephelograms than those obtained on humid “hazy” days.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. This thesis discusses {{the formation of}} aerosol particles by homogeneous nucleation of supersaturated vapor, and the subsequent or simultaneous growth of particles by condensation. Experiments, theory, and numerical simulations are used to approach the underlying goal of understanding the aerosol evolution process in photochemically reactive systems, such as <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>smog.</b> A comprehensive size-sectionalized model was developed for simulating {{the evolution of a}} multicomponent aerosol size distribution through homogeneous nucleation, condensational growth, coagulation, and various deposition mechanisms. When applied to atmospheric photochemistry, the model predicted that the number of new particles nucleated is controlled by the ratio between the rates of homogeneous nucleation and condensational growth. A simple model was devised for predicting the number and size evolution of particles which would be formed by a burst of homogeneous nucleation. An interesting aspect of the model was its prediction of suppression of homogeneous nucleation by seed aerosol through bulk vapor depletion. Later these predictions were verified qualitatively in two systems. One was a physiochemically well characterized system where nucleation was driven by a high initial supersaturation ratio, in which nucleation was faster than predicted by classical nucleation theory, and suppression of nucleation was only slight. The second system was our outdoor smog chamber. In a large outdoor smog chamber, toluene and NO[ [...] . ] were allowed to photochemically react. Gas phase concentrations and the resulting aerosol distribution were followed with time, for various initial concentrations of reactants and seed aerosol. A few thousand seed particles per cm[ [...] . ] (sub-ambient concentrations) were sufficient to suppress homogeneous nucleation that would have resulted in several times as many particles. Operation of the chamber in dual mode allowed the influence of a single parameter, varied between {{the two sides of the}} bag, to be clearly observed, thus avoiding many of the difficulties that arise from comparing experiments conducted at different times and different temperature and sunlight histories...|$|E

But do {{you think}} about California when you eat {{strawberry}} shortcake? You should [...] California leads the nation in strawberry production. How about artichokes? California produces over 98 % of the artichokes raised in the United States. Dates? California produces over 99 % of the dates in the United States. Yes, California is all of these, and it is much more. California may well be the most diverse state in the United States. Within its 100. 2 million acres, California has the lowest place in the U. S. in Death Valley and one of the highest mountains with Mt. Whitney. Because California is such a diverse state and has a wide variety of micro- climates, it supports a uniquely diverse agriculture. Agriculture uses only about 36 million acres of its total 100. 2 million acres, and most of the cash return from crops is produced on 8, 6 million acres that are irrigated. California produces about 250 crops and livestock commodities (excluding nursery crops) and provides the U. S. with about 25 % of its table foods. California leads the nation in the production of 46 commercial crops and livestock commodities; its farmers and ranchers marketed $ 8. 6 billion of crop and livestock products in 1975, and the state’s harvested farm production in 1975 set a new record at 51. 1 million tons. HISTORY OF BIRD PROBLEMS Records such as this are not achieved without some risk. Crops growing in Cali- fornia have always had competition from many types of vertebrate pests. The wide variety of crops grown in California and the varied climates and situations in which they are grown has resulted in many different species of birds damaging crops. Birds have compet- ed with man for his crops since the dawn of agriculture. McAtee (1932) cited examples of bird damage that occurred {{in a wide variety of}} crops in California during the early 1900 s. During the 1920 s, many requests for Information and relief from damage caused by a wide variety of birds, culminated in the assignment, in May 1929, of two biologists, S. E. Piper and Johnson Neff, of the former U. S. Bio- logical Survey, to initiate field studies in California. In cooperation with the Cali- fornia Department of Food and Agriculture and County Agricultural Commissioners, the study was to determine the problems and devise control procedures relative to bird depredations. Piper and Neff found such damage as Horned Larks pulling sprouting crops, House Finches disbudding deciduous fruit trees and devouring mature fruit. Blackbirds were a problem in the rice crop. Early controls were varied and, for the most part, lacked effectiveness. Flagging of fields was common to deter Horned Larks. Windmill devices were tried to frighten birds. Shooting to kill birds was common; scarecrows were. used. The six-year study brought forth the basis of most of the depredating bird control techniques still in use in California. At the end of the study, these two biologists compiled a book called “Procedure and Methods in Controlling Birds Injurious to Crops in California. ” This was and still is the “Bible” for bird damage control techniques used in California. The thorough investigations conducted by these biologists resulted in techniques that have remained valid in California for over 40 years...|$|E
