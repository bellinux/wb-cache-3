25|$|Scientists have drilled {{only about}} 1.5km into the 6- to 7-kilometer-thick oceanic crust, so their {{understanding}} of oceanic crust comes largely from comparing ophiolite structure to seismic soundings of in situ oceanic crust. Oceanic crust has a layered velocity structure that implies a <b>layered</b> <b>rock</b> series similar to that listed above. In detail there are problems, with many ophiolites exhibiting thinner accumulations of igneous rock than are inferred for oceanic crust. Another problem relating oceanic crust and ophiolites is that the thick gabbro layer of ophiolites calls for large magma chambers beneath mid-ocean ridges. Seismic sounding of mid-ocean ridges has revealed only a few magma chambers beneath ridges, and these are quite thin. A few deep drill holes into oceanic crust have intercepted gabbro, {{but it is not}} layered like ophiolite gabbro.|$|E

Computational models capable of generating fracture geometries according to geomechanical principles offer a means to create a numerical representation of a more realistic rock mass structure. In this work, the combined finite-discrete element method is applied to investigate fracture patterns in <b>layered</b> <b>rocks.</b> First, a three-layer model undergoing layer normal compression is simulated with the aim of examining the controls on fracture spacing in <b>layered</b> <b>rocks.</b> Second, a seven-layer model with low competence contrast is modelled under direct tension parallel to the layering and bending conditions with the focus on investigating through-going fracture formation across layer interfaces. The numerical results give an insight into the understanding of various mechanisms that contribute to fracture pattern development in <b>layered</b> <b>rocks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Opportunity has {{investigated}} in detail rocks {{on the rim}} of the Noachian age Endeavour crater, where orbital spectral reflectance signatures indicate the presence of Fe(+ 3) -rich smectites. The signatures are associated with fine-grained, <b>layered</b> <b>rocks</b> containing spherules of diagenetic or impact origin. The <b>layered</b> <b>rocks</b> are overlain by breccias, and both units are cut by calcium sulfate veins precipitated from fluids that circulated after the Endeavour impact. Compositional data for fractures in the <b>layered</b> <b>rocks</b> suggest formation of Al-rich smectites by aqueous leaching. Evidence is thus preserved for water-rock interactions before and after the impact, with aqueous environments of slightly acidic to circum-neutral pH that would have been more favorable for prebiotic chemistry and microorganisms than those recorded by younger sulfate-rich rocks at Meridiani Planum...|$|R

40|$|<b>Layered</b> <b>rocks</b> in Arabia Terra {{have been}} the focus of several recent papers. Studies have focused on the layers found in crater basins located in the {{southwest}} portion of the region. However, Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images have identified layered deposits across the region. Terrestrial <b>layered</b> <b>rocks</b> are usually sedimentary, and often deposited in water. Thus extensive layered sequences in Arabia Terra may indicate locations of past, major depositional basins on Mars. Other mechanisms can also create <b>layered</b> <b>rocks,</b> or the appearance of <b>layered</b> <b>rocks,</b> including volcanism (both lava flows and ash falls), wind-blown deposits, and wave-cut terraces at shorelines. By identifying where in the region layers occur, and classifying the layers according to morphology and albedo, past depositional environments may be identified. Arabia Terra is characterized by heavily cratered Noachian plains, as well as a rise from - 4000 m in the northwest to 4000 m in the southeast (Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter [MOLA] datum). This slope may have provided a constraint on sediment deposition and thus layer formation. While most of the region is Noachian in age, a significant percentage of the area is identified as Hesperian. Although the history of the Arabia Terra initially seems to be straightforward cratered plains with several younger units atop them analysis of high-resolution imagery may reveal a more complex history...|$|R

25|$|The first {{recognition}} of widespread sedimentary rock on Mars {{came from the}} Mars Orbiter Camera which found that several areas of the planet - including Valles Marineris and Terra Arabia - have horizontally <b>layered,</b> light-toned <b>rocks.</b> Follow-up observations of those rocks' mineralogy by OMEGA found that some are rich in sulfate minerals, and that other <b>layered</b> <b>rocks</b> around Mawrth Vallis are rich in phyllosilicates.

40|$|Many <b>layered</b> igneous <b>rocks</b> {{consist of}} two main parts: the cumulus (plus adcumulus and heteradcumulus) {{material}} and the pore material, or mesostasis, produced by the crystallization of the trapped liquid. Knowledge of the chemistry of the mesostasis will be useful in deducing magma fractionation trends and in the determination of solid/liquid trace element partition coefficients, which in turn will be significant in helping to elucidate the petrogenetic relation-ship between certain basalts and layered gabbros. A new geochemical method for the deter-mination of both the composition and amount of mesostasis in <b>layered</b> <b>rocks</b> is proposed. This method uses elements of contrasting behaviour and is best applied to rhythmically <b>layered</b> <b>rocks</b> rich in mafic or felsic minerals.

Thin veneers (from [...]5mm to 2mm thick) of slate, schist, or sandstone (metamorphic rocks) are pulled away from the original thicker stone slabs by adhering a thin layer of fiberglass/polyester resin composite backing.
