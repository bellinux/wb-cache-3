Using the specification of a monitoring interpreter, polyvariant type specialization can produce compiled code that is guaranteed to obey a specified safety policy. It propagates a security state at compile-time and generates code for each different security state. The resulting code contains virtually no run-time operations on the security state, at the price of some code duplication. A novel extension of type specialization by intersection types limits the amount of code duplication considerably, thus making the approach practical. A few years back, mobile code was merely an exciting research subject. Meanwhile, the situation has changed dramatically and mobile code is about to invade our everyday lives.

40|$|Caches {{are notorious}} for their unpredictability. It is {{difficult}} or even impossible to predict if a memory access results in a definite cache hit or miss. This unpredictability is highly undesired for real-time systems. The Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) of a software running on an embedded processor {{is one of the}} most important metrics during real-time system design. The WCET depends to a large extent on the total amount of time spent for memory accesses. In the presence of caches, WCET analysis must always assume a memory access to be a cache miss if it can not be guaranteed that it is a hit. Hence, WCETs for cached systems are imprecise due to the overestimation caused by the caches. Modern caches can be controlled by software. The software can <b>load</b> <b>parts</b> of its code or of its data into the cache and lock the cache afterwards. Cache locking prevents the cache’s contents from being flushed by deactivating the replacement. A locked cache is highly predictable and leads to very precise WCET estimates, because the uncertainty caused by the replacement strategy is eliminated completely. This paper presents techniques exploring the lockdown of instruction caches at compile-time to minimize WCETs. In contrast to the current state of the art in the area of cache locking, our techniques explicitly take the worst-case execution path into account during each step of the optimization procedure. This way, we can make sure that always those parts of the code are locked in the I-cache that lead to the highest WCET reduction. The results demonstrate that WCET reductions from 54 % up to 73 % can be achieved with an acceptable amount of CPU seconds required for the optimization and WCET analyses themselves...|$|E

Many other software products, including operating systems, <b>load</b> <b>parts</b> of themselves from a server across a network. Although users may be confident that their workstation is physically secure, some part of the network to which they are attached almost certainly is not secure. Most proposals that recommend cryptographic means to protect remotely loaded software also eliminate the advantages of remote loading-for example, ease of reconfiguration, upgrade distribution, and maintenance. For this reason, they have largely been abandoned before finding their way into commercial products. The article shows that, contrary to intuition, it is no more difficult to protect a workstation that loads its software across an insecure network than to protect a stand-alone workstation. In contrast to prevailing practice, the authors make essential use of a collision-rich hash function to ensure that an exhaustive off-line search by the opponent will produce not one, but many candidate pass words.

40|$|Infrastructural {{projects}} such as roads and railway tracks are usually built on an embankment of sand or granular material. When building on soft soils, the prevention of differential settlements and resulting damage is traditionally done by including a long consolidation period in the construction process. One method to decrease construction time {{is to use a}} pile foundation beneath the embankment. If a geosynthetic reinforcement layer (GR) is used in the base of the embankment, the construction is called a basal reinforced piled embankment. Because of the friction within the fill, the piles do not only carry the weight of the soil directly on top of them, but also part of the load above the field between the piles. This effect, called arching, is increased by the use of a GR. Furthermore, the GR itself transfers additional load to the pile. Only the residual load is now carried by the soft subsoil. Thus three <b>load</b> <b>parts</b> can be defined: arching A, GR load B and subsoil support C. The better the amount of arching can be determined, the more economically can the embankment and GR be designed. This thesis uses numerical analysis to validate a new arching model, the concentric arches model by Van Eekelen et al. (2013). First, a numerical model is designed and validated using measurements done in a scaled laboratory test and measurements done in a full-scale field situation. Then, parameters in the validated numerical model are varied and the results are compared to predictions of the concentric arches model as well as two other models that are currently in use, the Hewlett and Randolph (1988) model and the Zaeske (2001) model The numerical calculations and the predictions of the concentric arches method show strong similarities, especially for higher top loads and when the influence of the fill’s friction angle is of importance. The concentric arches model performs better in this respect than the Hewlett and Randolph model and qualitatively similar to the Zaeske model. Special consideration is given to the design of low embankment, in which full arches cannot develop. This occurrence of partial arching is mainly of importance during construction. The numerical model shows that the shape of the arches changes in these cases compared to higher embankments. This is not what is assumed in the concentric arches model, which models arches of the same shape, but limited to a smaller surface than in higher embankments. Both these phenomena however have similar effect on the amount of arching, which means the concentric arches model gives very satisfactory results for low embankment heights as well.

40|$|A basal {{reinforced}} piled embankment {{consists of}} a reinforced embankment on a pile foundation. The reinforcement consists {{of one or more}} horizontal layers of geosynthetic reinforcement (GR) installed {{at the base of the}} embankment. The design of the GR is the subject of this thesis. A basal reinforced piled embankment can be used for the construction of a road or a railway when a traditional construction method would require too much construction time, affect vulnerable objects nearby or give too much residual settlement, making frequent maintenance necessary. The GR strain needs to be calculated to design the GR. Multiplying this GR strain by the GR stiffness gives the tensile force, which needs to be smaller than the long-term GR tensile strength. The GR strain is calculated in two steps. Calculation step 1 divides the load – the weight of the embankment fill, road construction and traffic load – into two <b>load</b> <b>parts.</b> One part (load part A) is transferred to the piles directly. This part is relatively large because a load tends to be transferred to the stiffer parts of a construction. This mechanism is known as ‘arching’. The second, residual load part (B+C) rests on the GR (B) and the underlying subsoil (C). Calculation step 2 determines the GR strain on the basis of the result of step 1. Only the GR strips between each pair of adjacent piles are considered: they are loaded by B+C and may or may not be supported by the subsoil. The GR strain can be calculated if the distribution of load part B+C on the GR strip, the amount of subsoil support and the GR stiffness are known. An implicit result of this calculation step is the further division of load part B+C into parts B and C. Several methods for the GR design are available, all with their own models for calculation steps 1 and 2. The methods give results that differ immensely. The Dutch CUR 226 (2010) and the German EBGEO (2010) adopted Zaeske’s method (2001). However, measurements that were published later (Van Duijnen et al., 2010; Van Eekelen et al., 2015 a) showed that this method could be calculating much higher GR strains than those measured in practice, leading to heavier and more expensive designs than necessary. The objective of the present study was to establish a clearer picture of load distribution in a basal reinforced piled embankment and, on that basis, to develop and validate an analytical design model for the geosynthetic reinforcement in a piled embankment. The results were described in five papers published in the international scientific journal ‘Geotextiles and Geomembranes’. Those journal papers can be found in Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and Appendix A of this thesis (Van Eekelen et al., 2012 a, 2012 b, 2013, 2015 a and 2011 respectively). Chapter 2 presents a series of twelve 3 D experiments that were carried out at the Deltares laboratory. The scaled model tests were carried out under high surcharge loads to achieve stress situations comparable with those in practice. A unique feature of these tests was that <b>load</b> <b>parts</b> A, B and C could be measured separately, making it possible to compare the measurements with calculation steps 1 and 2 separately. In these tests (static load, laboratory scale), smooth relationships were obtained between the net load on the fill (surcharge load minus subsoil support) and several measured parameters such as load distribution and deformation. Consolidation of the subsoil resulted in an increase in arching (more A) and more tensile force in the GR (more B and more GR strain). The measured response to consolidation depends on the fill’s friction angle. A higher friction angle results in more arching during consolidation. One of the major conclusions based on the test series was that the load on a GR strip is approximately distributed as an inverse triangle, with the lowest pressure in the centre and higher pressure close to the piles. This conclusion was the basis for the remainder of this doctorate study and the development of the new calculation model. Chapter 3 considers calculation step 2. This chapter starts by comparing the measurements in the experiments with the calculation results of step 2 of the Zaeske (2001) model, which uses a triangular load distribution on the GR strip and considers the support of the subsoil underneath the GR strip only. It was found that Zaeske’s model calculates GR strains that are larger than the measured GR strains (approximately a factor of two for GR strains larger than 1 %). Chapter 3 continues with the suggestion of two modifications to Zaeske’s step 2. Firstly, the load distribution is changed from a triangular to an inverse triangular load distribution. Secondly, the subsoil support is extended from the support by the subsoil underneath the GR strip to the subsoil underneath the entire GR between the piles. The new step 2 model with these modifications produces a much better fit with field measurements than Zaeske’s model. Chapter 4 considers calculation step 1, the arching. Additional tests were conducted for this purpose, varying factors such as the fill height. This chapter gives an overview of the existing arching models and introduces a new model. This Concentric Arches model (CA model) is an adaptation and extension of the models of Hewlett and Randolph (1988), and Zaeske (2001), which have been adopted in several European design guidelines. Some countries use piled embankments without GR. Introducing GR changes the load distribution considerably. A major part of the load is then exerted on the piles and the residual load is mainly exerted on the GR strips between the piles, with the load being distributed approximately as an inverse triangle. Chapter 4 explains the development of the load distribution as a result of continuing GR deflection; new small arches grow within the older larger ones. Smaller arches exert less load on their subsurface. This idea is related to the concentric arches of the new model, which gives an almost perfect description of the observed load distribution in the limit state situation. Furthermore, the new model describes the influence of the fill strength and embankment height correctly. Chapter 5 compares the existing, and the newly introduced, design models with measurements from seven full-scale projects and four series of scaled model experiments. Two of these seven field projects were conducted in the Netherlands and they were carried out in part for this doctorate research. One of the four experimental series – the one presented in Chapters 2 and 4 – was conducted specifically for the present research. The other measurements were reported earlier in the literature. The calculations were carried out using mean, best-guess values for the material properties. The calculation results from the CA model match the measurements much better than the results of the arching models of Hewlett and Randolph (1988), and of Zaeske (2001). The results of the CA model are also the closest match with the results of the 3 D numerical calculations, as described in Van der Peet and Van Eekelen (2014). These authors also show that the new CA model responds better to changes in the fill friction angle than any of the other models considered. When there is no subsoil support, or almost no subsoil support, the inverse triangular load distribution on the GR strips between adjacent piles gives the best match with the measurements. When there is significant subsoil support, the load distribution is approximately uniform. This difference between the situation with or without subsoil support is understandable when one considers that most load is attracted to the construction parts that move least. In the cases with limited subsoil support, the load distribution that gives the minimum GR strain should be used to find the best match with the measurements. The GR strain calculated with Zaeske’s model is on average 2. 46 times the measured GR strain. The GR strain calculated with the new model is on average 1. 06 times the measured GR strain. The calculated GR strain is therefore almost a perfect match with the measured GR strain. The new Dutch CUR 226 (2015) has therefore adopted the model proposed in this thesis.
