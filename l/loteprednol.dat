5000|$|In 2014, a Phase 3 {{clinical}} trial for treating inflammation and pain after cataract surgery, and a Phase 2 trial for treating dry eye disease were initiated using nanoparticle <b>loteprednol</b> etabonate.

5000|$|Common {{adverse effects}} include foreign body {{sensation}} in the eye, dry eye and epiphora (overflow of tears), chemosis (swelling of the conjunctiva), headache, and itching. Increased intraocular pressure (IOP), {{a side effect}} typical of corticosteroids, occurs in about 2% of patients (compared to 7% under prednisolone acetate, an older anti-inflammatory agent which is prescribed after eye surgery, and 0.5% under placebo). [...] <b>Loteprednol</b> is also {{far less likely to}} cause elevated IOP compared to dexamethasone.|$|E
5000|$|These retrometabolic design {{strategies}} were introduced by Nicholas Bodor, {{one of the}} first and most prominent advocates for the early integration of metabolism, pharmacokinetic and general physicochemical considerations in the drug design process. [...] These drug design concepts recognize the importance of design-controlled metabolism and directly focus not on the increase of activity alone but on the increase of the activity/toxicity ratio (therapeutic index) in order to deliver the maximum benefit while also reducing or eliminating unwanted side effects. The importance of this field is reviewed in a book dedicated to the subject (Bodor, N.; Buchwald, P.; Retrometabolic Drug Design and Targeting, 1st ed., Wiley & Sons, 2012), as well as by a full chapter of Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Design, 7th ed. (2010) with close to 150 chemical structures and more than 450 references. [...] At the time of its introduction, the idea of designed-in metabolism represented a significant novelty and was against mainstream thinking then in place that instead focused on minimizing or entirely eliminating drug metabolism. Bodor's work on these design concepts developed during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and came to prominence during the mid-1990s. <b>Loteprednol</b> etabonate, a soft corticosteroid designed and patented by Bodor received final Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 1998 as the active ingredient of two ophthalmic preparations (Lotemax and Alrex), currently the only corticosteroid approved by the FDA for use in all inflammatory and allergy-related ophthalmic disorders. Its safety for long-term use [...] further supports the soft drug concept, and in 2004, <b>loteprednol</b> etabonate [...] was also approved as part of a combination product (Zylet). A second generation of soft corticosteroids such as etiprednol dicloacetate is in development for a full spectrum of other possible applications such as nasal spray for rhinitis or inhalation products for asthma.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Topical {{corticosteroids}} {{are routinely}} used as postoperative ocular anti-inflammatory drugs; how-ever, adverse effects such as increased intraocular pressure (IOP) are observed with their use. While older corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and predniso-lone acetate offer good anti-inflammatory efficacy, clinically {{significant increases in}} IOP (C 10 mmHg) are often associated with their use. <b>Loteprednol</b> eta-bonate, a novel C- 20 ester-based corticosteroid, was retrometabolically designed to offer potent anti-inflammatory efficacy but with decreased impact on IOP. After exerting its therapeutic effects {{on the site of}} action, <b>loteprednol</b> etabonate is rapidly converted to inactive metabolites, resulting in fewer adverse effects. Randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy and safety of <b>loteprednol</b> etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0. 5 % for the treatment of postoperative inflammation in post-cataract patients with few patients, if any, exhibiting clinically signif-icant increases (C 10 mmHg) in IOP. Furthermore, safety studies demonstrated a minimal effect of <b>loteprednol</b> etabonate on IOP with long-term use or in steroid responders with a much lower propensity to increase IOP relative to prednisolone acetate or dexamethasone. The anti-inflammatory treatment effect of <b>loteprednol</b> etabonate appears to be similar to that of rimexolone and difluprednate with less impact on IOP compared to difluprednate, although confirmatory comparative studies are needed. The available clinical data suggest that <b>loteprednol</b> etabon-ate is an efficacious and safe corticosteroid for the treatment of postoperative inflammation...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} for developing new antiallergic/antiasthmatic agents. One {{of them is}} the improvement of an existing class of effective drug classes. Due to some undesired effects of intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids, {{there is a need for}} better tolerated corticosteroids. <b>Loteprednol</b> etabonate belongs to the so-called class of soft steroids because it is metabolized by a onestep reaction (hydrolysis) without using the cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase system. In in vitro investigations using human cells, <b>loteprednol</b> inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines (e. g., TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, IL- 4, IL- 5) according to its relative binding potency to the glucocorticoid receptor. In in vivo animal studies, <b>loteprednol</b> effectively inhibited allergically induced vascular leakage in the nasal cavity of actively sensitized Brown Norway rats and rhinorrhea in actively sensitized domestic pigs following nasal challenge. In several models of allergic asthma, it was clearly demonstrated that <b>loteprednol</b> was able to suppress the allergically induced late phase eosinophilia in mice, rats and guinea pigs. After intrapulmonary administration of <b>loteprednol,</b> only a slight, statistically nonsignificant reduction in thymus weight was observed in a dose range far less than the therapeutically relevant doses. Its therapeutic ratio is clearly superior to those of beclomethasone and budesonide. <b>Loteprednol</b> is a safe steroid with an extremely wide range between therapeutic and side effect inducing doses. Its elimination profile, its pronounced binding to plasma protein and erythrocytes and the low oral bioavailability makes this drug highly suitable for nasal or pulmonary use. (C) 2000 Prous Science.

40|$|Background: Seasonal {{allergic}} conjunctivitis (SAC) {{one of the}} most common ocular immunological disorder affecting wide population. Various classes of drugs are been used to control allergic inflammation. Traditionally topical glucocorticoids have been used for SAC. However, repeated and continuous use of steroids is associated with various complications like increase in intraocular pressure, posterior sub capsular cataract, increased susceptibility for infections and delayed wound healing. Hence the current emphasis is to prefer topical NSAIDs as they are free from various steroid related complications. As there is paucity of information regarding the comparative efficacy of topical steroids and NSAIDs, the present study was taken up. The main objective was to study the comparative efficacy and safety of three topical NSAIDs: flurbiprofen, diclofenac, ketorolac and the topical steroid <b>loteprednol,</b> in SAC. Methods: A prospective, comparative study enrolled 40 patients for SAC. All study drugs were instilled 4 times daily for 4 weeks. Patients were assessed for objective and subjective parameters of inflammation at baseline and weekly intervals for 4 weeks using four point scales, and also observed for any side effects. The anti-inflammatory action was assessed by the change in mean scores from basal and at various intervals. Results: <b>Loteprednol</b> was more effective than the three NSAIDs, only ketorolac comparable to <b>loteprednol</b> in relieving ocular itching.

Pterygia show characteristic histological features {{that suggest that}} inflammation plays {{a prominent role in}} their initial pathogenesis and recurrence. Appropriate surgery is the key to successful treatment of pterygia, {{but there is also a}} rationale for the use of anti-inflammatory agents to reduce the rate of recurrence following surgery. Multiple surgical techniques have been developed over the last two millennia, but these initially had little success, due to high rates of recurrence. Current management strategies, associated with lower recurrence rates, include bare sclera excision and various types of grafts using tissue glues. Adjunctive therapies include mitomycin C and 5 -fluorouracil, as well as the topical ocular steroid <b>loteprednol</b> etabonate, which has been shown to have a lower risk of elevated intraocular pressure than have the other topical ocular steroids. Here, the surgical management of pterygium is presented from a historical perspective, and current management techniques, including the appropriate use of various adjunctive therapies, are reviewed, along with an illustrative case presentation and a discussion of the conjunctival forceps designed to facilitate surgical management. Despite thousands of years of experience with this condition, there remains a need for a more thorough understanding of pterygium and interventions to reduce both its incidence and postsurgical recurrence.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Loteprednol</b> {{etabonate}} (LE) {{is a novel}} soft steroid {{that was}} designed to improve the benefit/risk ratio of topical corticosteroid therapy. This study assesses the clinical efficacy and safety of three different doses of LE nasal spray in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). METHODS: In this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial 165 subjects with SAR to grass pollen received daily single doses of either 100, 200, 400 microg LE nasal spray, or placebo for 14 days. The patients underwent three 4 -h allergen challenges with grass pollen in an environmental exposure unit at a screening visit (baseline) and on days 7 and 14 of treatment. Standardized nasal symptom scores were obtained every 20 min. Nasal flow, nasal secretions, and FEV(1) were measured every hour during allergen challenges. RESULTS: After 14 days of treatment, patients who received 400 microg LE had significantly lower total nasal symptom scores compared with those receiving placebo (P = 0. 007).

We describe the development of a novel ophthalmic gel formulation of <b>loteprednol</b> etabonate (LE), a C- 20 ester-based corticosteroid with an established safety profile, in the treatment of ocular inflammatory conditions. The new LE gel formulation is non-settling, eliminating the need to shake the product to resuspend the drug, has a pH close to that of tears, and a low preservative concentration. The rheological characteristics of LE gel are such that the formulation is instilled as a drop and transitions to a fluid upon instillation in the eye, yet retains sufficient viscosity to prolong ocular surface retention. The new formulation provides consistent, uniform dosing as evidenced by dose extrusion studies, while pharmacokinetic studies in rabbits demonstrated rapid and sustained exposure to LE in ocular tissues following instillation of LE gel. Finally, results from two clinical studies of LE gel in the treatment of postoperative inflammation and pain following cataract surgery indicate that it was safe and effective.

LE is highly lipophilic and binds with high affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor; any unbound LE is metabolized to inactive metabolites. LE has been studied in several anterior segment inflammatory conditions (giant papillary conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca), and in postoperative ocular inflammation and pain. Combined with tobramycin, it is effective in blepharokeratoconjunctivitis. Elevations in IOP are infrequent with LE, and the absence of a C- 20 ketone precludes formation of Schiff base intermediates with lens proteins, a common first step implicated in cataract formation with ketone steroids...|$|E
40|$|Pterygium is an {{ocular disease}} characterised by {{the growth of}} fibrovascular {{conjunctiva}} on the cornea. It occurs more often in men, at an older age, and in individuals exposed to ultraviolet radiation. Surgical treatment is the primary treatment for pterygium {{and there are two}} common procedures for pterygium excision. In the first method, the head of the pterygium is separated from the corneal surface using a surgical blade. The second method is based on avulsion. Other approaches to excising the pterygium include the use of argon laser and excimer laser. Because of a high recurrence rate, adjuvant therapies, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and graft procedures, are used after pterygium excision. These procedures have become the standard long-term treatments for pterygium. Radiotherapy is based on beta irradiation. Chemotherapy includes the use of mitomycin C, 5 -fluorouracil, bevacizumab, and <b>loteprednol</b> etabonate. Graft procedures include amniotic membrane grafts and conjunctival autografts. Many surgeons believe that using mitomycin C and conjunctival autografts provides the best outcomes in terms of recurrence, cosmetics and patient satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Conjunctival {{adherence}} of a tick is {{an uncommon}} event with few reports previously {{cited in the}} literature. We report a unique case of tick penetration, specifically a black-legged deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), into the conjunctiva. Observations: This patient experienced a 3 -week history of unilateral mild ocular pain, decreased vision, and pigmented lesion of her right eye. Slit lamp examination demonstrated a tick attached to the conjunctiva. Pathology confirmed the insect exoskeleton. Visual appreciation of the tick demonstrated probable deer tick larval stage given the shape, size, pigmentation pattern and geographic location of the specimen. Polymyxin-trimethoprim eye drops were prescribed for use three times daily and <b>loteprednol</b> twice daily. Conclusions and importance: Despite the low risk for Lyme disease, which is endemic to the Adirondack region where the patient was affected, doxycycline was prescribed for prophylaxis. In any case of suspected tick penetration to the ocular surface, immediate ophthalmologic consultation and prompt removal via the method mentioned above is recommended, as well as attention paid to the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines regarding prophylaxis...|$|E
