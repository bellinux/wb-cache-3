5000|$|At the inquest, ex-club owner Stanley Wilcock gave {{evidence}} of {{there being a}} door behind the bar. This was an inward opening <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> <b>door,</b> which would have given access to the outside {{front of the building}} and a drop of 2 floors, but the fitting of a false dance floor in the club prevented it from opening. It was disclosed the door could be opened but it needed to be lifted over the false floor for it to open, [...] something customers in their panic had never thought about. If this door had been opened all victims would probably have escaped. It was established that the blaze was so intense due to the highly flammable solvents and paints used in the furniture workshop. The cause of death was given as smoke inhalation. The fire never fully reached the top floor but the hot gases and smoke soon filled the whole building. Despite an investigation by the Police and Fire Brigade, no actual cause for the fire could be given and the Coroner recorded an open verdict.|$|E

50|$|The main factory {{building}} is two stories high, rectangular, and runs parallel to George Street, on a north-south axis. It is constructed of concrete, with a brick extension to the north, and has fibrous cement sheeting and battens {{on the upper}} levels {{to the north and}} south. It has a gabled roof of galvanised iron with skylights, and a clerestory runs along the apex of {{the southern part of the}} roof. The western side of the building facing George Street has been stuccoed. There are four doors, a high-set roller door, and two hatches on the western side of the factory, five roller doors on the south side, and a roller door on the north side. There is a high-set <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> with roller <b>door</b> on the southern end of the east side, and a concrete loading dock juts out between this and the engine room to the north. Windows are generally steel-framed with wire-covered panes, or consist of panelled glass louvres.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the robbers}} had inside information, all the {{employees}} were accounted for, handcuffed, and forced {{down on the}} floor. At gunpoint, the shift supervisor was forced to deactivate the alarm system {{as well as all}} additional silent alarms within the vault and escort the robbers inside the vault. The supervisor was forced to open the cargo <b>bay</b> <b>door.</b> The robbers drove the van into the <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> and packed it with every bag of currency (from overseas military monetary exchanges) and jewelry they found in the vault.|$|R
5000|$|The goods shed was {{constructed}} in a different style to the station building, its character owing more to local traditional construction. It housed a crane and a side <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> with tall <b>doors</b> and a canopy for road vehicles; a smaller office building was tacked on to the side. The adjacent goods yard was served by five sidings. In addition, eight railway cottages were constructed nearby for staff. Access to the goods yard and exit from the Down loop serving platform 1 was controlled by [...] "South Box" [...] (or [...] "B Box") which was brought into use on 27 April 1902 and situated {{to the west of}} the station, although it was only infrequently used. On the opposite side of the station at the end of the Up main line platform was [...] "North Box" [...] (or [...] "A Box"), which replaced a previous box known as Stammerham Junction dating from 1865, possibly at the same time as South Box was brought into use or even a few days earlier.|$|R

50|$|Containers, {{trucks and}} {{trailers}} are typically loaded / unloaded {{from the rear}} by reversing the vehicle up against a raised concrete <b>loading</b> <b>bay,</b> the cargo is then moved using counterbalanced forklift trucks. The <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> {{is designed to be}} at approximately the height of the vehicle with a leveling device to accommodate any height differences.There are however many situations where {{it is not possible to}} utilize a permanent <b>loading</b> <b>bay.</b> In these situations, a yard ramp is an ideal solution, providing fast, efficient loading and unloading of trucks/trailers by forklifts. The possession of a yard ramp also provides a backup in case of any problems encountered with a normal loading bay/dock leveler system, and can also provide additional flexibility should vehicles be encountered that the normal <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> cannot cope with.|$|R

50|$|A <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> is {{a room in}} a theatre {{which is}} usually quite large. It {{generally}} has a <b>bay</b> <b>door</b> (a large metal door which rolls up, at least {{the size of the}} opening on a standard semi-trailer) at opposite sides of the room, one for a truck and the other for access to the stage. Sometimes sets and equipment for a traveling show are delivered through a bay, other times, the bay could be used for delivery of supplies and lumber for set construction. In a smaller theaters, the bay may serve as a theater, green room, or scene shop.In most union work, teamsters and grips who unload trucks and move equipment are different from the carpenters, electricians, and other stagehands who assemble a show. By Union rules, generally teamsters are not permitted to work on the actual performance, and the stagehands are not allowed to even enter trucks. This exists primarily because loading and unloading trailers {{is one of the most}} dangerous jobs in theatre and performance.|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{there were}} two levels. The upper level held seats for 32. The lower level was used for freight or to carry bombs when used in the bombing role, with two large {{duralumin}} bomb <b>bay</b> <b>doors.</b> The floor was made of wood, with nine detachable panels, that helped with the accommodation (through the bomb <b>bay</b> <b>doors)</b> of heavy <b>loads.</b> The cockpit held four: two pilots, with the first (on the left) with an armoured seat, a mechanic and an engineer/gunner.|$|R

5|$|The {{survivors}} told Coast Guard {{officials that}} during the storm, one of the engines of the plane failed, along {{with most of the}} electrical power; as a result, the crew was unable to drop the reserve tank or close the bomb <b>bay</b> <b>doors</b> automatically. Before the crew could close the bomb <b>bay</b> <b>doors</b> manually, the plane crashed in shark-infested waters and broke apart; three of the crewmen were {{able to get out of}} the downed plane, but the other seven were unable to escape. The three survivors were then attacked by sharks before being rescued.|$|R

5000|$|Some weapons [...] {{require that}} the weapon's {{guidance}} system acquire the target while the weapon is still attached to the aircraft. This forces relatively extended operations with the <b>bay</b> <b>doors</b> open.|$|R
30|$|An {{alternative}} {{solution is to}} establish centralized receiving stations, deploying a third-party logistics partner receiving the goods at the <b>loading</b> <b>bays</b> and carrying them to the stores whenever the retailer prefers. Although this initiative is relatively unexplored, it could reduce parking congestion since (1) it reduces the parking durations, and therefore increase the parking turnover at the <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> and (2) it gives vehicles’ drivers more freedom in choosing the arrival time and in scheduling their deliveries. However, to be effective, we recommend that such centralized receiving stations should (1) operate off-peak and outside the store opening times and (2) {{should be able to}} handle pick-ups, namely retrieving the goods from the stores and staging them at the <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> until the drivers arrive at the mall.|$|R
