In Stoke Bishop, Wills Hall {{on the edge of}} the Clifton Downs was the first to be opened, in 1929, by the then chancellor, Winston Churchill. Its original quadrangle layout has been expanded twice, in 1962 and 1990. Churchill Hall, named for the chancellor, followed in 1956, then Badock Hall in 1964. At the time of Badock Hall's establishment, some of the buildings were called Hiatt Baker Hall, but two years later, Hiatt Baker moved to its own site and is now the largest hall in the university. The first self-catering hall in Stoke Bishop was University Hall, established in 1971 with expansion in 1992.

25|$|Living in Bloomington, he {{was able}} to attend the seminary while <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> making the {{education}} affordable for him. Many of his classmates were from wealthier families, and he earned money by selling them nuts and fruits he picked in the forest around his home. Wright received a classical education, learning Greek and Latin. He graduated in 1828 and decided to become a lawyer. He studied law in the office of Craven Hester, one of southern Indiana's leading judges and political figures, and was admitted to the bar in 1829. He then moved to Rockville where he opened a law practice where he met Louisa Cook, the daughter of a wealthy local farmer. She was an ardent Methodist who converted Wright before the couple married on November 30, 1831. The couple had a son, but Louisa's poor health and several bouts with malaria prevented her from having more children, leading them to adopt a daughter in 1832. Wright became very active in the Methodist Church and an outspoken advocate of Sunday School and religious study in public schools. Much of his early support came from the church and many of his campaign rallies were held in Methodist churches.|$|E

500|$|Ruth K. MacDonald of New Mexico State University {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter points out that, as in Benjamin Bunny, domesticity is implicitly {{approved}} in the tale but reflects a sea-change in Potter’s life and work. Peter no longer raids McGregor’s garden for vegetables but grows his own and has his plot surrounded with a fence and chicken wire to keep predatory bunnies out. In effect, he has become McGregor. He is Potter's alter ego and, though he is a mature rabbit in The Flopsy Bunnies, he is still <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> {{with his mother and}} tending a garden with her [...] like Potter, who had achieved a degree of independence by 1909 but was not entirely free of her parents.|$|E

At 14 he began working in a textile factory, and soon rose to a white collar job there at a salary of 10 rubles a month, {{which would have been}} decent even for an adult. [...] Still <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> he began to frequent the disreputable district of Moldovanka.

500|$|Hemingway {{returned}} home early in 1919 {{to a time}} of readjustment. Not yet 20 years old, he had gained from the war a maturity that was at odds with <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> without a job and {{with the need for}} recuperation. As Reynolds explains, [...] "Hemingway could not really tell his parents what he thought when he saw his bloody knee. He could not say how scared he was in another country with surgeons who could not tell him in English if his leg was coming off or not." [...] In September, he took a fishing and camping trip with high school friends to the back-country of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The trip became the inspiration for his short story [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", in which the semi-autobiographical character Nick Adams takes to the country to find solitude after returning from war. A family friend offered him a job in Toronto, and with nothing else to do, he accepted. Late that year he began as a freelancer, staff writer, and foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star Weekly. He returned to Michigan the following June and then moved to Chicago in September 1920 to live with friends, while still filing stories for the Toronto Star.|$|E

His debut came later in 1978 with the story Wonder Island, which was published in Weekly Shōnen Jump. However, he did not rise to popularity until the comedy series Dr. Slump, which was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1980 to 1984.
