25|$|Pure oxygen {{activated}} sludge aeration systems are sealed-tank reactor vessels with surface aerator type impellers mounted within the tanks at the oxygen atmosphere-mixed liquor surface interface. The amount of oxygen entrainment, or DO (Dissolved Oxygen), {{can be controlled}} by a weir adjusted <b>level</b> <b>control,</b> and a vent gas oxygen controlled oxygen feed valve. Oxygen is generated on site by cryogenic distillation of air, pressure swing adsorption, or other methods. These systems are used where wastewater plant space is at a premium and high sewage throughput is required as high energy costs are involved in purifying oxygen.|$|E
25|$|News reporting, documentary, {{and human}} {{interest}} broadcast operations often used portable Marantz PMD-series recorders for {{the recording of}} speech interviews. The key advantages of the Marantz portable recorders were the accommodation of professional microphones with an XLR connector, normal and double tape speed recording for extended frequency response, Dolby and dbx noise reduction systems, manual or automatic gain control (AGC) <b>level</b> <b>control,</b> peak limiter, multiple tape formulation accommodation, microphone and line level input connections, unbalanced RCA stereo input and output connections, live or tape monitoring, VU meter, headphone jack, playback pitch control, and operation on AC power or batteries optimized for long duration. Unlike less-expensive portable recorders that were limited to automatic gain control (AGC) recording schemes, the manual recording mode preserved low noise dynamics and avoided the automatic elevation of noise.|$|E
25|$|After {{the demise}} of the Ninety-Eight in 1996, Oldsmobile added the Regency to the 1997 and 1998 lineups, which used the same front fenders and chrome grille as the Ninety-Eight sedan but kept the {{standard}} Eighty-Eight body. The Regency featured a long list of standard features including traction control, leather upholstery, dual 6-way power seats with power lumbar and a driver's side memory function, a dual-zone automatic climate control system, and an electronic <b>level</b> <b>control</b> for the rear suspension. A driver's side electrochromic outside mirror was also standard on the Regency, a feature that even Cadillac didn't offer as standard equipment. The interior day/night auto-dimming mirror was linked to the outside mirror and dimmed both with the same intensity at the same time. Some of these options, like the 2-driver memory feature, were not available on the Eighty-Eight Royale or LSS.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} assessed phonological and morphological {{awareness in}} dyslexic university students. We tested 44 dyslexic university students in phonological and morphological awareness tasks and compared their performances {{to those of}} both matched chronological age and matched reading <b>level</b> <b>controls.</b> In the phonological awareness tests, the dyslexic university students performed {{at the same level}} as their reading <b>level</b> <b>controls.</b> In contrast, they systematically outperformed their reading <b>level</b> <b>controls</b> in the morphological awareness tasks and almost reached the proficiency level of the chronological age controls. The results show that dyslexic university students develop their morphological awareness more than their phonological awareness. These findings add to the evidence indicating that morphological awareness is not deficient in dyslexia and could instead play a beneficial {{role in the development of}} literacy skills in this population...|$|R
500|$|The {{sound was}} {{provided}} by Solotech. Front of house engineer Blake Suib explained that, [...] " [...] and Solotech were asked {{to come up with}} a design that blocked the least amount of seats but provided the quality and coverage that [...] expects and that we were looking for". The public address (PA) was made of 64 Milos that split into four hangs of 16 per hang. Two at the 50 yard line pointed one way and directly behind, two at the 50 yard line pointed the opposite way. Also present were 32 Micas; 16 per hang, pointing to the sides. Each one of the four hangs had its own equalization (EQ) and <b>level</b> <b>control,</b> so in case one of the speakers were louder there would be a separate EQ to compensate for any change in the tone due to the distance. All the components and tools used in the public address were designed by Meyer Sound Laboratories, including a software called Mapp, used to decide where to point the PA; the Simm, to analyze and time align the PA accurately; and the Galileo, used to EQ and balance all the sections of the PA. The speakers were self-powered with amplifiers also built by Meyer Sounds. There were 24 HP700 subwoofers positioned all over the arena floor, and the Simm and Galileo were used to time align. Spears used a Crown CM-311AE headset microphone wearing the mic's beltpack (usually hidden in color matching material) on her top or pants, she did not use in-ear monitors; instead 12 Meyer CQs were positioned, eight flown around the center ring and two on each of the smaller stages. Spears specifically asked Suib to make the show sound similar to a dance club. Solotech provided the lighting package, including a mostly Vari-Lite rig, with 80 each VL3000s and VL3500s in various positions, and 60 VL500s built into the stage deck. Whitehouse also had 18 PRG Bad Boy luminaires, 16 of which sat in pods that hung in various positions lower than the rest of the rig, with two more at either end of the stage. Each of the eight pods housed two Bad Boys, two of the VL3500s, one Robert Juliat Ivanhoe followspot with scroller under DMX control, and a Molefay. Fifty Martin Professional Atomic Color strobes and four front of house Robert Juliat Aramis followspots rounded out the lighting package. The lightning team had to rehearse for a month to prepare. The tour was also the first to use the touring version of the PRG Virtuoso V676 console to control the system, which was used from the beginning of the European leg until the end of the tour. Pyrotechnics and jets of smoke used in the show were created by Lorenzo Cornacchia of Pyrotek Special Effects and Tait Towers.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are eight}} locks on the Welland Canal. From {{the north to}} the south, there is the Lake Ontario <b>level</b> <b>control</b> lock at Port Weller, {{followed}} by Lock 2 and then Lock 3, a site with a visitors' information centre and museum in St. Catharines, Ontario. [...] There are four locks in Thorold, Ontario, including twin flight locks 4, 5 and 6, with Lock 7 {{leading up to the}} main channel. The Lake Erie <b>level</b> <b>control</b> lock sits in Port Colborne, Ontario.|$|E

2500|$|Like the {{previous}} RS6 and the B7 RS 4 {{this generation of}} RS 6 includes Audi's [...] "Dynamic Ride Control" [...] (DRC) Sports suspension system. [...] The system is mainly mechanical, using a pump to provide additional pressure in the diagonally linked dampers (shock absorber) during cornering, to counteract rolling and pitching. [...] The system can dynamically adjust the stiffness at each damper constantly to maintain both a comfortable ride and high grip. [...] On this version, it has a three-way <b>level</b> <b>control,</b> selectable from the Multi Media Interface controls.|$|E

2500|$|When ordered {{with the}} factory towing package, the 1994-1996 Roadmaster was rated to tow up to 5000 pounds. [...] For the station wagon, {{this could be}} raised to 7000 pounds {{with the use of}} a weight-distributing hitch, dual sway controls, setting rear tire {{pressure}} to 35 PSI, and disabling the Electronic <b>Level</b> <b>Control.</b> [...] The towing package added 2.93 rear-axle gears and a limited slip differential, heavy duty cooling system including oil and transmission coolers, and a factory installed self leveling rear suspension consisting of air shocks, a height sensor between the rear axle and body and an on-board air compressor. Most visibly, a pair of electric fans offset to the left under the hood was replaced by [...] the combination of one conventional fan driven mechanically from the engine alongside one electric fan.|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{instrument}} {{inputs and}} speaker outputs (typically via 1/4" [...] jacks), an amp may have other inputs and outputs. These can include an auxiliary input jack (sometimes {{with its own}} <b>level</b> <b>control,</b> for a drum machine), [...] "send" [...] and [...] "return" [...] jacks to create an effects loop, a “line out” jack and an extension speaker jack. Practice amps sometimes have a 1/4" [...] headphone jack, or stereo RCA or mini jacks for connecting a CD player, portable media player or other sound source. Some guitar amps have an XLR input so that a microphone can be plugged in for singing. Guitar amps that include a mic input are in effect small, portable PA systems. Some amps, typically bass amps, have an XLR connector to provide a balanced output from the preamp section {{to go into a}} PA system or recording input.|$|E
