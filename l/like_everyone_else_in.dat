She tells him that just <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot {{tolerate}} his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems {{to be only a}} nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E
25|$|John Duff {{was born}} in China in 1895. <b>Like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the British Empire, Canadians were {{subjects}} of the reigning monarch, not citizens of any country. If there had been Canadian citizenship, Duff would have qualified via his Canadian parents. John Duff {{can be found on}} the Canadian Census for both 1901 and 1911. There was a category for “Nationality”. In both cases, Duff’s was listed as Canadian. When John Duff started racing in 1920, he had lived a significant part of his life in Canada. Although there was no Canadian citizenship until 1947, Canada had issued its own passports since the 1860s. As late as 1932, John Duff carried a Canadian passport — which means that he carried one throughout his racing career. In a newspaper interview given after his last crash, Duff was clear about his Canadian origins. Finally, and most conclusively, John Duff’s eldest son and daughter have no doubt that their father was a Canadian.|$|E

2500|$|In {{pursuit of}} the ADF, Kishi visited India, Pakistan, Burma, Thailand, Ceylon, and Taiwan in May 1957, asking the leaders of those nations to join the ADF, but with the {{exception}} of Taiwan, which agreed to join, all {{of the leaders of the}} those nations gave equivocal answers. Through he always denied it in public, but Kishi saw the ADF as an economic version of the [...] "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" [...] that Japan had sought to establish in World War II, which contributed to the failure of the proposed ADF as memories of the Japanese occupation were too fresh in Southeast Asia. To many people in Southeast Asia, the slogan [...] "Economic Development for Asia by Asia" [...] sounded too much like the wartime Japanese slogan [...] "Asia for Asians!". During World War II, the Japanese state had always presented the war as a race war between Asians vs. the [...] "white devils", portraying the war as a Pan-Asian crusade to unite all of the peoples of Asia against the [...] "white devils". The Japanese had been generally welcomed as liberators from European imperialism when they arrived in Southeast Asia, but soon the peoples of Southeast Asia had learned the Japanese did not regard other Asians as equals, as the Japanese had a habit of slapping the faces of the peoples they ruled to remind them who were the [...] "Great Yamato race" [...] and who were not. [...] The Burmese Prime Minister U Nu had, <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the Burmese elite, been a Japanese collaborator in World War II. Precisely because of his past U Nu told Kishi during his visit to Rangoon that he was reluctant to join the ADF as it would remind the Burmese people of the days when he was shouting Pan-Asian rhetoric, praising Japan as the natural leader of Asia and declaring how happy he was to serve the Japanese. Even in countries that were not occupied by Japan like India, Ceylon and Pakistan, Kishi encountered obstacles. During his visit to Karachi, the Pakistani Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy told Kishi that he thought of himself as a [...] "human being rather than an Asian first", preferred bilateral over multilateral aid as it allowed Pakistan to play off rival nations for better terms, and that Pakistan would not join the ADF if India also joined. Suhrawadry made it clear that until the Kashmir dispute was settled to Pakistan's satisfaction that Pakistan would not be joining any organization that India was a member of. [...] The Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru told Kishi during his visit to New Delhi that he wanted his nation to be neutral in the Cold War, and that as Japan was allied to the United States, joining the ADF would be in effect aligning India with the Americans. In Colombo, the Ceylonese Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, through not objecting to the ADF in principle, told Kishi that he preferred bilateral aid deals as it allowed Ceylon to play off the Soviet Union against the United States, and objected to the provision that joining the ADF would mean be [...] "locked in" [...] to only accepting aid from the ADF. Only during his visit to Taiping did Kishi receive outright acceptance of the ADF, through the Taiwanese press statement proclaiming the ADF would be most useful for stopping the rise of Communism in Asia proved embarrassing for Kishi as he had maintained in public that the ADF was supposed to be an organization for allowing Asians to help other Asians and had nothing to do with the Cold War. Because Japan was a much richer nation than all of the other nations of the proposed ADF combined, the ADF was generally as a vehicle for Japan to re-establish itself as a great power in Asia, as few had any doubt that Japan would be the dominant member of the ADF. Moreover, the fact that the United States was supporting the ADF led the proposed organization to be seen as siding with the United States in the Cold War, a struggle that many Asian nations wanted to be neutral in.|$|E

5000|$|Tertullian then {{proceeds}} {{to give an}} explanation of Christian life and practices. He describes {{the manner in which}} they come together to worship and please God; to pray for each other as well as for the emperor and the empire, to study and consider the Holy Scriptures, and to share food—but not before offering prayers and thanks to God. Afterwards everyone is free to share a song or something they learned from scripture, praising God all throughout the night. He continues by explaining the practice of tithing, the concept of loving one another and of being brothers and sisters, being united by their way of life under the teachings of Christ. And being part of this world, Christians have to interact with it and with others. They shop at meat markets and local shops, go to the baths and stay at inns just <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else,</b> though <b>in</b> everything they do, they [...] "bear in mind that we owe thanks to the Lord our God who created us". Despite this, the persecutors and accusers fail to recognize innocence when they see it, persecuting and treating the Christians unjustly. Christians know true innocence because they have learned and inherited it from God; they recognize and understand the eternal punishment that exists apart from God and acknowledge and fear the one who passes that real and true Judgment. Tertullian declares, [...] "in a word, we fear God, not the proconsul". He also addresses the claim that Christianity is more than a philosophy, bringing up the philosophers that say, [...] "it Christianity teaches the virtues and profess morality, justice, patience, moderation, and chastity". He makes the case that if Christianity is just another kind of philosophy, it should be treated the same way, granted with the freedom to teach and spread their beliefs and practice, customs and rituals.|$|R

5000|$|Lindsay's {{two primary}} themes in The Necessity of Secularism are the {{importance}} of secular government in a religiously pluralistic society and the independence of morality from theistic or religious belief. In support of the first theme, Lindsay argues that with different religious sects competing for membership and space in a democratic society, a common language is needed. In addition to formal {{separation of church and}} state, Lindsay urges that discussions of public policy be free from religious language and doctrine. Since religious language is only meaningful to practitioners of the religion that employs it, it's necessary to translate it to secular language in public policy discussions in a pluralistic society. Lindsay rejects arguments from authors such as Stephen Carter and Noah Feldman that such a requirement is too much of a burden to religious believers: [...] "Most believers, <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else,</b> live day-to-day <b>in</b> a secular world, a world in which we have no trouble communicating about natural phenomena...You don't need a Bible to conclude that if all humans are mortal, and Socrates is human, then Socrates is mortal. So secular language is spoken by believers already; they just have to apply it to public policy issues." [...] In support of the second major theme of his book, the independence of morality from theistic or religious belief, Lindsay emphasizes the Euthyphro dilemma. He considers several religious responses to the dilemma, and concludes that none of them succeed. Further, Lindsay talks about the epistemological problems in claiming that a doctrine is based on divine revelation, as there is no independent way to verify that such a revelation has occurred. It is from this point that the reason in the eponymous sub-title of the book is given: [...] "God cannot tell us what to do because, among other reasons, we are not able to recognize a command from God. Because God cannot effectively communicate with us, we cannot base morality on his commands." ...|$|R
