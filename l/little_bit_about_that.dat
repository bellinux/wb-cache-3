5000|$|The {{cultural}} {{significance of}} poke sallet, the cooked greens-like dish made from pokeweed, and the rural poverty reflected in its history, {{is indicated by}} the popularity and coverage received by the 1969 hit swamp rock song [...] "Polk Salad Annie", written and first performed by Tony Joe White. The opening lyrics run:If some of ya'll never been down south too muchI'm gonna tell you a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> thisSo <b>that</b> you'll understand what I'm talkin' aboutDown there we have a plant that grows out in the woodsAnd in the fields looks somethin' like a turnip greenAnd everybody calls it polk salad, polk saladUsed to know a girl lived down thereAnd she'd {{go out in the}} evenings and pick her a mess of itCarry it home and cook it for supper'Cause <b>thats</b> <b>about</b> all they had to eat, but they did all right....|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Statham {{started to}} develop a new movie written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples. Statham stated [...] "We've got a movie we're trying to do, written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples, in the vein of an old film, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. It’s not a remake or anything, but it's a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> like <b>that,</b> <b>about</b> {{relationships}} and how greed contaminates the relationships these three people have. The working title is The Grabbers." ...|$|R
500|$|The title Wildlife is not {{derived from}} lyrics from the album, but from themes that connect the songs. Dreyer regards {{wildlife}} as [...] "an all-encompassing word to sum everything up", {{and he has}} said that [...] "we all witness tragedy and change. It's the summation of our existence." [...] On the inside of the album cover the words [...] "To – for everything" [...] are written as a dedication with a word being crossed out. It has been speculated by some that the word is the name 'Helen'. Drummer Brad Vander Lugt when asked about the dedication replied [...] "That’s Jordan’s story to tell, and not mine. [...] It does have significance to a story he is telling. You will probably hear a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more <b>about</b> <b>that</b> in future work, Jordan has been known to continue stories or themes onto future albums." ...|$|R
500|$|Musically, {{the album}} {{incorporates}} elements of baile funk, grime, hip hop, and ragga. Peter Shapiro, writing in The Times, {{summed up the}} album's musical influences as [...] "anything {{as long as it}} has a beat". Some tracks drew on Tamil film music, which M.I.A. listened to while growing up. Shapiro described her music as a [...] "multi-genre pile-up" [...] and likened it to her graphic art, calling it [...] "vivid, gaudy, lo-fi and deceptively candyfloss". In a 2005 interview, when asked about the difficulty in categorising her sound, M.I.A. explained, [...] "Influences are crossing over into each other's puddles. I just accept where I'm at, I accept where the world is at and I accept how we receive and digest information. I get that somebody in Tokyo is on the internet instant messaging, and someone in the favelas is on the internet. Everybody seems to know a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> everything and <b>that's</b> how we process information now. This just reflects that." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1991 Miguel {{released}} his eighth studio album, Romance, {{a collection of}} classic boleros, the oldest of which originated in the 1940s. The album, which was produced by Armando Manzanero and arranged by Bebu Silvetti, was a commercial success in Latin America and sold over seven million copies worldwide. It revived interest in the bolero genre {{and was the first}} record by a Spanish-speaking artist to be certified gold in Brazil, Taiwan, and the United States. In spite of the album's success, Miguel did not want to release a follow-up record that was similar to Romance. When asked why he chose not to record more boleros, he replied [...] "I wanted to try my music, just forgetting a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> those boleros <b>that</b> everyone knows". He began working with the composers for the album a year before recording in a studio in 1992; in Miguel's words, he wanted to [...] "discuss the works, the themes, and melodies;...The creation of an album has to be part of me or else I {{would not be able to}} interpret it, or sing in it".|$|R
5000|$|Arnold {{confesses to}} having {{no ability to}} play guitar, so when he writes a song, it's more like [...] "chicken pecking" [...] notes, {{and it can be}} a long process. According to Arnold, this song is about {{following}} your dreams. [...] "And I know everybody has 'em. It's not also just about following your dreams, though. It's kind of a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> dreams <b>that</b> you've missed, and a little notion of regret, also."The person in the first verse of the song is fictional, and Arnold left it open to interpretation on whether that person is older or younger. He explains: [...] "It's just kind of an idea. And it's kind of weird. Maybe it doesn't have a perfect string full of lyrics in that first verse, and for me I've never thought it had a perfect one, because it's almost suggesting that it's an older person, but {{in a lot of ways}} it's kind of suggesting it's a younger person. But I left it like that because I want things to be like that. I want it to be like it would be interpreted a lot of different ways. I don't do it so much anymore, but I used to think that when I write lyrics, I tried to do every line to where it could be taken more than one way. And my thought process behind that was, Well, if I can get two meanings out of it, then there are countless meanings out there for somebody else to apply it to their own life."He also offers this bit of philosophy: [...] "The difference in a good song and a great song, to me, is the difference in a good book and a good movie: They're both telling you the same story. They both have the same outcome. But whereas the movie is telling you exactly what to see and be heard, the book kind of lets you see whatever your mind comes up with, and it makes it a lot more applicable to your life in a lot of ways." ...|$|R
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of anger <b>about</b> <b>that</b> and a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I think we have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|R
