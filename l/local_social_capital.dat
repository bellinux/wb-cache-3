Globalization has destabilized previously immutable social institutions, shifting cultural value away from old traditions to new more individualistic and market friendly ideas.

Following DiPasquale and Glaeser, {{a body of}} literature suggests that homeownership is positively related to <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> formation.

Moreover, homeownership creates barriers to geographic mobility, which increases the present value of the expected stream of benefits from <b>local</b> community <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> We test the homeownership hypothesis alongside other individual, household and locational determinants of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> using unique data created by merging the 2006 and 2008 samples of the New Zealand Quality of Life survey. The measures of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> used in our analysis include trust in others, participation in social networks, attitude towards local governance and sense of community. Since homeownership is not randomly assigned, we complement our regression models with propensity score matching to control for selection effects. The results confirm that homeownership exerts considerable positive impact in the formation of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> in New Zealand communities.

The absence of mobility is a factor behind high unemployment when jobless people prefer to remain in their home region rather than to go prospecting in more dynamic areas. In this paper, we attempt to understand the determinants of mobility by introducing the concept of <b>local</b> <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> Using data from a European household panel (ECHP), we provide various measures of social capital, {{which appears to be}} a strong factor of immobility. It is also a fairly large factor of unemployment when social capital is clearly local, while other types of social capital are found to {{have a positive effect on}} employability. We also find evidence of the reciprocal causality, that is, individuals born in another region have accumulated less <b>local</b> <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> Finally, observing that individuals in the South of Europe appear to accumulate more <b>local</b> <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> while in Northern Europe they tend to invest in more general types of social capital, we argue that part of the European unemployment puzzle can be better understood thanks to the concept of <b>local</b> <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> European unemployment, geographical mobility, social capital...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} a {{stronger}} strategic orientation towards <b>local</b> <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> {{as a first}} substantial step to a real policy of a 'socially integrative city'. A corresponding political conceptualisation {{could lead to a}} stronger base in local civil society and a more sensible, neighbourhood-based distribution of resources. In the paper this perspective is outlined through a discussion of the (<b>local)</b> <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> concept and the results of a related empirical study in deprived neighbourhoods in Berlin's capital district. The research output shows that strategic social potential in quantitatively and qualitatively differing forms exists in all the neighbourhoods. Furthermore the paper shows that <b>local</b> <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> can make the crucial difference in neighbourhood development in spite of similar (mostly problematic) presuppositions deriving from official data and monitoring. When a difficult initial situation with other negative factors coincides with a lower level of social capital, the potential to overcome neighbourhood marginalisation can be particularly poor. In a slightly different situation, i. e. a poor initial situation but with relatively high levels of social capital, conditions tend to stabilise.

40|$|Abstract. Temporary labor {{migration}} {{in developing countries}} is an important urban ^ rural linkage that has a potential impact on rural development. According to the new economies of labor migration, it is often a strategy used by families with small farms to acquire investment capital for future business formation. In this paper, I argue further that human-capital accretion during migration reinforces the mobilization of <b>local</b> <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> which in turn enhances a returnee's entrepreneurship. By using {{the results of an}} in-depth survey of returned labor migrants in rural China, I seek to explain the mobilization of social capital and income return to entrepreneurship in a multivariate framework. I find that skilled returnees are indeed more prone to mobilize social capital. The income return to <b>local</b> <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> is as considerable as that to investment capital and skills acquired at the urban destination. The findings suggest that the consequences of labor migration can be better understood through the integration of the new economics of labor migration and social capital...|$|E

There was increased control by managers and greater reliance on experts which diminished local people's participation (and the role of councillors) in local affairs.
