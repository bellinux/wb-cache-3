5|$|Chelsea were {{expected}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> in a 4–4–2 formation, with Essien in central defence. They had doubts about the fitness of captain John Terry going into the final. He appeared to have damaged his ankle ligaments during {{the first leg of}} Chelsea's Champions League tie with Porto, though passed a fitness test just days after. Arsenal {{were expected}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> in a similar formation, with Baptista and Aliadière up front.|$|E

5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks <b>line</b> <b>up</b> outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties <b>line</b> <b>up</b> between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E
5|$|The {{defensive}} line (DL) consists of defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT). Defensive ends <b>line</b> <b>up</b> {{on the ends}} of the line, while defensive tackles <b>line</b> <b>up</b> inside, between the defensive ends. The primary responsibilities of defensive ends and defensive tackles is to stop running plays on the outside and inside, respectively, to pressure the quarterback on passing plays, and to occupy the line so that the linebackers can break through.|$|E
5|$|The <b>line</b> <b>up</b> {{was made}} up of Brandan Schieppati, Scott Danough, Ryan Wombacher, Marta Peterson, Derek Youngsma and Dave Nassie's final {{appearance}} with the band in 2014.|$|E
50|$|Ngata {{is known}} {{throughout}} the NFL {{for being a}} very versatile player. He mainly <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> at strongside defensive end in the Baltimore Ravens 3-4 base defense, but sometimes <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> at nose tackle. In their 4-2 nickel package, he <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> at defensive tackle. This versatility makes Ngata {{one of the most}} dominant defensive linemen in the NFL.|$|R

5|$|The {{offensive}} team must <b>line</b> <b>up</b> {{in a legal}} formation {{before they}} can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can temporarily <b>line</b> <b>up</b> in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} receivers are {{the wide}} receivers (WR) and the tight ends (TE). Wide receivers <b>line</b> <b>up</b> {{on or near}} the line of scrimmage, split outside the line. The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends <b>line</b> <b>up</b> outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona were {{expected}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Ronaldinho, Ludovic Giuly and Deco supporting Samuel Eto'o who would be deployed as the lone striker. They had doubts about the fitness of Lionel Messi going into the final. He had pulled a thigh muscle during the second leg of their match with Chelsea, and had not played since, though he {{was included in the}} 22 man squad for the final. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard stated he would leave it late before deciding whether to select him. Despite being included in the squad Messi did not feature in the final. Arsenal {{were expected}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> in a 4–5–1 formation, with Thierry Henry as the sole striker. There was much discussion about whether José Antonio Reyes would take the place of Robert Pirès on the left of midfield. It had been announced before the match that this would be Pirès' last match as he had agreed to join Villarreal next season.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea were {{predicted}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Willian and Eden Hazard as wide men. Mourinho doubted the fitness of Diego Costa and Gary Cahill {{going into the}} match – the former aggravated his hamstring during a pre-season game against Barcelona. Arsenal were expected to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> similarly to Chelsea, with Walcott furthest forward and Mesut Özil in his preferred position as playmaker. Midfielder Jack Wilshere was ruled out of selection, having sustained an ankle injury during training. Arsenal's top scorer of the previous season, Alexis Sánchez, was rested, having won the 2015 Copa América with Chile earlier in the summer. The teamsheets showed Loïc Rémy starting the match for Chelsea up front and Cesc Fàbregas partnering Matic in midfield. As expected Petr Čech started in goal for Arsenal; the goalkeeper moved from Chelsea in search of first-team football.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting <b>line</b> <b>up</b> consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting <b>line</b> <b>up</b> during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

50|$|On punts {{there will}} be two {{offensive}} players on the punting team <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> close to the sideline. These are called gunners. According to the NFL Rules Digest:During a kick from scrimmage, only the end men, as eligible receivers on the line of scrimmage {{at the time of the}} snap, are permitted to go beyond the line before the ball is kicked.These two eligible receivers on the kicking team ― the gunners ― are allowed to start running down the field as soon as the ball is snapped. The gunner's job is to try to get down the field as fast as the kicked ball and tackle whoever catches it. In the best case, they get there just before the ball and make the other team afraid to try to return it, leading to a fair catch. When a team <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> to punt, the other team <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> in a defense that is designed to also receive a punt. There will be one player <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> about 40 yards back; he is the punt returner, the player designated to catch the punt. There will also be a few players <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> on the gunners; these players are called jammers. If the defense <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> two defenders on each gunner, then they are hoping to slow the gunners down, catch the punt, and try to run the punt back for a long gain or even a touchdown. If there is only one defender <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> on each gunner, then the receiving team has extra players rushing the punter, and they hope to block the punt. If no defenders are <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> on the gunners, the punting team may throw the ball to one of the gunners to pick up the first down.|$|R

5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that <b>line</b> <b>up</b> in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms <b>line</b> <b>up</b> {{in the presence of}} a field.|$|E
5|$|Linebackers <b>line</b> <b>up</b> {{behind the}} {{defensive}} line but {{in front of the}} defensive backfield. They are divided into two types: middle linebackers (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB). Linebackers are the defensive leaders and call the defensive plays. Their diverse roles include defending the run, pressuring the quarterback, and guarding backs, wide receivers and tight ends in the passing game.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City were {{predicted}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Nasri and James Milner as wide men. Due to a specified pre-season programme, Pellegrini {{had agreed to}} excuse several players from the match, namely Martín Demichelis, Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta, Bacary Sagna, Fernandinho, Frank Lampard and Sergio Agüero. Striker Álvaro Negredo was also unavailable for selection because of an injury. Arsenal were expected to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> similarly to Manchester City, with Ramsey as a holding midfielder, and Tomáš Rosický in an advanced role behind Olivier Giroud. Goalkeeper David Ospina was ruled {{out of the game}} with a thigh injury; German internationals Per Mertesacker, Mesut Özil and Lukas Podolski did not feature as they were given extended time off following their national side's success at the World Cup.|$|E
