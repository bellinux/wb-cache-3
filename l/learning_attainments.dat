Rather, little research is found to explore its applicability in big-sized classes which averagely are made of more than 50 students. The present study was undertaken to investigate viability of applying Task-based instruction into big-sized language classrooms. Pre- and–post written tests, oral tests, and interviews were administered for data collections. Three main findings from the case study are reported: a). the experimental group {{is likely to have}} presented significantly better <b>learning</b> <b>attainments</b> while comparing with the control group; b) the experimental group seems to have showed significantly better oral English performance than the control group; c) the experimental group tends to have presented more active and motivated learning than the control group based on data collected from individual interviews.

40|$|Quality {{has been}} an Education for All (EFA) goal since the 2000 Dakar {{framework}} positioned it 'at the heard of education' as a fundamental determinant of student enrolment, retention and achievement. Over the years, classroom pedagogy has been consistently regarded as 'the crucial variable for improving learning outcomes' (eg Hattie, 2009) and is thus seen as critical to reforms aimed at improving educational quality (UNESCO, 2005, p. 152). The quality of teacher-pupil classroom interaction remains of central importance, rather research evidence (eg Borich, 1996) {{suggests that it is}} the single most important factor accounting for wide variation in the <b>learning</b> <b>attainments</b> of students who have used the same curriculum materials and purportedly experienced similar teaching methods. Other more recent studies (eg Aslam and Kingdon, 2011) have also reported that teacher 'process' variables have a more significant impact on student achievement than standard background characteristics. In the current erea of the 'global learning crisis' (UNESCO, 2014) many developing economies have embarked on major pedagogical reforms. In India, the notion of energising schools and transforming classrooms has received unprecedented attention in the last 15 years. A number of programmes have been introduced in various states to provide meaningful access (Jandhyala and Ramachandran, 2007). The Activity Based Learning (ABL) Programme is one such effort to change the nature of teaching and learning in mainstream classrooms...|$|E
40|$|Purpose:In a {{world in}} which {{successful}} learning is believed to rest on the methods of teaching and the performance of students is determined by teacher quality, it is clear that teachers are the backbone of student <b>learning</b> <b>attainments.</b> In such a scenario, teacher development, welfare, motivation, and satisfaction are crucial for better teaching performance. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to determine the motivator and hygiene factors among excellent teachers in Malaysia and to explore factors that lead to satisfaction and cause dissatisfaction among excellent teachers in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses quantitative design to determine the motivator and hygiene factors among excellent teachers. For the sample size, 306 excellent teachers participated in this study and data were analysed using principle component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to determine the dominant factor among Herzberg’s motivator and hygiene factors. Findings: From the findings, the results showed that the satisfaction of excellent teachers was low in terms of “personal growth” (motivator) and “supervision” (hygiene). The paper concludes by calling upon the Malaysian Ministry of Education (MoE) to consider both motivator and hygiene factors, and what causes satisfaction and dissatisfaction among excellent teachers. Research limitations/implications: This study has some limitations to be considered, especially in terms of sample size. The low number of excellent teachers participating in this study is due to the scarcity of face-to-face data collection, in that an online survey was deemed to be the only means to reach the excellent teachers. This is due to the lack of a list of excellent teachers in some state districts, making it difficult to determine those schools which have excellent teachers. In addition, it is also due to logistical and geographical difficulties in reaching certain schools and meeting the excellent teachers. In recognition of such difficulties in undertaking research on excellent teachers in Malaysia, the researchers in this study urge the Malaysian MoE, as well as state districts and regional offices, to update the profile of excellent teachers by creating records and a list of all excellent teachers in Malaysia to facilitate future research. In this scenario, the findings of this study should be used with caution and not be generalized to other contexts, schools, regions, or states. Practical implications: To be fully cognizant about the excellent teachers’ scheme was introduced to uplift the standard of teaching in Malaysia, and the recipients of this scheme or status (excellent) are considered to be the “cream of the crop” in the teaching profession in Malaysia and for non-excellent teachers to emulate, it is vital to look into their well-being as well as their growth. With the results of this study, the authors can say that the implications for practice touch many aspects of the professional and personal development of Malaysian excellent teachers. Specifically, it is imperative that the factors that intrinsically and extrinsically motivate excellent teachers in Malaysia and the causes of dissatisfaction are identified. In addition, the implications also place emphasis on paving ways for the personal growth of excellent teachers and to provide leeway for them to pursue their own personal happiness. Furthermore, the implications of the lack of proper supervision of school principals on excellent teachers should be avoided, and, in general, hygiene factors could be used as positive implications to improve excellent teachers’ teaching practices an performance. Originality/value: This research is original as it calls MoE attention to the well-being of excellent teachers in Malaysia. As excellent teachers in Malaysia are selected and promoted among teachers in Malaysia in order to improve teaching and learning in Malaysia. They are appointed to be a role model for other teachers to emulate. With this position, excellent teachers are expected to contribute to the development of their schools and others and they can be posted anywhere as well as called at any time for help. Therefore, it is worthy to know how satisfied those excellent teachers are regarding government policy. Hence, it is important to know what motivates and satisfies them...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the effects of civil war on child and infant mortality, <b>learning</b> <b>attainment</b> and access to water and sanitation services. Household and individual level data (such as theDemographic and Health Surveys and the Colombian Standardized Saber test) are extensively used along with data on conflict intensity (such as Prio-Uppsala Battle Deaths and the Colombian PoliceCrime statistics). The first chapter explores how different intensity levels of civil war lead to changes in child and infant mortality in Latin American countries that have experienced lengthy civil wars (Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Peru). Econometric procedures indicate that civil war increases the risk of mortality {{during the first year of}} life. Using individual level test scoresfrom Colombia, as the measure of <b>learning</b> <b>attainment,</b> the second chapter studies how exposure to civil war at birth and at the year of the test impacts math and language learning. Exposure to conflictat birth reduces the <b>learning</b> <b>attainment</b> of 5 th grade students. Results seem to be not conclusive for 9 th and 11 grade students due to sample attrition. The third chapter estimates how civil warmodifies households' access to water and sanitation services and, in turn, the health of children in Colombia. Employing different methods to control for the civil war intensity, regressions found thatcivil war leads to contradictory effects on access to water and sanitation services. Overall, estimations throughout the three chapters provide strong evidence supporting the existence of negative effects of civil war on child and infant mortality, <b>learning</b> <b>attainment</b> and access to water and sanitation services. The techniques and the theoretical model used in the third chapter also open up the way for the existence of households' adaptive behavior while the conflict goes on.

Specifically, we determined nursing students’ awareness, self-assessed <b>learning</b> <b>attainment,</b> difficulties, and preparedness regarding the nursing process/nursing diagnosis, and then analyzed the associations between these constructs {{in order to determine}} the current state of instructional content. A self-administered anonymous questionnaire study was carried out a total of four times: once after the introductory course for first-year students (Group 1), once each before and after the intermediate course for secondyear students (Groups 2 and 3), and once after the applied course for third-year students (Group 4). We determined nursing students’ actual level of awareness, self-assessed <b>learning</b> <b>attainment,</b> self-assessed difficulties in studying, and preparedness regarding the nursing process/nursing diagnosis. Then, we analyzed the correlations among these measures. Regarding awareness, significantly greater percentages of respondents responded to items in such a way as to indicate that they were highly aware of the nursing process/nursing diagnosis in Groups 1 and 3 than in Groups 2 and 4. In Group 4, a significant positive correlation was found between preparedness and self-assessment. The poor awareness rate in Group 2 suggests that although learning about the nursing process and nursing diagnosis at a stage in which understanding remains at a purely theoretical level can boost student awareness, the effect is not long lasting. The results suggest that introducing nursing diagnosis while students are still learning about the nursing process might confuse them, thus pointing to the need for better integrated education of the nursing process and nursing diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores students’ {{learning}} journeys in {{and through}} units in Higher Education degree courses. The exploration focuses specifically on student learning failure. It does so by using empirical evidence from one Australian university over a two-year period. The argument presented here is that universities can exploit detailed data at their disposal to enhance students’ achievements on their learning journeys. An information-rich but modest Toolkit is proposed that provides {{a detailed description of}} student learning journeys in general, and of failure in particular. The Toolkit comprises an individual student’s current achievement in a unit (Grade); an individual student’s previous semester achievement (Grade Point Average); three failing Categories, namely, Academically Weak, Not Engaged or Speed Bump and two passing Categories, namely, Passing OK or Flagging, into one of which each individual student is assigned after encountering a unit; and the Group <b>Learning</b> <b>Attainment</b> of all students in that unit (an average of all Grades in a unit). The final Toolkit element concerns Dimensions of responsibility for learning. The Dimensions are Student, University, Course and Lecturer. This thesis suggests that student academic learning failure is an interrelationship of these four Dimensions. An argument is presented that the three non-Student Dimensions can impact negatively on student learning journeys, and are likely to contribute to failure. Notwithstanding these issues, the thesis concludes {{that it is possible to}} support and enhance student learning achievement journeys...|$|R

It provides the vehicle to experience and gain an Insight into an evolutionary and exploratory journey of people working and learning together as they reflect on the creative, emotional, social, moral and sensual feelings of practice. In particular, it offers insights into the professional identity of the writer as she critically examines the impact of educational assessment on a school community and the people working in it. The research methodology is adapted from critical action research in which the researcher's educational values are the yardstick against which the tacit knowledge of action (practice) is evaluated. Professional stories of past practice are used to represent implicit theories that are collaboratively reflected upon as they are deconstructed and explored. The creative research process is uniquely represented by the visual metaphor of a multi-layered jigsaw puzzle that enables the researcher to uncover successive, significant layers of professional knowledge in the infant school that relate to the concept of a fairer assessment of children's <b>learning,</b> development and <b>attainment.</b> The educational assessment landscape or 'sensescape' is traversed in order to make sense of the conceptual model of a fairer assessment of children's <b>learning,</b> developnient and <b>attainment</b> as a living educational theory.
