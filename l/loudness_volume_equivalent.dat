50|$|Body {{capacitance}} was {{a significant}} nuisance when tuning the earliest radios; touching a tuning knob would couple the body capacitance into the tuning circuit, slightly changing its resonant frequency. However, body capacitance is very useful in the Theremin, a musical instrument in which it causes slight frequency shifts of the instrument's internal oscillators. One of them changes pitch, and the other causes <b>loudness</b> (<b>volume)</b> to change smoothly between silence and full amount.|$|R
50|$|Pitch depends to {{a lesser}} degree on the sound {{pressure}} level (<b>loudness,</b> <b>volume)</b> of the tone, especially at frequencies below 1,000 Hz and above 2,000 Hz. The pitch of lower tones gets lower as sound pressure increases. For instance, a tone of 200 Hz that is very loud seems one semitone lower in pitch than if it is just barely audible. Above 2,000 Hz, the pitch gets higher as the sound gets louder.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} interferometric {{observations of}} the asteroid (41) Daphne in the thermal infrared obtained with the Mid-Infrared Interferometric Instrument (MIDI) of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). We derived the size and the surface thermal properties of (41) Daphne {{by means of a}} thermophysical model (TPM), which is used for the interpretation of interferometric data for the first time. From our TPM analysis, we derived a <b>volume</b> <b>equivalent</b> diameter for (41) Daphne of 189 km, using a non-convex 3 -D shape model derived from optical lightcurves and adaptive optics images (B. Carry, private communication). On the other hand, when using the convex shape of Kaasalainen et al. (2002. Icarus 159, 369 - 395) in our TPM analysis, the resulting <b>volume</b> <b>equivalent</b> diameter of (41) Daphne is between 194 and 209 km, depending on the surface roughness. The shape of the asteroid is used as an a priori information in our TPM analysis. No attempt is made to adjust the shape to the data. Only the size of the asteroid and its thermal parameters (albedo, thermal inertia and roughness) are adjusted to the data. We estimated our model systematic uncertainty to be of 4 % and of 7 % on the determination of the asteroid <b>volume</b> <b>equivalent</b> diameter depending on whether the non-convex or the convex shape is used, respectively. In terms of thermal properties, we derived a value of the surface thermal inertia smaller than 50 J m- 2 s- 0. 5 K- 1 and preferably in the range between 0 and 30 J m- 2 s- 0. 5 K- 1. Our TPM analysis also shows that Daphne has a moderate macroscopic surface roughness. Comment: 44 pages, 8 figures, 3 table...|$|R

40|$|A {{quantitative}} analysis of variations in granule microstructure based upon changes in primary particle size and bed preparation is presented. The granule microstructures are obtained using X-Ray Computed Tomography (XRCT). An algorithm is developed {{to measure the}} number and size of macro-voids (pore space with <b>volume</b> <b>equivalent</b> size {{greater than or equal}} to 30  μm or 3 times the primary particle size). Four size fractions of alumina, ranging in primary particle size from 0. 5  μm to 108  μm, are sieved using three different sieve sizes to create static powder beds from which single-droplet granules are produced. The analysis shows that large macro-voids exist in ultra-fine powders (0. 1 – 10  μm). The macro-voids take up to 7 % of the granule volume and the largest macro-voids are 200 – 700  μm in <b>volume</b> <b>equivalent</b> size. Changing the sieve preparation changes the size and total volume of macro-voids. In contrast, there are very few macro-voids in granules formed from coarser powders. This study shows that micron sized powders have the opportunity to form complex structures during granulation and that the handling history of the materials should receive greater scrutiny than it currently gets...|$|R
40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} far field, {{as well as}} near field, {{originating from}} light interaction with a red blood cell (RBC) <b>volume</b> <b>equivalent</b> spheroid, were analyzed utilizing T-matrix theory. This method is a powerful tool which enables the influence of cell shape on the angular distribution of scattered light to be studied. General observations were that the three-dimensional shape, as well as optical thickness apparent to the incident field, affect the forward scattering. The back scattering {{was influenced by the}} shape of the surface facing the incident beam. Furthermore, sphering as well as elongation of an oblate shaped RBC into a <b>volume</b> <b>equivalent</b> sphere or prolate shaped spheroid, respectively, were theoretically modeled in order to imitate physiological phenomena caused, e. g., by sphering agents, heat or increased shear stress of flowing blood. Both sphering and elongation were shown to decrease the intensity of the forward directed scattering, thus yielding lower g-factors. The sphering made the scattering pattern independent of the azimuthal scattering angle φs, while the elongation induced more apparent φs-dependent patterns. The light scattering by an RBC <b>volume</b> <b>equivalent</b> spheroid, was thus found to be highly influenced by the shape of the scattering object. A near-field radius, rnf, was evaluated as the distance to which the maximum intensity of the total near field had decreased to 2. 5 times that of the incident field. It was estimated to 2 - 24. 5 times the maximum radius of the scattering spheroid, corresponding to 12 - 69 µm. When the absorption properties of a red blood cell were incorporated in the computations, the near-field radius was only slightly reduced by 0. 2 - 0. 6 times the maximum radius. As the near-field radius was shown to be larger than a simple estimation of the distance between the RBCs in whole blood, the assumption of independent scattering, frequently employed in optical measurements on whole blood, seems inappropriate. This also indicates that results obtained from diluted blood, cannot be extrapolated to whole blood, by multiplying with a simple concentration factor...|$|R
