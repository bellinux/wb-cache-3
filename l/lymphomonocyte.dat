40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} in eight normotensive obese patients the influence of low sodium intake (9 mEq/day) on the sympathetic activity modifications induced by caloric restriction (2511 kJ/day). As compared to the isocaloric salt balanced diet, 7 days of normosodic underfeeding induced a decrease in the overall norepinephrine turnover (clearance and appearance rate) and 24 hours urinary output, whereas the combined caloric and salt restriction significantly increased the norepinephrine appearance rate and even more the norepinephrine clearance but, on the other hand, decreased the beta-adrenergic receptor number on the <b>lymphomonocyte</b> surface, suggesting a reduced peripheral sensitivity to catecholamines. Therefore, the utility of the combined sodium and caloric restriction in the treatment of the normotensive obese patients remains still questionable...|$|E

Ovarian steroids, in turn, reduce the cytokine production from immune-competent cells. In the present study we evaluated whether <b>lymphomonocytes</b> are present in FF, and if both their subset distribution and their IL 1 alpha and IL 2 secretions, after activation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), {{are similar to those of}} peripheral blood. Interferences of IL 1 alpha and IL 2 production by FF <b>lymphomonocytes</b> caused by isolated granulosa cells were also evaluated. The study was performed on 86 FFs obtained from follicles containing mature oocytes that were aspirated at the time of ovum pickup from 27 women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with exogenous gonadotropins for an in vitro fertilization (IVF) program [IVF-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) or gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) ]. Lymphocytes were found in FF. The distribution of CD 8 + and CD 3 + lymphocyte subsets is equal to that in peripheral blood, but the percentage of CD 11 b+, CD 16 +, and CD 4 + cells (its trend) is higher in FF than in peripheral blood. The amount of IL 2 and IL 1 alpha deriving from PHA-activated FF <b>lymphomonocytes</b> is similar to that of peripheral blood PHA-activated <b>lymphomonocytes.</b> Granulosa cells significantly blunt IL 2 and IL 1 alpha production by FF <b>lymphomonocytes.</b> These results suggest that preovulation, a migration of <b>lymphomonocytes</b> from the peripheral compartment to the follicle occurs. However, unfavorable effects of IL 2 and IL 1 alpha, cytotoxic and antisteroidogenetic activities, are counteracted by the products of granulosa cells. The higher amounts of CD 11 b+, CD 16 +, and CD 4 + in FF suggest that they could be involved in other immune processes...|$|R

We investigated the gene expression of inflammation-related cytokines and mediators, transactivation of relevant transcription factors, and phagocytosis role in cell-glucan interactions, by means of RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and colorimetric assay. Our results show that sonicated and alkalized paramylon upregulates pro-inflammatory factors (NO, TNF-Î±, IL- 6, and COX- 2) in <b>lymphomonocytes.</b> A clear demonstration of this upregulation is the increased transactivation of NF-kB visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. Phagocytosis assay showed that internalization is not a mandatory step for signaling cascade to be triggered, since immune activity is not present in the <b>lymphomonocytes</b> that have internalized paramylon granules and particulate MacroGardÂ®. Moreover, the response of Euglena Î²-glucan-activated <b>lymphomonocytes</b> is much greater than that induced by commercially used Î²-glucans such as MacroGardÂ®.

We evaluated the immunological properties of a chimeric Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), a plant virus engineered to express on its surface a synthetic peptide derived from many HVR 1 sequences of the HCV envelope protein E 2 (R 9 mimotope). Evidence was obtained that the chimeric R 9 -CMV elicits a specific humoral response in rabbits. Furthermore, in patients with chronicHCV infection, purified preparations of R 9 -CMV downmodulated the lymphocyte surface density of CD 3 and CD 8, and induced a significant release of interferon (IFN) -γ, interleukin (IL) - 12 p 70 and IL- 15 by <b>lymphomonocyte</b> cultures. Finally, an R 9 mimotope-specific CD 8 T-cell response, as assessed by intracellular IFN-γ production, was achieved {{in the majority of}} the patients studied.

Design. Patients with valvular disease with AF or sinus rhythm (SR) were recruited and compared. Before the extracorporal circulation, about 250 mg tissue of right atrium was collected for pathological examination. The activity of NF-kB in myocardium was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and the concentration of cardiac tissue interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) was determined by radioimmuoassay. Results. Patients with valvular disease with AF exhibited higher NF-kB activity, higher concentration of TNF-a and IL- 6, severe <b>lymphomonocyte</b> infiltration, and more fibrosis than those patients with valvular disease with SR. There were significant positive correlations among NF-kB activity and levels of TNF-a and IL- 6 and collagen volume fraction. Conclusions.

The aim of this study was to correlate cytokine production and lymphocyte apoptosis to post-ischemic left ventricular remodeling in patients affected by acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing primary cutaneous angioplasty (PCI). Methods. In 40 patients, affected by AMI and undergoing PCI, we evaluated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and interleukin 10 (IL 10) production and apoptosis on day 1, day 3, day 7, 1 month and 6 months after PCI. Patients were divided into two subgroups of remodeling or not remodeling by echocardiographic criteria. Results. In the subgroup of remodeling patients, at each timepoint TNF- production was increased significantly in comparison with the subgroup of not remodeling patients. IL 10 production was statistically lower in remodeling subjects than in not remodeling ones 1 and 6 months after reperfusion. There were no differences between the two groups as regards <b>lymphomonocyte</b> apoptosis. Conclusions. We found an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF- and a corresponding decrease of anti-inflammatory/regulatory cytokine IL 10 in remodeling patients and we concluded that this cytokine imbalance resulted in pro-inflammatory effects which might contribute to the progression of left ventricular remodeling...|$|E

40|$|Red wine {{possesses}} anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activies in {{virtue of}} its content in flavonoids. Here, we tested the in vitro effects of some italian red wines on peripheral blood <b>lymphomonocytes</b> from normal donors. Flavonoid amount was measured and wines were diluited at different concentrations: 1 : 5, 1 : 10, 1 : 100, 1 : 1000. To verify the effects of flavonoids, samples were deprived of them and tested on immune cells. Three types of wines were used: Lambrusco, Primitivo, Negroamaro. From preliminary experiments, Negroamaro was the most effective of all and, then, used throughout the study. Immune parameters were the following: 1. 	Expression of CD 69 measured on <b>lymphomonocytes</b> by cytofluorimetry; 2. 	Production of IgA and IgG as evaluated by ELISPOT; 3. 	Production of nitric oxide (NO) from monocytes {{by means of a}} spectrophotometric method. Two stimulants were used, LPS for B cells and monocytes and PMA for T cells and monocytes. Data obtained show that red wine at a concentration of 1 : 10 is able to enhance IgG production, however same concentration deprived of flavonoids is no longer effective. Expression of CD 69, as an earlier marker of activation, on T and B cells is not influenced by red wine. Finally, NO production from monocytes is enhanced by 1 : 5 and 1 : 10 dilutions but not by 1 : 100 and 1 : 1000 dilutions. Samples deprived of flavonoids lose their capacity of inducing NO generation. Taken togheter, these findings indicate that red wine possesses immune activities which can be ascribed to flavonoids since their removal abrogates the described effects...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: P 2 X 7 {{receptor}} (P 2 X 7 R), trigger {{of acute}} inflammatory responses via the NLRP 3 inflammasome, is hyperfunctioning {{in patients with}} Sjogren Syndrome (SS), where it stimulates IL- 18 production. Some patients with SS develop a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (MALT-NHL). OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate the involvement and the putative prognostic role of this inflammatory pathway {{in the development of}} MALT-NHL. METHODS: 147 women with SS have been prospectively followed for a mean of 52 months, relating the expression and function of the P 2 X 7 R-inflammasome axis in salivary glands and circulating <b>lymphomonocytes</b> to the prognosis and the degree of the disease. RESULTS: At baseline, gene expression of P 2 X 7 R and of the inflammasome components NLRP 3, caspase- 1 and IL- 18 increased accordingly to the presence of germinative centres, was higher in autoantibodies-positive individuals and strongly higher in those developing a MALT-NHL over the follow-up. Glandular expression of IL- 18 was three-fold higher in MALT-NHL than in controls or in the other SS patients. P 2 X 7 R did not colocalize with generic markers of inflammatory infiltrate, like CD 20, being selectively expressed by epithelial cells. P 2 X 4 R, sharing functional characteristics with P 2 X 7 R, did not differ in SS and controls. The increased P 2 X 7 R gene and protein expression was tissue-specific, no difference being observed in peripheral <b>lymphomonocytes</b> between SS with MALT-NHL and SS not developing MALT-NHL. CONCLUSION: We propose the P 2 X 7 R-inflammasome axis as a novel potential pathway involved in both SS exocrinopathy and lymphomagenesis, reinforcing the hypothesis of a key role of IL- 18, via its increased P 2 X 7 R-mediated production, in the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative malignancies, and opening novel opportunities for the early diagnosis of lymphoproliferative complications and the development of potential targeted therapies...|$|R

The high comorbidity rates between bipolar disorder (BD) and PTSD have {{raised the issue of}} whether some characteristics of BD could represent risk factors for PTSD. In combat-related PTSD, the 18 kDa mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO), essential for steroid synthesis, was found to be decreased. Aims of the present study were: 1) the assessment of the TSPO mitochondrial density in lymphomonocytes from civilian patients with non-combat-related PTSD, without current or lifetime Axis I mood comorbidity, versus controls; 2) the exploration of the correlations between TSPO density and the presence of comorbid manic/hypomanic lifetime spectrum symptoms. Assessments included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), the Impact of Event Scale (IES), and the lifetime Mood Spectrum Self-Report (MOODS-SR). Blood samples were processed to assess TSPO binding parameters in <b>lymphomonocyte</b> mitochondrial membranes. PTSD patients showed a significant decrease in TSPO density, without changes in mitochondrial citrate synthase activity. Further, TSPO density correlated with the number of lifetime manic/hypomanic spectrum symptoms. For the first time, TSPO density was found to be decreased in non-war-related PTSD and such decreases correlated with comorbid manic/hypomanic spectrum symptoms, indicating a possible role of sub-threshold bipolar comorbidity in PTSD-related neurobiological dysregulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of the Golgi glycosyltransferase beta 1, 6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (core 2 GlcNAc-T), which {{plays a role in}} T-cell activation and cell-cell adhesion, appears to be modulated in resting lymphomonocytes during different phases of multiple sclerosis (MS). In particular, a significant decrease (25 - 30 %) of the enzyme activity was observed, with respect to healthy subjects, in MS patients who were in relapse or in the very early stages of remission. A similar trend was found to be associated with patients affected by active lesions. A statistically significant decrease in the enzyme activity was also observed in patients with the progressive form. By contrast, core 2 GlcNAc-T activity did not appear correlated with duration of the disease. Interestingly, MS individuals under treatment with IFN-beta 1 a, an immunosuppressive agent, showed levels of activity which were comparable with those observed in healthy subjects. Together, these observations suggest that down-regulation of core 2 GlcNAc-T activity is linked to the occurrence of acute phases in the relapsing-remitting form and to the progressive form of the disease, probably caused by altered expression of glycoproteins which are involved in <b>lymphomonocyte</b> activation and/or interaction with the endothelium. Additionally, it appears that the enzyme assay may provide a useful marker of the disease activity and the effects of therapeutical approaches...|$|E
40|$|Inappropriate {{production}} of nitric oxide (NO) {{may be responsible}} for the haemodynamic disturbances of diabetic ketoacidosis. We investigated whether this metabolic condition is associated with increased plasma nitrate (the stable oxidation product of NO) levels and NO synthase gene expression in lymphomonocytes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma nitrate concentrations, lymphomonocyte-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and soluble thrombomodulin were measured in 11 Type 1 diabetic patients at baseline, during mild ketosis and after euglycaemia was re-established. RESULTS: During diabetic ketosis plasma nitrate concentrations were higher (18 (16 - 21) vs. 9 (7 - 11) micro mol/l; (95 % lower-upper confidence interval) P < 0. 05) than at baseline. At baseline <b>lymphomonocyte</b> iNOS mRNA expression and iNOS protein levels were undetectable, but in ketosis both were increased (both at P < 0. 0001). After recovery from ketosis, NO 3 concentration, iNOS mRNA, and iNOS expression (270 +/- 36 %, mean +/- sd) decreased but not significantly. No significant changes were observed in either TNF-alpha or soluble thrombomodulin levels between the three conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic ketosis is associated with increased nitrate levels and the activation of iNOS expression in circulating lymphomonocytes, but it does not affect either the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha or a marker of endothelial dysfunction such as thrombomodulin. Our data support the hypothesis that, during diabetic ketosis, alterations in NO homeostasis are present in circulating lymphomonocytes...|$|E

Following red wine (Negroamaro) pretreatment of <b>lymphomonocytes,</b> results will show a production of regulatory Interleukin (IL) - 12, proinflammatory (IL- 1 β and IL- 6), and anti-inflammatory (IL- 10) cytokines, as well as of IgA and IgG. The fine balance between inflammation and antiinflammation, as well as the role of humoral immune response either systemic or mucosal will be discussed as a consequence of red wine intake.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} whether {{activation of}} integrin receptors could modulate {{the expression of}} monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) in human hepatic stellate cells (HSC), mesenchymal cells responsible for extracellular matrix synthesis within the liver. When compared to non-adherent cells, HSC plated on collagen types I or IV, or fibronectin, showed increased MCP- 1 gene expression and protein secretion in the conditioned medium. Increased MCP- 1 secretion was also observed when cells were plated on dishes coated with a monoclonal antibody directed against the β 1 -integrin subunit, demonstrating that ligation of β 1 -integrins is sufficient to stimulate MCP- 1 expression. Conversely, integrin-independent cell adhesion on poly-l-lysine did not modify MCP- 1 secretion. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D blocked the collagen-dependent increase in MCP- 1 secretion. Chemotactic assay of HSC-conditioned medium showed that HSC plated on collagen secrete higher amounts of chemotactic factors for <b>lymphomonocytes,</b> and that MCP- 1 accounts for {{the great majority of}} this effect. These findings indicate a novel mechanism of MCP- 1 regulation possibly relevant in those conditions where HSC interact with an altered extracellular matrix...|$|R

We report here {{the results of a}} cross-sectional study on long term effects of severe brain damage on immunological and neuro-endocrine changes in patients who recovered from prolonged coma caused by head injury. Results obtained from post-comatose (PC) patients were compared with those obtained from two control groups made up of spinal-cord injury (SCI) patients and healthy subjects, respectively. The following parameters were studied: <b>lymphomonocyte</b> subsets; interleukin 2 (IL- 2) production; natural killer (NK) activity and serum levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, tri-iodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4). With respect to healthy controls the PC 1 subgroup, i. e. patients examined 3 - 6 months after injury, showed a statistically significant decrease in IL- 2 production, NK activity and CD 25 lymphocytes. Similar immunological disturbances were observed in SCI but not in the PC 2 subgroup, i. e. patients examined later than 6 months after injury. The same sub-group of PC 1 patients showed high serum levels of cortisol and PRL.

Density of alpha 2 -adrenoceptors was assessed by the specific binding of 3 H-yohimbine to intact platelets, while the function of beta 2 -adrenoceptors was estimated by the production of cAMP after the exposure of lymphomonocytes to isoprenaline. The maximal number of alpha 2 -adrenoceptors was increased in the hypotensive compared to the normotensive group (262. 13 vs. 77. 21 fmol/mg protein; p < 0. 01). Plasma norepinephrine was higher in the hypotensive than in the normotensive uremic patients (640 +/- 195 vs. 344 +/- 156 pg/ml; p < 0. 01).

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is frequently characterized by obesity and metabolic diseases including hypertension, insulin resistance, and diabetes in adulthood, all leading to {{an increased risk of}} atherosclerosis. The present study aimed to evaluate serum and production of inflammatory markers in adolescent Sardinian PCOS. On the basis of HOMA findings, patients were divided into noninsulin resistant (NIR) and insulin resistant (IR), and were weight- and age-matched with healthy girls.

40|$|AbstractInformation on equine {{infectious}} anaemia (EIA) in mules, including those with an equivocal reaction in {{agar gel immunodiffusion test}} (AGIDT), is scarce. For this, a study was conducted to evaluate the clinical, viral loads and pathological findings of two groups of naturally infected asymptomatic mules, respectively with a negative/equivocal and positive AGIDT reactivity, which were subjected to pharmacological immune suppression (IS). A non-infected control was included in the study that remained negative during the observation period. Throughout the whole study, even repeated episodes of recrudescence of EIA were observed in 9 infected mules, independently from their AGIDT reactivity. These events were generally characterised by mild, transient alterations, typical of the EIA acute form represented by hyperthermia and thrombocytopenia, in concomitance with viral RNA (vRNA) peaks that were higher in the Post-IS period, reaching values similar to those of horses during the clinical acute phase of EIA. Total tissue viral nucleic acid loads were greatest in animals with the major vRNA activity and in particular in those with negative/equivocal AGIDT reactivity. vRNA replication levels were around 10 – 1000 times lower than those reported in horses, with the animals still presenting typical alterations of EIA reactivation. Macroscopic lesions were absent in all the infected animals while histological alterations were characterised by <b>lymphomonocyte</b> infiltrates and moderate hemosiderosis in the cytoplasm of macrophages. On the basis of the above results, even mules with an equivocal/negative AGIDT reaction may act as EIAV reservoirs. Moreover, such animals could escape detection due to the low AGIDT sensitivity and therefore contribute to the maintenance and spread of the infection...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Vascular endothelial cells play a {{major role}} in {{maintaining}} cardiovascular homeostasis in health. Diabetes mellitus (DM) substantially impairs the vasodilating properties of the endothelium and leads to endothelial dysfunction, which can thus be considered the first step in the progression of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study is to illustrate possible mechanisms responsible for endothelial dysfunction in DM. DATA SYNTHESIS: We have shown that NADPH oxidase gene expression is increased in circulating <b>lymphomonocytes</b> from patients with DM, and that this increased gene expression is dependent upon metabolic control. Hyperglycemia can mediate its adverse effects through the activation of protein kinase C. We have shown an increase in membrane-associated PKC beta 2 activity in monocytes from patients with DM. This activity was reduced by 40 % in the euglycemic condition. Finally, we show a reduction of the circulating endothelial progenitor cells, a subset of bone marrow-derived endothelial-oriented stem cells, which can give rise to mature endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: Endothelial dysfunction, the initial step of the atherosclerotic process, is reversible. Thus, major efforts should be made to control not only hyperglycemia but also the other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, in order to prevent the onset of all these processes that eventually leads the diabetic patient to premature death...|$|R
40|$|Chlamydia Trachomatis (C. T.) most {{commonly}} causes cervicitis in women, often without overt symptoms; when untreated, {{it produces a}} clinically inapparent but persistent mild infection or an evident salpingitis. Either processes may lead to scarring of the falloppian tubes and fertility problems. A group of 30 women 20 - 35 years aged has undergone an ophthalmological routine examination; 7 of them presented a chronical follicular conjunctivitis and history of yellow-white cervical discharge, while the remaining 23 had a mild chronical follicular conjunctivitis but not genital symptoms. Each patient has undergone an immunofluorescent test with monoclonal antibody specific for C. T. on the samples collected by genital and conjunctival scraping and cytological evaluation of the above samples with Giemsa staining. 6 out of 7 patients with genital discharge were positive for C. T., one of which even for eye samples too; all eyes samples showed <b>lymphomonocytes</b> and neutrofilic cells in their eye samples. An additional 3 cases negative for C. T. showed this kind of cells in the eye scraping. The preliminary {{results of this study}} on mild follicular chronical conjunctivitis suggest that the Ophthalmologist could {{play an important role in}} order to make an early diagnosis in genital and eye infection by Chlamydial Trachomatis...|$|R
40|$|Rett {{syndrome}} (RTT) {{is mainly}} caused by mutations in the X-linked methyl-CpG binding protein (MeCP 2) gene. By binding to methylated promoters on CpG islands, MeCP 2 protein is able to modulate several genes and important cellular pathways. Therefore, mutations in MeCP 2 can seriously affect the cellular phenotype. Today, the pathways that MeCP 2 mutations are able to affect in RTT are not clear yet. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the gene expression profiles in peripheral blood <b>lymphomonocytes</b> (PBMC) isolated from RTT patients to try to evidence new genes and new pathways that are involved in RTT pathophysiology. LIMMA (Linear Models for MicroArray) and SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) analyses on microarray data from 12 RTT patients and 7 control subjects identified 482 genes modulated in RTT, of which 430 were upregulated and 52 were downregulated. Functional clustering of a total of 146 genes in RTT identified key biological pathways related to mitochondrial function and organization, cellular ubiquitination and proteosome degradation, RNA processing, and chromatin folding. Our microarray data reveal an overexpression of genes involved in ATP synthesis suggesting altered energy requirement that parallels with increased activities of protein degradation. In conclusion, these findings suggest that mitochondrial-ATP-proteasome functions are likely to be involved in RTT clinical features...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{lymphocytes}} {{play a major role in}} coronary plaque destabilization in acute coronary syndromes. The aim of this study was to evaluate circulating lymphocyte apoptosis in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in comparison with subjects with stable angina and with healthy controls. We considered spontaneous <b>lymphomonocyte</b> apoptosis (evaluated by ELISA), interleukin (IL) - 2 production (evaluated by ELISA), Fas expression on T cells (evaluated by flow cytometry) and Fas ligand mRNA (evaluated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), as well as Fas functionality. To evaluate T-cell activation, we also investigated T-cell subpopulations (CD 4 /CD 8 ratio), T-cell surface HLA-DR and CD 69 expression (evaluated by flow cytometry) in blood taken within 6 hours from onset of NSTEMI. Spontaneous apoptosis was significantly increased in NSTEMI patients in comparison with the two control groups and it was associated with an increased expression of Fas, an increased susceptibility to the Fas agonist (CH- 11) and a normal production of IL- 2 in cell cultures. We also found a significant increase of HLA-DR+ CD 3 + and CD 69 + CD 4 + cells in NSTEMI patients. These data suggest that the enhanced apoptosis is due to a mechanism of "active" antigen-driven death, induced by the expression of death cytokines and not by the failure of cell growth factors. We conclude that in case of NSTEMI peripheral lymphocytes are activated and undergo an enhanced programmed cell death due to activation mechanisms. It is likely that lymphocyte activation occurs before the onset of acute ischemia and contributes to the plaque rupture and to the myocardial ischemic insult...|$|E
40|$|Circulating T {{cells and}} monocytes expressing T-bet, pSTAT 1 and pSTAT 3 {{increase}} in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) during relapse. Natalizumab (NZB) {{is an effective}} drug in RRMS, but exacerbation of the disease after its discontinuation has been described in some patients. The aim {{of this research was}} to study the effect of NZB treatment on circulating <b>lymphomonocyte</b> subpopulations expressing T-bet, pSTAT 1, pSTAT 3 and CD 4 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + regulatory T cells. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the percentages of circulating CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, CD 14 + monocytes and B cells expressing T-bet, pSTAT 1, and pSTAT 3, and CD 4 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + regulatory T cells from RRMS patients before and after 6 - 12 NZB infusions. In NZB-treated RRMS patients, the percentages of CD 4 +pSTAT 1 + and CD 8 +pSTAT 1 + T cells, CD 14 +pSTAT 1 + monocytes, CD 4 +T-bet+, CD 8 +T-bet+ and CD 4 +pSTAT 3 + T cells and CD 14 +pSTAT 3 + monocytes increased after 12 drug infusions and were similar to those observed in untreated relapsing RRMS patients. Otherwise in vitro NZB exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from untreated RRMS patients and controls had no effect. It was concluded that NZB treatment determines an accumulation of CD 4 +pSTAT 1 +, CD 8 +pSTAT 1 +, CD 4 +T-bet+, CD 8 +T-bet+ and CD 4 +STAT 3 + T cells in peripheral blood that may account for the exacerbation of the disease observed in some patients after the discontinuation of the drug...|$|E
40|$|Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) systems {{without a}} venous {{reservoir}} rarely are adopted clinically. The {{effects of a}} biocompatible CPB system with a venous reservoir were evaluated on the activation of the coagulation and inflammatory systems. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A university hospital (single center). PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-three {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) surgery patients were assigned to the Physio group (closed venous reservoir, phosphorylcholine coating, and no cardiotomy suction) or the Standard group (open, noncoated, and cardiotomy suction used). METHODS: Blood samples were obtained at 6 different time points before, during, and after surgery. Nuclear factor-kB (NF-κB) was evaluated before surgery and 2 and 24 hours after surgery. Myocardial damage was evaluated measuring cardiac troponin I. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Interleukin (IL) - 6 (a marker of inflammation), prothrombin fragment 1 - 2 (PF- 1. 2, a marker of thrombin generation), plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PAP, a marker of fibrinolysis), and platelet factor 4 (PF 4, a marker of platelet activation) were measured. The DNA binding activity of proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB was quantified in the isolated <b>lymphomonocyte</b> cells. Surgery caused changes of all plasma biomarkers. This reaction was attenuated strongly in the Physio group; PF- 1. 2, PAP, and PF 4 all were decreased significantly. In the Physio group, a significantly lower cardiac troponin I release was observed postoperatively. After surgery, NF-κB activity was reduced in the Physio group although this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal strategy using a closed and phosphorylcholine-coated CPB circuit together with the avoidance of cardiotomy suction reduced activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems intraoperatively, although these changes did not persist postoperatively. However, no difference in clinical outcome was appreciated on a larger scale...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of the acidic glycohydrolase beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase, an enzyme system normally participating in the stepwise degradation of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans, appears to be modulated in lymphocytes and monocytes from peripheral blood of patients affected by multiple sclerosis during different stages of the disease. In particular, {{a significant decrease in}} this enzyme activity, compared with healthy subjects, was observed in patients affected by the relapsing-remitting form both in a stable clinical status and during a relapse as well as in patients with the progressive form. The decrease in total intracellular hexosaminidase activity in <b>lymphomonocytes</b> of multiple sclerosis patients was accompanied by an enrichment of this activity associated with the plasma membrane fraction as demonstrated by experiments of subcellular fractionation. The analysis carried out using two synthetic substrates, 4 -methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide and its sulfate derivative, enables us to demonstrate that this accumulation is mainly due to isoenzymes with a betabeta structure, whereas lysosomal fractions confirmed the classical presence of both alphabeta and betabeta forms (hexosaminidases A and B, respectively). This was particularly evident in the plasma membrane fraction from mononuclear cells of patients with a clinical exacerbation of the disease. Considered together, these observations provide additional insight into the abnormality of peripheral blood immune cells in multiple sclerosis and may contribute {{to the understanding of the}} basic mechanisms underlying the pathological events resulting in the demyelinating process...|$|R
40|$|The de novo {{production}} of steroids and neurosteroids begins in mitochondria by {{the conversion of}} cholesterol to pregnenolone through cytochrome P 450 side-chain cleavage (CYP 11 A 1) enzymatic activity. The C-terminal amino acid domain of the translocator protein (TSPO) has been demonstrated to bind cholesterol, thereby determining its mitochondrial translocation. The goal {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of the Ala 147 Thr single-nucleotide polymorphism localized in this TSPO region on pregnenolone production in healthy volunteers. Pregnenolone production was evaluated in a peripheral cell model, represented by circulating <b>lymphomonocytes.</b> First, CYP 11 A 1 expression, both at mRNA and protein level, was demonstrated. Pregnenolone production varied among genotype groups. Comparison of pregnenolone mean values revealed that Thr 147 homozygous or heterozygous individuals had significantly lower pregnenolone levels compared with Ala 147 homozygous individuals. These findings suggested a dominant effect of the minor allelic variant Thr 147 to produce this first metabolite of the steroidogenesis pathway. Interestingly, Ala 147 homozygous individuals exhibited significant higher levels of circulating cholesterol-rich low-density lipoproteins with respect to heterozygous individuals. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the Ala 147 Thr spontaneous amino acid substitution within TSPO is able to affect pregnenolone production; this should encourage further studies to investigate its potential role in polygenic dyslipidemias.

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether static {{electromagnetic fields}} (EMFs) at a flux density of 4. 75 T, generated by an NMR apparatus (NMRF), could promote movements of Ca 2 þ, cell proliferation, and the eventual production of proinflammatory cytokines in human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) {{as well as}} in Jurkat cells, after exposure to the field for 1 h. The same study was also performed after activation of cells with 5 mg/ml phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). Our results clearly demonstrate that static NMRF exposure has neither proliferative, nor activating, nor proinflammatory effects on both normal and PHA activated PBMC. Moreover, the concentration of interleukin- 1 b, interleukin- 2, interleukin- 6, interferon, and tumour necrosis factor a (TNFa) remained unvaried in exposed cells. Exposure of Jurkat cells statistically decreased the proliferation and the proliferation indexes, which 24 and 48 h after exposure were 0. 70. 29 and 0. 870. 12, respectively. Moreover, in Jurkat cells the [Ca 2 þ]i was higher than in PBMC and was reduced significantly to about one half after exposure. This is consistent with the decrease of proliferation and with the low levels of IL- 2 measured. On the whole, our data suggest that NMRF exposure failed to affect the physiologic behaviour of normal <b>lymphomonocytes.</b> Instead in Jurkat cells, by changing the properties of cell membranes, NMRF can influence Ca 2 þ transport processes, and hence Ca 2 þ homeostasis with improvement of proliferation...|$|R
