40|$|This paper {{proposed}} a novel method to protect <b>logging</b> <b>information</b> more securely. The method, named NIGELOG, produces multiple backups of the <b>logging</b> <b>information,</b> hides them in arbitrary directories, and periodically moves these backups to other directories. Also, NIGELOG can automatically restore the original <b>logging</b> <b>information</b> {{by using the}} backups even if the original file is altered or deleted by intruders. NIGELOG is implemented as a C++ class library with some standard software libraries and does not require additional hardwares such as write-once media. It is easier to apply NIGELOG to UNIX applications which produces log-files. 1 Introduction Intrusion detection consists of the collection of <b>logging</b> <b>information</b> and its analysis. In other words, {{it is impossible to}} detect any intrusion without the logging information(hereafter cited as log-info). In order to find the intrusion, system administrators inspect the log-info manually and intrusion detection systems analyzes the log- [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Part 2 : WorkshopInternational audienceLogging {{information}} {{is necessary in}} order to understand a computer’s behavior. However, {{there is a possibility that}} attackers will delete logs to hide the evidence of their attacking and cheating. Moreover, various problems might cause the loss of <b>logging</b> <b>information.</b> In homeland security, the plans for counter terrorism are based on data. The reliability of the data is depends on that of data collector. Because the reliability of the data collector is ensured by logs, the protection of it is important problem. To address these issues, we propose a system to prevent tampering and loss of <b>logging</b> <b>information</b> using a virtual machine monitor (VMM). In this system, <b>logging</b> <b>information</b> generated by the operating system (OS) and application program (AP) working on the target virtual machine (VM) is gathered by the VMM without any modification of the OS. The security of the <b>logging</b> <b>information</b> is ensured by its isolation from the VM. In addition, the isolation and multiple copying of logs can help in the detection of tampering...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAspects {{provide a}} means of {{separating}} cross-cutting concerns from our core implementation code into separate modules. Cross-cutting concerns are pieces of functionality that are used across multiple parts of a system. They cut across, as opposed to standing alone. For example if every method of our program requires <b>logging</b> <b>information</b> for identification then a logging aspect {{can be applied to}} methods external to the method implementation without using <b>logging</b> <b>information</b> with the methods internally. It's a powerful technique to help employ the principle of separation of concerns within code. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a methodology that provides separation of crosscutting concerns by introducing a new unit of modularization—an aspect.
