40|$|International audienceThis paper {{studies the}} effects of {{introducing}} centrifugal incentives in an otherwise standard Downsian model of electoral competition. First, we demonstrate that a symmetric equilibrium is guaranteed to exist when centrifugal incentives are induced by any kind of partial voter participation (such as abstention due to indifference, abstention due to alienation, etc.) and, then, we argue that: (a) this symmetric equilibrium is in pure strategies, and it is hence convergent, only when centrifugal incentives are sufficiently weak on both sides; (b) when centrifugal incentives are strong on both sides (when, for example, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> abstain when they are sufficiently indifferent between the two candidates) players use mixed strategies—the stronger the centrifugal incentives, the larger the probability weight that players assign to locations near the extremes; and (c) when centrifugal incentives are strong on one side only—say for example only on the right—the support of players’ mixed strategies contain all policies except from those that are sufficiently close to the left extreme...|$|E

It won four seats in the ensuing 2007 general elections, by far out performing its predecessor Ford Kenya. These included Housing Minister Hon Soita Shitanda, Hon Bonny Khalwale, the vocal chairperson of Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, that audits government spending and hence deals with matters on corruption, and Fwamba NC Fwamba, the founding chairman of the Democratic Union for Change (D.U.C). In 2011 Hon Eugene Wamalwa joined the party and announced plans to run on the party ticket {{as the president of}} Kenya at the March 4, 2013 elections. This created a big interest in the party with <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> in his native Bungoma and Trans Nzoia counties joining the party in droves. By October 2012, the party had registered 67,345 members and won three civic seats in Bungoma and Trans Nzoia. in the runup to the March 2013 elections, the party was working with other 'like minded parties' such as the National Alliance, United Republican Party and Wiper Democratic Movement. but was left out of the coalition they formed known as the Jubilee Alliance.

30|$|This {{theory of}} how online {{information}} seeking relates to eventual outcomes {{suggests that a}} model which uses Wikipedia page views to predict electoral outcomes should take into account several factors. First, we would expect new parties, already established parties and incumbent parties to experience different page view dynamics, with newer parties receiving a disproportionately large amount of page views compared to their final number of votes (a result already observed in socially generated predictions based on Twitter data [16]), whilst more established parties experience the reverse effect. Second, parties attracting <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> swing <b>voters</b> may also do disproportionately well in page view statistics, whilst parties which are losing votes may again do disproportionately badly. Finally, coverage of the political party in the mainstream news media may well correlate with voting behaviour itself, as well as serving to ‘replace’ any effect of Wikipedia page views (hence parties which are well covered by the news media are may be badly covered by Wikipedia).|$|R
30|$|Based on this information, we also {{enhanced}} our {{theory of}} the sources of Wikipedia traffic before election time. We have shown good evidence that newer parties which attracted a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> swing <b>voters</b> received disproportionately high levels of Wikipedia traffic. Our data is at an aggregate level therefore we cannot offer firm conclusions about individual behaviour: however, the data is consistent with the idea that voters do not seek information uniformly about all parties at election time. Rather, they behave like ‘cognitive misers’, being more likely to seek information on new political parties with which they do not have previous experience and being more likely to seek information only when they are actually changing the way they vote. By contrast, {{there was no evidence of}} a ‘media effect’: there was little correlation between news media mentions and overall Wikipedia traffic patterns. Indeed, the news media and Wikipedia appeared biased towards different things: with news favouring incumbent parties, whilst Wikipedia favoured new ones. Furthermore, there was no evidence of a ‘viability’ effect: voters did not appear to ignore parties that had little realistic chance of gaining power.|$|R
30|$|For each party, we {{recorded}} several variables of interest. First, {{we recorded}} {{the amount of}} views the page of the political party in question in the corresponding Wikipedia language edition received in {{the week before the}} election. There was some ambiguity about which Wikipedia page to use in some cases, especially where more than one party presented itself {{in the form of a}} coalition, and hence more than one page could be valid. In these cases, we always used the Wikipedia page which had the highest number of views. A full list of the Wikipedia pages used is available in Additional file  1. Results of the 2009 and 2014 elections were taken from the official web page of the elections. 3 Results of the 2004 elections, which were needed to calculate the change between 2004 and 2009, were taken from the Norwegian Centre for Research Data. 4 We then also recorded the percentage of the vote achieved by the party, and the difference between that percentage and the previous year, in order to try and captures whether voters swung towards or away from the party. Change in vote share is, of course, not identical to the amount of swing voters: a party could, for example, gain and lose the same number of votes, which would mean <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> swing <b>voters</b> but no visible aggregate change. However, we expect the amount <b>of</b> swing <b>voters</b> and the amount of change to be correlated.|$|R
