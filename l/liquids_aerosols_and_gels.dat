The simulations combine ‘What-if’ attack scenarios involving the use of LAG explosives, LAG explosive detection systems and alternative procedures of security checks of passengers and hand luggage at European airports. The operational constraints and consequences of security incidents are modelled as random events, employing software-based business process-modelling techniques. Frequency distributions of fatalities generated in the computer experiments are evaluated and compared, systematically and in quantitative terms, using risk assessment methods recently developed in the operational sciences.

40|$|Airports {{accommodate}} passengers with a {{range of}} prior experience, from frequent flyers, to passengers who fly every couple of years, to those who have never flown before. Passengers with varying levels of prior experience may use different visual elements when navigating the airport. Ensuring all passengers can navigate to the processing activities intuitively is important for passengers, airports and airlines. This paper examines how participants with Low, Medium and High airport familiarity navigate through the departures area at an Australian international airport. Three navigation activities are investigated: (i) navigating to the check-in row, (ii) navigating through the <b>Liquids,</b> <b>Aerosols</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gels</b> (LAGs) preparation area before security screening, and; (iii) navigating to either the boarding gate first or to a discretionary activity first, after exiting customs. In the three activities, differences were observed between the familiarity groups. These differences include the use of different information to locate the check-in desk, different actions when navigating through the LAG preparation area, and evidence that Low familiarity passengers have a desire to locate the boarding gate as soon as possible once through customs. This research provides evidence based design reccomendations for airports to benefit from intuitive passenger navigation...|$|E
40|$|Restrictions on the {{carriage}} of <b>liquids,</b> <b>aerosol,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gels</b> (LAGs) by airline passengers {{have been in}} place since November 2006, following the discovery of a terrorist plot involving homemade liquid explosives to be used on transatlantic flights (Wikipedia, 2006). Restrictions on {{the carriage}} of LAGs remain today, and the operational impact of introducing further screening of liquids is subject to ongoing debate. This paper addresses one of the concerns, namely that the false alarm rates of liquid explosive detection systems (LEDS) are adversely affected by the filling level of LAGs containers. Our study contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the operational impact of screening partially full containers, based on a large number of screening repetitions under laboratory conditions and robust statistical analysis. False alarm rates were observed for 39 LAGs screened with 5 different LEDS. For each combination, four different container filling levels (100 %, 75 %, 50 % and 25 %) were studied. These observations were used to model the impact of partially filling for sequential combinations of equipment. Three possible scenarios were considered, namely passengers being allowed to carry (1) only water, (2) water & soft drinks, and (3) all LAGs. The results show that, for a sequential combination of two equipment types, the impact of partially filled containers on the overall false alarm rate is negligible. Nevertheless, partially filled containers do result in an approximate two-fold increase in the number of items requiring level-two screening, which may be significant for airports when managing their screening processes.

Sulfuric acid aerosols can take up nitric acid near the ice frost point, just before ice nucleation. Aerosols in the tropopause region may show a larger spread of extinction and extinction ratios at different wavelengths than background stratospheric aerosols. The high surface areas and low extinction ratios of subvisible cirrus deduced from satellite observations {{are unlikely to be}} due purely to aerosols, except for high sulfate loadings.

A fourth ice mode represents ice from other sources. The competition of these modes for available water is realized in a physical parameterization scheme considering also the effect of preexisting ice on the ice nucleation process.

Reductions in zonal mean annual average cirrus ice particle number concentrations induced by heterogeneous nucleation of up to 20 % in the tropics and 1 %– 10 % in the midlatitudes are simulated. The effect is further amplified by ice formation on aircraft-generated soot.

Therefore, many considerations must be fulfilled before adopting in vitro bioassay test systems for toxicity screening of airborne materials. However, recent methodological and technical breakthroughs of in vitro methods {{have the potential to}} fulfil the essential requirements of toxicity testing for airborne chemicals. Technology has now become available that allows cells to be cultured on permeable microporous membranes in transwell or snapwell inserts providing a very close contact between target cells and test atmospheres to study the cellular interactions caused by airborne chemical exposures without any interfering culture medium. Using a direct exposure technique at the air-liquid interface, target cells can be continuously exposed to airborne chemicals on their apical side, while being nourished from their basolateral side.

40|$|Abstract: The wetting {{behaviour}} of liquids on fine fibres {{is important}} in many industries, including textile manufacture and cleaning, industrial coating of fibres and wires, nanotechnology, and also in both the filtration of <b>liquid</b> <b>aerosols,</b> <b>and</b> wet filtration technology for industrial air pollution control. Experimental observation of the wetting processes of fibre/liquid systems (during air filtration when airflow forces are acting) shows many important features such as droplet oscillatory motion and movement or flow of droplets along fibres. The oscillation {{is believed to be}} induced by the onset of the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Two dimensional flow in this region is usually modelled using the classical Karman vortex street, however there exist no 3 D equivalents. A model incorporating the interfacial tension between the droplet and fibre and considering this as a restoring force to resist drag force, has been developed (using MATLAB) to examine this phenomenon without the need to consider the Karman vortex. The model is capable of describing the general motion of a droplet {{as a function of the}} physical parameters drag force, droplet mass, and the restoring force. A further important phenomenon noted was the effect of the fibre inclination on droplet motion down the fibre. A second model incorporating drag forces and gravitational forces acting on a droplet has been developed which allows the optimum fibre angle for maximum droplet flow to be determined for a given filter installation. This latter model is very important for filter design in wet filtration systems. Both models were compared to experimental results obtained from image analysis in the MATLAB Image Analysis Toolbox, with favourable results. Both models have the potential to improve the design/efficiency of wet filter systems, and also are relevant to other areas of fibre wetting...|$|R

This article experimentally investigates the deformation and detachment of liquid droplets on three different solid surfaces in a fully developed turbulent channel flow. It is shown that the droplets either are compressed or elongate under the turbulent flow. The elongation of the droplet due to the turbulent flow is measured and presented. When the friction velocity of the flow exceeds a critical value, the droplets slide along the surface. The critical friction velocity is found empirically to be inversely proportional to the square root of the contact diameter. The sliding velocity after detachment is also reported. It has been observed by many researchers that, when the external force is gravity or a simple shear flow, the retention force of the droplet {{is proportional to the}} difference between the cosines of the receding and advancing contact angles. As the shape of a deformed droplet is much more complex under a turbulent flow, this article discusses the applicability of the same relation to the turbulent channel flow...|$|R
40|$|Compared to {{the solid}} and gaseous phases, liquids are {{more closely related}} to {{biological}} processes and the life sciences. In fact, it is generally believed that abiogenesis occurred in the liquid environment of the primordial sea which, itself, was formed only when appropriate conditions came to prevail on the young Earth, providing a striking illustration of the marginal character of the liquid state, in contrast with the solid and gaseous phases of the same substances, which exist over much wider ranges of temperature and pressure: the liquid state arises from a delicate balance between packing of molecules and cohesive forces or, more formally, between entropy and energy. The importance of a full quantitative understanding of liquids is only obvious. Following research in simple liquids, a new area of complex liquids emerged for the study of systems which exhibit ow, but whose liquid-like behaviour cannot be explained by the standard one-body picture used in simple liquids, as interatomic forces are significantly different from the hard-sphere type. The term complex liquid can be interchangeably used with complex fluid or soft matter - following P. G. de Gennes. Many examples of complex liquids involve the mixing of different phases, be they fluid or not in their own right, such as solid and liquid (to make up gel or sol), liquid and gas (to make up foam or <b>liquid</b> <b>aerosol),</b> <b>and</b> solid and gas (to make up solid foam or solid aerosol). Under appropriate conditions, these complex liquid examples, known as colloids, will exhibit fluid-like behaviour on the macroscopic scale.

Setting out with a definition, examples of polymers, and a brief discussion of the practical applications of this work, the General Introduction gives an overview of the theoretical progress in the area of polymer adsorption.

40|$|Thin and sub-visual cirrus cloud reside at or {{near the}} {{tropical}} tropopause layer (TTL) with high frequency and {{have a significant impact on}} climate due to their effect on the radiation balance relating to the microphysical properties. There is a significant lack of information about cirrus clouds including the conditions that form them as well as how these clouds evolve in time and difficulties in representing these clouds in models with high resolution. TTL observations show an atmospheric phenomenon of very low ice number concentration and substantial in-cloud super-saturations in cirrus cloud (0. 005 - 0. 2 cm- 3 and RHj up to 130 % respectively) which is at odds with homogeneous nucleation only. In this work, we have made use of recent experimental laboratory results (conducted at the AIDA chamber in Germany) which have indicated that aerosol solution particles can become glassy and therefore solid particles when the temperatures are low and similar to TTL temperatures. Glassy aerosols have the potential to form ice particles with much lower freezing thresholds than <b>liquid</b> <b>aerosols</b> need <b>and</b> there is likely an abundance of these particles in the TTL region, unlike typical IN particles. By incorporating the experimental results into the Advanced Particle Simulation Code (APSC), it has been shown that cirrus formed by only homogeneous freezing agrees with observations only for weak updrafts (up to 3 or 4 cm/s) and only for a deposition coefficient, (1, equal to 1. 0. The simulations with glassy particles have shown good agreement of modelled cirrus cloud properties with TTL observation when forced by gravity waves whereas <b>liquid</b> <b>aerosol</b> nucleation is at odds with the observations. In this work, it has been shown that using the latest experimental results of glassy nucleation incorporated in a cirrus model shows that glassy aerosol nucleation is a likely explanation for TTL observations.

40|$|The {{atmosphere}} contains solid <b>and</b> <b>liquid</b> particles (<b>aerosols)</b> <b>and</b> clouds, which {{interact with}} the incoming and outgoing radiation in a complex and spatially very variable manner. Aerosol particles are a largely natural, though highly variable, component of our atmosphere. Aerosols affect our environment at the local, regional, and global levels. There are many factors that are known to influence climate, both natural and human-induced. The increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases <b>and</b> <b>aerosols</b> through human activity is of particular concern. The effect of the increasing amount of aerosols on the radiative forcing is not yet well known. Regional patterns of climate change depend significantly on the time dependence of the forcing, the spatial distribution of <b>aerosol</b> concentrations <b>and</b> details of the modelled climate processes. Determination of aerosol optical depth from satellite remote sensing measurements is extremely complex due to the large variability of aerosol optical properties. Significant simplification occurs when measurements are taken over water since the ocean reflection signal can be taken as negligible in the near infrared. Unfortunately, over land, most of the signal {{can be attributed to}} ground reflectance. In this paper we propose a new approach to retrieve aerosol properties over land surfaces, especially high reflectance surface including arid, semiarid, and urban areas, where the surface reflectance is usually very bright in the red part of visible spectrum and in the near infrared, but is much darker in the blue spectra...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{stratospheric aerosol}} climate records {{developed in the}} framework of the Aerosol_cci project, one of the 14 parallel projects from the ESA Climate Change Initiative. These data records were processed from a stratospheric aerosol dataset derived from the GOMOS experiment, using an inversion algorithm optimized for aerosol retrieval, called AerGOM. They provide a suite of aerosol parameters, such as the aerosol extinction coefficient at differentwavelengths in the UV–visible range. The extinction record includes the total extinction aswell as separate fields for <b>liquid</b> sulfate <b>aerosols</b> <b>and</b> polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). Several additional fields (PSC flag, etc.) are also provided. The resulting stratospheric aerosol dataset, which spans the whole duration of the GOMOS mission (2002 − 2012), was validated using different reference datasets (lidar and balloon profiles). In the present paper, the emphasis is put on the extinction records. After a thorough analysis of the original AerGOM dataset, we describe the methodology used to construct the gridded CCI-GOMOS dataset and the resulting improvements on both the AerGOM algorithmand the binning procedure, in terms of spatio-temporal resolution, coverage and data quality. The extinction datasets were validated using lidar profiles from three ground-based stations (Mauna Loa, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Dumont d'Urville). The median difference of the CCI-GOMOS (Level 3) extinction and ground-based lidar profiles is between 15...|$|R
