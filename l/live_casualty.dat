This Mw 7.3 earthquake was preceded by precursors, i.e., many small earthquakes, a change in groundwater levels, abnormal animal behaviors, etc. (e.g., Adams 1976). The regional government determined that a large earthquake was about to occur and, the morning of February 4 th, mandated the residents to evacuate to safe places. Later in the evening, the earthquake destroyed the populated city of one million residents. Most of the buildings had been built without the strength to withstand the earthquake.

40|$|A major {{incident}} has {{occurred when the}} number of <b>live</b> <b>casualties,</b> severity, type of incident or location requires extraordinary resources. Major incident management is interdisciplinary and involves triage, treatment and transport of patients. We aimed to investigate experiences within {{major incident}} preparedness and management among Norwegian rescue workers. A questionnaire was answered by 918 rescue workers across Norway. Questions rated from 1 (doesn’t work) to 7 (works excellently) are presented as median and range. Health-care personnel constituted 34. 1 % of the participants, firefighters 54. 1 % and police 11. 8 %. Training for major incident response scored 5 (1, 7) among health-care workers and 4 (1, 7) among firefighters and police. Preparedness for major incident response scored 5 (1, 7) for all professions. Interdisciplinary cooperation scored 5 (3, 7) among health-care workers and police and 5 (1, 7) among firefighters. Among health-care workers, 77. 5 % answered that a system for major-incident triage exists; 56. 3 % had triage equipment available. The majority – 45. 1 % of health-care workers, 44. 7 % of firefighters and 60. 4 % of police – did not know {{how long it would take}} to get emergency stretchers to the scene. Rescue personnel find major incident preparedness and on-scene multidisciplinary cooperation to function well. Some shortcomings are reported with regard to systems for major incident triage, tagging equipment for triage and knowledge about access to emergency stretchers...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Whilst a {{disaster}} is typically {{thought of as}} a naturally occurring event (such as an earthquake or tidal wave), a mass casualty situation may occur from a natural or man-made source (such as a mass transportation collision, or industrial fire). In many higher income countries, mass casualty situations tend to be referred to as Major Incidents. Although a standard understanding of what constitutes a major incident has not been agreed, with the term being interchanged with both mass casualty incident and disaster, for health services a major incident may be considered to be: “any occurrence which presents a serious threat {{to the health of the}} community, disruption to the service or causes (or is likely to cause) such numbers or types of casualties as to require special arrangements to be implemented by hospitals, ambulance services or health authorities”. (Major incidents for services other than the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) will not affect health providers, and so are not considered in any more detail here.) This definition is intentionally broad, to cover incidents from food poisoning outbreaks to planning for mass gatherings. However, major incidents are generally regarded as events which are unpredictable, sudden and which result in a large number of injured or ill casualties presenting to the emergency services over a short period of time. The alternative term used is Mass Casualty Incidents (MCI), loosely described as “the most demanding and chaotic events a responder will ever be confronted with”, the ultimate goal being to get the greatest number of survivable patients to treatment facilities in the shortest amount of time. The point at which a major incident occurs is dependent upon the ability of health service resources at the time of the incident to cope with the patient workload. Major incidents may therefore occur with relatively small numbers of casualties if resources are scarce: this is particularly likely to occur in low and middle income countries where healthcare resources are limited at the best of times. The health services definition also takes into account the severity of injury, as an incident resulting in a small number of casualties may require a major incident response if they are all severely injured. Currently there does not exist a form of quality measurement for evaluation of a response to a major incident but emergency services aim for an early activation of sufficient personnel, rapid access to a secured scene and efficient patient evacuation to the correct facility. In the Western Cape a major incident is declared at the discretion of the most senior Emergency Medical Services (EMS) staff who are present at the scene. Usually this includes: where the resources used are more than 2 ambulances, other agencies are involved (Fire and Rescue) or 3 or more patients, 5 most commonly though the MIMMS definition is used “any incident where the location, number, severity or type of <b>live</b> <b>casualties</b> requires extraordinary resources”. The objectives of this study were (i) to describe the incident type related to total number in the study, (ii) to describe the severity in relation to total number of patients, (iii) to describe the weather conditions prevalent at incidents, (iv) to determine weather conditions associated with red triage category, and (v) to determine which vehicle types are involved in MVC’s. This is the first study to describe major incidents in an African setting. Understanding the types of incidents responded to and the injury severity of patients, will allow more robust planning for future similar incidents. Further to this prevalence of incidents in particular traffic related “hot spots” can be identified and problems rectified...|$|R

40|$|The Netherlands Armed Forces use - 80 °C frozen {{red blood}} cells (RBCs), plasma and {{platelets}} combined with regular liquid stored RBCs, {{for the treatment of}} (military) casualties in Medical Treatment Facilities abroad. Our objective was to assess and compare the use of - 80 °C frozen blood products in combination with the different transfusion protocols and their effect on the outcome of trauma casualties. Hemovigilance and combat casualties data from Afghanistan 2006 - 2010 for 272 (military) trauma casualties with or without massive transfusions (MT: ≥ 6 RBC/ 24 hr, N = 82 and non-MT: 1 - 5 RBC/ 24 hr, N = 190) were analyzed retrospectively. In November 2007, a massive transfusion protocol (MTP; 4 : 3 : 1 RBC:Plasma:Platelets) for ATLS® class III/IV hemorrhage was introduced in military theatre. Blood product use, injury severity and mortality were assessed pre- and post-introduction of the MTP. Data were compared to civilian and military trauma studies to assess effectiveness of the frozen blood products and MTP. No ABO incompatible blood products were transfused and only 1 mild transfusion reaction was observed with 3, 060 transfused products. In hospital mortality decreased post-MTP for MT patients from 44 % to 14 % (P = 0. 005) and for non-MT patients from 12. 7 % to 5. 9 % (P = 0. 139).

40|$|According to the {{practice}} guidelines of the American Burn Association on burn shock resuscitation, intravenous (IV) fluid therapy is the standard of care for the replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses in burn injury of ≥ 20 % of the total body surface area.

The requirement of the continuing IV fluid therapy was reduced by an average of 58 % in the first 24 hours after the injury (range 37 - 78 %).

40|$|Background: Iran {{has been}} a very disaster-prone country {{throughout}} its history. Wars, earthquakes, floods, droughts, inversion effects of air pollution in metropolitan have occurred many times, affected millions of people, and have claimed hundred thousands of lives during past century. Recently the fatal earthquake of Bam claimed more than 30000 <b>lives</b> and many <b>casualties</b> and economic lost, while in USA, a similar earthquake just killed 2 people and damaged much less. This may raise a fundamental question in our mind: why do disasters in developed countries cause the least amount of damages while in developing countries such Iran in the same situation the most indemnity? Methodology: This research aimed at studying existing Disaster Management System (DMS) in Iran and illuminating weaknesses during a crisis using a survey and reviewing the literature on DMS in developed and developing countries. Results and Discussion: In Iran, disaster management is managed by National Committee for Natural Disaster Management, which is located in Ministry of Interior. When the National Disaster Management Organization (NDMO) is located in a line ministry, it {{may not be able to}} guarantee the representation and participation of the other line ministries. Considering our culture and annually billions $ damages of natural and manmade disasters and claiming much life (which we cannot account their worth by money), psychological and economical problems as aftermath of disasters, Creating NDMO in president’s office has many advantages. Disaster management is a cycle started from mitigation, preparedness, response and ended with recovery. In Iran, in mitigation and preparedness phases we have not done much. There is no stiff rule in building code, planning for response, drill and etc. We have had many disasters and we have many experiences in response, so DMS, response to disasters rationally well. Preparedness for response increase effectiveness and efficiency of response. Recovery after major incidents includes psychology, jobs, homes, and treatment matters. There is a need for planning in this period. Finally, every phase of DM should comprise a cycle of comprehensive planning, execution and feedback. Any type of crisis planning needs sufficient information from databases. Lack of Access to great databases like spatial database information and Geographic Database Information and communication among organizations to interchange information are major problems for disaster managers before and after disasters. Another problem is fiscal affaires after disasters. In developed countries, insurance plays a main role in risk transfer and Funds for rebuilding. Finally, Experiences recognized education as a major part of reducing vulnerability. People need appropriate public education in self-protecting behaviors, relief aids, mitigation etc. Except some maneuvers and limited educations, we have not done much education to improve effectiveness of DM. Conclusion: there are some challenges In DMS: firstly, creation of an independent NDMO in President’s Office is a necessity. Secondly, in disaster management, all aspects must be considered in the same importance and as a whole not separately. Thirdly, disaster databases such as SDI or GDI should be created and finally insurance and education of people should consume great deal of efforts...|$|R
40|$|SafetyCube aims {{to develop}} an {{innovative}} road safety Decision Support System (DSS) that will enable policy-makers and stakeholders to select the most appropriate strategies, measures and cost-effective approaches to reduce casualties of all road user types and all severities. Work Package 7 of SafetyCube is dedicated to serious road traffic injuries, their health impacts and their costs. This Deliverable discusses health impacts of (serious) road traffic injuries. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Serious road traffic injuries are increasingly being adopted as an additional indicator for road safety, next to fatalities. Reducing the number of serious traffic injuries {{is one of the}} key priorities in the road safety programme 2011 - 2020 of the European Commission. Serious and other non-fatal injuries can have a major impact on the quality of life of a crash survivor and their relatives and also pose a burden to society. The consequences of injuries are very determinative for the costs of injuries for society. Moreover, consequences of injuries differ between casualties. To further optimize road safety policy, it is important to obtain greater insight into the consequences of different road traffic injuries, both for the individual and for society as a whole. This Deliverable discusses the impacts of non-fatal road traffic injuries in terms of: * Physical/functional, psychological and socio-economic consequences for casualties; and * Burden of injury (expressed in Years Lived with Disability). METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: Road traffic injuries have a wide range of potential consequences. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a framework for discussing consequences for individual road traffic casualties. According to the ICF, road traffic injuries can result in disabilities related to one or more levels of human functioning: 1) Problems in body function or structure (impairments), e. g. paralysis 2) Activity limitations, e. g. being unable to walk 3) Participation restrictions, e. g. being unable to work The extent to which an injury influences activities and participation of a casualty also depends on personal and environmental factors. By means of a literature review and a number of additional case studies, disabilities due to road traffic injuries related to different levels of human functioning as well as the influence of personal and environmental factors are investigated. The societal burden of injuries can be expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). This measure integrates mortality, expressed in Years of Life Lost (YLL) and morbidity, expressed in Years Lived with Disability (YLD). This Deliverable focuses on non-fatal injuries (YLDs). The burden of non-fatal road traffic injuries is examined by means of a literature review and by estimating the burden of road injuries for six countries, applying a method that was developed within the European INTEGRIS study. Literature review (Chapter 3) : The literature review aims to provide an overview of current knowledge on consequences of road traffic injuries for both individual casualties and their relatives and society as a whole. The review is based on a recent review conducted by SWOV. This review has been extended and updated, and now covers studies published between 2000 and August 2016. The literature review shows that road traffic injuries can have major consequences for <b>lives</b> of <b>casualties</b> (and their families) and that they create a major burden to society as a whole. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (Haagsma et al., 2016), non-fatal road traffic injuries account for 8. 6 million Years Lived with Disability (YLD) worldwide. Reported prevalence of disability differs considerably between studies, depending on the characteristics of the casualties taken into account (e. g. injury severity), the duration of the follow-up and the type of disabilities that are taken into account. Self-reported prevalence of disabilities varies for example between 11 % and 80 % according to the most recent review. Reported consequences relate to all three levels of human functioning (impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions) defined in the ICF. Reported consequences of being injured in a crash include for example pain, fatigue, mobility problems, problems carrying out daily activities, impacts on the everyday life of the family and on leisure activities and sick leaves. Moreover, the literature shows that road traffic injuries also lead to psychological disorders, the most common disorder being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Consequences differ from one casualty to the other, depending on type and severity of injury, transport mode and several personal and environmental factors like age, gender, comorbidity and socio-economic status. Concerning injury severity, studies quite consistently show that the risks of mainly functional and socio-economic consequences increase as a function of the injury severity. However, minor injuries, like strain injuries to the spine, may also have grave long-term consequences. Moreover, as less severe injuries are much more common than severe ones, they are responsible for a high percentage of disabilities and consequently represent a large share in the burden of injury. Transport modes that are linked to a relatively high prevalence of long-term disabilities are pedestrians and motorcyclists. Concerning age, prevalence of physical health impacts appears to be lower for younger casualties and concerning gender, women experience more physical and psychological consequences than men. Case studies on impacts of road traffic injuries on casualties’ lives (Chapter 4) : Some of the SafetyCube partners have access to additional studies/data on impacts of injuries obtained in road traffic crashes. The results of the following five studies are included in this Deliverable: * The Spanish study on the Health Impacts of Road traffic crashes; a nationwide household survey conducted among 213, 626 respondents, including 473 persons who reported one or more disabilities due to a road traffic crash. * The ESPARR study; a prospective cohort follow-up study in the Rhône region in France that determined the long term health impacts of road traffic crashes. 1972 participants, including 433 MAIS 3 + casualties have been followed up to five years after the crash. * An analysis of two datasets from the UK: 1) a dataset collected as part of a PhD research, that followed 50 road crash casualties who were admitted to hospitals in the UK Midlands until one year after the crash, and; 2) data collected for the Impact of Injury study, a multi-centre follow-up study, including 114 road traffic casualties, that explored the impact of unintentional injuries up to 1 year. * Information collected one year after the crash by the Hannover Medical School for 608 respondents that were involved in crashes that were included in the GIDAS in-depth database. * The MyLAC (‘My Life After the Crash’) study; an international retrospective survey that aimed to investigate medical, psychological, social and economic consequences of road traffic injuries. 755 road traffic casualties from 20 different countries responded to a questionnaire. Most of these case studies, as most studies discussed in the literature review, are follow-up studies in which road traffic casualties were asked to fill out a questionnaire on perceived impacts of sustained injuries. The main limitation of such questionnaires is that non-response is often quite high and might introduce a bias, overestimating the proportion of casualties that experience negative consequences. Moreover, none of the studies provides a full picture of all possible impacts of road traffic injuries for different groups of injuries, on different moments in time. However, they all provide some interesting information. The ESPARR cohort study appears to be the most comprehensive study available concerning impacts of road traffic injuries. The case studies confirm the conclusion from the literature review that (serious) road traffic injuries experience all kinds of functional, psychological and soci 0 -economic consequences. According to the ESPARR study for example, three quarters of the MAIS 3 + casualties and one third of the MAIS< 3 casualties is not fully recovered three years after the crash. Pain is the most often reported functional consequence in the ESPARR cohort study. In the Spanish study most reported disabilities due to road traffic crashes (all severities) are related to mobility and home life. Psychological consequences include PTSD, chronic depression or anxiety and fears. Socio-economic consequences discussed in the case studies include being unable to work, financial consequences, negative impact on family life and impacts on the housing situation. In Germany for example, 7 % of the people involved in a crash reported that they were not able to return to their old job, 8 % reported a slow restart and 2 % had to modify their home or to move. The MyLAC study also provide information on the consequences of crashes for relatives of the road traffic casualties. More than one third of the casualties reported that the crash had had consequences on at least one of their relatives’ personal or professional life. Most of the case studies also include less severe injured casualties. In the ESPARR study and the UK case studies it is possible to compare the consequences for serious road traffic injuries with consequences perceived by people that are less severely injured. This analysis shows that also MAIS< 3 casualties quite often encounter negative consequences, although less often and less long lasting than MAIS 3 + casualties do. Looking at different types of road users, consequences appear to be larger for pedestrians and motorized two-wheelers.
