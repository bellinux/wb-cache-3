Reactions of germanium, tin and <b>lead</b> <b>alkyls,</b> aryls, halides and heterocycles with K(tmeda) :Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 } afforded complexes such as K(tmeda) Sn{CH(SiMe 3) 2 } 2 {Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 }}, which exhibits the first structurally characterised Ga Sn bond in a molecular complex. Group 6, 9 and 11 metal halide complexes were treated with K(tmeda) :Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 }, yielding complexes such as (IPr) Cu{Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 }} and (IPr) Ag{Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 }}. These complexes exhibit the first structurally characterised Ga Cu and Ga Ag bonds in molecular complexes. A study of the reactivity of (lPr) Cu{Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 }} with unsaturated organic substrates suggested that the Ga Cu bond is quite inert. Salt metathesis reactions of group 10 metal halide complexes with K(tmeda) :Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 } afforded complexes such as (dppe) Pt{Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 } } 2. An investigation into the further reactivity of this complex towards ter/-butylphosphaalkyne yielded a platinum(II) complex, (dppe) Pt{Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 }}{Ga{ PC(Bul) C(H) - (NAr) C(H) N(Ar) }}, which exhibits a formally anionic P,N-heterocyclic gallium(I) ligand. The kinetics {{of the formation of}} this complex were studied. A novel gallium(III) complex, GaI 2 {C(But) P(H) C(But) =P} 2, was formed by the disproportionation reaction of :Sn(n 4 -P 2 C 2 But 2) with "Gal". The oxidative insertion reaction of K(tmeda) :Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 } with FisoH yielded the gallium(III) hydride, {N(Ar) C(H) N(Ar) -K}(H) Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 }. Reaction of the digallane(4), Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 } 2, with N 3 -SiMe 3 afforded the paramagnetic complex, {u- N(SiMe 3) }Ga{ N(Ar) C(H) 2 '} 2, which was studied by EPR spectroscopy. A synthetic route to the novel gallium(I) NHC analogue, K(tmeda) :Ga{ N(Ar) C(Me) 2 }, is also described. Work performed in Monash University, involving bulky amidinate and guanidinate ligands, is also discussed. A novel cationic boron heterocycle, BrB(Giso) + (Giso" = {N(Ar) } 2 CNCy 2 l, was synthesised from BBr 3 and the gallium(I) guanidinate, :Ga(Giso). The use of Sm(Giso) 2 as a one-electron reducing agent is exploited in the coupling of two molecules of CS 2 by formation of a C S bond to yield {Sm(Giso) 2 } 2 (uvr 2 :Ti 2 -SCSCS 2).

A peak area recorded on the chart paper is proportioned to each other atlkyl lead content. The apparatus for gas chromatography, which was developed, consisted of an aluminum-made thermostat chamber (28 cm in diameter and about 7 cm in height) with a column of Teflon tube (3 mm × 3 m). The instrument of atomic absorption spectrometer used was Shimadzu Multichannel, Model MAF- 1, fitted with 5 cm slot burner of premixing type.

These results show that Greek and Roman lead and silver mining and smelting activities polluted the middle troposphere of the Northern Hemisphere on a hemispheric scale two millennia ago, long before the Industrial Revolution.

40|$|Global {{atmospheric}} {{sources of}} lead have increased more than 100 -fold {{over the past century}} as a result of deforestation, coal combustion, ore smelting and leaded petroleum. Lead compounds generally accumulate in depositional areas across the globe where, due to low solubility and relative freedom from microbial degradation, the history of their inputs is preserved. In lakes there is rapid deposition and often little bioturbation of lead, resulting in an excellent depositional history of changes in both natural and anthropogenic sources. The objective {{of this study was to}} use sediments from a regionally bounded set of lakes to provide an indication of the rates of environmental inputs of lead whilst taking into account differences of trophic state and lead exposure between lakes. Intact sediment gravity cores were collected from 13 Rotorua lakes in North Island of New Zealand between March 2006 and January 2007. Cores penetrated sediments to a depth of 16 – 30 cm and contained volcanic tephra from the 1886 AD Tarawera eruption. The upper depth of the Tarawera tephra enabled prescription of a date for the associated depth in the core (120 years). Each core showed a sub-surface peak in lead concentration above the Tarawera tephra which was contemporaneous with the peak use of <b>lead</b> <b>alkyl</b> as a petroleum additive in New Zealand. An 8 m piston core was taken in the largest of the lakes, Lake Rotorua, in March 2007. The lake is antipodal to the pre-industrial sources of atmospheric lead but still shows increasing lead concentrations from < 2 up to 3. 5 μg g− 1 between the Whakatane eruption (5530 ± 60 cal. yr BP) and the Tarawera eruption. Peaks in lead concentration in Lake Rotorua are associated with volcanic tephras, but are small compared with those arising from recent anthropogenic-derived lead deposition. Our results show that diagenetic processes associated with iron, manganese and sulfate oxidation-reduction, and sulfide precipitation, act to smooth distributions of lead from anthropogenic sources in the lake sediments. The extent of this smoothing can be related to changes in sulfate availability and reduction in sulfide driven by differences in trophic status amongst the lakes. Greatest lead mobilisation occurs in mesotrophic lakes during seasonal anoxia as iron and manganese are released to the porewater, allowing upward migration of lead towards the sediment–water interface. This lead mobilisation can only occur if sulfides are not present. The sub-surface peak in lead concentrations in lake sediments ascribed to <b>lead</b> <b>alkyl</b> in petroleum persists despite the diagenetic processes acting to disperse lead within the sediments and into the overlying water...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Lead (Pb) {{poisoning}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and preventable environmental health problems. There are different sources of environmental pollution with <b>lead</b> as <b>lead</b> <b>alkyl</b> additives in petrol and manufacturing processes. Pb in the atmosphere can be deposited in urban soils, and may then be re-suspended to re-enter the atmosphere. This could increase human exposure to Pb and cause long-term health effects. Thus, monitoring Pb pollution is considered one of the major tasks in controlling pollution. Scalp hair can be utilized for the determination of lead (Pb) concentration. It provides a lasting record of metal intakes of weeks or even months, and for most metals, their accumulation in hair reflects their accumulation in the whole body. This work was conducted to investigate the concentration of lead in male scalp hair of Cairo (residential-traffic and residential-industrial) and rural residents after twenty years of phasing out of leaded gasoline. Results indicated that the mean concentration of lead in hair of residential-traffic (9. 7552 µg/g ± 0. 71) and residential-industrial (12. 3288 µg/g ± 1. 13) was significantly higher than that in rural residents (4. 7327 µg/g ± 0. 67). The mean concentration of lead in hair of resident’s industrial areas was the highest among Cairo residents and not the traffic areas as it was before phasing out of leaded gasoline. Twenty years of phasing out of leaded gasoline in Cairo has greatly improved the lead pollution among residents of traffic areas, but industrial areas residents were still suffering from lead pollution, which needs more efforts to control the sources of lead pollution.

40|$|Abstract Organic {{derivatives}} of tin, lead, mercury are {{the most}} widely distributed organometallic ecotoxicants in the environment. While some of these organometallic compounds exist in the environment {{as a result of}} direct discharge, anthropogenic emissions alone cannot explain the ubiquity, for example, of the organomercury and organolead compounds in marine and fresh waters, sediments and biota. It is known that some organometallic compounds are formed via a bioconversion from the inorganic contaminants. Depending on the source, they can enter the environment in varied forms inorganic species of different stability. These can be bio-converted further by environmental biota; for instance metals such as tin and lead can be discharged into the environment in the form of organometallic species which can undergo further transformation. Determination of organometallics in environmental and biological samples is difficult due to matrix effect and their low concentrations. Separation and preconcentration is necessary to enhance final determination. Speciation studies are even more complicated. Speciation is an important aspect and gives information about bioavailability of the metal thus their toxicity. This work focused on the development of a method for speciation of organospecies of tin, lead and mercury. A new derivatisation agent has been synthesised and used successfully. SLM probe extraction has been exposed to a new matrix. Different environmental samples have been analysed for organo-species of tin and lead and their pathways predicted. The SLM probe extraction gives the advantage of carrying out several extractions, reduction of the amount of solvent used and avoidance of emulsion problems. A simple system has been developed and applied successfully on organotin and organolead extraction from aqueous environmental sample. For reproducibility of the results, pH, salinity, stirring rate and extraction time were optimized. An analytical method for simultaneous in situ ethylation, using new derivatisation agent bromomagnesium tetraethylborate (Et 4 BMgBr), of organotin and organomercury compounds in sediment samples was developed. The determination of mercury and tin compounds is achieved by species-specific isotope dilution, derivatisation and gas chromatography – inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GC-ICP-MS). In derivatisation, pH and the amount of derivatisation agent were studied. Percentage recovery and accuracy of the method was confirmed by comparison of experimental results with sediment and plant certified reference material (IAEA 405 for sediment and CRM 279 for plant). Although organolead compounds as a gasoline additive are banned in most countries, in some regions, lead is still added to gasoline in varying proportions of different tetraalkyllead compounds and contamination by organolead compounds is still present at different places, e. g. : <b>lead</b> <b>alkyl</b> manufactures The use of both tetraalkyllead and butyltin is banned (tetraalkyllead as gasoline additive and butyltin in antifouling pints and PVC materials). This work focussed on their conversion in water and soil. This should provide an insight into their presence in the environment and an understanding of their degradation in the environment. A method for full speciation and determination of <b>alkyl</b> <b>lead</b> and inorganic lead (II) after the tetramethyllead degradation in aqueous samples has been developed. This was accomplished by in situ derivatisation with sodium tetraphenyllead borate NaB(Ph) 4 derivative. The derivatisation was carried out directly in the aqueous sample and the derivatives were extracted using the supported liquid membrane probe extraction (SLMPE). The extracted analytes were then transferred to a GC/MS for separation and detection. This study focused on the transformation of tetramethyllead in aqueous media, at different concentration of major elements, K+,Na+,Ca++, Mg++,Cl-,SO 4 [...] . Adsorption / desorption on soil of ionic organolead and organotin were also studied. As South Africa is one of the world’s major producers of coal, mercury should be monitored as it is a side product in coal combustion.

The cascade reaction that <b>leads</b> to the <b>alkyl</b> cinnamates occurs through two oxidation steps: the selective oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde, followed by oxidation of the hemiacetal that results from the base-catalysed reaction of cinnamaldehyde with an aliphatic alcohol. The rate constants for the two steps were evaluated in the temperature range 10 – 45 [*]°C. The cinnamyl alcohol oxidation is faster than the oxidative esterification of cinnamaldehyde with methanol, ethanol, 2 -propanol, 1 -butanol, 1 -hexanol or 1 -octanol.

On the continental shelf, levels of dissolved lead varied within 0. 06 and 0. 27 nM in winter (0. 15 ± 0. 06 nM, sd = 1. 96, n = 49), whereas concentrations measured in spring were in the range 0. 06 – 0. 17 nM (0. 09 ± 0. 03 nM, sd = 1. 96, n = 60).

Because benzene is widely used in indus-try, exposure of workers to benzene is a health concern that deserves attention. 1, 2 During the late 19 th century, it was found that continuous exposure to benzene can lead to aplastic anemia and leukemia. There were also cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia reported during this period. 3 This association brought attention to the toxicity of benzene to the bone marrow. Additional studies in Italy and Turkey showed that the stan-dardized mortality ratio of leukemia among work-ers exposed to benzene is higher than that of non-exposed civilians. 4 The threshold limit values for benzene have become more stringent. Threshold limit values refer to airborne concentrations of sub-stances and represent conditions under which it is believed that nearly all workers may be exposed on a daily basis without adverse health effects.

Chapter 1 introduces uranium and nuclear waste, and gives an introduction into uranium(V) chemistry. It further compares the chemistry of uranyl(V) to neptunyl(V), with a specific focus on solid state interactions. The chemistry of the Pacman calixpyrroles is briefly introduced. These macrocyclic ligands form the basis for the synthesis of uranyl Pacman, which represents the major uranyl complex investigated in this thesis. Chapter 2 {{describes the}} reductive and catalytic uranyl oxo-group metalation using Group XIII and Group I reagents. It presents the reductive uranyl alumination using di-(iso-butyl) -aluminium hydride and Tebbe’s reagent to form the first Al(III) - uranyl(V) oxo complexes (AlIII-O-UV=O). The chapter shows how the transmetalation of these aluminated uranyl(V) complexes with alkali metal hydrides and <b>alkyls</b> <b>leads</b> to the formation of mono-metalated alkali metal uranyl(V) complexes (MI-O-UV=O). The combination of these two reactions is developed into a catalytic synthesis of the latter. The use of elemental alkali metals is described as another pathway of accessing alkali metal uranyl(V) complexes, carried out in collaboration with Dr. Rianne M. Lord. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis of the first Group IV uranyl(V) complexes, using low-valent titanium and zirconium starting materials. The chapter includes magnetic measurements on the first Ti(III) -uranyl(V) complex and a comparison of computational results regarding a selection of uranyl(V) complexes from this thesis. The magnetic measurements were carried out by Dr. Alessandro Prescimone, University of Edinburgh, and analysed by Dr. Nicola Magnani, Institute for Transuranium Elements, Karlsruhe, Germany. Theoretical calculations were carried out by Xiaobin Zhang and Prof. Dr. Georg Schreckenbach, University of Manitoba, Canada. The chapter further describes the reductive metalation of uranyl using elemental Mg, Ca and Zn and their respective metal halides. Chapter 4 describes the uranyl functionalisation using f-elements and their complexes. It describes the attempted mono-metalation using lanthanides and the formation of a Sm(III) -bis(uranyl(V)) complex. It further describes the uranyl reduction using actinides and the synthesis of the first U(IV) -uranyl(V) complex. The chapter further describes the first Np(IV) -uranyl(V) complex and the attempted synthesis of a Pu(IV) -uranyl(V) complex. These syntheses were performed in collaboration with Michał S. Dutkiewicz at the Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) in Karlsruhe, Germany. This work was carried out with the help of Dr. Christos Apostolidis and Dr. Olaf Walter and supervised by Prof. Dr Roberto Caciuffo. Chapter 5 describes the reductive uranyl functionalisation in a redox-active dipyrromethene ligand, collaboratively carried out with James R. Pankhurst and Lucy N. Platts. The synthetic work and analyses were performed jointly with Lucy N. Platts (master student under the supervision of the author); UV-vis spectra and cyclic voltammograms were recorded by James R. Pankhurst and Lucy N. Platts. The chapter presents the synthesis of a new uranyl(VI) complex and its two-electron reduction to uranium(IV) using a titanium(III) reductant. Additionally the chapter describes the reductive uranyl silylation in a dipyrromethane complex of which the ligand was designed by Dr. Daniel Betz. Section 6 describes the synthetic procedures. Section 7 gives references to the work of others. Section 8 shows the publication related to this thesis. Section 9 is a table of the complexes described in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS; [URL] is the {{umbrella}} project that encompasses the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology’s National Capability contaminant {{monitoring and surveillance}} work on avian predators. By monitoring sentinel vertebrate species, the PBMS aims to detect and quantify current and emerging chemical threats {{to the environment and}} in particular to vertebrate wildlife. Lead (Pb) is a highly toxic metal that acts as a non-specific poison affecting all body systems and has no known biological requirement. Sources of Pb in the environment include lead mining, the refining and smelting of lead and other metals, the manufacture and use of <b>alkyl</b> <b>lead</b> fuel additives, and the use of lead ammunition. The present study is {{the first two years of}} a PBMS monitoring programme to quantify the scale of exposure to [and associated risk from] Pb in predatory birds. The aim is to quantify the extent of exposure to lead [as assessed from liver residues] in two predatory bird species, the red kite (Mivus milvus) and the sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus). The red kite is a scavenger and, as such, is particularly at risk from consumption of Pb ammunition in unretrieved game. Sparrowhawks prey predominantly upon live passerine birds that are unlikely to be shot in the UK; likely sources of exposure are diffuse Pb contamination although some individuals may also be exposed to Pb particles ingested by their prey. We also examined the liver Pb isotope ratios in to explore whether they can be used to ascribe likely sources of any Pb detected in the birds. Red kites had significantly higher Pb concentration than those measured in sparrowhawks but the majority of sparrowhawks and all the red kites had liver Pb concentrations below those thought to cause clinical and sub-clinical adverse effects in Falconiforme species. There was overlap in the liver Pb isotope ratios of red kites and sparrowhawks yet there was evidence of separation between the two species. There was also evidence of overlap with the isotope signature for coal and for Pb shot but the isotope signatures in the bird livers were distinct from that of petrol Pb. The Pb isotope pattern observed in the red kites and sparrowhawks in the current study may reflect the fact that liver Pb concentrations were low in the small sample of birds that were analysed and may have been a result of exposure to low-level, diffuse contamination. birds.
