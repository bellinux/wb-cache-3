The actual position is compared to the desired position by a digital subtracter that drives a DAC (Digital-to-analog converter) that drives the position control amplifier (KP).

This line will be modified on each loop to load the next lines into the accumulator OUT // Output the accumulator's value. The accumulator's value will be the line that was just loaded SUB ONE // Subtract 1 from the value in the accumulator. This is so {{we can do the}} BRZ in the next step to see if we are on the last line in the program BRZ ONE // If the previous subtraction has made the accumulator 0 (which means we had the value 001 in the accumulator), then branch to position ONE LDA LOAD // Load the <b>LOAD</b> <b>position</b> into the accumulator, this is in preparation to increment the address digits for this position ADD ONE // Increment the position digits for the LOAD line. The value currently in the accumulator would, if read as an instruction, load the next line into the accumulator, compared to the last line loaded STA LOAD // Store the newly incremented LOAD line back in the <b>LOAD</b> <b>position</b> BRA LOAD // Return {{back to the beginning of}} the loop ONE DAT 1 // The variable 1. If read as an instruction, this will be interpreted as HLT/COB and will end the programThis quine works using self-modifying code. Position 0 is incremented by on each loop, outputting that line's code, until the code it is outputting is 1, at which point it branches to the ONE position. The ONE position begins with a 0, so it is interpreted as a HALT/COB instruction.|$|E

40|$|The {{operation}} of a helicopter with an externally slung load is highly demanding for the flight crew. Without having a direct view on the load, the pilot needs assistance by a crew member for load handling, e. g. <b>load</b> <b>positioning.</b> During Helicopter Hoist Operations (HHO), the hoist operator gives instructions to the pilot and stabilizes the load motion. An automatic <b>load</b> <b>positioning</b> system for HHO is designed with the aim to reduce the workload of the flight crew and to improve the load handling performance. The control system consists of a multi-loop architecture that is designed using multi-objective optimization. The system was designed to achieve best performance in <b>load</b> <b>positioning</b> for the entire cable length range of the rescue hoist. <b>Load</b> <b>positioning</b> performance {{is a function of}} the cable length; faster automatic <b>load</b> <b>positioning</b> can be achieved with shorter cable lengths.

The rotor of the synchro {{control transformer}} is turned by the response shaft, which is geared to the load and so indicates what {{the position of the}} load actually is. The synchro compares the actual <b>load</b> <b>position</b> with the ordered position; and, if the two do not agree, it generates an alternating-current signal which is transmitted to the amplifier. The angular difference between the two positions is called the error, and the signal to the amplifier is the error signal.

50|$|The {{forward path}} begins with θC, the desired {{position}} command. This is multiplied by KP {{which could be}} a constant or a function of frequency. KP incorporates the conversion gain of the DAC and any filtering on the DAC output. The output of KP is the velocity command VωC which is multiplied by KV {{which can be a}} constant or a function of frequency. The output of KV is the current command, VIC which is multiplied by KC which can be a constant or a function of frequency. The output of KC is the amplifier output voltage, VA. The current, IM, though the motor winding is the integral of the voltage applied to the inductance. The motor produces a torque, T, proportional to IM. Permanent magnet motors tend to have a linear current to torque function. The conversion constant of current to torque is KM. The torque, T, divided by the load moment of inertia, M, is the acceleration, α, which is integrated to give the load velocity ω which is integrated to produce the <b>load</b> <b>position,</b> θLC.|$|E

40|$|There is an {{increased}} interest {{in the use of}} Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for load transportation from environmental remote sensing to construction and parcel delivery. One of the main challenges is accurate control of the <b>load</b> <b>position</b> and trajectory. This paper presents an assessment of real flight trials for the control of an autonomous multi-rotor with a suspended slung load using only visual feedback to determine the <b>load</b> <b>position.</b> This method uses an onboard camera {{to take advantage of a}} common visual marker detection algorithm to robustly detect the load location. The <b>load</b> <b>position</b> is calculated using an onboard processor, and transmitted over a wireless network to a ground station integrating MATLAB/SIMULINK and Robotic Operating System (ROS) and a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to control both the load and the UAV. To evaluate the system performance, the position of the load determined by the visual detection system in real flight is compared with data received by a motion tracking system. The multi-rotor position tracking performance is also analyzed by conducting flight trials using perfect <b>load</b> <b>position</b> data and data obtained only from the visual system.

40|$|Selected {{physical}} and mechanical properties of horse eye bean (mucuna sloanei) were studied at different moisture content levels of 11. 5 %, 13 % and 17 % (db). Compression strength characteristics were conducted under quasi-static compressive force at longitudinal and latitudinal (lateral) <b>loading</b> <b>positions</b> and the rupture forces, compressive strength, modulus of deformability, toughness, stiffness and force at bio-yield point determined as the mechanical properties. Results indicated that volume (20. 137 - 21. 856 mm 3), surface area (598. 362 - 720. 208 mm 2), geometric mean diameter (24. 98 - 27. 12 mm), and weight (7. 625 - 9. 203 g) of the velvet bean seed increased linearly with increase in moisture content. Also, the bulk density, specific gravity (0. 378 - 0. 421 g/mm 3), sphericity (0. 882 - 0. 831) and aspect ratio (0. 974 - 0. 726) decreased linearly with increase in moisture content. These indicate that Velvet beans have wide size ranges and no single {{sample of the}} grains can effectively represent the other. In {{the case of the}} force-deformation characteristics, result indicates that the force and corresponding deformation to rupture of velvet bean seeds were found to vary from 400 N - 2500 N and 3 mm - 10. 25 mm in longitudinal <b>loading</b> <b>positions</b> and 800 N - 2800 N, 3. 5 mm - 11. 5 mm in lateral <b>loading</b> <b>positions</b> at the various moisture contents.

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} generic proposal on the infl uence of various microwave load parameters based on results accumulated during an investigation using a specifi c microwave multimode heating cavity confi guration. The results have been obtained by numerical analysis using the Finite Element Method within a 3 D environment. The load parameters considered were dielectric constant, loss factor, load thickness and <b>load</b> <b>position.</b> Load material properties are typical of those used in industrial relevant applications. Of the four load parameters investigated, the confi guration with a high loss factor was seen to dominate the load impact regardless of load thickness, <b>load</b> <b>position</b> or dielectric constant. With decreasing loss factor or increasing load thickness, the infl uence of the dielectric constant increases. Minor adjustments in the <b>load</b> <b>position</b> (10 %) is generally seen to have minimal impact for all load properties considered. The paper also investigates the numerical impact of varying load properties. As the dielectric constant increases, which requires a higher number of mesh elements, so does the average iterations per numerical cycle. The number of numerical cycles and time to reach a convergence is also seen to be inversely proportional to the load loss factor...|$|E
