C2C12 cells can be cultured {{in a variety}} of conditions to induce specific responses of interest. For example, assisted by the cell line's high differentiation rate and fusion rate, fibronectin templates can be micro-plated to petri dishes or cell culture flasks in order to induce specific growth patterns, such as that of mimicking skeletal muscle cell interactions with extracellular matrix components. The introduction of adhesion molecules can alter the growth pattern of C2C12 cells to a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> exhibiting polarity. There are many ways to regulate the shape of C2C12 myoblasts genetically and environmentally, from stress, to cytoskeleton alteration, to growth factors. The scaffolding of C2C12 cells is particularly important for studying muscle tissue regeneration post-injury or after tissue wasting due to disease or ICU rehabilitation.|$|E

40|$|The Mandovi and Zuari are two {{tropical}} estuaries {{along the}} west coast of India, characterized by mixed tides with semi-diurnal dominance and heavy fresh water influx during the southwest monsoon (June to September). Previous observations of tides in these estuaries show that the tidal effects in the upstream regions are subject to decay due to freshwater influx during the southwest monsoon. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> of salinity in these estuaries undergoes large variations between the southwest monsoon and the dry season (February to May). The main objectives of the present study were to simulate the tidal circulation, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> of salinity and the freshwater influence on tides and the salinity distribution. Another objective was to study the intra-seasonal variations of salinity during the breaks in the southwest monsoon. A hybrid network numerical model was used for the present study to simulate the tidal circulation and the salinity distribution in these estuaries. The model reproduced observed tides accurately during the dry and wet seasons. The model could reproduce the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> of salinity well during the dry season and the simulation of salinity distribution was reasonably well during the wet season. The simulated tidally-averaged salinities over the M 2 tidal period for varying river discharges show that even a small freshwater influx can affect the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> of salinity to a great extent in this type of estuaries...|$|E

40|$|It’s {{well known}} that {{thin-walled}} elastic theory represents an important simplified model to analyze various actual structures. Particularly, this model can be applied with good results {{to the analysis of}} ships with large deck openings, subjected to non-uniform torsion, whose distinctive feature is that they may undergo considerable warping deformations. In this paper the problem of the elastic equilibrium of a thin-walled beam is discussed from the beginning, assuming the fundamental hypothesis of Kollbrunner and Hajdin, 1972, {{based on the assumption that}} the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> of the warping deformations is an arbitrary function independent of the unit twist angle. Furthermore the effective <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> of the applied torque is taken into due consideration to determine the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> of the warping function and the unit twist angle, in the hypothesis of restrained torsion. It is {{well known that}} a still unsolved problem is the role of transverse bulkheads, generally assumed as perfectly rigid in the evaluation of the bimoment <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution.</b> So a method, based on a global energy approach, is presented to take into account the deformability of transverse bulkheads, schematized as orthotropic plates. Finally, a numerical application to a ship with large deck openings is carried out, in order to evaluate the viability of the proposed method. A numerical comparison with the classical Vlasov theory is carried out, in order to highlight the role of the transverse bulkheads in the evaluation of warping stresses...|$|E
30|$|The high-energy plasmas drift {{around the}} Earth with {{timescales}} of hours {{to tens of}} minutes due to gradient and curvature of the magnetic field. On the other hand, the electron–cyclotron (ELF/VLF) waves and EMIC waves are localized mainly in the dusk and dawn sectors, respectively (e.g., Li et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2015). Thus, observations of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> of these waves and drifting plasmas are essentially important to understand particle energization and loss in the inner magnetosphere quantitatively. One can obtain <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> of waves and particles through statistical analyses of long-term single satellite data by using its orbital motion. However, instantaneous measurement of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> of waves and particles is essential to provide quantitative understanding, because, for example, statistical analysis of long-term single satellite data can lead to misinterpreting a moving localized wave source as a wide spatial extent of the source region.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This study {{evaluated}} the biomass distribution of microcrustaceans in three subtropical reservoirs in Brazil {{and the relationship}} among these distributions and some limnological variables in the reservoirs. The hypothesis was that the microcrustacean biomass is distributed according to Marzolf´s third model, proposed in 1990 for zooplankton density in tropical reservoirs. The planktonic microcrustacean biomass ranged from 261. 5 mg DW m- 3 (Iraí reservoir, transition zone, dry season) to 0. 03 mg DW m- 3 (Segredo reservoir, fluvial zone, wet season). The highest biomass values were registered in the transition zone, but this longitudinal variation was not significant. The total biomass {{was related to the}} trophic state of each reservoir, and a higher difference was observed among the reservoirs than within them. The longitudinal biomass distribution was also related with the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> of chlorophyll-a and showed the same pattern described in Marzolf´s third model. In this way, the results suggested that this model developed for density zooplankton could be employed for the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distribution</b> of zooplankton biomass in the studied reservoirs.

They can be modelled to obtain information on stellar magnetic activity by fitting the rotational modulation of the stellar flux produced by the brightness inhomogeneities associated with photospheric active regions. The variation of the total solar irradiance provides a good proxy for those photometric time series and can be used to test the performance of different spot modelling approaches. We test discrete spot models as well as maximum entropy and Tikhonov regularized spot models by comparing the reconstructed total sunspot area variation and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>distributions</b> of sunspot groups with those actually observed in the Sun along activity cycle 23. Appropriate statistical methods are introduced to measure model performance versus the timescale of variation.
