25|$|After former Texas {{defensive}} coordinator Gene Chizik {{was hired as}} head coach at Iowa State University in December 2006, Applewhite was rumored to be joining his coaching staff. Applewhite, however, officially announced on December 4, 2006, {{that he would not}} leave Rice for Iowa State. He did however leave Rice only a month later, not for Iowa State but for Alabama, as he accepted an offer by newly hired Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban to serve as the offensive coordinator. Given his ties to the <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>State,</b> Applewhite targeted a couple of Texas high school prospects, including Lennon Creer. Alabama eventually received commitments by quarterback Nick Fanuzzi and defensive back Tarence Farmer.|$|E

25|$|The {{scenario}} changed radically for the Rangers {{with the}} state election of 1873. When newly elected Governor Richard Coke took office in January 1874, it {{marked the end of}} Reconstruction for the <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>State,</b> and he vigorously restored order to Texas in pursuit of improvements to both the economy and security. Once again Indians and Mexican bandits were threatening the frontiers, and once again the Rangers were tasked with solving the problem. That same year, the state legislature authorized the recommissioning of the Rangers, and a special force was created within its aegis: the Frontier Battalion, consisting of six companies of 75 men each under the command of Major John B. Jones. This group {{played a major role in}} the control of ordinary lawbreakers as well as the defense against hostile Indian tribes, which was particularly necessary in the period of lawlessness and social collapse of the Reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|He first gained {{prominence}} in November 1953 when he tracked down the former Thomas C. Buntin and his wife. The bizarre case involved {{the son of}} a wealthy Nashville business owner who had disappeared in September 1931, followed six weeks later by the disappearance of his secretary. Seigenthaler was sent to Texas by The Tennessean after reports surfaced that Buntin (now known as Thomas D. Palmer) was living somewhere in the <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>state.</b> After a series of dead-ends, Seigenthaler struck pay dirt in Orange, Texas, where he saw an elderly man step off a bus. Noting the man's distinctive left ear, Seigenthaler followed him home. After three further days of investigation, {{he went back to the}} home, where he confirmed the identities of Buntin/Palmer, his wife, the former Betty McCuddy, and their six children. Seigenthaler won a National Headliner Award for the story.|$|E
25|$|The {{prominent}} cartouch on the 1955 addition {{became a}} symbol of the Titche-Goettinger company and can be found {{in other areas of the}} building. It is made of solid Indiana limestone and stands 28 feet high by 26 feet across, covering part of the building's fifth, sixth and seventh floors. The design was created by the architectural firm of Thomas Jameson and Merrill. The center portion is topped by a star signifying the <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>State</b> and Titche's place in it. On each side of the star are live oak leaves mixed in with cactus blossoms. Below the star on the left is a scale indicating full measure and value. On the right, a ship indicating the world of commerce. Nine cotton bolls are indicative of Texas farm life and the textile industry, and on the right are the initials of the store. The six national flags of Texas are shown, representing the United States, Confederacy, France, (on the left) Texas, Mexico and Spain (on the right).|$|E

50|$|Negotiations for a Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaty were {{initiated}} by the Texan Envoy and Minister to the Netherlands, and commenced in 1841. The treaty foresaw a most favored nation-clause not only between the three city-states and Texas, but also extendable to any state of the German Confederation. Talks were initially held in Hamburg, but later moved to Paris. It took until April 1844 for the treaty to be signed, by which time Lübeck, Hamburg and Texas saw the <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>State's</b> coming accession to the U.S., and didn't bother ratifying the treaty. Bremen was the only party where the treaty got ratified, coming into effect in December 1844.|$|R
50|$|Comal is a {{strongly}} Republican county: the last Democrat {{to carry it}} being Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, and no others have done so since Franklin Roosevelt’s 1936 landslide when he won every Texas county bar traditionally Unionist Gillespie and Kendall and took 87.31 percent of the <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>State’s</b> vote. In earlier periods, the county’s German heritage meant it often deviated from “Solid South” Democratic voting: in 1924 Robert La Follette won 73.96 percent of Comal County’s vote (versus 6.52 percent for all of Texas), which made it his strongest county nationwide, and in 1920 American candidate James “Pa” Ferguson carried the county with 841 votes to 765 for Warren G. Harding.|$|R
25|$|Houston {{has been}} {{home to some of}} the more {{experimental}} and extreme music of Texas. From Mayo Thompson's psychedelic free music group the Red Crayola and the experimental work of composer Pauline Oliveros to the hardcore rap of the Geto Boys and the primordial sludge rock of Rusted Shut, the 713 has long waved the freak flag over the <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>state.</b> The Pain Teens, Charalambides, and Richard Ramirez are among the better known Houston noise artists. Notable rising bands include Spain Colored Orange, Southern Backtones, Jennifer Grassman, and The Ton Tons. Among the city's most influential punk bands were the hardcore Really Red and DRI. The local scene has also included Culturcide, Verbal Abuse, Stark Raving Mad, Sik Mentality, Dresden 45, Legionnaire's Disease, The Hates, AK-47, The Killerwatz, Free Money, The Recipients, and The Degenerates. Houston is known for its chopped and screwed rap music, popularized by DJ Screw and the Screwed Up Click. Houston also is the home of lo-fi music straddling blues, folk, and antiphonal traditions, as epitomized by elusive cult hero Jandek and the slightly more visible Jana Hunter. Houston is the birthplace and final resting place of Chris Whitley (1960–2005) who won a Grammy for his Living with the Law, revolutionized the steel dobro guitar, and enjoyed a massive cult following, but died prematurely of lung cancer in 2005. Houston is home to Beyoncé, Hilary Duff, Kelly Rowland, and the other original members of Destiny's Child. Houston is the birthplace of Grammy Award Winning Gospel Artist Yolanda Adams; who in 2009 was named the #1 Gospel Artist of the last decade by Billboard Magazine. Jazz artists born in Houston include saxophonists Billy Harper and Walter Smith III, pianists Robert Glasper and Jason Moran, and drummer Eric Harland. Prairie View Co-eds formed at Prairie View A University in the 1940s. Houston has had sizable folk-country and blues scenes dating back to the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, which included many now famous performers such as Nancy Griffith, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Lyle Lovett, Robert Earl Keen and Lightnin' Hopkins, Albert Collins, Big Mama Thornton, and Johnny Copeland who were signed with the hometown Peacock Records.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, she {{appeared}} in the teen comedy Slackers as Angela Patton, Four Faces of God as Sam, and the crime comedy <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>State</b> of Mind as Baby. Slackers received negative responses from critics, including one who found that the characters [...] "are not so strikingly original as to elevate the slack material", while Four Faces of God and <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>State</b> of Mind did not have wide theatrical releases. 2003 saw King in the film Bulletproof Monk, alongside Chow Yun-fat and Seann William Scott, an adaptation of a comic book by Michael Avon Oeming. After five auditions, a screen test, and a physical test, she landed the role of Jade, a character skilled in martial arts. This was King's first leading action film role. Bulletproof Monk received mostly negative reviews from critics, who cited that the fight scenes were not as well choreographed or directed as those other genre films, and that the alternating comedic and action scenes were jarring. Regardless, Bulletproof Monk was nominated for Choice Movie in a Drama/Action Adventure award at the Teen Choice Awards. In late 2003, King appeared in the music video for the Robbie Williams song, [...] "Sexed Up", and on the cover artwork for the single's release. In 2004, {{she appeared}} in the comedy White Chicks, playing Heather Vandergeld, with actress Brittany Daniel as her sister Megan Vandergeld, a parody on socialites Paris and Nicky Hilton. White Chicks was negatively reviewed by critics, receiving five nominations at the Razzie Awards in the categories for Worst Actress, Worst Director, Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple and Worst Screenplay. However, White Chicks won Outstanding Directing for a Box Office Movie and Outstanding Writing for a Box Office Movie at the BET Comedy Awards.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that then-Vice President Richard Nixon carried more states and won the popular vote, Kennedy emerged victorious in the 1960 United States Presidential Election by winning the electoral vote {{by a margin of}} 303-219. President-Elect Kennedy’s close margin of victory {{signified}} a major success for the Viva Kennedy Clubs because it proved the importance of earning the Mexican American vote. In Texas, Kennedy earned 91% of the Mexican American vote or 200,000 votes, which helped him win the <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>State’s</b> 24 electoral votes despite losing the white vote. Sixteen of the seventeen Texas counties where there was a Mexican American majority voted overwhelmingly for Kennedy. Throughout the nation, 85% of Mexican Americans voted for Kennedy.|$|R

500|$|The {{most serious}} threat from {{tropical}} cyclones in Texas residents is from flooding, from both Gulf of Mexico hurricanes and tropical storms and {{the remnants of}} Eastern Pacific storms. The worst aspect about tropical cyclones is that the weaker they are, the more efficient they can be at producing heavy rains and catastrophic flooding. Systems with sprawling circulations, such as Hurricane Beulah, also tend to make good rainmakers. Slow moving systems, such as Tropical Storm Amelia or Hurricane Harvey also can produce significant rainfall over the <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>State.</b> Harvey's storm total rainfall is the most recorded within the United States. Harvey's extremely heavy rainfall produced catastrophic flooding across much of southeastern Texas; particularly {{in and around the}} Houston metropolitan area, where accumulations exceeded [...] over a four-day period.

5000|$|Strait Country {{received}} positive reviews {{upon its}} release in 1981. On the AllMusic website, it received {{four out of}} five stars. In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted how [...] "startling" [...] this debut album was during a time when country music was dominated by country-pop crossover songs, outlaw country anthems, the urban cowboy trend, and the Alabama-style country-rock movement. In contrast, Strait ignored the trends and focused on traditional country music, [...] "drawing deep on honky tonk tradition, undeniably rooted in Texas but willing to wander outside of the <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>State's</b> borders". Strait displays his clear love for the music of Merle Haggard on [...] "Blame It on Mexico", produced with a [...] "light production sheen" [...] that makes it accessible and timely, and yet the singer's [...] "delivery and attitude" [...] make it [...] "sound as pure country as the harder stuff". Erlewine observed: And that's the genius of Strait Country—it showed how it was possible to be planted firmly in traditional country yet flexible enough to play softer stuff without losing that hardcore stance ... by blending the hardcore honky tonk, Western swing and Bakersfield country with a few melodic ballads that weren't designed for the barroom, he set the template for years and years of modern country. Erlewine concluded that in addition to being influential, Strait Country is [...] "flat-out great, the beginning of a remarkable streak of continually satisfying albums from George Strait".|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} five decades the Texas Observer has been an {{essential}} voice in Texas culture and politics, championing honest government, civil rights, labor, and the environment, providing a platform {{for many of the}} state’s most passionate and progressive voices. Included here are ninety-one selections, including Roy Bedichek, Lou Dubose, Ronnie Dugger, Dagoberto Gilb, Jim Hightower, Molly Ivins, Larry McMurtry, Maury Maverick Jr., Willie Morris, and Debbie Nathan. To mark the Texas Observer’s fiftieth anniversary in 2004, Char Miller has selected a cross section of the best work to appear in its pages. Not only does the collection pay homage to an important alternative voice in Texas journalism, it also serves as a progressive chronicle of a half-century of life in the <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> State—a <b>state</b> that has spawned three presidents in the last forty years. If Texas is, as some say, a crucible for national politics, then Fifty Years of the Texas Observer can be read as casebook for issues that concern citizens in all fifty states. With a foreword by Molly Ivins, these pieces form a progressive chronicle of a half-century of life in Texas. [URL]...|$|R
