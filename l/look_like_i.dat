He reflected, [...] "I {{was terrified of}} the role of Al, because it was like nothing I'd ever done before, and I didn't know how to get to the places the role was asking me to go emotionally." [...] For scenes in which Al's face is {{disfigured}} and swathed in bandages, Cage lost 15 pounds and had two of his front teeth pulled out. [...] "I wanted to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was hit by a bomb," [...] he said. [...] "It gave me a feeling of something I had lost. I felt this was a once-in-a-lifetime part, and it deserved that much." ...|$|E
500|$|Common became {{interested}} in the role due to both the script and the prospect of working with McAvoy, Jolie, and Morgan Freeman. Common learned a great deal about firearms as preparation for the role, but said he is not a strong supporter of guns in real life. Konstantin Khabensky, who starred in Bekmambetov's Night Watch, was cast so that the director would have a familiar face around. British television veteran Marc Warren agreed to work in the film because he always wanted to be in a Hollywood blockbuster. Thomas Kretschmann originally intended to pick up the comic series after being cast, but Bekmambetov convinced him not to. He said that he [...] "did excessive gun training" [...] to [...] "make sure I look good and I <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> know what I'm doing". Kristen Hager originally auditioned for Fox, but accepted the role of Cathy, considering it [...] "fun to play".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E

500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E

[...] After the 1922 season, Meine spent {{three years in the}} minor leagues, pitching for the Syracuse Stars and Kansas City Blues. [...] In 1926, he compiled a 17–14 record with a 3.27 ERA. Despite the 17-win season, Meine quit baseball after the 1926 season. [...] He recalled, [...] "It didn't <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was going up, and I just retired.

But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face.

He said, [...] "My rationale for filing was to prove what a fraud this thing is. Now it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> am a greedy bastard. Every one of those suckers are getting it.

Intrigued and {{at a point where}} he was [...] "lost", Jordison attended rehearsals at Anders Colsefini's basement and immediately {{wanted to be part of}} this new band. Speaking of this moment he said, [...] "I remember trying so hard not to smile, so I didn't <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> wanted to join, I remained poker-faced, but I thought they ruled." [...] A lot of Slipknot's early development was discussed by band members while Jordison worked night shifts at Sinclair's garage. Of the eventual nine members, Joey was the third to join the band. Slipknot would become pioneers to the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Jordison is accompanied by two custom percussionists, giving their music a feel that Rolling Stone touted as [...] "suffocating".|$|E

I'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me--unless {{it might be a}} foreign missionary. I suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular. But I do hope that some day I shall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I just love pretty clothes. And I've never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember--but of course it's all the more to look forward to, isn't it? And then I can imagine that I'm dressed gorgeously. This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear this horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you know. A {{merchant}} in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum. Some people said it was because he couldn't sell it, but I'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldn't you? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that I had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you ARE imagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and boots. I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island with all my might. I wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither was Mrs. Spencer although she generally is. She said she hadn't time to get sick, watching to see that I didn't fall overboard. She said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy I did prowl, isn't it? And I wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat, because I didn't know whether I'd ever have another opportunity. Oh, {{there are a lot more}} cherry-trees all in bloom! This Island is the bloomiest place. I just love it already, and I'm so glad I'm going to live here. I've always heard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world, and I used to imagine I was living here, but I never really expected I would. It's delightful when your imaginations come true, isn't it? But those red roads are so funny. When we got into the train at Charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked her a thousand already. I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions? And what DOES make the roads red?" ...|$|E
