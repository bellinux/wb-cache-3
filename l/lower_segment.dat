5|$|The most {{important}} tributaries of the Sava River found in its upper basin {{are characterized by}} relatively steep grades of flow, high flow velocities and rapids. Those are left tributaries: the Kokra, the Kamnik Bistrica and the Savinja; and right tributaries: the Sora, the Ljubljanica and the Krka (Sava). Further downstream larger rivers empty into the Sava, as the right bank of the basin grows steadily. Right tributaries in this <b>lower</b> <b>segment</b> of the basin start as fast flowing courses, only to slow down {{as they enter the}} Pannonian Basin. They include the Kupa, the Una, the Vrbas, the Ukrina, the Bosna, the Brka, the Tinja, the Drina and the Kolubara. Left tributaries in the <b>lower</b> <b>segment</b> drain plains consequently exhibiting less steep course grades, lower flow rates and meandering. They include the Sutla, the Krapina, the Lonja, the Ilova, the Orljava and the Bosut.|$|E
5|$|David Hillis, one of DeLee's {{colleagues at}} the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, {{published}} a 1917 journal article about his invention of the fetoscope, {{also known as the}} head stethoscope. By 1922, DeLee published a report of a similar device. Though DeLee published his findings several years after Hillis, he claimed that he had been openly discussing his idea for the device over many years. The device became known as the DeLee-Hillis stethoscope. DeLee was also the inventor of a catheter used to suction an infant's airway; the DeLee suction trap is still used after the delivery of a baby. He was one of the earliest physicians to advocate for the <b>lower</b> <b>segment</b> cesarean section.|$|E
25|$|During effacement, the cervix becomes {{incorporated}} into the <b>lower</b> <b>segment</b> of the uterus. During a contraction, uterine muscles contract causing shortening of the upper segment and drawing upwards of the <b>lower</b> <b>segment,</b> in a gradual expulsive motion. The presenting fetal part then is permitted to descend. Full dilation is reached when the cervix has widened enough to allow passage of the baby's head, around 10cm dilation for a term baby.|$|E

25|$|In general, the Mac Mini {{has been}} praised as a {{relatively}} affordable computer with a solid range of features. However, many also {{agree that it is}} relatively costly for a computer aimed at the <b>lower</b> <b>segment</b> of the market. It is possible to buy small computers at the same price with faster processors, better graphics card, more memory, and more storage. The small size has made the Mac Mini particularly popular as a home theater solution. In addition, its size and reliability has helped keep resale values high.|$|E
25|$|In words, {{you want}} to protect 1 units of {{inventory}} for the higher valued segment where 1 {{is equal to the}} inverse probability of demand of the revenue ratio of the lower valued segment to the higher valued segment. This equation defines the EMSRa algorithm which handles the two segment case. EMSRb is smarter and handles multiple segments by comparing the revenue of the <b>lower</b> <b>segment</b> to a demand weighted average of the revenues of the higher segments. Neither of these heuristics produces the exact right answer and increasingly implementations make use of Monte Carlo simulation to find optimal protection levels.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} {{caesarean section}} involves a midline incision on the uterus longitudinal incision which allows a larger space {{to deliver the}} baby. It is performed at very early gestations where the <b>lower</b> <b>segment</b> of the uterus is unformed as it is safer in this situation for the baby: but it is rarely performed other than at these early gestations, as the operation is more prone to complications than a low transverse uterine incision. Any woman {{who has had a}} classical section will be recommended to have an elective repeat section in subsequent pregnancies as the vertical incision is much more likely to rupture in labour than the transverse incision.|$|E
25|$|At {{the heart}} of yield {{management}} decision-making process is the trade-off of marginal yields from segments that are competing for the same inventory. In capacity-constrained cases, there is a bird-in-the-hand decision that forces the seller to reject lower revenue generating customers {{in the hopes that}} the inventory can be sold in a higher valued segment. The tradeoff is sometimes mistakenly identified as occurring at the intersection of the marginal revenue curves for the competing segments. While this is accurate when it supports marketing decisions where access to both segments is equivalent, it is wrong for inventory control decisions. In these cases the intersection of the marginal revenue curve of the higher valued segment with the actual value of the <b>lower</b> <b>segment</b> is the point of interest.|$|E

2500|$|Around 50 to 60 {{million years}} ago, during the Paleocene Epoch, Antrim {{was subject to}} intense {{volcanic}} activity, when highly fluid molten basalt intruded through chalk beds to form an extensive lava plateau. As the lava cooled, contraction occurred.

In many cases the horizontal fracture has resulted in a bottom face that is [...] while the upper face of the <b>lower</b> <b>segment</b> is concave, producing what are called [...] "ball and socket" [...] joints.

40|$|Abstract—Biomechanical {{studies of}} human walking reveal that {{compliance}} {{plays an important}} role at least in natural and smooth motions as well as for self-stabilization. Inspired by this, we present here {{the development of a new}} <b>lower</b> leg <b>segment</b> of the dynamic biped robot “RunBot”. This new <b>lower</b> leg <b>segment</b> features a compliant ankle connected to a flat foot. It is mainly employed to realize robust self-stabilization in a passive manner. In general, such self-stabilization is achieved through mechanical feedback due to elasticity. Using real-time walking experiments, this study shows that the new <b>lower</b> leg <b>segment</b> improves dynamic walking behavior of the robot in two main respects compared to an old <b>lower</b> leg <b>segment</b> consisting of rigid ankle and curved foot: 1) it provides better self-stabilization after stumbling and 2) it increases passive dynamics during some stages of the gait cycle of the robot; i. e., when the whole robot moves unactuated. As a consequence, a combination of compliance (i. e., the new <b>lower</b> leg <b>segment)</b> and active components (i. e., actuated hip and knee joints) driven by a neural mechanism (i. e., reflexive neural control) enables RunBot to perform robust self-stabilization and at the same time natural, smooth, and energy-efficient walking behavior without high control effort.

40|$|Indigenous {{soil and}} water {{conservation}} (SWC) technologies such as miraba (rectangular grass strip bounds that do not necessarily follow contours) and micro ridges have been used widely in the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. However, their strengths and limitations to crop productivity have not been investigated. This study aimed to determine soil fertility and crop yield variability under miraba, micro ridges and bench terraces as a way to explore and compare these SWC technologies. A survey was carried out in Majulai watershed (with Acrisols as dominant soils) which is highly affected by soil degradation due to water erosion. Composite soil samples were collected from 0 - 30 cm depth in upper, middle and <b>lower</b> <b>segments</b> within bench terraces, micro ridges and miraba at the upper, mid and lower slopes of the watershed. Contents of most soil nutrients (e. g. available P, K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +) and maize grain yields varied significantly (P=. 05) between SWC technologies, with the trend: bench terraces > micro ridges >miraba>control (fields with no SWC measures). Similarly under all SWC technologies soil fertility and maize grain yields varied significantly (P=. 05) with slope position, showing the trend: lower slopes > mid slopes > upper slopes. Moreover, soil fertility and maize grain yields varied significantly (P=. 05) between segments of the studied SWC technologies except for bench terraces. The trends for both soil fertility and maize grain yields were as follows: <b>lower</b> <b>segments</b> > middle segments > upper segments under micro ridges; <b>lower</b> <b>segments</b> > upper segments > middle segments under miraba. These observations call for management strategies and technological adjustments that would reduce pattern and magnitude of spatial variations of soil nutrients and crop yields under miraba and micro ridges for improved crop production in the Usambara Mountains. status: publishe...|$|R
