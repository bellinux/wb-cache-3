5000|$|States {{are called}} upon to prevent any {{financial}} service -- including insurance or reinsurance -- and freeze any asset that could contribute to Iran's proliferation.

PFI's national chairman Abdul Rehman was the former national secretary of SIMI, {{while the state}} secretary Abdul Hameed Master was SIMI's former state secretary. Most former leaders of SIMI were either identified with PFI or were at present holding various portfolios in the organisation. The alleged SIMI connection has been dubbed baseless by {{the leaders of the}} Popular Front claiming that the Front was launched in 1993, whereas the SIMI ban came much later in 2001. [...] Retired Indian army officer P C Katoch has claimed that PFI has links with ISI.|$|R
5|$|In August 1957, the US assented to {{a two-year}} testing {{moratorium}} {{proposed by the}} Soviet Union, but required that it be linked to restrictions on the production of fissionable material with military uses, a condition that the Soviet Union rejected. While Eisenhower insisted on <b>linking</b> a test <b>ban</b> to a broader disarmament effort (e.g., the production cut-off), Moscow insisted on independent consideration of a test ban.|$|R
5000|$|The Postmaster-General <b>linked</b> {{the station}} <b>ban</b> to his government's concern about {{communism}} infiltrating the unions. He {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "there were only two classes of Australians today, those who were loyal to the country and those who were not." [...] The Minister said anyone who had information that would assist the government in its fight against communism and enemy agents should, submit it to the nearest police station, or send it to him direct.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, militants <b>linked</b> to the <b>banned</b> Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) entered Sur district, erected {{barricades}} and dug ditches in the streets. The {{local authority}} banned public gatherings and imposed a curfew, and the Turkish Army deployed about 200 {{troops of the}} Special Forces Command to conduct house-to-house searches. The conflict resulted in most residents abandoning their homes. Abandoned houses in various neighborhoods of Sur district were occupied by militants, and clashes between the PKK and Turkish Army and Special Forces continued until early 2016.|$|R
5000|$|The {{foundation}} was {{preceded by}} talks between former KPD functionaries and Gustav Heinemann, the West German minister of justice, who explained to them that while a refounding of a banned party was not legally possible, Communists were free to form an entirely new party. Even though the close <b>links</b> to the <b>banned</b> KPD made the new party liable to be declared illegal, no such declaration was requested by the German government as West German authorities were liberalizing the attitude towards the communist bloc and East Germany in particular.|$|R
5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 {{attacks on}} the United States, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf {{announced}} {{his support for the}} US-led War on Terror. This declaration sparked conflict with the Lal Masjid, whose leadership was openly pro-Taliban. Abdul Aziz and Abdul Rashid denied having any <b>links</b> to <b>banned</b> terrorist organisations but were vehemently opposed to the War on Terror and the conflict in Afghanistan. They openly condemned Musharraf and opposed Pakistani security forces, including the Pakistan Rangers and Islamabad Capital Territory police. The mosque became a source for speeches calling for the assassination of Musharraf. One of these speeches was delivered by Masood Azhar, whose Jaish-e-Mohammed group members were later involved in failed attempts to kill the president. In July 2005, Pakistani authorities attempted to raid the mosque in connection with their investigation into the July 7, 2005 London bombings, but the police were blocked by baton-wielding female students. After the raid, authorities apologised for the behaviour of the police.|$|R
50|$|Sponsored by Senator William Roth, the CAAA was {{the first}} United States anti-apartheid legislation. The act was {{initiated}} by Congressman Ronald V. Dellums {{in reaction to the}} plight of blacks in South Africa and demanded the end of apartheid. The legislation aimed to ban all new U.S. trade and investment in South Africa and would be a catalyst for similar sanctions in Europe and Japan. Direct air <b>links</b> were also <b>banned,</b> including South African Airways flights to U.S. airports. The act also required various U.S. departments and agencies to suppress funds and assistance to the then pro-apartheid government.|$|R
40|$|World Trade Organization (WTO) {{rules do}} not forbid {{government}} Members from utilizing an environment-related import <b>ban</b> <b>linked</b> to the processes and production methods (PPMs) used in exporting countries. The myth that PPMs violate world trade law pervades the 2 ̆ 2 trade and environment 2 ̆ 2 debate, {{and is one}} reason why so many environmentalists are wary of the WTO. This Article presents a new taxonomy of PPMs. It distinguishes three different kinds of trade measures, and analyzes the status of each under WTO rules. Understanding the correct legal status of different types of PPMs is a necessary first step toward resolving disputes over the use of such environmental instruments...|$|R
5000|$|Journalist Rebecca MacKinnon {{argued that}} making {{companies}} liable for users' actions {{could have a}} chilling effect on user-generated sites like YouTube. [...] "The intention {{is not the same as}} China’s Great Firewall, a nationwide system of Web censorship, but the practical effect could be similar". [...] The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has warned that Etsy, Flickr and Vimeo all seem likely to shut down if the bill becomes law. According to critics, the bill would <b>ban</b> <b>linking</b> to sites deemed offending, even in search results and on services such as Twitter. [...] Many cloud computing and Web hosting services may leave the US to avoid lawsuits.|$|R
5000|$|On January 8, 2015, Judge Duffey {{denied the}} defendants' motion to dismiss. He {{found that the}} plaintiffs were asserting they had a {{fundamental}} right to marry a person of the same sex, {{which is not a}} right protected by the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Since a fundamental right was not at issue, he explained he would assess Georgia's ban under the least restrictive standard of review, rational basis. He denied the motion because the state defendants had not yet met the rational basis standard by explaining the <b>link</b> between Georgia's <b>ban</b> on same-sex marriage and the state's interest in [...] "child welfare and procreation".|$|R
2500|$|After the decision, the Harbour Commission {{notified}} the Government of Canada {{that it could}} not continue to run the airport and asked that the Government of Canada take it over. However, the government chose to offer the airport to local interests for 90 days. If no local interest came forward, the Harbour Commission could begin to shut down the airport. The Harbour Commission cited the lack of fixed <b>link,</b> the <b>ban</b> on jets and the potential long response time to a major disaster at the airport. Tonks suggested the Greater Toronto Airports Authority agency running Pearson airport should take over the island airport as well. In September mayor Hall changed her position on the airport. Hall proposed continuing the jet ban but allow the bridge and allow modifications to the noise guidelines to allow U.S. regional airline turboprop planes to land at the airport. A few days later Hall met with federal Transport Minister Doug Young, provincial Transportation Minister Al Palladini, provincial Municipal Affairs Minister Al Leach, Tonks and the Harbour Commissioners to hammer out a deal. Jets were ruled out as, in Young's words, [...] "city councillors appear solidly opposed".|$|R
5000|$|On December 28, a {{military}} {{court of inquiry}} was established to investigate the matter and punish those involved. Retired Major General Sayed Mohammad Ibrahim, a defense analyst, said the country and its democratic structures were reasonably immune to interference. [...] "Today's news about events in the army is worrying but will not cause any damage to democracy," [...] he said. The military spokesperson also said the initial investigations found non-resident Bangladeshis (NRB) link to the plot while {{at least one of}} the officers, the fugitive Major, was <b>linked</b> to <b>banned</b> Islamist group Hizbut Tahrir. He mentioned, [...] "Stringent legal measures will be taken against the persons involved in the conspiracy after proper investigation." [...] The army spokesman underlined that banking on the army in the past, [...] "different evil forces availed political gains and made abortive attempts to do so but as an institution, military still has to bear the stigma". non-resident Bangladeshi, Ishraq Ahmed, who was involved in the coup said the coup goal was topple Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from “letting Bangladesh be 'turned into a Bantustan' run by India”. Major Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haq and Ishraq Ahmed are on the run.|$|R
25|$|During this period, {{he testified}} {{on behalf of}} a {{captured}} cell of the Umkhonto we Sizwe, an armed anti-apartheid group <b>linked</b> to the <b>banned</b> African National Congress (ANC). He stated that although he was committed to non-violence and censured those on all sides who used violence, he could understand why other black Africans would turn towards it when all their non-violent tactics had proved fruitless in overturning apartheid. In an earlier address, he had expressed the view that an armed struggle against the South African government had little chance of succeeding but also called out Western nations for hypocrisy, noting that they were condemning armed liberation groups in southern Africa while they had praised armed liberation groups operating in Europe during the Second World War.|$|R
5000|$|A {{member of}} the Nationalist Congress Party, he served as forest and {{environment}} minister {{in the government of}} E.K. Mawlong. He later served as cooperation minister under Chief Minister Flinder Anderson Khonglam. He later lost his seat in the state assembly following the February 2003 elections. On June 27, 2003, he was arrested on charges of maintaining <b>links</b> with the <b>banned</b> militant group Achik National Volunteers' Council. [...] He was released on bail about a month later. The following year he lost the Garo Hills District Council election for the Dengnakpara G.D.C. constituency to Roster Sangma of the Congress. He lost the 2003 legislative election by just over 300 votes to Zenith Sangma. [...] However, he reemerged as the victor in the 2008 legislative elections.|$|R
5000|$|... b) Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission 447 U.S. 557 (U.S. 1980) which {{challenged}} {{a public}} service commission’s regulation banning promotional advertising by an electric utility. The Court held that the regulation {{was a violation of}} Amendment I because the state interest in ensuring fair and efficient utility rates was not sufficiently <b>linked</b> to the <b>ban.</b> In the case of the electric company, the public service commission’s concern over the equality and efficiency of utility rates did not provide a constitutionally acceptable reason for restricting protected speech. The ban on all promotional advertising by the company violated both Amendment I in respect to the freedom of speech, and the Amendment XIV in regards to the Due Process Clause.|$|R
5000|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} Muslim Aid {{has centered}} mainly on allegations of {{its role in}} the financing of terrorist or extremist organizations. In 2002, a Spanish police report alleged the organisation to have used funds to send mujahadeen fighters to Bosnia. In 2010, the organisation was investigated by the Charity Commission for England and Wales for allegedly funding groups <b>linked</b> to a <b>banned</b> terrorist organisation. The investigation cleared the organisation and said that the claims were unsubstantiated. The Sunday Telegraph criticised the outcome saying that the Commission cleared the organization “without examining any of the evidence presented,” that the organisation has admitted funding two organisations linked to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and alleging that Muslim Aid is “closely linked to the extremist Islamic Forum of Europe, which wants to create a sharia state in Europe.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Opponents {{of the ban}} {{claim that}} the {{regulations}} have caused shops to close {{as a result of}} costs associated with the ban, and that the bans have caused the proportion of illegal or 'contraband' cigarettes sold to increase. Following the ban in Canada, 27 per cent of cigarettes sold are illegal. and 15 per cent of convenience stores have closed.In Iceland 30 per cent of smaller shops have closed. [...] It is not yet clear whether the shop closures were linked to the tobacco display ban or the significant wider economic issues affecting Iceland during the period in question. One study states that teenage smoking levels in Thailand, increased in the period following the ban. - a causative <b>link</b> between the <b>ban</b> and the increase has not been demonstrated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{trial of}} Mr. Bram Fischer was {{primarily}} {{an attempt to}} remove and imprison {{the leadership of the}} SACP. On 26 August 1964, Bram Fischer, a senior lawyer who had led the defense of the Rivonia trialists, and fourteen other people were arrested and charged with having furthered the aims of the SACP or being office-bearers, officers, or members of the party. The charge sheet alleged that they aimed at [...] "establishing a despotic government based on the dictatorship of the proletariat" [...] in South Africa. Esther had been the <b>link</b> between the <b>banned</b> liberation movements and activists working openly, she was detained and then kept in solitary confinement. Esther and other communist women began a hunger strike, hoping this would compel the police to charge or release them.|$|R
5000|$|Additional {{concerns}} {{include the}} possible impact on common Internet {{functions such as}} links from one site to another or accessing data from the cloud. EFF claimed the bill would <b>ban</b> <b>linking</b> to sites deemed offending, even in search results and on services such as Twitter. Christian Dawson, Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Virginia-based hosting company ServInt, predicted that the legislation would lead to many cloud computing and Web hosting services {{moving out of the}} US to avoid lawsuits. Even without SOPA, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) has already launched extradition proceedings against Richard O'Dwyer in the UK. O'Dwyer hosted the TVShack.net website which had links to material elsewhere and did not host any files. ICE has stated that it intends to pursue websites even if their only connection to the USA is a [...]com or [...]net web domain.|$|R
5000|$|A {{year after}} {{the closure of the}} jailbait subreddit, a subreddit called [...] "Creepshots" [...] drew {{controversy}} in the press for hosting sexualized images of women without their knowledge. In the wake of this media attention, violentacrez was added to Creepshots as a moderator, and reports emerged that Gawker reporter Adrian Chen was planning an exposé that would reveal the real-life identity of this user, who moderated dozens of controversial subreddits as well as a few hundred general-interest communities. Several major subreddits <b>banned</b> <b>links</b> to Gawker in response to the impending exposé and the violentacrez account was deleted. Moderators defended their decisions to block the site from these sections of Reddit on the basis that the impending report was [...] "doxing" [...] (a term for exposing the identity of a pseudonymous person), and that such exposure threatened the site's structural integrity.|$|R
