40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} Maricopa, Marana, and Glendale, Arizona in 2001 to measure cotton growth, yield, micronaire, and production costs in single and double seed <b>line</b> <b>per</b> bed systems on 32 and 40 inch beds. Canopy development was faster and canopy closure was greater in the double seed line than in the single seed line systems and was greater in the 32 inch than in the 40 inch row systems. At Maricopa, the single line 32 inch system yield of 1571 lbs. /A was significantly greater than the yields of the other seed line/row spacing systems. The yields of the single line 40 and the double line 32 inch systems {{were not significantly different}} at 1476 and 1411 lbs. of lint/A, respectively, and the yields of the double line 32 and the double line 40 inch systems also were not significantly different at 1411 and 1396 lbs. of lint/A, respectively. There were no significant lint yield differences at the Marana or Glendale location. At Marana, the lint yields were 1063 and 1066 lbs. /A for the single and double seed line 40 inch row spacing systems, respectively. At Glendale, the single and double seed line 38 inch row spacing systems yielded 1474 and 1551 lbs. of lint/A, respectively. In all 2001 experiments, there was a trend for reduced micronaire in the double seed <b>line</b> <b>per</b> bed systems compared to the single seed <b>line</b> <b>per</b> bed systems. At Maricopa, the average micronaire was 5. 0 and 4. 7 for the single and double seed <b>line</b> <b>per</b> bed 32 <b>inch</b> row system, respectively, and 5. 2 and 4. 9 for the single and double seed <b>line</b> <b>per</b> bed 40 <b>inch</b> row systems, respectively. At Marana, the micronaire was 4. 7 and 4. 5 for the single and double seed <b>line</b> <b>per</b> bed 40 <b>inch</b> row systems, respectively. At Glendale, the micronaire was 5. 1 and 4. 6 for the single and double seed <b>line</b> <b>per</b> bed 38 <b>inch</b> row systems, respectively.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe lattice parameters, structure factors, and Debye-Waller temperature factor of a homogenized, binary Ti- 51 at. %Al intermetallic alloy were determined using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Previous {{studies have been}} hampered by extinction at low Bragg angles, therefore improved powdering methods were implemented. The powder was produced by pulverizing lathe turnings taken from the sample ingot using a ceramic mortar and pestle. then the powder was passed through a U. S. Standard 400 sieve mesh (38 microns). After further grinding a new acoustical sieving procedure was performed where powder particles were passed through a 2000 <b>line</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> sieve mesh (5 - 7 microns). Next the powder was annealed to relieve induced stress produced during grinding. An X-ray diffraction study was conducted for Bragg angles 10 - 140 deg. The L 1 structured TiAl lattice parameters of a = 4. 002 and c= 4. 081 were determined using XRD peak positions. the resulting c/a ratio equalled 1. 02. The measured integrated intensities of the fundamental reflections {{were used to determine}} a Debye-Waller temperature factor of B= 0. 65 using the Wilson method. these values were determined to be accurate based on comparison to previous research and theoretical approximations. The effects of extinction at low angles were not completely avoided with the refined powder particle size however, they were significantly reduced. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Color {{matching}} is {{an important}} issue in the flexographic industry today because of many problems related to it. For example, there are few standards of ink and color for spot color printing. Further, there is no standardization in the communication among anilox roller suppliers and their customers concerning the specific cell volume measurement of the anilox roller. This research focused on the study of the use of the banded anilox roller as a tool for color proofing under the assumption that a spot color printed by the flexographic process actually should be produced using a banded anilox roller as a tool for color proofing. The major questions for this study were: 1. How will the anilox cell volume and <b>line</b> screen <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> affect the CIE LAB total color difference (AE) ? 2. Can the same color actually be produced with a AE 3 ̆c 2 (good match) by using the same specification of anilox roller? This research was conducted by printing a spot color with two banded anilox rollers to match the original Pantone color as close as possible and using it for the reference. The data collected from each of the bands was plotted in diagrams to see the effects of cell volume and <b>line</b> screen <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the total color difference(AE). In this experiment, two ink color strengths were used. In the second experiment, three anilox rollers were tested. The same specifications were given from the particular band of banded anilox roller derived from the first experiment to give the best color match from the first run. The second experiment was to print the same spot color using the three anilox rollers and banded anilox to deter mine which would give the closest match to the original Pantone color. Samples from each of the anilox rollers were collected and measured for their total color differences (AE) as determined relative to the sample mean of press sheets selected from the second press run of the banded anilox roller. In addition, the same banded anilox from the second press run was used to run again to confirm the result. The press sheets for each of the anilox rollers was evaluated for the degree of color matching to the press sheet printed by the banded anilox from the second press run. The study results show that there is a negative linear relationship between the cell volume (BCM) and the CIE LAB total color difference (AE), and a positive linear relationship between the <b>line</b> screen <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (LPI) and the CIE LAB total color difference (AE). Ink color strength also has {{a significant impact on the}} changing of the AE value. Furthermore, the same color can be produced with AE 3 ̆c 1 (no difference) by using the same banded anilox roller. However, only one of the three anilox rollers from different suppliers can produce the same color with the CIE LAB total color diffference (AE) 3 ̆c 2...|$|R

50|$|Handspinners use {{the number}} of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> often. Because the amount of twist defines {{a lot about a}} yarn, {{the number of}} twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is an {{important}} measure to recreate a yarn.

Measuring the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> such as medium twist or hard twist yarns.

50|$|The {{number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> {{in a piece}} of woven cloth varies {{depending}} on the stage of manufacture.

After weaving the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will increase, and it will increase again after being washed. This increase in the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (and picks <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> and shrinkage in the size of the fabric is known as the take-up. The take-up is dependent on many factors, including the material and how tightly the cloth is woven.
