The description must include a detailed explanation of and justification for any additional resources needed. 1. Provide a written narrative explaining and justifying what additional resources will be required to implement the proposed bill. The narrative of the potential impact must address the following: � How will the proposed bill affect the agency's operations? o Describe the divisions and programs that will be affected o Specify the current vs. projected activities performed within the affected division(s) /program(s) o Provide the current vs. projected number of persons served o Describe the current vs. projected amount or types of service provided o Provide measures of the current vs. projected workload per position Can the projected workload be accommodated within the agency's existing capacity and/or budget? If not, provide a detailed explanation of how it was determined that the agency is at capacity. 2. In addition to the narrative, complete the Fiscal Note Information Request Template. The template is an excel file containing three (3) worksheets, which are to be used to provide <b>line</b> <b>item</b> <b>details</b> for all additional resources needed.

Before it {{was approved by the}} Pentagon and sent to Congress, it was vetted by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and signed by Chief of Naval Operations Jonathan Greenert, after which the <b>line</b> <b>item</b> was removed. In a 31 March 2014 letter to Congress, Admiral Greenert said that the decision to remove the RCOH <b>line</b> <b>item</b> from the unfunded priorities list was made to align with budget decisions over the next several years. The list was for the FY 2015, so a decision to refuel or inactivate the carrier has to be made during FY 2016 budget planning with the fiscal outlook at that time and the possibility of sequestration funding levels.

40|$|Unbalanced bidding is {{a serious}} problem for the {{construction}} owner because it may increase the cost of construction The most common way to mathematically unbalance a bid is frontloading where a bidder overstates the unit price of <b>line</b> <b>items</b> scheduled to be performed early in the project and understates the unit price of <b>line</b> <b>items</b> performed later. A bidder can also overstate the unit price of a <b>line</b> <b>item</b> whose quantity was somehow underrated by the engineer. If the owner proves that a mathematically unbalanced bid costs more to perform, the bid is said to be materially unbalanced, in which case the owner can reject the bid. A model is presented that formalizes and automates the process of detecting mathematically and materially unbalanced bids by comparing <b>line</b> <b>item</b> prices with the engineer’s estimates and the average prices offered by the bidders. This model allows owners to detect and reject unbalanced bids, and deters bidders from unbalancing their bid. Bids, mathematical models, financial management, construction costs, optimization,...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Objective: Determine the {{adequacy}} of food composition data for sweetened beverages and snack foods, and improve the nutrient database for a previously validated FFQ (the Beverage and Snack Questionnaire,BSQ). Methods: To illustrate the impact of using only USDA Standard Reference- 24 to perform nutrient analyses of the BSQ, we populated two nutritional databases. The first database included only BSQ foods whose nutrient profiles were available from USDA SR- 24. The second database included nutrient profiles obtained from USDA SR- 24 augmented with data from other databases, food manufacturers, and scientific publications. Nutritional analyses of the BSQ were performed separately for each database, and mean estimates for energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate were compared. We also compared the nutritional databases by selecting a single food to define the nutrient profile of each <b>line</b> <b>item,</b> and subsequently by selecting multiple foods to define <b>line</b> <b>items.</b> Results: Comparing BSQ nutritional analysis using only information from USDA-SR 24 vs. analysis using this information augmented with other sources revealed minor differences (approximately 0 - 1 %) for mean energy and macronutrients in 13 of 19 <b>line</b> <b>items.</b> However, deviations up to 100 % with respect to macronutrient composition were observed for other <b>line</b> <b>items</b> including fruit drinks, flavored waters, and frozen desserts. Nutritional analysis using single vs. multiple foods to define <b>line</b> <b>items</b> was similar, although significant deviations (up to 100 % were observed for various <b>line</b> <b>items</b> such as candies, cookies, and fruits. Significance: If USDA SR- 24 is the sole source of food composition data, the accuracy of nutritional assessments could be compromised, potentially leading to underestimating effects of sweetened beverages and snack foods on nutritional status and energy balance. Understanding how food composition data and <b>line</b> <b>item</b> definitions impact the performance of FFQs may improve the accuracy of dietary assessment tools, and advance understanding {{of the effects of}} foods on nutritional status...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the theory and}} application of an alternative measure of stock-out cost in inventory control. Instead of recording the number of units of a product which are backordered, in certain situations {{it is appropriate to}} focus on the number or percentage of customer <b>line</b> <b>items</b> (requests for a particular item) which are backordered. By combining an approximate backorder cost per customer <b>line</b> <b>item</b> backordered with the usual ordering and carrying costs, an approximately optimal reorder point (or safety stock) formula is derived. The formula is applied to a stratified sample of 500 products from an actual inventory system, and an estimated 13 % reduction in customer <b>line</b> <b>items</b> backordered is obtained with no increase in total inventory investment. ...|$|R

S. Government’s (USG) key contributions to this growing body of information. This 2016 update adds 27 new <b>line</b> <b>items</b> to the list, for a total of 379 <b>line</b> <b>items.</b> (A <b>line</b> <b>item</b> is a unique combination of a country and a good.) These include three new goods – potatoes, pepper, and silk cocoons – that have not appeared on the List before, as well as two new countries, Costa Rica and Sudan. This edition also removes one <b>line</b> <b>item,</b> garments from Jordan, from the List. With these changes, the List has a total of 139 goods produced by child labor and/or forced labor in violation of international standards in 75 countries around the world. In this edition, for the first time, we include narrative descriptions of the child labor or forced labor occurring in the mining, production, or manufacture of each of the new <b>line</b> <b>items.</b> Based on available information, we detail the areas of a country where the child or forced labor is concentrated, how widespread the problem is, the ages and other demographics of the victims, the hazards to which child laborers are exposed, the forms of forced labor used to exploit victims, and other details that help to tell their stories more fully than in past editions...|$|R

30|$|To {{generate}} the pallet {{data from the}} information contained in a TPFDD <b>line</b> <b>item,</b> DALP-TS computes upper and lower bounds on the required number of pallets. The bounds indicate the smallest and largest number of pallets that could be created from the given cargo weight. In order to be a non-trivial load, pallets were assumed to have a lower weight bound of 2500  lb. The structural limitations of the pallet base, as well as most cargo aircraft, restrict the pallet upper weight limit to 10, 000  lb. Thus, if a TPFDD <b>line</b> <b>item</b> specified 63, 800  lb of cargo, the minimum number of possible pallets is: 63, 800 / 10, 000  =  7, and the maximum number of pallets is: 63, 800 / 2500  =  25. DALP-TS randomly selects an integer between these bounds (inclusive) as the total number of pallets and assigns a random weight between 2500 and 10, 000  lb to each pallet such that the sum of the pallet weights equals the specified weight by the TPFDD <b>line</b> <b>item.</b> Each pallet associated with a given TPFDD <b>line</b> <b>item</b> has identical temporal constraints.|$|R
