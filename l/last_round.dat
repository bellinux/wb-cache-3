This was a controversial decision at the time as {{it was the first time}} such a phenomenon had happened in Iraqi football.|$|E

That meant that Yorkshire and Lancashire had each won once during the tournament, and irrespective of results in the <b>last</b> <b>round</b> of group matches, neither could qualify for finals day; both the Southern Vipers and Western Storm would join the Loughborough Lightning.|$|E
5|$|Mobilization of the Red Army {{had begun}} before the <b>last</b> <b>round</b> of {{meetings}} in Moscow. On June 7, the Army {{was ordered to}} prepare for an attack against Lithuania.
