5|$|In Angry Birds, {{the player}} {{controls}} {{a flock of}} multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs, which have been stolen {{by a group of}} hungry green pigs. In each stage of the gameplay, enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass, and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game is to eliminate all the pigs on the level. Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and squash the pigs. The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions). The <b>launch</b> <b>process</b> is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released. In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard-to-reach pigs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe authors had the {{opportunity}} to contribute in the erection process of the „Čadečka” highway bridge between September 2014 and June 2015. The tasks of the authors were to design and execute the <b>launching</b> <b>process</b> of the steel main girders together with the design of the launching technology and the static check of the superstructure in each launching phase. The specialty of the <b>launching</b> <b>process</b> consisted in the complex bridge geometry. In top view two third of the bridge is located in a right arch of a circle, one part is a transient arch, a short part is straight {{and the end of the}} bridge is located in a transient arch having opposite curvature than the another end. In side view the bridge has also a curved shape with an extreme point in the middle part. In addition to this complex geometry the relative level distance between the two main I-girders is not constant along the longitudinal axis, it follows the exact geometry of the carriageway. This complex geometry cannot be launched without continuous modification of the erected shape, which made the <b>launching</b> <b>process</b> difficult. The paper gives an overview on the specialties of this complicated design and calculation process...|$|R
