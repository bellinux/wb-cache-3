5|$|In modern times, among European royalty at least, marriages between royal dynasties {{have become}} much rarer than they once were.

Since the nation's {{official}} {{debut in}} 1936, Liechtensteinian athletes {{have appeared in}} every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, except for two occasions. <b>Liechtenstein</b> did not register any athletes at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, and eventually joined the United States-led boycott when Moscow hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics.

5|$|<b>Liechtenstein</b> {{formally}} {{came into}} existence on 23 January 1719, when Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor decreed the lordship of Schellenberg and the countship of Vaduz united and raised to the dignity of a principality. <b>Liechtenstein</b> {{was a part of}} the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Pressburg was signed on 26 December 1805; this marked Liechtenstein's formal independence, though it was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine and the German Confederation afterwards. While <b>Liechtenstein</b> was still closely aligned with Austria-Hungary until World War I, it realigned its politics and its customs and monetary institutions with Switzerland instead. Having been a constitutional monarchy since 1921, Hans-Adam II demanded more influence in Liechtenstein's politics in the early 21st century, which he was granted in a referendum held on 16 March 2003, effectively making <b>Liechtenstein</b> a semi-constitutional monarchy again. However, the constitutional changes also provide for the possibility of a referendum to abolish the monarchy entirely. The current monarch is Hans-Adam II, who turned over the day-to-day governing decisions to his son and heir Alois, Hereditary Prince of <b>Liechtenstein</b> on 15 August 2004.|$|E
