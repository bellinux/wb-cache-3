60|$|From {{the mass}} who show a {{satisfactory}} result {{at the end}} of the Schooling process, the functional manhood and womanhood of our peoples have to be developed, and we have now to discuss the nature of the second phase of education, the phase that should be the mental parallel and accompaniment of physical adolescence in all the citizens who are to count for strength in the state. There is a break in the whole development of the human being at this age, and it may very well be paralleled by a break in methods and subjects of instruction. In Great Britain, in the case of the wealthier classes, schooling and puerile discipline is prolonged altogether too far, largely through the gross incapacity of our secondary teachers. These men are unable, boring away day after day, week after week, year after year, with vain repetitions, imbecile breaks and new beginnings, through all the vast period from eleven or twelve until twenty, to achieve that mastery of Latin and Greek which was once the necessary preliminary to education, and which has become at last, through the secular decline in scholastic energy and capacity due to the withdrawal of interest in these studies, the unattainable educational ideal. These classical pedagogues, however, carry the thing up to three or four and twenty in the Universities-- though it is inconceivable that any language spoken since the antediluvian age of leisure, can need more than ten years to learn--and if they could keep the men until forty or fifty they would still be fumbling away at the keys to the room that was ransacked long ago. But with educated men as teachers and practical handbooks to help, and practical examiners to guide them, there is no reason whatever why the great mass of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>training</b> of the citizen, in the use of his own and any other necessary language, should not be done for good and all by fourteen, why he should not have a fairly complete mastery of form and quantity through mathematical training and drawing, and why the way should not be clear and immediate for the development of that adult mental edifice of which this is the foundation.|$|E

40|$|Several {{clinical}} case fragments {{show how}} {{a reading of}} the subject’s symptoms {{at the level of the}} signifier gives access to its underlying unconscious logic. Freud’s “splitting of consciousness” model is proposed to have a neurophysiologic counterpart in LeDoux’s model for the processing of emotional stimuli. The language fragments in these dynamics are considered as material phoneme vectors, corresponding to Freud’s word-presentation and to Lacan’s signifier. Accordingly, neurolinguistic research has uncovered a specific, well-organized lexical brain area in which the words are phonologically encoded. In line with Lacan, psycholinguistic research has shown how the <b>linguistic</b> <b>train</b> always has an ambiguous structure, transiently and unconsciously activating its different meanings, followed by inhibition of the contextually inappropriate meanings. Neurophysiologic research also shows how language is always a motor event. Imminent articulatory intentions that remain without effective execution will therefore give rise to articulatory or phonemic phantoms, searching for relief in substitutive signifiers. A neurophysiologic mechanism for Freudian repression is thus proposed, leading to the return of the repressed in symptoms with a similar phonemic structure though with a radically different meaning. The phonemic phantoms thereby organize the structure of the unconscious by functioning as attractors for the subject’s mental energy in its (linguistic) action space.

50|$|For instance, Psycharis {{proposed}} {{to change the}} form of the neuter noun το φως gen. του φωτός (=light) into το φώτο (gen. του φώτου).

Moreover, Psycharis also advocated spelling reform, which would have meant abolishing the six different ways to write the vowel /i/ and all instances of double consonants.

50|$|Some deep {{learning}} architectures display problematic behaviors, such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images {{as belonging to}} a familiar category of ordinary images and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images. Goertzel hypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous multi-component AGI architectures. These issues may possibly be addressed by {{deep learning}} architectures that internally form states homologous to image-grammar decompositions of observed entities and events. Learning a grammar (visual or <b>linguistic)</b> from <b>training</b> data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basic goal of both human language acquisition and AI.|$|R
