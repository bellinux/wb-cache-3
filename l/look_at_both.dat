5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Blatty worked {{as the public}} {{relations}} director at Loyola University of Los Angeles and as a publicity director at the University of Southern California. He published his first book, Which Way to Mecca, Jack? in 1960, a humorous <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>both</b> his early life, and {{his work at the}} United States Information Agency in Lebanon. In 1961, while still working in public relations, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show You Bet Your Life, winning $10,000, enough money to quit his job and to write full-time. Thereafter, he never held a regular job.|$|E

25|$|The court {{states the}} test for {{copyright}} infringement as copying an item {{that is the subject}} of a valid copyright, making no mention of improper appropriation of protectible elements. This is in contrast to the 2nd Circuit's prior opinion in Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119 (1930), that infringement occurs only when there is copying and improper appropriation. The Nichols court held that appropriation was not improper when the alleged infringer copied only unprotectible elements of the original work. While it is appropriate to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>both</b> protectible and unprotectible elements of a work to determine whether copying has occurred, only the protectible elements are relevant when it comes to determining improper appropriation. The Steinberg court made no attempt to separate the protectable and unprotectable elements of Steinberg's drawing.|$|E

500|$|During the 2010–11 season, the Capitals {{participated in}} the 2011 NHL Winter Classic against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Heinz Field, Pittsburgh. Leading up to the game, both teams were {{featured}} on HBO's 24/7, which offered a behind-the-scenes <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>both</b> teams as they prepared. Laich refused to blame {{the presence of the}} cameras for the team's losing streak, saying, [...] "There's no using the HBO cameras as a crutch or an annoyance or anything like that. There's no excuse. I don't think HBO has played any bit of an ounce in how things have gone the last two weeks." [...] Laich was appreciative of the opportunities afforded by the outdoor game, and was happy to be able to share time with his family and friends on the outdoor rink set up at Heinz Field.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were the}} most praised aspect of the game. Ryan Davis of GameSpot said that the visuals were [...] "gorgeous" [...] and breathtaking to <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> <b>both</b> in ship designs and details of the tracks. However, Davis noted that the game never remains at a [...] "solid" [...] 60 frames per second, which can cause occasional fluctuation. A reviewer of GamePro similarly praised the visuals as breathtaking, stating that the [...] "beautiful" [...] panoramic scenery defied the notion of usual graphics displayed on a handheld console. Ryan O'Donnell of IGN considered the graphics to be the strongest aspect of the game, saying that its courses, weapon detail and ship designs were [...] "beautiful". However, O'Donnell found that occasional framerate issues kept it from [...] "perfection". Daniel Chang of GameSpy opinionated that the visuals were [...] "well-crafted as any video game or feature film". John Davison of 1UP stated that both the game's presentation and graphics were stunning and [...] "absolutely beautiful". A reviewer from Edge similarly praised the aesthetics as [...] "beautiful" [...] and dynamic. Andy Kelly of GamesRadar stated that the visuals were well-designed, although he noticed some framerate drops.|$|E

500|$|Concept {{work for}} Valkyria Chronicles III began after {{development}} finished on Valkyria Chronicles II in early 2010, with full development beginning shortly after this. The director of Valkyria Chronicles II, Takeshi Ozawa, returned to that role for Valkyria Chronicles III. Development work took approximately one year. After {{the release of}} Valkyria Chronicles II, the staff took a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>both</b> the popular response for the game and {{what they wanted to}} do next for the series. Like its predecessor, Valkyria Chronicles III was developed for PlayStation Portable: this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for Valkyria Chronicles II, and they had not come up with the [...] "revolutionary" [...] idea that would warrant a new entry for the PlayStation 3. Speaking in an interview, it was stated that the development team considered Valkyria Chronicles III to be the series' first true sequel: while Valkyria Chronicles II had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move, the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of Valkyria Chronicles II due to being on the same platform. In addition to Sega staff from the previous games, development work was also handled by Media.Vision. The original scenario was written Kazuki Yamanobe, while the script was written by Hiroyuki Fujii, Koichi Majima, Kishiko Miyagi, Seiki Nagakawa and Takayuki Shouji. Its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{feminine}} {{categorization of}} Egypt, and subsequently Cleopatra, was negatively portrayed throughout early criticism. The story of Antony and Cleopatra was often summarised as either [...] "the fall {{of a great}} general, betrayed in his dotage by a treacherous strumpet, or else it {{can be viewed as}} a celebration of transcendental love." [...] In both reduced summaries, Egypt and Cleopatra are presented as either the destruction of Antony's masculinity and greatness or as agents in a love story. Once the Women's Liberation Movement grew between the 1960s and 1980s, however, critics began to take a closer <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>both</b> Shakespeare's characterization of Egypt and Cleopatra and the work and opinions of other critics on the same matter.|$|E

Alex Macpherson of Fact said that, {{apart from its}} interesting music, Rated R is important for how Rihanna has [...] "seized back control of her public story" [...] during [...] "our current [...] age". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe praised it as a brief <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>both</b> Rihanna's development {{as an artist and}} [...] "the confluence of tabloid culture and pop art". MSN Music's Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention, indicating a [...] "likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy." [...] He cited [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy" [...] as highlights and credited Rihanna for [...] "concocting a persona of interest out of one dynamite musical trick and a bad patch I wouldn't wish on Lindsay Lohan".|$|E

2500|$|Musicians and playwrights {{have made}} {{reference}} to Scientology on some of their work, with some pieces treating the topic in a negative light by their references, and others in a positive manner. Frank Zappa's 1979 concept album/rock opera Joe's Garage lampoons Scientology in the song [...] "A Token of My Extreme". Scientologist Chick Corea has {{made reference to}} Scientology in his work, {{and two of his}} albums were influenced by L. Ron Hubbard novels. [...] Maynard James Keenan of the metal band Tool, has been critical of Scientology, and the 1996 song [...] "Ænema" [...] contains a negative reference to L. Ron Hubbard. [...] Both Scientology and the life of its founder L. Ron Hubbard were addressed in the 2003 Off-Broadway musical, A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant. [...] The play took a tongue-in-cheek <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>both</b> Hubbard's life and the history of the Church, and received an Obie Award in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{adapting the}} Boris Pasternak novel for television, screenwriter Andrew Davies revealed {{the task was}} [...] "daunting because the book is reckoned to be a masterpiece and the film is a great movie and one that I admire very much. Robert Bolt is the king of epic screenplay writers in my book. But as I got further into the book I kept thinking that I didn't agree with Robert Bolt about how to tell the story... and I began to feel much more excited." [...] He added, [...] "It was also a relief to find {{so much in the}} book that hadn't found its way into the first movie and could make great drama.... I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but I thought we could say more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. None of these things really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. I think that if they <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>both</b> versions now, people will probably think that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet speak to us in our time. Maybe my script will seem out of date in 20 years time because a lot of them do, but watching the original film, I think the central performances look stilted and dated now." ...|$|E
