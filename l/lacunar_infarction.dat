50|$|Lipohyalinosis is a small-vessel {{disease in}} the brain. Originally defined by Fisher as 'segmental {{arteriolar}} wall disorganisation', {{it is characterised by}} vessel wall thickening and a resultant reduction in luminal diameter. Fisher considered this small-vessel disease {{to be the result of}} hypertension, induced in the acute stage by fibrinoid necrosis that would lead to occlusion and hence lacunar stroke. However, recent evidence suggests that endothelial dysfunction as a result of inflammation is a more likely cause for it. This may occur subsequent to blood-brain barrier failure, and lead to extravasation of serum components into the brain that are potentially toxic. <b>Lacunar</b> <b>infarction</b> could thus occur in this way, and the narrowing - the hallmark feature of lipohyalinosis - may merely be a feature of the swelling occurring around it that squeezes on the structure.|$|E
5000|$|A silent <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction</b> (SLI) is {{one type}} of silent stroke which usually shows no {{identifiable}} outward symptoms thus the term [...] "silent". Individuals who suffer a SLI are often completely unaware they have suffered a stroke. This type of stroke often causes lesions in the surrounding brain tissue that are visibly detected via neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and computerized axial tomography (CT scan). Silent strokes, including silent lacunar infarctions, {{have been shown to}} be much more common than previously thought, with an estimated prevalence rate of eleven million per year in the United States. Approximately 10% of these silent strokes are silent lacunar infarctions. While dubbed [...] "silent" [...] due to the immediate lack of classic stroke symptoms, SLIs can cause damage to the surrounding brain tissue (lesions) and can affect various aspects of a persons mood, personality, and cognitive functioning. A SLI or any type of silent stroke places an individual at greater risk for future major stroke.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Silent brain infarctions are {{the silent}} {{cerebrovascular}} {{events that are}} distinguished from symptomatic <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> by their 'silence'; the origin of these infarctions is still unclear. This study analyzed the characteristics of silent and symptomatic <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> and sought to explore the mechanism of this 'silence'. METHODS: In total, 156 patients with only silent brain infarctions, 90 with only symptomatic <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions,</b> 160 with both silent and symptomatic <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions,</b> and 115 without any infarctions were recruited. Vascular risk factors, leukoaraiosis, and vascular assessment results were compared. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were compared between patients with only symptomatic <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> and patients with two types of infarctions. The locations {{of all of the}} infarctions were evaluated. The evolution of the two types of infarctions was retrospectively studied by comparing the infarcts on the magnetic resonance images of 63 patients obtained at different times. RESULTS: The main risk factors for silent brain infarctions were hypertension, age, and advanced leukoaraiosis; the main factors for symptomatic <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> were hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and atherosclerosis of relevant arteries. The neurological deficits of patients with only symptomatic <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> were more severe than those of patients with both types of infarctions. More silent brain infarctions were located in the corona radiata and basal ganglia; these locations were {{different from those of the}} symptomatic <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions.</b> The initial sizes of the symptomatic <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> were larger than the silent brain infarctions, whereas the final sizes were almost equal between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic ischemic preconditioning and nonstrategic locations may be the main reasons for the 'silence' of silent brain infarctions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{origin and}} afferentation of the frontal N 30 {{component}} of the median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) {{have not yet been}} fully elucidated. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the possible selective impairment of the N 30 component in patients with lacunar infarcts of the basal ganglia as compared to patients with <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> sparing the basal ganglia and to a group of healthy subjects. METHODS: Median nerve SEPs were measured in ten patients with <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> of the brain (but no cortical atrophy or leukoaraiosis) and 13 healthy volunteers. Four patients had <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> affecting the basal ganglia and 6 patients had lesions affecting other structures. RESULTS: In two patients with lesions affecting the head of the caudate nucleus, there was no identifiable N 30 component on the affected side. In one patient with bilateral lesions of the globus pallidus, the amplitude of the N 30 component was significantly reduced. In one patient with lesion of the tail of the caudate nucleus, the N 30 component was unaffected. The amplitude of the N 30 component was also reduced in two patients with frontal subcortical white matter lesions. In all the other subjects, we recorded normal N 30 components on both sides. CONCLUSION: Our results further support the importance of the basal ganglia, especially the head of the caudate nucleus in the generation of the N 30 {{component of the}} median nerve SEPs...|$|R

40|$|Background: Lacunar infarctions {{account for}} up to 25 % of all ischemic strokes and, thus, {{constitute}} a numerically important subgroup. It {{is important that the}} two pathogeneses of <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction,</b> that is, small-vessel occlusion and branch atheromatous disease, be differentiated because prognoses and treatment strategies differ. The authors evaluated the presence of branch atheromatous plaque in parent arteries that supply lacunar infarcts by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI). Methods: HR-MRI was performed in 15 patients with (1) a clinical presentation consistent with classical lacunar syndromes; (2) an acute <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction</b> by diffusion-weighted imaging, measuring ≤ 20 mm in maximal diameter; (3) a magnetic resonance angiography showing a normal middle cerebral artery or basilar artery supplying the ischemic lesion, and (4) no other obvious etiology for small-vessel distribution ischemic stroke. Results: The median time of vessel wall imaging after index events was 4 days (range, 2 – 15 days). Six of the 15 patients had a <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction</b> in the middle cerebral artery territory, and 9 had a lesion in the basilar artery territory. HR-MRI detected underlying atheromatous plaques in 9 patients (60 %) with a <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction.</b> In these 9 patients, asymptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis was more frequent compared to patients without branch atheromatous plaque (55. 6 vs. 16. 7 %). In pontine infarctions, ischemic lesions that extended to the pial base of the pons were more frequent in patients with branch atheromatous plaques (83. 3 vs. 33. 3 %), and all the ischemic lesions and atheromatous plaques were on the same side (right, n = 2; left, n = 4).

40|$|Subcortical {{vascular}} dementia (SVD) {{is a small}} vessel disease with dementia that exhibits relatively uniform clinical and pathological features and constitutes approximately half of {{vascular dementia}} (VaD) cases.

To my knowledge，however，there have been no reports evaluating age-related changes in cerebral MRA in many neurologically normal subjects. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the correlation between the visualization of cerebral peripheral arteries in MRA and aging，sex，laterality or <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Materials and Methods: Two hundred forty four neurologically normal subjects (119 males and 125 females，aged 7 to 82 yrs.) were evaluated with MRA and MRI. A 3 DFT-TOF pulse sequence with slab thickness of 115 mm was used to obtain axial，saggital and coronal projection images. The imaging parameters were 30 / 11 / 1 (TR/TE/excitations) using a 20 degree flip angle and the voxel size was 0. 9 x 1. 1 x 0. 9 mm. A total of 6 arteries including bilateral anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) ，middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) and posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) for every subject were each graded into 8 scores by the degree of visualizaiion of the arteries. Asymptomatic <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> were analyzed in subjects of fifties or more. They were scored as 0 - 2 based on their size and the scores were summed. Results: An age-related decline of visualization of the cerebral arteries was observed in ACA (r=- 0. 603 ，p< 0. 001) ， MCA (r=- 0. 452 ，p< 0. 001) and PCA (r=- 0. 537 ，p< 0. 001). Females during the fifth decade had a higher score of visualization of the arteries than males (p< 0. 01). No substantial relationship was observed between visualization of the arteries and sex in other decades，laterality or <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions.</b> Conclusion: The MRA using a 3 DFT-TOF pulse sequence with slab thickness of 115 mm disclosed an age-related decline of visualization of thc cerebral arteries and a sex-dependent difference of the visualization in the fifth decade probably due to the decline of the blood flow velocity with aging and a difference in it between females and males in the fifth decade，respectively. 医歯学総合研究科博士論文(医学); 学位取得日: 平成 7 年 12 月 25...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Genetic {{influences}} {{are important}} in multifactorial cerebral small-vessel disease (SVD) and may act via endothelial dysfunction. Nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a key mediator of endothelial function. We determined the role of 3 potentially functional eNOS polymorphisms (T- 786 C, intron 4 ab, G 894 T) located toward the 5 ' flanking end of the gene as risk factors for SVD and different SVD subtypes: isolated <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction</b> (n= 137) and ischemic leukoaraiosis (n= 160). METHODS: Three hundred patients with SVD and 600 community controls were studied. Genotypes were determined through polymerase chain reaction with or without restriction fragment digestion. Nitrate (NO(x)) levels were determined in a subgroup by use of a Griess method. Polymorphisms were tested individually and in combination with haplotype analysis. RESULTS: The intron 4 a variant was protective against SVD. This effect was confined to isolated <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction</b> (odds ratio, 0. 55; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 35 to 0. 86; P= 0. 01). Haplotypes encountered were significantly different in this subtype compared with controls (P= 0. 001), with the - 786 C promoter/intron 4 a combination particularly underrepresented.

The specific association with isolated symptomatic <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction</b> and not ischemic leukoaraiosis may reflect different etiopathogeneses of the 2 subtypes.

40|$|Background: CADASIL is {{responsible}} for diffuse hyperintensities in the white matter on FLAIR images. These lesions are often associated with focal lesions in the basal ganglia such as <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions.</b> The prevalence and significance of diffuse or confluent thalamic hyperintensities (CTH) remain unknown. Methods: The frequency of hyperintensities on FLAIR images in the thalamus was assessed in 147 CADASIL patients, and signal abnormalities on both FLAIR and T(1) -weighted images were categorized as focal/punctuate or diffuse/confluent by the same reader. The areas of increased diffusion were also analyzed on apparent diffusion coefficient maps. The association of CTH with vascular risk factors, the main clinical manifestations {{of the disease and}} MRI markers (brain parenchymal fraction, volume of white matter hyperintensities, volume of lacunar infarcts and number of microbleeds) was analyzed with generalized linear regression models. Results: CTH were detected in 12 % of the CADASIL subjects in association with hypointensities on T(1) -weighted images. CTH corresponded to areas of increased diffusion apparent diffusion coefficient maps. CTH were found significantly associated with age and independently related to the volume of white matter hyperintensities but not to that of <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> or to cerebral atrophy after adjustment for age and sex. No significant association was found between CTH and global cognitive performances. Conclusion: CTH are observed on FLAIR images in a sizeable proportion of CADASIL patients. They are mainly related to the extent of white matter hyperintensities and do not correlate with cognitive decline.

Recurrent strokes {{were more likely to}} be lacunar if the index event was lacunar. Few studies reported on the risk of MI, but we found no significant difference in risk of cardiac death in non-lacunar versus <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction.</b> Thus, although early mortality and stroke recurrence risks are higher among non-lacunar than lacunar infarct patients, the risks appear not to differ in the longer term and the risks of cardiac outcomes are similar, although data are limited. There is some evidence that recurrent ischaemic stroke subtypes breed true. These results provide limited support for a distinct arterial pathology underlying <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction...</b>|$|E
40|$|Electroencephalograms of 12 {{patients}} with a recent lacunar infarct, 12 {{patients with}} a recent cortical infarct and 12 control patients were studied without previous information about the clinical features and the corresponding CT scan findings. EEG assessment included both visual and computerised analysis, in both the eyes closed and the eyes open condition. The specificity and {{the sensitivity of the}} EEG in the diagnosis of <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction</b> in this study were both 0. 8 (95 % confidence limits 0. 5 - 1). The positive predictive value of diagnosing a lacunar infarct {{on the basis of the}} EEG was 0. 7 (95 % confidence limits 0. 4 - 0. 9). The chance-corrected coefficient of agreement (kappa) between CT scanning and EEG was 0. 75. Thus, in contrast to the results of previous studies, most EEGs of patients with recent <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction</b> show rather specific abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|In {{a cohort}} 760 {{consecutive}} stroke patients (23 {{hospitals in the}} Netherlands), we studied prognosis in relation to stroke type and focused on (a) short-term and long-term mortality, and (b) long-term functional health. Based on clinical and CT data, we distinguished infratentorial strokes from supratentorial strokes (<b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions,</b> (sub) cortical infarctions and intracerebral hemorrhages). Cumulative mortality for all stroke patients was 34 % at 6 months, 51 % at 3 years, and 62 % at 5 years. Short-term mortality {{could be explained by}} stroke type, whereas long-term mortality could not. Of all survivors, 55 % were in poor functional health at 6 months, 49 % at 3 years and 42 % at 5 years. Long-term functional health outcomes were associated with stroke type. We conclude that the impact of stroke type on mortality is limited to the first 6 months, whereas the type of stroke influences the long-term functional healt...|$|R
40|$|All stroke {{patients}} {{admitted to}} Banjaluka Clinical Centre during one year {{were evaluated by}} the standard protocol during the hospitalization and {{three months after the}} stroke. It included clinical, functional and neuropsychological examination and neuroimaging. Dementia was diagnosed according to the criteria of National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l’Enseignement en Neurosciences. Demographic and clinical variables were examined. After the exclusion of the patients who died (n= 139) and those who refused to be interviewed during the 3 -month follow up (n= 52) and those with pre-stroke dementia (n= 22), a total of 273 (58. 8 %) patients underwent neuropsychological examination 3 months after the stroke. Fortynine (19. 52 %) of them met the criteria for vascular dementia. The predictors of vascular dementia were age, atrial fibrillation, cognitive and functional impairment on admission and functional outcome, subcortical <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions,</b> leukoaraiosis, multiple and bilateral brain lesions. Dementia is frequent after stroke and it cannot be determined by a single factor. A combination of several factors increases the critical threshold for cognitive decline...|$|R
40|$|Notch {{signaling}} {{is essential}} for vascular physiology. Neomorphic heterozygous mutations in NOTCH 3, {{one of the four}} human NOTCH receptors, cause cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Hypomorphic heterozygous alleles have been occasionally described in association with a spectrum of cerebrovascular phenotypes overlapping CADASIL, but their pathogenic potential is unclear. We describe a patient with childhood-onset arteriopathy, cavitating leukoencephalopathy with cerebral white matter abnormalities presented as diffuse cavitations, multiple <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> and disseminated microbleeds. We identified a novel homozygous c. C 2898 A (p. C 966 *) null mutation in NOTCH 3 abolishing NOTCH 3 expression and causing NOTCH 3 signaling impairment. NOTCH 3 targets acting in the regulation of arterial tone (KCNA 5) or expressed in the vasculature (CDH 6) were downregulated. Patient's vessels were characterized by smooth muscle degeneration as in CADASIL, but without deposition of granular osmiophilic material (GOM), the CADASIL hallmark. The heterozygous parents displayed similar but less dramatic trends in decrease in the expression of NOTCH 3 and its targets, as well as in vessel degeneration. This study suggests a functional link between NOTCH 3 deficiency and pathogenesis of vascular leukoencephalopathies...|$|R
40|$|Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an {{important}} therapeutic strategy for patients with carotid artery stenosis. However, the potential influence of CAS on cognitive function in patients with carotid artery stenosis and cerebral <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction</b> has not been determined. This study investigated changes in cognitive function associated with CAS and the factors related to these changes. This prospective cohort study comprised 579 Chinese patients with cerebral <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction</b> and carotid artery stenosis for whom CAS was indicated, and a matched control group of 552 healthy individuals. Cognitive function before CAS and at scheduled intervals from 6 months to 3 years was assessed with instruments that included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. Potential factors that might affect cognitive function were analyzed via logistic regression. The MMSE and MoCA scores of the patients before CAS were significantly {{lower than that of}} the control subjects. These scores were significantly higher 6 months after CAS and sustained or increased throughout the 3 -year follow-up. Also significantly improved after CAS from baseline were scores for an alternating trail test, cube copying, clock-drawing, attention, and delayed recall in an auditory-verbal learning test. Logistic regression analyses showed that age greater than 65 y, little education, diabetes, and hypertension were independent risk factors for deteriorated MoCA scores 3 years after CAS. CAS was associated with significantly improved cognitive function in cerebral <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarction</b> patients with severe stenosis...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: The aim of {{the study}} is to search the lesion {{localization}} of the pure isolated facial paresis-dysarthria syndrome in patients who were admitted to our neurology clinic in a prospective study. Methods: Over a period of six years, the patients who had no prominent sensorimotor dysfunction were examined by neurologists and underwent computerized tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: Eleven patients out of more than 2000 had the aforementioned clinical picture. <b>Lacunar</b> <b>infarctions</b> were identified at the corona radiata in nine patients, and at the internal capsule in two patients. As reported previously, facial paresis was usually mild and temporary. Six of our eleven patients were seen at the outpatient clinic one month later. Four of them had completely recovered and the other two had mild dsyarthria without any facial paresis. The other five could not be reached after leaving the hospital. Conclusions: Dysarthria-facial paresis is a rare clinical entity and possibly a variation of dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome, and we suggest that pure facial paresis (FP) and pure dysarthria should be considered as very extreme examples of this syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Hypertension is {{commonly}} considered the {{major cause of}} <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions.</b> However, in some cases, {{it has been suggested}} that lacunes could be caused by cerebral emboli from cardiac or carotid sources. Cholesterol cerebral emboli have been rarely reported as a cause of lacunes. Case Description: We describe a 79 -year-old patient with a progressive multi-infarct dementia who developed transient motor aphasia and paresis of the right arm. Computed tomography showed lacunar infarcts in the right caudate nucleus, left thalamus, and left putamen, as well as an old right frontal infarction. Neuropathological examination demonstrated no prominent vascular hyalinosis, but did show multiple cholesterol emboli occluding small arteries around lacunar infarcts and leptomeningeal arteries near cortical infarcts. The cholesterol material presumably originated in the extended atheromatous changes along the aortic arch. Conclusions: Our report confirms that lacunes can be caused by cholesterol emboli in some patients. Small cerebral emboli should not be overlooked as a cause of lacunes. {Stroke 1991 ^ 2 : 1440 - 1444) Small-vessel occlusive disease related to athero-sclerosis or hyalinosis caused by hypertensionhas been commonly considered as the majo...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter {{changes such as}} periventricular hyperin-tensity (PVH) {{and deep}} white matter hyperintensity (DWMH) are {{associated}} with both peri-ventricular edema and ischemic white matter degeneration. Their diagnostic and predictive value in normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is unclear. To identify prognostically important changes, we classified PVH and DWMH at MR imaging in a large series of patients with NPH, before and after ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery. METHODS: Axial proton density – and T 2 -weighted turbo spin-echo sequences and coronal T 1 -weighted sequences were performed on a 0. 5 -T imager in 34 patients with NPH, before and 3 months after shunt surgery. PVH at the anterior, central, and posterior thirds of the lateral ventricles was assessed on transaxial images with a semiquantitative five-step scale describing the extension (in mm) {{and shape of the}} PVH. DWMH was quantified with a four-step scale. The number of cortical and subcortical <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarctions,</b> the flow void sign, and the width of the third and lateral ventricles were registered. Gait ability, need for sleep, urinary incon-tinence, living conditions, and psychometric test performance were assessed pre- and postoperatively...|$|R
