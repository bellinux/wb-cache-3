25|$|To my {{knowledge}} {{there is only}} one top-flight professional gay footballer who came out – Justin Fashanu. He ended up committing suicide. I have been advising a top premiership star who is bisexual. If it came out that he had gay tendencies, his career would be over in two minutes. Should it be? No, but if you go on the terraces and hear the way fans are, and also, that kind of general attitude that goes with football, it's almost <b>like</b> <b>going</b> back to the dark ages.|$|E

The period was topped off with the team winning the FA Cup for the third time in the club's history in 1935. When World War Two began, the club entered non-competitive war leagues, returning to the status quo in 1946.|$|E

Harrison presented the song after it was decided to exclude his composition [...] "Only a Northern Song", which the Beatles recorded in February 1967.

The one film he genuinely studied was John Ford's Stagecoach, which he watched 40 times. [...] "As it turned out, {{the first day}} I ever walked onto a set was my first day as a director," [...] Welles said. [...] "I'd learned whatever I knew in the projection room—from Ford.
