500|$|When the {{cofferdams}} were {{in place}} and the construction site was drained of water, excavation for the dam foundation began. For the dam to rest on solid rock, {{it was necessary to}} remove accumulated erosion soils and other <b>loose</b> <b>materials</b> in the riverbed until sound bedrock was reached. Work on the foundation excavations was completed in June 1933. During this excavation, approximately [...] of material was removed. Since the dam was an arch-gravity type, the side-walls of the canyon would bear the force of the impounded lake. Therefore, the side-walls were excavated too, to reach virgin rock as weathered rock might provide pathways for water seepage.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{initially}} {{believed that the}} top of the viaduct was composed of solid granite blocks (originally carrying a single track). [...] After the track and ballast were removed from the structure, troughs were discovered recessed into the granite capstones. [...] The 18" [...] deep troughs ran {{the entire length of the}} viaduct and were spaced approximately 56" [...] apart (standard railroad gauge). [...] In some locations, the trough contained a solid piece of oak, including some abandoned spikes. [...] It is believed the troughs held wooden sleepers for the original single track railroad. [...] These <b>loose</b> <b>materials</b> were removed from the deck, and lean concrete was placed to fill the voids. [...] Archival photographs of the sleepers were taken and their remnants will be turned over to the local historical commission. [...] At the approaches to the viaduct, a series of granite walls were uncovered running perpendicular to the tracks. [...] These walls were approximately 7' on center, and it was thought that they might have carried a timber approach structure. [...] The locations of the walls conflicted with new abutments for the PPC beams, and they made it difficult to install sheet piling for the contractor's support of excavation system. [...] The walls were left in place undisturbed beneath the new track structure. [...] HDR, Inc. redesigned the abutments to minimize their depths, eliminate the conflicts and reduce the loading of the temporary support of excavation system.|$|E

50|$|The {{next phase}} of the {{formation}} of the Marbles started when the blocks were exposed to water.

60|$|We {{must first}} {{have a clear}} idea of what is meant by an arch. It is a curved shell of firm {{materials}}, on whose back a burden is to be laid of <b>loose</b> <b>materials.</b> So far as the materials above it are not loose, but themselves hold together, the opening below is not an arch, but an excavation. Note this difference very carefully. If the King of Sardinia tunnels through the Mont Cenis, as he proposes, he will not require to build a brick arch under his tunnel to carry the weight of the Mont Cenis: that would need scientific masonry indeed. The Mont Cenis will carry itself, by its own cohesion, and a succession of invisible granite arches, rather larger than the tunnel. But when Mr. Brunel tunnelled the Thames bottom, he needed to build a brick arch to carry the six or seven feet of mud and the weight of water above. That is a type of all arches proper.|$|E
60|$|This {{preliminary}} step taken towards {{covering the}} face of the mount with verdure, our mariners went to work to lay out their garden, regularly, within the crater. Mark manifested a good deal of ingenuity in this matter. With occasional exceptions the surface of the plain, or the bottom of the crater, was an even crust of no great thickness, compared of concrete ashes, scoriæ &c., but which might have borne the weight of a loaded wagon. This crust once broken, which it was not very difficult to do by means of pick and crows, the materials beneath were found loose enough for the purposes of agriculture, almost without using the spade. Now, space being abundant, Mark drew lines, in fanciful and winding paths, leaving the crust for his walks, and only breaking into the <b>loose</b> <b>materials</b> beneath, wherever he wished to form a bed. This variety served to amuse him and Betts, and they worked with so much the greater zeal, as their labours produced objects that were agreeable to the eye, and which amused them now, while they promised to benefit them hereafter. As each bed, whether oval, winding or straight, was dug, the loam and sea-weed was mixed up in it, in great abundance, after which it was sown, or planted.|$|E

50|$|A debris cone is {{commonly}} made when rock from a high-up narrow slit or gorge {{falls into a}} ﬂat-ﬂoored valley. Here the soil and <b>loose</b> <b>materials</b> are deposited, leaving a mound of conical shape. While an alluvial fan is formed when ﬂowing water rushes rock and soil down a slope, debris cones come from one of several dry processes known as mass wasting. That is gravity pulling <b>loose</b> <b>materials</b> downslope. Such mounds can reach sizes large enough to obstruct river channels. Similar deposits {{can also be found}} lying on boulders moved by a landslide, or on a glacier, where a cone-shaped mound of ice or snow may be covered with a veneer of debris thick enough to prevent the underlying ice from melting. A debris cone is also called a dirt cone or cone of detritus.|$|E
