5|$|Feldman, had microfracture surgery {{performed}} {{on his right}} knee during the off-season. To rehab, he made two appearances for the Double-A Frisco Roughriders and eight appearances for the Triple-A Round Rock Express. On July 8, he was transferred from the 15-day disabled <b>list</b> <b>to</b> the 60-day disabled list. He was outrighted to the minors on July 13. However, on July 14, after he cleared waivers, Feldman rejected the assignment giving the Rangers the option of activating him from the disabled list or releasing him. They opted to activate him off the disabled list, which re-added him to the 40-man roster.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} further enhance the appeal of its new {{flagship}} product, in 1993 the firm established a Communication Services division, designed {{to tap into the}} commercial market. The firm started making deals with major telecommunication companies, such as BellSouth and MCI Inc. in preparation for the services the firm was about to offer. In November of that year the division launched its Fax Broadcast service. The Fax Broadcast service allowed subscribers to upload a single fax and a recipient <b>list</b> <b>to</b> Delrina. Systems at Delrina would then send out the fax to the recipients on that <b>list,</b> <b>to</b> a maximum of 500 fax numbers. A subsequent Fax Mailbox feature—which enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number—was initially held up following a dispute with AlphaNet Telecom for the rights to the technology. This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil <b>list</b> <b>to</b> help balance the budget. He was concerned by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril of the world, and that there was bound to be a war within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to be suspicious of the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 3 February, about 600 miles northeast of Iceland, U-255 fired a salvo of torpedoes at Convoy RA-52, en route from Murmansk to New York, and hit the 7,460 ton American merchant ship Greylock. The ship attempted to evade the attack, but was holed below the waterline, immediately flooded, and began to <b>list</b> <b>to</b> starboard. Within fifteen minutes the crew of 61 and nine passengers abandoned ship in four lifeboats. A British escort then shelled and sank the crippled ship. U-255 then arrived back at Narvik on 9 February.|$|E
5|$|The Italian fleet was reorganized on 9 December, and Pola {{joined her}} three sister {{ships in the}} 3rd Division of the 1st Squadron, which was now {{commanded}} by Admiral Angelo Iachino. On 14 December, a British air raid on Naples slightly damaged Pola. Two bombs hit the ship, both amidships on the port side. The hits damaged three of the ship's boilers and caused significant flooding and a significant <b>list</b> <b>to</b> port. Pola was drydocked on 16 December for repair work that lasted until 7 February 1941. She returned to Taranto on 13 February, and she joined Zara and Fiume for extensive maneuvers off Taranto on 1117 March. A nighttime training operation followed on 2324 March.|$|E

5|$|A {{home run}} {{is a hit}} in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the <b>list</b> <b>to</b> do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1940, Gens was fired from his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to continue to live in Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in Vilnius, and although Gens was on a <b>list</b> <b>to</b> be sent to Soviet labor camps, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Ūsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital {{did not need to be}} informed of his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.|$|E
5|$|During {{his absence}} from the Test team, the Australian {{selectors}} had been unsuccessful {{in their attempts to}} find a reliable partner for Arthur Morris to open the batting. Barnes started the season solidly and, in the last match before the team for the third Test against the West Indies was chosen, he hit 107 against Victoria. The selectors duly picked him for the match, then passed the team <b>list</b> <b>to</b> the Board of Control for ratification. The Board vetoed the inclusion of Barnes and requested the nomination of a replacement player. Unwilling to accept the blame for Barnes's omission, the selectors deliberately deferred their decision on the replacement. When the team was not announced at the scheduled time, journalists uncovered the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all of the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass; insulting the Royal Family; theft from team-mates; drunkenness; and stealing a car.|$|E
