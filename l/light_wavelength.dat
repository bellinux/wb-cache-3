25|$|Swallowtail (Papilio) {{butterflies}} have {{complex systems}} for emitting fluorescent light. Their wings contain pigment-infused crystals that provide directed fluorescent light. These crystals function to produce fluorescent light {{best when they}} absorb radiance from sky-blue <b>light</b> (<b>wavelength</b> about 420nm). The wavelengths of light that the butterflies see the best correspond to the absorbance of the crystals in the butterfly's wings. This likely functions to enhance the capacity for signaling.|$|E

Their high dark resistance, reaching tens GOhm, provides a high dynamic range {{with respect to the}} light intensity and low signal distortions. However, their reaction time to a change in the light intensity is long, about 140 ms at 25°C.|$|E

2500|$|Interface and colloid science {{had existed}} {{for nearly a}} century before they became {{associated}} with nanotechnology. [...] The first observations and size measurements of nanoparticles had been made during {{the first decade of the}} 20th century by Richard Adolf Zsigmondy, winner of the 1925 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, who made a detailed study of gold sols and other nanomaterials with sizes down to 10nm using an ultramicroscope which was capable of visualizing particles much smaller than the <b>light</b> <b>wavelength.</b> [...] Zsigmondy was also the first to use the term [...] "nanometer" [...] explicitly for characterizing particle size. [...] In the 1920s, Irving Langmuir, winner of the 1932 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and Katharine B. Blodgett introduced the concept of a monolayer, a layer of material one molecule thick. [...] In the early 1950s, Derjaguin and Abrikosova conducted the first measurement of surface forces.|$|E
2500|$|A full-wave plate {{introduces}} a phase difference of exactly one wavelength {{between the two}} polarization directions, for one wavelength of light. In optical mineralogy, {{it is common to}} use a full-wave plate designed for green <b>light</b> (<b>wavelength</b> = 540nbsp&nm). Linearly polarized white light which passes through the plate becomes elliptically polarized, except for 540nbsp&nm light which will remain linear. If a linear polarizer oriented perpendicular to the original polarization is added, this green wavelength is fully extinguished but elements of the other colors remain. This means that under these conditions the plate will appear an intense shade of red-violet, sometimes known as [...] "sensitive tint". This gives rise to this plate's alternative names, the sensitive-tint plate or (less commonly) red-tint plate. These plates are widely used in mineralogy to aid in identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks.|$|E

For growth under a canopy, where blue light is diminished, CRY 1 and CRY 2 perceive this change and respond by directly contacting two bHLH transcription factors, PIF 4 and PIF 5. These factors are also known to be controlled by phytochromes, the red/far-red photoreceptors; however, transcriptome analyses indicate that the gene regulatory programs induced by the different <b>light</b> <b>wavelengths</b> are distinct. Our results indicate that CRYs signal by modulating PIF activity genome wide and that these factors integrate binding of different plant photoreceptors to facilitate growth changes under different light conditions...|$|R
