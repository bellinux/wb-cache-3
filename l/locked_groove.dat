5000|$|One of {{the best-known}} {{examples}} of this technique was The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Many UK copies featured a multi-layered collage of randomized chatter in their run-off loops. However, two variations were made: the original British pressing (black label with gold logo) has the [...] "inner groove" [...] play through the entire <b>locked</b> <b>groove</b> and {{does not include the}} laughter {{at the beginning of the}} piece. The re-issue of the British pressing (black label with silver logo) starts playing the [...] "inner groove" [...] long before the needle reaches the <b>locked</b> <b>groove,</b> includes the laughter and, once the needle hits the <b>locked</b> <b>groove,</b> the listener only hears the last two seconds of the piece played over and over again. The Who responded by putting a musical <b>locked</b> <b>groove</b> at the end of their 1967 album The Who Sell Out.|$|E
50|$|Most {{records have}} a <b>locked</b> <b>groove</b> {{at the end}} of each side or {{individual}} band.

50|$|An anti-record is {{a musical}} vinyl record {{which has been}} treated (melted, drilled, painted, etc.) so that it becomes a noise record. While this term was first used by Laylah Records on {{conventional}} vinyl releases by Current 93, Nurse With Wound and others, Ron Lessard of RRRecords applied the term {{to a series of}} physically altered records released by RRR in 1988. Anti-records can also be records featuring strange configurations or pressing, such as extra or unusually sized holes, <b>locked</b> <b>grooves,</b> and parallel grooves. One notable noise anti-record was Pagan Muzak, created by noise artist Boyd Rice, which contained <b>locked</b> <b>grooves</b> as well as multiple center holes. RRRecords also published a record containing 500 <b>locked</b> <b>grooves</b> by various artists.|$|R

50|$|Towards the center, {{at the end}} of the groove, {{there is}} another wide-pitched section known as the lead-out. At the very end of this section the groove joins itself to form a {{complete}} circle, called the lock groove; when the stylus reaches this point, it circles repeatedly until lifted from the record. On some recordings (for example Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles, Super Trouper by ABBA and Atom Heart Mother by Pink Floyd), the sound continues on the <b>lock</b> <b>groove,</b> which gives a strange repeating effect. Automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of the arm, as it reaches the wider spacing in the groove, to trigger a mechanism that lifts the arm off the record. Precisely because of this mechanism, most automatic turntables are incapable of playing any audio in the <b>lock</b> <b>groove,</b> since they will lift the arm before it reaches that groove.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the designs}} of other early {{semi-automatic}} pistols, Browning's design used a full length slide that covered {{the full length of}} the barrel, as opposed to other designs which utilized a barrel and bolt that slid in grooves machined in the frame. In the Browning design, the slide fitted into rails in the frame, and was integral with the bolt. The barrel rode in <b>locking</b> <b>grooves</b> machined into the interior of the slide, but attached to swinging links secured to the frame, one at the front and one at the rear. When the slide is forward (i.e., in battery), the length of the links holds the barrel up, locking it securely into matching grooves in the slide. Upon recoiling, the barrel and slide move backwards a short distance, locked together, until the arc of the links pulls the barrel downwards, disengaging it from the slide and halting its rearward motion. The barrel then stops moving, while the slide continues rearwards, extracting and ejecting the fired cartridge case and then returns forward, loading a fresh cartridge from the magazine. The barrel is caught, and moved forward with the slide, the camming action of the links lifting it again to lock into the matching grooves. This is identical to the modern style of short recoil action as developed for the later M1911, with the exception of employing both front and rear links, which causes the whole barrel to remain parallel to the slide as it drops out of the <b>locking</b> <b>grooves.</b> The M1911, and most other pistols since, found that it was only necessary to use a single rear link and <b>locking</b> <b>grooves</b> in the rear. When the slide retracts, only the rear of the barrel is dropped, causing it to tilt relative to the slide, while a fixed barrel bushing holds the front of the barrel in place when the slide is in battery, yet allows for movement of the slide and barrel. This approach was found to work perfectly well, and saved in complexity, cost of manufacture, as well as simplicity of assembly and disassembly.|$|R
