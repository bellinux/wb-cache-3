It is {{shown that the}} lateral displacement <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> has been distinctly effected by the sloping of foundation, the value of lateral displacement on sloping foundation is greatly bigger than that of horizontal foundation. The peak value of lateral displacement can be effectively reduced by geotextile.

The development of plastic zone <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> has been impeded and separated by geotextile, which enhanced the stability <b>of</b> <b>embankment.</b> The results also indicated that, if necessary, reinforcement such as anti-slide pile should be layout at lower toe <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> on sloping weak foundation...|$|R
