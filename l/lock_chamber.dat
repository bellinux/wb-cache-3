5|$|Work {{began on}} the canal in 1763. When water was let into {{the first section of}} the canal in 1764 the side walls of a <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> collapsed. Zacharie had to borrow money to continue. In 1766, to satisfy his creditors, he prematurely opened the canal. The water broke the banks and the {{participants}} in the ceremony had to scramble to escape. Work was halted with the canal reaching only to Saint-Romain-en-Gier. In 1768, Zacharie died penniless of a heart attack.|$|E
25|$|Water usage is {{calculated}} per single lock cycle. It {{is determined by}} the water volume in a <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> between the levels it handles. Essentially, each cycle uses the volume of water discharged by the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> (its width multiplied by its height and depth). When the locks are in stairs, as in the Panama Canal, only the first (highest) <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> matters for this calculation. None of the lower locks use additional water; they have the same volume. Moreover, the ship's underwater volume does not matter, because that volume is present {{both before and after the}} change in water level and thus is part of the non-moved volume.|$|E

25|$|The 1828 design {{originally}} {{filled the}} <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> {{through the use}} of culverts in the lock masonry. The wicket, i.e. large paddle valve, hidden in the masonry recess where the upper gate fit in, would be opened, and water would flow through the lock masonry to three openings in the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber.</b> Both sides of the lock had these, so there would be a total of 2 wickets, and 6 openings. The upper gate is above the breast wall. Most of the wicket openings in the upper gate recess have been closed with masonry, but one wicket at Violettes Lock is still intact as of 2013 (see photo). Note that modern replacement gates in locks 1-23, have the wickets in the gates, since the original wickets in the lock masonry are inoperable. This system of routing water through the masonry was abandoned due the tendency for debris to clog the opening.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} where locks {{have been built}} to a round plan, with more than two exits from the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber,</b> each serving a different water level. Thus the lock serves both {{as a way of}} changing levels and as a junction. The circular plan of the lock allows boats within it to rotate to line up with the appropriate exit gate.|$|E
25|$|The 1830 design {{eliminated}} {{the use of}} culverts in the masonry, and the upper gate is below the breast wall.

25|$|Keddington, {{where much}} of the parish church dates from the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, was the site of Keddington Church Lock, {{although}} little of it remains. Ticklepenny Lock is better preserved, with four concave sections separated by timber posts. The third section is partially hidden by a twentieth century concrete bridge, which carries a minor road over the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber.</b> Nearby are the Grade I listed ruins of Louth Abbey, a Cistercian abbey dating from 1139. Willows Lock is also reasonably well preserved, and is of a similar construction to Ticklepenny Lock, as is Salter Fen Lock, although it differs in having a large opening which acts as an overflow in the south-eastern side.|$|E
25|$|A turf-sided lock is {{an early}} form of canal lock design that uses earth banks to form the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber,</b> {{subsequently}} attracting grasses and other vegetation, instead of the now more familiar and widespread brick, stone, or concrete lock wall constructions. This early lock design was most often used on river navigations in the early 18th century {{before the advent of}} canals in Britain. The sides of the turf-lock are sloping so, when full, the lock is quite wide. Consequently, this type of lock needs more water to operate than vertical-sided brick- or stone-walled locks. On British canals and waterways most turf-sided locks have been subsequently rebuilt in brick or stone, and so only a few good examples survive, such as at Garston Lock, and Monkey Marsh Lock, on the Kennet and Avon Canal.|$|E

25|$|As a {{signatory}} to the United Nations Global Compact {{and member}} of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the ACP has developed an environmentally and socially sustainable program for expansion, which will protect the aquatic and terrestrial resources of the canal watershed. After completion, expansion will guarantee the availability and quality of water resources by using water-saving basins at each new lock. These water-saving basins will diminish water loss and preserve freshwater resources along the waterway by reusing water from the basins into the locks. Each <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> will have three water-saving basins, which will reuse 60% of the water in each transit. There are a total of nine basins for each of the two lock complexes, and a total of 18 basins for the entire project.|$|E
25|$|Guillotine gates. Some locks have {{vertically}} moving steel gates – {{these are}} quite common on river navigations in East Anglia. Sometimes {{just one of}} the pairs of swinging gates is replaced by a guillotine: for instance at Salterhebble Locks, where space to swing the balance beams of bottom gates of the lowest lock was restricted by bridge widening. On the River Nene most locks have this arrangement as in time of flood the top mitre gates are chained open and the bottom guillotines lifted so that the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> acts as an overflow sluice. Guillotine gates are also used on the downstream side of larger locks such as the 23m Bollène lock on the River Rhône, the aperture being large enough for a boat to travel under it.|$|E
25|$|The caisson lock can however be powered, and the caisson lifted, by {{buoyancy}} alone. Pumping {{ballast water}} {{in and out}} of the caisson is enough to float it up or down the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber.</b> The weight of ballast water is approximately that of the canal barge being lifted. The boat lift though needs a mechanical lift system. In most vertical lift systems, this must also lift or lower the weight of the caisson and its water contents as well. This is substantially more than the barge alone, and the power to lift it is supplied mechanically. At the time of their development, the steam engine was in its infancy. Steam engines had been developed as water pumps, but not yet for the supply of mechanical power (see rotative steam engine). Given the engineering constraints of the time, lifting an enclosed caisson by buoyancy was more practical than driving a boat lift.|$|E
50|$|A {{very short}} section of Dick Brook was canalized about 1717 to enable small boats to travel up stream from the River Severn to Astley Forge. Two flash locks were {{constructed}} {{and the date}} 1717 is visible {{on one of these}} <b>lock</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R

500|$|Before 1626 the River Don had two outlets, {{an eastern}} branch that meandered across Hatfield Chase {{to enter the}} River Trent, and a {{northern}} branch, which was a Roman navigation channel, and joined the River Aire at Turnbridge, near East Cowick. Cornelius Vermuyden's drainage scheme for Hatfield Chase, begun in 1626 and largely completed by 1628, included the construction of Ashfield Bank, which ran for [...] along the southern bank of the Don from Fishlake to Thorne, cutting off the eastern branch. Navigation to Sandtoft {{was made possible by}} the provision of a navigable sluice in the bank, which had lifting gates and a [...] <b>lock</b> <b>chamber.</b> A further bank some distance to the east of the northern channel ran for [...] from Thorne to Turnbridge to provide washlands, which would flood when high levels in the Aire prevented the Don discharging into it.|$|E
500|$|After Portland was {{incorporated}} in 1851, quickly growing into Oregon's largest city, Oregon City gradually lost its importance {{as the economic}} and political center of the Willamette Valley. Beginning in the 1850s, steamboats began to ply the Willamette, {{despite the fact that they}} could not pass Willamette Falls. As a result, navigation on the Willamette River was divided into two stretches: the [...] lower stretch from Portland to Oregon City—which allowed connection with the rest of the Columbia River system—and the upper reach, which encompassed most of the Willamette's length. Any boats whose owners found it absolutely necessary to get past the falls had to be portaged. This led to competition for business among steam portage companies. In 1873, the construction of the Willamette Falls Locks bypassed the falls and allowed easy navigation between the upper and lower river. Each <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> measured [...] long and [...] wide, and the canal was originally operated manually before it switched to electrical power. Today, the lock system is little used.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there are}} no known records {{from the time the}} canal was constructed, the lock at Hudd's Mill was {{documented}} by Thomas Surbey in 1699. Surbey was a water engineer, and made notes and drawings when he visited it, during a journey from London to York. The <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> was [...] long and [...] wide. The gates were hung on stone piers, but the banks between them were of earth. The gates were conventional 'V' gates, similar to modern ones, which included some sort of paddle, but did not include balance beams. Instead, a chain or rope was attached to the mid-stream edge of the gate and to the bank. While this would have made opening the gates possible, it is not obvious how they were shut. The measurements match those of the surviving structures, with the exception of Briggin's lock, which appears to only be [...] long. There is no visible evidence that it was shortened at some point, nor any obvious reason why it would have been built shorter than all the others.|$|E
