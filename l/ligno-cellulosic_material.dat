The biofuel produced from <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>material</b> exhibits energetic, economic and environmental benefits in contrast to bio-ethanol from starch or sugar. Until now, physical and chemical difficulty caused by the close connection of {{the main components of}} lignocellulosic bio-mass, discourage the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose to fermentable sugars. The main purpose of pretreatment is to enhance the enzyme accessibility improving digestibility of cellulose. Every pretreatment has a particular effect on the fraction of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, thus different pretreatment methods and conditions should be selected for the development of subsequent hydrolysis and fermentation steps.

The field-grown material showed variations in plant height from 54 to 122 cm and in grain yield from 2 to 6. 61 t ha- 1. The release of monomeric sugars was determined by high-throughput enzymatic treatment of <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>material</b> and varied between 0. 169 and 0. 312 g/g dm for glucose and 0. 146 and 0. 283 g/g dm for xylose. As expected, plant height and grain yield showed to be highly influenced by genetic factors with repeatability (R) equal to 0. 75 and 0. 53 respectively, while this was reduced for glucose and xylose (R= 0. 09 for both). The study of trait correlations showed how old, low-yielding, tall varieties released higher amounts of monomeric sugars after straw enzymatic hydrolysis, showing reduced recalcitrance to bioconversion compared to modern varieties. 93 lines from the collection were genotyped with the DArTseq® genotypic platform and 5525 markers were used for genome-wide association mapping.

Among the different biomass crops for <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>materials,</b> {{one of the most interesting}} is giant reed (Arundo donax L.), because it is tolerant to a wide range of environmental stresses so that it can be cultivated on marginal, degraded or contaminated lands thus reducing competition with food crops which generally require a better quality arable land (Di Nasso et al.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the last}} years, the biotechnological {{production}} of platform chemicals for fuel components {{has become a}} major focus of interest. Although <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>material</b> is considered as suitable feedstock, the almost inevitable pretreatment of this recalcitrant material may interfere with the subsequent fermentation steps. In this study, the fungus Ustilago maydis was used to produce itaconic acid as platform chemical for the synthesis of potential biofuels such as 3 -methyltetrahydrofuran. No studies, however, have investigated how pretreatment of ligno-cellulosic biomass precisely influences the subsequent fermentation by U. maydis. Thus, this current study aims to first characterize U. maydis in shake flasks and then to evaluate the influence of three exemplary pretreatment methods on the cultivation and itaconic acid production of this fungus. Cellulose enzymatically hydrolysed in seawater and salt-assisted organic-acid catalysed cellulose were investigated as substrates. Lastly, hydrolysed hemicellulose from fractionated beech wood was applied as substrate. Results U. maydis was characterized on shake flask level regarding its itaconic acid production on glucose. Nitrogen limitation was shown to be a crucial condition for the production of itaconic acid. For itaconic acid concentrations above 25 g/L, a significant product inhibition was observed. Performing experiments that simulated influences of possible pretreatment methods, U. maydis was only slightly affected by high osmolarities up to 3. 5 osmol/L as well as of 0. 1 M oxalic acid. The production of itaconic acid was achieved on pretreated cellulose in seawater and on the hydrolysed hemicellulosic fraction of pretreated beech wood. Conclusion The fungus U. maydis is a promising producer of itaconic acid, since it grows as single cells (yeast-like) in submerged cultivations and it is extremely robust in high osmotic media and real seawater. Moreover, U. maydis can grow on the hemicellulosic fraction of pretreated beech wood. Thereby, this fungus combines important advantages of yeasts and filamentous fungi. Nevertheless, the biomass pretreatment does indeed affect the subsequent itaconic acid production. Although U. maydis is insusceptible to most possible impurities from pretreatment, high amounts of salts or residues of organic acids can slow microbial growth and decrease the production. Consequently, the pretreatment step needs to fit the prerequisites defined by the actual microorganisms applied for fermentation. </p...|$|E
30|$|High {{interest}} of energy performance [4 – 6] and fire resistance [7] of wooden structure buildings led to {{measurements of the}} thermal conductive properties of wood in past decades. Due to past research interest, most of the measurements of the thermal conductive properties on wood were made at high temperatures. Thermal conductive properties can be categorized into three groups: thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and specific heat capacity [6, 8], which {{are the most important}} parameters for simulating the thermal behavior of wood [5]. The thermal conductive properties of wood are dependent on a number of factors. Some of the most important factors are density, porosity and anisotropy [9, 10]. There is general agreement that the thermal conductive properties of wood are mainly dependent upon the cell components which are aggregated into tissue-independent phases [11, 12]. Eventually, more cell components exist as the density of wood increases. The thermal conductivity of the cell components in wood has been described in detail by many other researchers. The major cell components of wood are cellulose and hemicellulose, which usually account for 65 – 75  % of the wood dry weight and 18 – 35  % of the lignin [13], and they are generally more thermally conductive than air [14 – 16]. Meanwhile, porosity is another obstacle to the thermal conduction of wood, due to the low thermal conductivity property of air, which fills the cellular substance with voids before the fiber saturation points. The anisotropy of the structure, a key characteristic of wood, and physical properties have been extensively discussed under low thermal properties by several researchers. Wood is a <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>material</b> mainly comprising long-chain linear polymers (cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin), minor amounts of extractives and inorganic compounds [13]. These components are combined and mainly aligned with the longitudinal axis of the cell. Given the anisotropic nature of wood, thermal conductivity is approximately 2 – 3 times higher in the longitudinal direction than in the transversal [17 – 19], but it is not significantly different between the radial and tangential directions [5, 20]. All three parameters are strongly influenced above the fiber saturation point (FSP) and can vary by as much as 100  % depending on the moisture content [21]; however, the moisture content of timber in service is well below the FSP. Therefore, it does not correspond with the pronounced change in the thermal conductive properties of wood because the thermal conductivities of water vapor and air are very similar [11].|$|E

After processing the panel Raman spectra with the help of PCA and cluster analysis, three distinctive clusters were obtained, discriminating wood, leather, and mixed regions. With the assigned spectral information, it was possible to create a spectral image of the surface...|$|R

Among the main conversion routes, i. e. biological and thermochemical, the latter presents {{the advantage of being}} in the continuation of traditional process engineering, thus more inclined to be rapidly industrialized. Here, we investigate two key points of the process consisting in the transformation of solid wood into suitably sized particles, their transport and injection into an entrained flow gasifier and the Fischer-Tropsch conversion of the resulting syngas in liquid fuel. Because of the very large elasticity of <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>materials,</b> the size reduction by grinding requires too much energy to be economically competitive. In order to increase the wood fragility, and thus decrease the energy consumption, the biomass is preliminarily torrefied (i. e. heated up to 300 °C under inert atmosphere). In this section, we present new results correlating the required specific energy, the size of the grid holes used in the knife-mill, the torrefaction intensity and the resulting particle size. For two types of wood (beech for hard wood and spruce for softwood), it is evidenced that the grinding energy decreases exponentially when the particle size increases. Both the prefactor and the characteristic length linearly decrease when the torrefaction becomes more severe. The anisotropic microstructure of <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>materials</b> is the cause of the elongated particles morphology. The poor flowability associated with this particle shape makes the pneumatic transport and injection problematic, which is clearly an obstacle to the industrialization of the process. Indeed, to avoid jamming, larger flow rates of inert gas must be used to convey the particles, with an increasing cost of gas separation at later stages. Here, we present new experimental results showing how flowability is modified by the particles size and shape, which in turn depend on the wood species and the torrefaction intensity. Due to its complex nature, the flowability is characterized in three configurations. The jammed-unjammed threshold is evaluated by shear tests performed on a packed bed. The dense quasistatic flowability is evaluated using a powder rheometer that measures the energy required by a rotating blade to circulate through the bed. The fluidization ability is evaluated at two different scales: in the powder rheometer in presence of an upwards air flow and in a standard fluidization column. Results show that the flowability of torrefied wood particles is very poor and very dependent on the wood species (hardwood or softwood). Due to particles interlocking, the bed is highly porous. This is evidenced by the pressure drop which is about 4 times smaller than expected by the Wu & Yen correlation for compact particles of same size. Also, this interlocking is the cause of an apparent cohesivity, which manifests itself by a channeling tendency and a minimum fluidization velocity about 5 to 10 times larger than expected by the Wu & Yen correlation. The significant difference between spruce and beech flowability is attributed to the particles morphology...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{a lot of}} {{researches}} {{have done}} by domestic and foreign scholars to enhance and improve the development of man-made board production that based on natural fiber and agricultural residues. Due to a worldwide shortage of forest resources which have been excessive cutting, man-made board production {{has become one of}} the alternative ways to solve wood supply problems. Particle board is a panel product manufactured under pressure from particles of wood or other <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>materials</b> and an adhesive. In Malaysia, the demand and trend of uses wood panel product such as particle board is increasing in the market. The purpose of this study is to identify the potential use of cassava root as a raw material for bio-composite development. In this research, cassava root from different ages (6, 9 and 12 months) were used for production of bonded particle boards by using polyester as a binder. Constant resin content, temperature, time pressing and pressure were applied during boards’ production. Moisture content, density, water absorption and thickness swelling test were carried out to determine dimensional stability of the boards while static bending tests were carried out to assess the mechanical strength of the boards. Particleboard from 12 month cassava root gave the best results in term of physical and mechanical properties. But, particleboard from 12 month cassava root did not meet the ANSI/A 208. 1 - 1999 standard for general-purpose boards. For this reason, additional research needs to be done on improving the physical and mechanical properties produced from different ages of the cassava root...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFossil fuels (oil, {{natural gas}} and coal) {{presently}} represent about 90 % of the world’s total commercial primary energy demand. Yet, they are depletable sources of energy. Growth {{in the production of}} easily accessible oil, the main source of high energy liquid transportation fuels, will not match the projected rate of demand growth, especially in developing countries. In the transport sector, today, the only alternative to non-sustainable fossil fuels is biofuels that are produced from biomass, a stored environmentally neutral solar energy. These fuels are compatible with current vehicles and blendable with conventional fuels. Moreover, they share the long-established distribution infrastructure with little, if any, modification of equipment. The main biofuels presently in commercial production are bioethanol and biodiesel. Industrial countries started production of the 1 st generation bioethanol and biodiesel from food products (grains and edible oil) since a few decades and these fuels are currently available at petrol stations. Second generation bioethanol from <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>materials</b> is on the research, pilot and/or demonstration stage. This paper discusses the current situation regarding liquid fuels in Egypt which are experiencing imbalance between total production and demand for gasoline and diesel fuels. The quantified need for nonconventional sources is presented. Based on a thorough assessment of current and prospective generated agriculture residues as distributed over the political areas, mapping of the number and capacity of plants to be installed for production of bioethanol from available residues namely rice straw, sugar cane residues and cotton stalks has been developed. Annual capacities of 3000, 10, 000 and 20, 000 tons ethanol/year until year 2021 have been proposed. Capital and operating requirements and economic indicators have been estimated. It has been concluded that at current price of ethanol of about $ 0. 6 /kg, the simple rate of return on investments is about 2. 8 %, 11 % and 16 % for the 3000, 10, 000 and 20, 000 tons annual capacity ethanol respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{forestry}} {{sector in}} New Zealand {{ranks as the}} third largest export earner. The individual industries within the forestry sector have, in some cases, grown up {{on the basis of}} institutionalised knowledge, sometimes without a full understanding of the underlying fundamental physico-chemical relationships and the changes that occur during wood material processing. At the same time the commercial pressures of operating within the forestry sector have resulted in demand for more uniform, high quality, fit-for-purpose product, faster throughput and less downgrade from what is becoming a lower quality feedstock as harvest ages decline. In the 21 st century, the forestry sector is being transformed into an "engineered <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>materials</b> processor" and this in turn is requiring a more sophisticated knowledge of the material feedstock and the processes involved in wood products manufacture. The aim of this work was to use magnetic resonance techniques to explore aspects of <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>materials</b> processing at points along the value-added process chain, namely drying, chemical modification (preservation) and re-engineering (gluing) of wood products. Magnetic resonance mini-imaging studies of the water transport during the drying of radiata pine boards rave shown differences in the directional movement of water within the wood structure. These effects show a dependence on the surface area to volume ratio of timber and the orientation of the annual rings with respect to the larger drying face. Narrow, flat-sawn boards exhibit anomalous drying behaviour in terms of water mass transport, whereas thicker boards display more conventional core-shell drying behaviour. These restrictions to flow have been further investigated using diffusion tensor imaging via a modified pulsed field gradient spin-echo sequence to elucidate the nature of anisotropic diffusion in wood. The direction of least restriction to self-diffusion is in the longitudinal direction, as would be expected with it being the direction of active transport within a tree stem, whereas the direction of greatest restriction to self-diffusion is in the radial direction, with the higher density latewood acting as a barrier. Preservation of radiata pine sapwood with novel boron-based preservatives has been investigated using magnetic resonance imaging to determine the penetration and retention of the incipient compounds. An apparent anomaly in retention for trimethylborate-treated Pinus radiata sapwood was investigated by 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy of excised sections of latewood and earlywood, which showed hydrolytic decomposition of trimethyl borate to form boric acid. The rate of hydrolysis of trimethylborate was monitored by 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy and was shown to occur very rapidly in the latewood (within 24 hours), and over a longer time scale of several days in the earlywood. The resulting publication has reported some of the first published 11 B MRI images. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has provided (in conjunction with separate mass spectrometry studies) mechanistic evidence for the accelerated curing of phenol-resorcinol formaldehyde resols, using ammonia in combination with the conventional paraformaldehyde hardener - a process known as GreenWeldTM. Carbon- 13 and nitrogen- 15 NMR spectroscopy has shown evidence of both benzylamine and aniline type bridging structures formed during cure, compared to only methylene structures being formed under conventional curing conditions. Poly(vinyl acetate) emulsion polymer adhesive has also been examined using NMR spectroscopic methods, with particular focus on the effect of addition of aluminium chloride, which is often commercially added to PVAc formulations as a crosslinking agent. Multinuclear magnetic resonance spectra obtained during the cure of AlCl 3 modified PV Ac adhesive, shows a low frequency 27 Al shift of ca. 3 ppm suggesting a local change in environment as the aluminium changes from a solvated to a covalently bonded octahedral environment. Finally, as a preliminary study, a new device for measuring uniaxial extension of visco-elastic solids was trialled on poly(vinyl acetate) hydrogels to study the effect of addition of aluminium chloride on the visco-elastic properties of the adhesive. A similar, manually operated device was used to obtain NMR spectroscopic data during compression of the gel. These studies have shown that addition of aluminium chloride as a crosslinking agent, in fact produces a cured adhesive with fewer crosslinks than the corresponding unmodified adhesive, but with increased resistance to shear-induced creep...|$|R
30|$|Three phase OP is a {{heterogeneous}} matrix with a chemical composition that differs greatly among different producers (Christoforou and Fokaides 2016). OP is quite rich in water (30 – 50 %) and contains {{a substantial amount}} of residual oil (2 – 4 %) (Azbar et al. 2004). It is also characterized by high fiber (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and pectines) and low protein contents. In addition, it is rich in fat, mostly polyunsaturated fatty acids (Ramachandran et al. 2007; Molina-Alcaide and Yáñez-Ruiz 2008; Lafka et al. 2011). The ash content ranges between 1.7 and 4 % and major elements present in OP are potassium followed by calcium, magnesium and sodium (Aliakbarian et al. 2011). Despite its variable composition, fibers followed by fat and protein remain the main constituents of OP (Christoforou and Fokaides 2016). OP is a <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> organic <b>material</b> which has low digestibility and energy content in addition to having high tannin content (Al-Masri and Guenther 1999).|$|R
40|$|A newly {{effective}} system {{was used to}} bleach <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> textile <b>materials.</b> This system is based on two different newly synthesized natrium oxo-diperoxo molybdates, Na 2 [MoO (O 2) 2 (C 2 O 4) ] and Na 2 [MoO (O 2) 2 (C 6 H 6 O 7) ]. These two compounds were characterized by means of cyclic voltammetry, and the bleached fabrics were fully characterized by measuring their whiteness index, percent loss in fabric weight {{and the content of}} lignin in the fabric. The obtained results revealed that good whiteness index of the bleached linen-cotton fabrics (50 % linen and 50 % cotton) and low content of lignin could be obtained by soaking the fabric for 55 min at 90 °C in a solution containing 3. 5 % of molybdate complex and 3. 5 % H 2 O 2.
