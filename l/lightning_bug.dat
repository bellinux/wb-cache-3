50|$|Although {{the virtue}} of the <b>Lightning</b> <b>Bugs</b> {{was that they were}} far more {{expendable}} than piloted reconnaissance aircraft, by early 1966 an average of four out of five <b>Lightning</b> <b>Bugs</b> failed to return from missions. This was unacceptable even for a relatively cheap drone, and the Air Force asked Ryan to quickly convert ten standard Firebee target drones to expendable decoys. They were fitted with traveling-wave tube (TWT) active radar enhancement devices to make them look like a bigger aircraft on radar. There were no provisions for recovery or long-range fuel capacity, since their missions were to be one-way only.|$|R
40|$|Our eyes {{allow us}} to see when there is light present. One {{of the things we}} can see is the light {{produced}} by fireflies (also called <b>lightning</b> <b>bugs</b> or glow worms). Fireflies, like all living things, need some basic things to survive, including air, water, and food. In this lesson students explore fireflies and many other things by listening to and reading stories. Cross-curricular links to math, social studies, and language arts are provided.

50|$|The <b>Lightning</b> <b>Bugs</b> {{remained}} a potentially valuable reconnaissance asset. The first opportunity for operational use came in August 1964. On 2 August, the destroyer USS Maddox was sailing in international waters off the North Vietnamese coast {{when it was}} allegedly attacked by three North Vietnamese PT boats in {{what is known as}} the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, and which became a pretext for a major expansion of US involvement in the war in Vietnam.The Johnson Administration feared Communist Chinese intervention in the widening war, and decided to use the <b>Lightning</b> <b>Bugs</b> to monitor Chinese activities.
