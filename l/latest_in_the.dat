5|$|The Light Tank Mk VII (A17), {{also known}} as the Tetrarch, was a British light tank {{produced}} by Vickers-Armstrongs in the late 1930s and deployed during the Second World War. The Tetrarch was originally designed as the <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line of light tanks built by the company for the British Army. It improved upon its predecessor, the Mk VIB Light Tank, by introducing the extra firepower of a 2-pounder gun. The War Office ordered 70 tanks, an order that eventually increased to 220. Production was delayed by several factors, and as a consequence, only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produced.|$|E

In 2006, 209 people were killed and over 700 injured when seven bombs exploded on the city's commuter trains. In 2008, a series of ten coordinated attacks by armed terrorists for three days resulted in 173 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several heritage landmarks and prestigious hotels.

5|$|There is {{no direct}} mention of Ivalice in Vagrant Story.

Durai, a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the War of the Lions (and narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story told in Final Fantasy Tactics), is used {{at the beginning of the}} game, and the descriptions of several items make direct reference to the same story.

25|$|This defeat forced Wohlgemuth to {{lead his}} army not towards Komárom, where he planned to join the besieging Austrians, but to retreat towards Érsekújvár. Two days after the battle, on 21 April, the first Hungarian units entered in Komárom, ending the {{imperial}} blockade from the northern side of the fortress.

25|$|According to the Erste Group Bank, {{it would}} be very {{difficult}} for Romania to meet this 2019 target, not in regards of complying with the five nominal convergence criteria values, but in regards of reaching some appropriate levels of real convergence (i.e. raising the GDP per capita from 50% to a level above 60% of the EU average) ahead of the euro adoption. The Romanian Central Bank governor, Mugur Isărescu, admitted the target was ambitious, but obtainable if the political parties passed a legal roadmap for the required reforms to be implemented, and clarified this roadmap should lead to Romania entering ERM-2 only on 1 January 2017 so the euro could be adopted after two years of ERM-2 membership on 1 January 2019. In April 2015, Isărescu stated that the technical requirement for adoption of the euro 1 January 2019 would imply joining ERM-2 at the <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half of 2016. Ahead of ERM-2 entry, Isărescu argued, Romania needs to conduct monetary adjustments in form of finalizing the process of bringing minimum reserve requirement ratios in line with eurozone levels (a process envisaged to last between 1-1½ year) and to complete major economic policy adjustments: 1) Removing the sources of repressed inflation (i.e. completion of the energy market deregulation), 2) Removing sources of quasi-fiscal deficits (by restructuring loss-making state-owned enterprises), 3) Removing other sources of future budgetary pressures (i.e. the unavoidable expenditures to modernise road infrastructure).|$|E

500|$|Due to {{its border}} with Wales, Cheshire played an {{important}} role in defending England against the Welsh. Many castles were built along the border, and 8 of the 20 castles in Cheshire are within [...] of the Welsh border. Castles along the border were constructed when the Norman invasion of Wales was slowed by Welsh opposition; when conquest was swift, there was less need for fortifications. Compared to north Wales, relatively few castles are found in Cheshire since many, such as Holt Castle, were built on the western side of the River Dee. Most of these castles were motte-and-baileys and were originally of turf and timber construction, although they were sometimes later replaced by stone structures if a long-term castle was needed. Away from the borders, baronial castles were built in Cheshire and were a status symbol. The castles in Cheshire were built over a period of several centuries, with the earliest in 1070 and the <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 15th century. Most, 12 out of 20, were built between 1070 and the end of the 12th century. Of the three castles in Cheshire known to have been built after the 13th century, they are either tower houses or fortified manor houses; this type of structure was more important as a feudal residence than a military structure and reflects the national trend of castles after the 13th century being used as a symbol of authority rather than primarily military.|$|E
