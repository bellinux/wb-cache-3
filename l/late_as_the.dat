5|$|As <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> mid-1980s, Mansfield {{remained}} one of {{the biggest}} television draws. In 1980, The Jayne Mansfield Story aired on CBS starring Loni Anderson in the title role and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mickey Hargitay. It was nominated for three Emmy Awards. She was featured in the A+E Networks TV series Biography in an episode titled Jayne Mansfield: Blonde Ambition. The TV series won an Emmy Award in outstanding non-fiction TV series category in 2001. A again featured her life in another TV serial, Dangerous Curves, in 1999. In 1988, her story and archival footage was a part of TV documentary Hollywood Sex Symbols.|$|E
5|$|Before the 20th century, and in {{some cases}} as <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 1940s, historians largely took ancient {{literary}} sources at face value as evidence for the lives of women in the ancient world. In the middle of the 20th century this began to change. Early innovations in the study of women in ancient history began in France, as the Annales School began to take a greater interest in underrepresented groups. Robert Flacelière was an influential early author on women in Greece. Around the same time, feminist philosophy, such as Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex also examined the lives of women in the classical world.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{development}} of petroleum, the island was largely devoted to pearl fisheries and, as <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, {{was considered to be}} the finest in the world. In 1903, German explorer, Hermann Burchardt, visited Bahrain and took many photographs of historical sites, including the old Qaṣr es-Sheikh, photos now stored at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. Prior to the First World War, there were about 400 vessels hunting pearls and an annual export of more than £30,000.|$|E

The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16strikes per second, typically in one-second bursts, although repeated frequently. As <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> early twentieth century {{it was thought that}} the drumming might be a vocalisation, and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.|$|E
5|$|Gerhard Heilmann {{discussed}} Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis at considerable {{length in}} his 1926 book The Origin of Birds. Heilmann examined hatchlings {{of many other}} bird species, both closely related to those studied by Beebe and belonging to more primitive species, in hope of finding additional evidence for the leg-wings which Beebe had documented. After failing to find such evidence, Heilmann ultimately rejected Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis, and this remained the consensus among ornithologists {{for the next several}} decades. Beebe, however, continued to advance his Tetrapteryx hypothesis as <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Heazlewood {{speculated that}} the later 1865 church was {{probably}} used for classes due {{the small size of}} the wooden school building. The school grew to around 100 pupils on the register in 1900. The church building, also used for Wesleyen Sunday school, was used as a school until 1929. For this period the Education Department rented it from the Church trustees. A new school was built, on donated land, opposite the church and next to the recreation ground. This state school was opened in a ceremony on 23 August 1929. The school remained open as <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> end of 1954.|$|E

5|$|In 1627 Barbary Pirates {{from the}} Republic of Salé {{occupied}} Lundy for five years. The North African invaders, {{under the command}} of Dutch renegade Jan Janszoon, flew an Ottoman flag over the island. Some captured Europeans were held on Lundy before being sent to Algiers as slaves. From 1628 to 1634 the island was plagued by pirate ships of French, Basque, English and Spanish origin. These incursions were eventually ended by Sir John Penington, but in the 1660s and as <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 1700s the island still fell prey to French privateers.|$|E
5|$|In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle {{suggested}} that nature abhors a vacuum, a principle that {{became known as}} the horror vacui. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the West it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty. As <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.|$|E

5|$|Lochlann, {{originally}} Laithlinn or Lothlend, {{the land}} where Amlaíb's father was king, is often identified with Norway, {{but it is not}} universally accepted that it had such a meaning in early times. Several historians have proposed instead that in early times, and certainly as <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Clontarf in 1014, Laithlinn refers to the Norse and Norse-Gael lands in the Hebrides, the Isle of Man, the Northern Isles and parts of mainland Scotland. Whatever the original sense, by the twelfth century, when Magnus Barefoot undertook his expedition to the West, it had come to mean Norway.|$|E
5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords as <b>late</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ninth century. The Anglo-Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders, with a leader who had authority over many different groups; Ælle of Sussex may have been such a leader. Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. A weaker state also might ask or pay {{for the protection of}} a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.|$|E
