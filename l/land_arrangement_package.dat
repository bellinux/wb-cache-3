40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to an emerging literature on free <b>land</b> <b>arrangements</b> in developing countries. We argue that in-depth empirical analysis {{is crucial to}} understand the specific terms of <b>land</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Using mixed quantitative and qualitative data collected among rural-urban migrants in Thailand, we categorize <b>land</b> <b>arrangements</b> along four dimensions: self-reported categories by the actors, {{the nature of the}} relationship between the parties involved, the nature of the payment made, and how explicit or binding are the contractual terms. The economic motivations in each of the consequent categories of <b>land</b> <b>arrangement</b> are then analyzed with simple econometrics. Our main results suggest that while free <b>land</b> <b>arrangements</b> are allegedly common practice in Thailand, only a small number of these free arrangements are really free. Many appear to be a `disguised form of rental contract', similar to sharecropping except for the fact that they are reported as free arrangements. Disguised rental is often found among households who rely heavily on the safety net function of land. Or results also suggest that the arrangements which do not involve any direct repayment or compensation are often parts of complex inter-vivo bequests, and involve incomplete transfers of property rights...|$|R

40|$|Project co-funded by the European Commission within FP 6 (2002 – 2006) The <b>Arrangement</b> 2 <b>package</b> of cgal {{has been}} vastly {{extended}} and improved during the acs project. It {{is now being}} frequently used, not only for academic research but more recently also by several companies. Clearly, {{the next stage of}} research and development along these lines is the three-dimensional case of arrangements of surfaces. As is often the case in geometric computing, this is a significantly more difficult task than the two-dimensional case. In this report we summarize the two major directions we have taken during the last year of the acs project toward the three-dimensional goal: (i) constructing arrangements of curves on surfaces thus paving the way to the reduction of the three-dimensional problem into a collection of inter-linked two-dimensional problems, and (ii) developing geometric primitives operating on a small number of surfaces, which constitute the building blocks on which a future three-dimensional package will be built. We emphasize that in both directions we make extensive use of the capabilities of the two-dimensional <b>arrangement</b> <b>package,</b> enhanced during the acs project. ...|$|R
