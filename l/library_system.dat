40|$|This {{study of}} {{resource}} sharing among public libraries {{was made possible}} by six <b>library</b> <b>systems</b> in northern Illincis. With the organizaticn of the <b>library</b> <b>systems</b> and development of interlibrary scan services and other cccperative activities, the problem of extending resource sharing among member libraries and between <b>library</b> <b>systems</b> arose. Several <b>library</b> <b>systems</b> have initiated union catalogs and a prinary consideration of this study has been the status and utility of those union catalogs. The study indicates that unicn catalogs for <b>library</b> <b>systems</b> will not be of much practical value in interlibrary loan services and that money and effort can be better expended in other directicns. The direction with the greatest potential is automated centralized processing and catalcging. The catalcging performed by the Library of Congress and available in its catalcg cards and Machine-Readable Catalcging (MARC) magnetic tapes is a means tc avoid unnecessary catalcging duplication and provides a convenient tool for automated processing.
