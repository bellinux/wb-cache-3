In 1898 he sold one of these, General Howe's Levee, 1777, but he later regretted it, realizing that such a series could not be complete if the separate paintings could not be kept together. Consequently, he never sold another one of those, but he did sell the reproduction rights to various publishing companies.

The authors combined two baseline conditions with an alternating treatments design and then replicated the effects across four teacher-nominated students. The first baseline condition was the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s typical instruction format, where one student who raised his/her hand was called upon to respond to the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s question. The second baseline condition (BL 2 ̆ 7) was the same as the first baseline with an additional control for the number of teacher-delivered questions to the class per session. The RC condition was the same as BL 2 ̆ 7 except students were expected to write their answers on the <b>laminated</b> <b>card</b> and then display upon the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s cue.

30|$|Administration of {{deuterium}} oxide and collection of skin samples {{is very easy}} making this assay highly attractive; however as with any new assay feasibility and cost must be considered. Unlike other methods of assessing protein turnover which historically have used short term i.v. infusion of radiolabelled tracer or invasive punch sampling (discussed above) in this study subjects drink pre-bottled D 2 O at home and are then tape stripped. In our study tape strips were collected by a single person to minimize any sampling variability between subjects in such a small cohort and because the subjects were already visiting the clinic for pre-existing visits. However skin collection could also {{be carried out by}} the subject in an outpatient setting as tape strip collection is painless and requires minimal training. Following collection tape strips are stuck onto a <b>laminated</b> <b>card</b> and can be stored in the subjects’ freezer until collection. It is conceivable to imagine a kit mailed to the subjects home of D 2 O, tape strips and collection cards. The abundance of keratin in the tape strip sample means protein isolation is relatively easy for any chemical laboratory. We envision this method being most applicable to interpretation of clinical trials rather than routine disease management of patients. In this scenario access to a mass spectrometry instrument and chemical lab is not limiting. Additionally, new mass spec methods such as MRM or SISCAPA, are high through put and have been used to translate biomarker approaches from discovery to clinical trials. These methods can be used to measure a targeted protein of interest from a complex biological sample and this method could be adapted to this platform.|$|E
40|$|Obesity {{has been}} {{described}} by the World Health Organisation as a global epidemic, and is recognised as a major health concern due to the associated medical, psychosocial, and economical problems. Treating obesity-related health conditions are a major burden for health systems but treatment towards weight loss are mostly unsuccessful in the long term. Most of the various treatment types are rather costly, like pharmaceutical or surgical interventions. Previous studies found that particular eating behaviours are associated with increased BMI; therefore, an approach of treatment is to influence the concerning eating behaviours towards behaviours with less risk of weight gain. Theories and models of behaviour are used to develop interventions to change eating behaviour. Often treatment schemes focussing on behavioural change are time consuming and costly based on the need of specialised therapists to conduct therapy. Thus, obese and overweight individuals urgently need an effective obesity-management intervention that is simple, inexpensive, and not too time-consuming, does not rely on major assistance of health professionals and can be performed at home for achieving changes in eating behaviour resulting in weight loss. Study aims: The first aim of this current thesis was to develop a new weight loss intervention which focusses on eating behaviour with support of behavioural change theories and current knowledge about eating behaviours which carry obesity risks. The second aim was to investigate the effectiveness of the intervention on body weight and physiological and psychological parameters and to investigate whether particular targeted health behaviours would have a stronger impact on the measured parameters than others. The third aim was to investigate the influence of the various health behaviours on clinical blood parameters which are known to be risk factors for chronic diseases like insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease being related to high BMI. Results: A novel weight-loss intervention was developed, based on principles of Control Theory (CT) and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), using reflective processes on 10 commandments (health behaviours) for the influence of eating behaviour. These 10 behavioural commandments were based on eating behaviours, extracted from literature, which are recognised of high importance for weight loss and health. The study design used three tools (<b>laminated</b> <b>card,</b> leaflet, compliance report). These tools were designed to be complementary to each other regarding their influence on eating behaviour combining the nutritional information with selected behaviour change techniques. Two longitudinal studies to test the effectiveness of the intervention were performed, in United Kingdom (UK) - Bangor area and Saudi Arabia (SA) – King Fahad Medical City. Both studies were performed for 3 and 6 months, as well as including a 3 months follow-up assessment with overweight/obese females. The first study was conducted in UK (3 months, n= 35; 6 months, n= 36; follow up, n= 19) to investigate the effectiveness of the study intervention on body weight, attitudes towards food and food craving domains. The intervention was successful to achieve significant weight loss (5. 5 ± 3. 7 kg and 7. 8 ± 5. 3 kg) in the first two phases of the study (after 3 - and 6 -months of the intervention), respectively. After the follow-up period, the intervention succeeded to maintain the achieved weight loss that was obtained {{at the end of the}} second phase (6 months) of the study. There were significant correlations between BMI change and commitment to seven of the eating commandments (B 1, B 2, B 3, B 6, B 8, B 9, B 10), as well as after 6 -months between commitment to (B 1, B 2, B 3, B 5, B 7, B 8, B 9) and BMI change. In the follow-up period, there were significant correlations between BMI change and commitment to B 1 and B 10. The intervention induced significant improvement in explicit attitudes towards healthy food (3. 9 ± 4. 5 and 5 ± 7. 4) and unhealthy food (4. 5 ± 5 and 6. 1 ± 6. 8) after 3 and 6 months, respectively; outcomes in the follow-up period showed that participants maintained these improvements in explicit attitudes. However, no significant improvement in implicit attitude towards food was detected (IAT). Total of food cravings domains were significantly reduced after 3 months and 6 months of the intervention (33. 3 ± 34. 3 and 36. 8 ± 47. 5). These achievements were maintained in the follow-up phase of the study. After 3 -months of the intervention, there were significant correlations between weight loss and change of two craving dimensions (Ant+ and Emotions), while BMI change correlated with changes in Ant+ and Hunger. After 6 -months, changes of two dimensions of FCQ-t (Ant+ and Hunger) were significantly correlated with weight loss and BMI change. After 3 -months, changes in several FCQ-t dimensions were significantly correlated with commitment to some commandments. “Thoughts” dimension correlated with commitment to B 1 and B 10, and “Guilt” dimension correlated with commitment to B 7, while “Intent”, “Cues” and “Hunger” dimensions were correlated with commitment to B 1. After 6 months, change in “Thought” dimension was correlated with commitment to B 1 and B 10, “Intent” dimension correlated with commitment to B 1 and B 5, “Guilt” correlated with commitment to B 4, while “Ant+” and “Hunger” were correlated to commitment with B 1. At the follow-up, the reduced level of FCQ-t dimensions remained. The second study was conducted in Saudi Arabia (3 months, n= 104; 6 months, n= 26; follow up, n= 11) at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) investigating the effectiveness of the novel intervention on body weight loss and important metabolic blood parameters (glucose homoeostasis, lipid profile, blood pressure, and resting heart rate) in overweight/obese females. The intervention was successful to achieve significant weight loss (7. 3 ± 3. 5 kg, 15. 1 ± 8. 5 kg, and 2. 3 ± 2. 6 kg) in the study phases after 3 -, 6 -months of the intervention, and follow-up, respectively. After 3 -months, there was significant correlation between commitment to all commandments and achieved changes in body weight and BMI. However, changes in weight loss and BMI were correlated with commitment to all commandments except commitment to B 4 and B 6 after 6 -months. After 3 months of the intervention there was significant improvement in blood metabolic parameters in terms of glucose homeostasis parameters; significant improvement in fasting insulin, glucose, HG. A 1 c, HOMA IR, and HOMA S. Improvement of various glucose homeostasis measures were significantly correlated with commitment to all commandments but B 4 and B 6. Lipid profile significantly improved (reduction in LDL, TC, and TG). Changes in LDL and TC were correlated with all commitment to all commandments but B 1 and B 10 which have been found to be significantly correlated with HDL change. Systolic blood pressure was found to be reduced after the 3 months of intervention. In terms of attitude measures, explicit attitudes towards healthy and unhealthy food were significantly improved after the intervention; increased attitudes towards healthy food was correlated with commitment to all commandments except B 4; decrease in attitude towards unhealthy food was correlated to commitment to all commandments. After 6 months significant improvements in the glucose homeostasis parameters (insulin, glucose, and HG. A 1 c) and in lipids profile (LDL, TC, and TG) were detected. In addition, there were improvements in explicit attitudes towards healthy foods and unhealthy foods. However, there was no significant change in the cardiovascular parameters (BP and RHR) after 6 months of the intervention. Conclusion: The newly developed weight loss intervention was effective in inducing improvements in terms weight loss, food craving dimensions, explicit attitudes towards food, and achieved significant reductions in blood based clinical health risk parameters. The outcomes support that achievements in weight loss, and the maintenance of weight loss can be achieved using interventional designs based on behavioural theories. As a novelty this has been achieve with an intervention which needs low time commitment from health professionals. The change in body weight via the applied cognitive techniques to alter negative eating behaviours might even be successful in the longterm...|$|E

The booklet consists of illustrated messages presented on postcard-sized <b>laminated</b> <b>cards</b> that are joined by a ring. Pregnant women were encouraged to discuss booklet content with their families. Methods We examined use of the booklet and factors affecting adoption of practices through semi-structured interviews with district and community-level government health personnel, staff from the Nepal Family Health Program, FCHVs, recently delivered women and their husbands and mothers-in-law. Results The booklet is shared among household members, promotes discussion, and is referred to when questions arise or during emergencies. Booklet cards on danger signs and nutritious foods are particularly well-received. Cards on family planning and certain aspects of birth preparedness generate less interest. Husbands and mothers-in-law control decision-making for maternal and newborn care-seeking and related household-level behaviors. Conclusions Interpersonal peer communication through trusted community-level volunteers is an acceptable primary strategy in Nepal for promotion of household-level behaviors. The content and number of messages should be simplified or streamlined before being scaled-up to minimize intervention complexity and redundant communication. </p...|$|R
