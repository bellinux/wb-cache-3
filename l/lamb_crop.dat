50|$|Ewes and rams hit puberty {{just after}} 3 months old. Lambs should be {{separated}} from their mother after 60 days to prevent impregnation of the ewe. At the age of 7-8 months, ewe lambs should have their first estrus cycle. Ewes will have ovulate during all months of the year, not following a seasonal breeding period like most sheep. Ewes can lamb at 12 months of age. Ewes can have two lamb crops in a year, sometimes three in two years. One to four lambs in one <b>lamb</b> <b>crop</b> are possible, with twins being most common. St. Croix sheep have a high lamb survivability and the ewes are instinctive mothers, usually not requiring much help. Ewes also produce plenty of milk for their lambs.|$|E
50|$|Blackface ewes are {{excellent}} mothers and will often attempt {{to defend their}} lambs against predators.

The breed spread from the border areas during the 19th century to the highlands and the Scottish islands. They also crossed to Northern Ireland and the US. There are flocks scattered across the USA but this robust little breed has remained a minor breed in North America. Blackface lambs yield a carcass ideal for the modern consumer. The meat is free of superfluous fat and waste and is known the world over for its distinct flavour. Although they are not large sheep they have enormous potential for the production of high quality lean lamb for today's health conscious consumer.

Multiparous Kalkohi ewes (n = 32; 3 years old) were randomly assigned to 2 groups which consumed isoenergetic and isonitrogenous control (C) or Megalac (M; 5 % Megalac in diet DM) diet. All ewes were synchronized by prostaglandin injection. Blood samples were collected from d 8, 10, and 12 of estrus cycle. Diets offered 4 wk prior to mating and up to 4 wk after mating and 2 weeks before parturition. Pregnancy, lambing and twining rate were not significantly affected by fat inclusion in ewe diet (P  % 5). Similarly, pregnancy length was unaltered by treatment (P  % 5). <b>Lambing</b> <b>crop</b> was affected by diet fat (P  % 5).

40|$|Divergent {{breeding}} {{lines of}} Romney sheep, selected as lambs for consistently {{high or low}} faecal worm egg count (FEC) following natural multi-species challenge by nematode parasites, were established in New Zealand at Wallaceville Animal Research Centre in 1979 and at Rotomahana Station in 1985. In 1988 the Rotomahana lines, including an unselected control line maintained under the same management conditions, were transferred to Tokanui Station where they remained for 4 years. In 1993 elite high and low FEC animals from Tokanui, along with the controls, were transferred to Wallaceville, where merged lines have since been managed together. Selection responses from the lines at Rotomahana and Tokanui, and from a further 5 years of divergent selection in the merged lines, are reported here. For the two most recent <b>lamb</b> <b>crops</b> (1996 and 1997 birth years), log-transformed FECs of {{the high and low}} lines were 1. 27 and - 1. 46 phenotypic standard deviation units from the control. After back-transformation to the original scale, where the FEC for control line lambs averaged 1255 eggs per g, the means for the high and low lines were 3. 05 and 0. 27 times the control mean. Animal-model restricted maximum likelihood estimates of heritability and repeatability for single-record FEC (following separate infections) were 0. 28 (s. e. 0. 02) and 0. 42 (s. e. 0. 01), respectively. Correlated responses in production traits include significantly decreased post-weaning weight gain and increased dags (breech soiling) in lambs, and decreased fleece weight in yearlings and ewes in the low FEC line, compared with those in the high line. However the low FEC line had proportionally 0. 11 more lambs weaned per ewe mated than the high FEC line (P < 0. 01). It is concluded firstly that selection for high or low FEC in Romneys has achieved an 11 -fold difference between the divergent lines.

Ewes were mated to Suffolk rams and recorded over the first 3 seasons of production. Between lambing and weaning, ewes rearing single lambs grazed semi-natural hill swards (1. 5 ?ewes/ha) and those rearing twins grazed improved enclosures (10 ?ewes/ha). Crossbreeding significantly (P< 0. 001) increased body weights at all ages, with values for four-year old ewes of 45. 9, 57. 2, 51. 6, 57. 8 and 58. 5 ?kg in purebred Welsh Mountain and Cheviot, Lleyn, Poll Dorset and Texel crossbred ewes respectively. Individual lamb growth rates from birth to 8 weeks and from 8 weeks to weaning were significantly higher in the progeny of crossbred ewes (P< 0. 001) with highest growth rates for lambs reared by Poll Dorset and Texel cross ewes.

In each of two environments, approximately 144 ewes were mated in a three breed reciprocal cross design each year. The resulting 757 parturitions produced 1263 lambs. Hampshire, Suffolk and Willamette sheep from university flocks were used. Two rams of each breed {{were used in}} each environment each year. One location was rolling hill land, the other was level, irrigated, valley bottom land, both near Corvallis, Oregon. Least squares analyses of variance were computed on ewe production traits which included fertility, lambs born, percent survival to weaning, lambs weaned and pounds of lamb weaned. None of the effects tested {{in the analysis of}} fertility showed significance. On the other traits, year was significant except for survival. Location was significant for pounds weaned per ewe mated and for lambs born, percent weaned and pounds weaned per ewe lambing. The main effect of the hill land was superior except for lambs born per ewe which lambed. Dam age was significant except for survival. The age effect on fertility was not tested. Otherwise production increased with age. Dam weight change during the mating season was significant for pounds weaned per ewe mated and for prolificacy. Pounds weaned increased with weight gain while prolificacy decreased. Lambing date was significant for lambs born and lambs weaned per ewe lambing. Prolificacy increased as the lambing season progressed. Location x year interaction effects on pounds of lamb weaned per ewe mated and on lambs weaned, percent weaned and pounds of lamb weaned per ewe which lambed were significant. Dam breed and dam x location interaction were significant for pounds weaned per ewe mated. The overall and hill land ranking of ewe breeds was Willamette, Suffolk, then Hampshire. The interaction re. sulted primarily from a disproportionate increase in the performance of the Willamette ewes on the hill land. The Suffolk ewes were superior on the irrigated pasture.

40|$|Alternative {{forage crops}} offer {{a number of}} {{benefits}} for farmers including a cheap finishing system for lambs, benefits for soil condition, fertility building for rotations and providing a cover crop. Certain forages have also been demonstrated to have some anthelmintic benefits for lambs. A demonstration study was undertaken to investigate the potential of six crops used in the horticulture industry (fertility building crops) as forage crops for weaned growing <b>lambs.</b> The <b>crops</b> include white mustard, Nemat (form of Rocket), Crimson Clover, Sweet Clover, Caliente 119 and Caliente 99 (Cruciferae). The grazing field was split into three blocks and two crops were sown in solid strips in each block. Each block also had grass headlands. 10 ewe lambs were randomly allocated (balanced for liveweight) to each block. Lambs {{were introduced to the}} blocks 1 week after <b>crop</b> emergence. <b>Lambs</b> were weighed fortnightly for 8 weeks. Mob faecal samples were also taken from each group on a fortnightly basis. Grazing behaviour assessments were also undertaken. Lambs grazing the mustard treatment had the least liveweight gain of the three groups over the grazing period (average of 58 g/day). Whereas lambs grazing the clover treatment had the greatest liveweight gain (average of 110 g/day). Lambs grazing the Caliente treatment were intermediate (average of 92 g/day). However, in the third grazing period lambs on the Caliente treatment had negative liveweight gains (- 50 g/day). Although activity varied throughout the day, on average 75...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{investigations}} {{were based}} on a complete diallel cross among three inbred lines of Suffolk sheep. Line of sire effects were assumed to be an estimate of general combining ability effects while sire x dam interaction was assumed to be an estimate of specific combining ability. The line of dam effects were also a measure of general combining ability plus any maternal effects that were present. General and specific combining ability effects were observed for birth weight, 120 -day adjusted weaning weight, and conformation and condition scores at weaning. The linecross individuals were generally superior to the inbred lambs for all six traits studied on the lambs produced by the diallel matings. Among the linecrosses, considering all six traits, 3 x 1 and 1 x 3 appeared to be the superior crosses implying that lines 1 and 3 combined more effectively than either lines 1 and 2 or lines 2 and 3. Significant general combining ability effects were not observed for any of the traits studied on the lambs born from diallel matings. Significant specific combining ability effects were observed only for yearling wool weight. Significant line of dam effects were observed for birth weight and yearling wool weight indicating a possibility of maternal effects for these two traits. The linecross ewe lambs produced by the diallel matings were bred as yearlings and two-year-olds to a common sire to obtain two <b>lamb</b> <b>crops</b> for evaluation of the lamb producing ability of the linecross ewes. No straight line ewe lambs were included. Estimates of general combining ability and reciprocal effects were obtained on the lambs produced by these linecross ewes. Year effects were removed before estimates of general combining ability and reciprocal effects were obtained. Observations were made of birth weight, 120 -day adjusted weaning weight, conformation and condition scores at weaning, endocrine gland weights, detailed carcass information, and organoleptic and cooking evaluations. The endocrine glands weighed were right and left adrenals, pituitary, and thyroid. Carcass characteristics observed were cold carcass weight, carcass grade and length, fat thickness, and rib eye area as well as brisket-flank-and-shank, shoulder and neck, rack, trimmed loin, trimmed legs, fat trim, and kidney knob percentages. A seven rib rack was used to determine percent total loss in cooking, percent drip, tenderness, juiciness, flavor of lean, flavor of fat, and overall score. Significant general combining ability effects were observed for carcass grade, fat thickness over the 12 th rib, percent fat trim, percent kidney knob, and percent trimmed legs. All other traits exhibited a lack of either general combining ability or reciprocal effects. Line 1 was the highest in general combining ability for carcass grade and percent kidney knob while line 3 was the greatest in general combining ability for fat thickness and percent fat trim, which was considered an undesirable trait. Line 2 was the most effective in general combining ability for percent trimmed legs. Considering the entire study, line 1 was the most effective combiner followed by lines 3 and 2, respectively. The 1 x 3 and 3 x 1 linecross lambs of the diallel matings appeared superior. Linecross 1 x 3 and 3 x 1 ewes produced crossbred lambs of outstanding quality when compared to the lambs from the other linecross ewes...|$|R
40|$|Story In Brief: Increasing {{reproductive}} efficiency {{will have}} the greatest influence on ranch profitability. New Mexico ranches will typically wean between a 90 and 110 % <b>lamb</b> <b>crop.</b> However, the potential is much greater. Willingham et al. (1986) found that range ewes (west Texas) ovulated 1. 52 eggs per ewe and with a lambing and weaning percent of 117 % and 101 %, respectively. The greatest reproductive loss is between ovulation and lambing with the most vulnerable period pre-implantatin. Therefore, to increase reproductive efficiency, we need to increase implantation rates and reduce early embryonic death. A second way to increase reproductive efficiency {{is to increase the}} pounds of lamb marketed per ewe. Therefore, we need to increase weaning weight of lambs going to market in the fall. For many years, producers in New Mexico and the west have used mutton sires as terminal crosses on western white face ewes. This system fit well into the selection system developed by Prof Neale. However, little information is published regarding the actual benefits of the crossbred lamb. Objectives: The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine the stage/s of greatest reproductive loss in Western Whiteface range ewes. The secondary objective was to determine if terminal cross breeding will effectively produce more pounds of weaned lamb than straightbred Western whiteface lambs on native rangelands. Expected Outcomes: Our hypothesis was that we would see about 40 – 50 % loss of potential lambs (potential lambs = ovulation rates) with the greatest loss in the first few weeks following breeding. Also, we expected the cross bred lambs to wean about 10 % heavier than the straightbred lambs...|$|E
40|$|The Menz and Horro {{highland}} sheep breeds {{are being}} evaluated at the ILCA Debre Birhan research station in Ethiopia for between-and within-breed genetic variation for resistance to internal parasites. The experimental design involve mating, for each breed, 150 ewes with 10 rams to lamb at the begining {{of the dry}} season (October/November) and the wet season (June/July). This paper reports data collected from birth to weaning on lambs from the first three <b>lamb</b> <b>crop</b> (i. e. born October/November 1992; June/July 1993; October/November 1993). The traits analysed were birth weight (BWT), weaning weight (WWT), packed red cell volume (PCV) recorded at weaning, logarithm transformed faecal egg count (LFEC) recorded at weaning and lamb survival from birth to weaning. The effect of both breed and lambing group was significant (P) for all traits analysed. Horro lambs were heavier at birth and at weaning, had lower PCV, higher LFEC and lower survival rate from birth to weaning than Menz lambs. There was a significant interaction of breed by lambing group for all traits except BWT. For lamb survival, WWT and PCV the interaction {{took the form of}} varying magnitude of differences between the breeds in different lambing groups rather than any change in breed ranking. For LFEC the breed ranking changed in different groups with the Menz having higher LFEC than Horro lambs in the first lambing group, while the reverse was true in the other two lambing groups. There was no evidence from these data that the breed difference in lamb survival was due to resistance to endoparasites. There was significant additive genetic direct and maternal variance for BWT and WWT. For BWT the estimate of the direct (h 2 A) and maternal (h 2 M) heritability were 0. 07 0. 06 and 0. 34 0. 06, respectively, while for WWT the corresponding estimates were 0. 04 0. 05 and 0. 43 0. 07. For PCV and LFEC h 2 M was not significant and the overall heritability estimates were 0. 34 0. 14 and 0. 32 0. 13, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{conducted}} by the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) in coastal Kenya indicate that the local Red Maasai sheep are more resistant to endoparasites than the introduced Dorper sheep breed. These studies also provide the first evidence of genetic variation in endoparasite resistance within African sheep breeds. Early results show that smallholders at the Kenya coast could double their lamb off-take if they used Red Maasai-cross animals instead of Dorpers. Dorper sheep, which originate in South Africa, have become popular in Kenya because they can grow faster and attain heavier body weights than local breeds of sheep. But while this may be true under the relatively favourable conditions of the Kenyan highlands, {{it does not necessarily}} hold true elsewhere. ILCA's studies in the subhumid coastal zone show that growth rates and body weights are similar in Dorper and Red Maasai. The Red Maasai-Dorper crosses are more productive than the Dorper itself because they have a better reproductive performance and lower mortality rates both of which may be linker to their greater resistance to endoparasites. The predominant endoparasite found in sheep and goats in both the coastal and highland areas of Kenya is the bloodsucking parasite Haemonchus contortus, {{which is one of the}} most pathogenic gastro-intestinal parasites. The ILCA research was based on results from a 100 -ewe herd using Dorper, Dorper-Red Maasai crosses and backcrosses and has shown that smallholders who keep sheep in the subhumid coastal zone in Kenya should be encouraged to keep indicenous stock such as the Red Maasai or cross-brads with at least 50 % Red Maasai blood. Using end oparasite-resistant Red Maasai sheep could double a farmer's annual <b>lamb</b> <b>crop.</b> The implications for the rest of Africa are significant: losses due to endoparasites will be reduced, use of expensive control chemicals will also be reduced and this in turn will reduce environmental contamination and the development of drug-resistant strains of endoparasites.

40|$|A flock {{monitoring}} {{study on}} 60 households as undertaken from October 2008 to September 2009 to measure productive and reproductive performances; determine socioeconomic benefits and husbandry practices; and identify production barriers and suggest intervention options in Alaba Special Woreda. The Woreda was stratified {{on the basis}} of sheep and goat densities and the respective sites and households were selected using multistage (purposive and random) sampling techniques. Mean land holding per household was 1. 5 ha. On average, a household owned 6. 5 cattle, 6. 1 sheep, 4. 5 goats, 1. 15 equines and 4. 2 chickens. Hot pepper, teff and chat are the major cash sources for farmers. Small ruminant are mainly kept for income generation. Males were sold or slaughtered before attaining puberty. ‘Afelama’, a local bylaw and punishment rule, restricts movement of sheep and goats during cropping period. Sale, death, home slaughter, share holding, gifts out and predator contributed for 60. 5, 13. 8, 11. 0, 5. 2, 1. 4, and 5. 7 % exits, respectively, in sheep flocks while the corresponding values for goats were 41. 5, 17. 8, 16. 1, 5. 9, 11. 9, and 2. 5 %. Sheep and goats are mainly sold to purchase agricultural inputs (fertilizer and improved seeds) and is the major reason for the reported exits. Home born, purchase, shareholding, and gifts back constituted 87. 1 %, 10. 1, 1. 7 and 1. 1 % entries, respectively, for sheep while for goats the values were 94. 4, 2. 1, 2. 8 and 0. 7 %, respectively. Most lambing and kidding occurred between March and June, the apparent peak being in May. Mean birth weight (BWT) (kg), weaning weight (WWT) (kg), Average daily gain to weaning (ADG, g), litter size, age at first parturition and parturition interval (months) for sheep were 2. 30 + 0. 03, 10. 35 + 0. 19, 89. 24 + 1. 98, 1. 52 + 0. 04, 12. 43 + 0. 1, and 9. 19 + 0. 08, respectively. The corresponding values for goats were 2. 34 + 0. 03, 9. 85 + 0. 29, 82. 34 + 3. 18, 1. 47 + 0. 04, 11. 95 + 0. 13, and 9. 05 + 0. 08 respectively. Sex, parity, litter size and season significantly (P< 0. 05) affected BWT in sheep whereas birth type affected 90 day weight, ADG and 120 day weight. Similarly, season influenced 30 and 120 day weights significantly (P< 0. 05). All fixed factors except sex significantly (P< 0. 05) affected BWT in goats whereas birth type and season significantly affected weight at 30, 60, 90 days and ADG consistently while other factors affected weight at specific ages; however, the trends were not consistent. Pre-weaning mortality rate of 13. 89 % and 10. 66 % were found for sheep and goats, respectively. Mean milk yield (morning milk) of does was 150 + 56. 03 ml. Offtake rates of sheep and goats were 41. 18 and 30. 37 %, respectively. Small ruminant enterprise contributes 52. 32 % of the net total cash income obtained from livestock rearing and 24. 23 % of the net total agricultural cash income. The major problems for small ruminant production in the area are poor veterinary services, water and feed shortage, seasonal market fluctuations and lack of overall extension supports. Higher rate of abortions and mortality could offset the higher prolificacy of kid and <b>lamb</b> <b>crops</b> obtained. To utilize the current emerging market opportunities, attempts should be made to improve veterinary services and forage development to alleviate the losses due to co-occurrence of high parturitions during critical feed shortage time. Efforts should also be made to optimize female reproduction and increase lamb and kid output. To select outstanding males from the local genotypes, breeding strategy should be devised. Further study is needed to identify the milking potential of the Does and cost-effective feeding strategy from locally available feeds for finishing animals in the area.

40|$|A 12 -year {{experiment}} {{designed to}} show the benefits of applying lime to acid soils when growing annual pasture, perennial pasture, and annual crops in rotations with annual or perennial pastures, provides the context for comparing methods of economic analysis. In this study enterprise gross margins are compared with whole-farm cumulative monthly cash flows derived using a business process model. The current study gave gross margins comparable with those of a recently published study based on the first 12 years of the same field experiment at Book Book near Wagga Wagga in southern NSW (Li et al., 2010). Both gross margin analyses indicated positive results for all treatments. However, because key fixed and capital cost items were not {{taken into account in}} the gross margin analysis the financial benefits of the treatments were overstated. In the whole-farm analysis, a full set of accounts (including fixed and capital costs) was developed for the experimental combinations of prime <b>lamb</b> and dryland <b>cropping</b> enterprises and used to generate a monthly cash flow sequence for each treatment over the 12 -year term of the experiment. This full financial analysis, where all costs are included, showed all mixed treatments (cropping and grazing) accumulated unsustainable losses over the period of the trial. The grazing-only treatments generated positive cash lows over the 12 year period, but 2 accumulated high levels of debt in the initial years. None of these outcomes were predicted by gross margins, which were consistently positive for all treatments. This paper concludes that the analysis of trial results benefits from interpretation in the context of whole-farm analysis, verified by district experience. Relying on gross margin analysis alone would have supported loss-making outcomes in this trial. This conclusion has important ramifications for analysis of all systems trials. Agribusiness,...|$|R
40|$|Integration {{of crops}} and {{livestock}} has been revitalised in Australia, initially {{as an opportunity to}} increase cropping within the high-rainfall grazing zones, and more recently, to improve enterprise diversification and profitability across the low-, medium- and high-rainfall, and mixed-farming zones. Young crops are highly digestible (> 80 % dry matter digestibility, DMD) with a high energy density (> 12 MJ/kg DM) and, in much of southern Australia, fill a winter feed gap. The quality and time of feed availability also coincide with the high nutrient requirements of ewes in late pregnancy and lactation. In Western Australia and South Australia, young crops are available for lactating ewes and young growing lambs (autumn lambing). For the smaller proportion of growers who lamb later in winter, young crops are available for the last 1 - 2 months of pregnancy. In the later-lambing states of New South Wales and Victoria, crops may be grazed by ewes at any stage of pregnancy and lactation and/or by young <b>lambs.</b> In Tasmania, <b>crops</b> {{are more likely to be}} available during early-mid-gestation. Limited studies on feed budgeting with grazing crops have indicated that ewes can maintain or even increase liveweight, with a much lower level of feed on offer than would be required with traditional pastures (2. 2, indicating a high risk of grass tetany. The elevated potassium also contributes to a high dietary cation-anion difference of approximately + 49 mEq/ 100 g DM and this may cause metabolic alkalosis and hypocalcaemia. Pregnancy toxaemia, hypocalcaemia and grass tetany are all potential causes of increased ewe mortality. Pregnancy and/or lactation outcomes will also be influenced by a deficiency of trace elements. Grazing young crops in areas with a history of selenium, copper, iodine and cobalt deficiency will increase susceptibility to deficiency by increasing growth and feed intake. In conclusion, the grazing of young growing crops presents new opportunities for increased production and stocking rates in the mixed-farming zones. The value of this feed source is well recognised by some producers. While growing crops have a highly productive potential, they also come with an increased risk of a range metabolic disturbances and nutritional imbalances. These risks can be minimised by regular monitoring of livestock and crop biomass and the provision of mineral supplements...|$|R
