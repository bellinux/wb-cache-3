The Kopanang <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> is one {{of several}} <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> in the Vaal Reefs gold mining area that may {{have an impact on the}} surface and {{groundwater}} quality. Few Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) studies exist on <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> in the South African gold industry due to the overwhelming acid generation from slime dams. Due to the existence of sulfide minerals in the Kopanang <b>rock</b> <b>dump,</b> there is a possibility that acid generation can occur, depending on the mineralogical composition of the rocks. If the <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> generates acid it will increase the possibility of heavy metal leaching and pollute the underlying aquifers. The aim of this study was to determine whether the dump generates acid and if so to quantify the acid generation and the impact it has on the surface and groundwater. From this study it was concluded that the <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> has a potential to produce acid resulting in AMD. However, the inherent minerals in the <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> (calcite, dolomite, mica and chlorite) have a neutralising effect on the produced acid that may form. Furthermore, the underlying dolomite acts as a buffer for any residual acid. There is, however, evidence of water pollution around the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> and in the groundwater adjacent to the <b>rock</b> <b>dump.</b> This polluted water has a neutral pH with elevated uranium and sulfate concentrations. The final conclusion was that the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> produces neutral mine drainage (NMD). An additional finding was that high run-off water from the <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> infiltrates through the prevailing bedding planes and joints in the underlying dolomites. This, together with the weight of the <b>rock</b> <b>dump,</b> contributed to the formation of small sinkholes. Master...|$|R

40|$|Waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> {{represent}} {{among the}} largest remnant structures of open pit mining operations. They can absorb {{a large proportion of}} the mine 2 Ì† 7 s operating costs, and can be costly to rehabilitate. Poor design, construction and rehabilitation of waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> can produce a major safety risk and environmental hazard. There are many examples worldwide where poor design and construction of waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> have resulted in failures causing considerable loss of life and widespread damage, or have resulted in erosion and seepage that have led to severe environmental pollution. The proper design and scheduling of waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> and haul routes can significantly reduce costs, minimise the possibility of failures, and avoid harming the environment. The first part of the paper discusses waste rock haulage costs and waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> design in open pit mining operations, and describes the development and application of waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> scheduling model using the Operations Research technique of Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). The model focuses on minimising the haulage cost for each block of waste rock taken from the open pit and placed in the dump. Allowance is also made for the selective placement of benign and reactive waste rock, based on an open pit block model that delineates the different rock types. The second part of the paper employs the proposed model to schedule real mine site data. The findings and applicability of the methods are discussed in the final section of the paper...|$|R
40|$|Mining has {{occurred}} at the Hercules Ag, Au, Cu, Pb, Zn VHMS deposit in western Tasmania, almost continuously for the last I 00 years. Mining activity has degraded the local environment, through clearing of vegetation, enhanced erosion {{and the formation of}} acid mine drainage (AMD). Of significant concern is the Bakers Creek waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump,</b> situated in a waterfall in the upper reaches of Bakers Creek. This steep, unstable sulfidic rock pile cannot be readily removed or engineered, and is an on-going source of AMD. To allow rehabilitation options for the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> to be devised, the contribution of AMD from the Bakers Creek waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> needed to be ascertained. Long term and intensive water sampling programs have been implemented to characterise and quantify AMD emanating from the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump,</b> and to investigate climatic controls on water quality of Bakers Creek. Water samples were collected from ten sites along Bakers Creek, where field analyses of pH, Eh, conductivity and temperature were conducted. Water samples were collected for laboratory analyses of major and trace element concentrations, sulphate, chloride and alkalinity. The pH of the drainage waters vary from 5. 6 (upstream of mining activity) to 3. 0 (foot of the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump).</b> Maximum metal concentrations were measured at the adit, or the base of the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump.</b> Major contaminants are Fe (43. 8 ppm), Pb (19. 2 ppm), AI (8. 47 ppm) and Sulfate (1440 ppm) and Zn (82. 2 ppm).

40|$|Abstract. PT Freeport Indonesia {{constructed}} a large trial waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> {{as a part}} of acid rock drainage (ARD) Management Program in 1999. The purposes of constructing the trial waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> were to observe physical and geochemical behaviors of field-scale waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps,</b> and to investigate oxidation and leaching behaviors in order to optimize dump design for ARD mitigation. This paper presents the analysis and results of data collected during the 4 -year test period. Results suggest that variations in oxygen and temperature profiles observed within the trial dump panels depend on the type of waste rock, particle size distribution and dumping methods. The placement of coarse rock layers was observed to promote oxygen transfer into the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump.</b> Barometric pressure did not vary significantly between the atmosphere and the interior of the dump. The application of an impermeable surface cover was observed to have only a limited effect on oxygen concentrations within the profile of the waste rock.

40|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} (ARD) from sulphide bearing waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> poses {{a serious}} threat to the environment and has become problematic to the mining industry. Water that is discharged from sulphide waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> {{has the potential to be}} low in pH, thus having the ability to transport heavy metals. The acid water and the heavy metals in solution became toxic to the environment. Acid rock drainage from sulphide bearing waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> is the most serious environmental liability in the mining industry; believed to be $ 3. 2 billion for 750 million tonnes of waste rock in Canada alone (Feasby et al., 1997). The understanding of the characteristics and quantity of water flow through waste rock has become fundamental. A complete hydrologic characterization was performed for the sulphide waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> at Equity Silver Mine Ltd. near Houston, Be (575 km north northwest of Vancouver, Canada). The characterization of the hydrologic system entailed the investigation of five elements: geologic structure, topography, surface hydrology, groundwater and water chemistry. The hydrologic budget was determined for the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump.</b> The components are as follows: precipitation, runoff, sublimation, mass transfer, evapotranspiration, changes in storage, infiltration and groundwater. Precipitation was measured with an on site weather station. The runoff was measured for the 1998 freshet with a series of weirs and culverts that were instrumented to measure runoffwater. The remaining surface components were determined by the SoilCover (1997) model, a one dimensional finite difference heat and mass transfer program. The groundwater component was investigated using a numerical model, FEMW A TER (ECGL, 1998), which can solve three dimensional saturated or unsaturated groundwater flow regime systems. All of the surface hydrological components are required in order to equalize the surface water balance for the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump.</b> The components of the surface hydrological budget during the one year study period over the area of the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> are as follows: precipitation of 642 mm, 94 rnm (15 %) runoff, 327 mm (51 %) evapotranspiration, 27 rnm (4 %) infiltration, 97 mm (15 %) sublimation and 97 rnm (15 %) mass transfer. The cover system lost 9 rnm of water during the one year study period; thus the net surface infiltration was 36 rnm (6 %). The water balance relationship for the acid rock drainage collection ditch that surrounds the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> was evaluated. The contributions to the ditch are: runoff, infiltration, groundwater discharge and changes in storage. The water balance for the drainage ditch showed that the acid rock drainage flow reporting to the ditch is equivalent to 318 rnm of water per year over the area of the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump.</b> The components of this total flow are estimated to be 36 mm (11 %) infiltration, 27 mm (9 %) runoff, 252 mm (79 %) groundwater discharge and 3 mm (1 %) due to changes in storage within the waste rock...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{behaviour}} of a falling apron made from 'poorly sorted' material. It is a follow-up of a report, which was made by a Dutch student, Marc van der Hoeven, with the title: "The behaviour of a falling apron". In {{the end of the}} last century a complex river training work had to be done in con- nection with the construction of the Jamuna Bridge in Bangladesh crossing one of the largest rivers of the world. The Jamuna River has a strong changing character and the morphological behaviour is difficult to predict. By means of two banana-formed guide bunds the span of the bridge could be reduced from 15 km to 5 km. The constriction forced to an additional protection of the guide bunds. At the toe <b>loose</b> <b>rock</b> material was <b>dumped,</b> which 'fall' down' and covers the slope when erosion occurs. This is the reason why this kind of exibel protection is called 'falling apron'. In the previous study from Marc van der Hoeven only 'well sorted' material was used for the experiments, material with a narrow grading. In reality these falling aprons are made from material with a wide grading, called 'poorly sorted' material. For this reason a further study was demanded from the contractor Ballast-Ham-Dredging from the Netherlands. The experiments in a flume were mainly done with the aim to get information about the setting process of a falling apron, to determine the angle of the slope and the thickness of the protective layer after a ow attack. In two experiments it was found that the developing slope angle was approximately 1 : 2 and the setting process was evenly spread over the entire slope. A layer with an average thickness of the characteristic stone diameter of D 50 protected the emerging slope. This single layer does not stop the erosion, but it slows down the scour development and this even better in comparison to the 'well sorted' material. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|A {{knowledge}} of {{angle of repose}} and stability of waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> slopes is of vital importance at all mine sites. Conventional slope stability analyses model slopes in plane strain. In reality, slopes advance in a curvilinear pattern in plan and hence produce slope faces that are either convex or concave in plan. The three - dimensional shape of the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> {{is similar to that}} of a solid body of revolution, which may be modelled using a two-dimensional grid and a radial coordinate system. A 250 m high in-pit waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> at Kidston Gold Mines Limited, North Queensland, Australia was modelled using this technique. The analysis showed that adopting a non-linear Mohr-Columb envelope resulted in a more deeply - seated failure plane than would occur using a linear envelope. A slope with a concave advancing face in plan was stable at an angle at least 2 Â° steeper than an identical slope advancing in a straight line in plan. On the other hand, a convex advancing slope was only just stable at an angle of 0. 5 Â° flatter than an identical slope advancing in a straight lin...|$|R
40|$|The peak shear {{strength}} of rock joints obtained from direct shear tests, and the peak {{shear strength}} of rockfill, as interpreted from large-scale triaxial tests, have common non-linear strength envelopes. An extremely low stress index test for rock joints, the tilt test, with an apparent normal stress {{as low as}} 0. 001 MPa when sliding occurs, can also be performed to characterise rockfill. However for rockfill or <b>rock</b> <b>dumps,</b> larger samples with relevant particle sizes are desirable. Some full-scale tests at a dam site in Italy, using a 2 x 2 x 5 m tilt-shear test, were able to sample the as-compacted-as-built rockfill, with no need for using parallel (model) grading curves with reduced-sized particles. Interfaces between the rockfill or <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> and eventual <b>rock</b> foundations, can be handled with similar shear strength estimation methods. In each case, a low-stress index test result is extrapolated to full scale and to engineering stress level by related non-linear strength laws. It is possible to estimate each through inexpensive characterisation. The non-linear, stress-dependent friction angles suggest that large <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> with constant slope angle will have strongly reducing factors of safety {{from top to bottom}} and from outside to inside. ...|$|R

40|$|Understanding how {{rainfall}} infiltrates, {{is stored}} within and is transported through surface waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> {{is essential to}} predicting the release rates of mineral weathering products to the environment. Infiltration is commonly assumed to be 50 % of annual rainfall. There are however a lack of field data to confirm this. Further, there is poor understanding of the fate of rainfall infiltration; the proportion that goes into storage within the dump and the proportion that emerges {{from the base of}} the dump as seepage. In addition, there is poor understanding of the size of rainfall event necessary to trigger base seepage and the time delay before base seepage emerges following the rainfall event, and how these parameters change as the <b>dump</b> wets-up. Waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> are heterogeneous in nature, with conventional end-dumping of waste rock from a tip head resulting in a base rubble zone, alternating angle of repose coarse and fine-grained layers within the dump, and a traffic-compacted top surface, creating highly non-uniform pore distributions and preferred flow paths. These preferred flow paths are likely to dominate the transport of water through the dump.

These waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> are the cause of many environmental problems and partially {{pose a threat to}} the population. The aim of this work is the development of tools for the design and assessment of stabilization measures for these waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps.</b> Initially, a utility analysis is carried out to find the most appropriate stabilization measures, considering the local conditions and circumstances. The required material properties and shear strength parameters for the evaluation of slope stability are obtained from field and laboratory tests. It is found, that a linear approximation of standard shear test results overestimates the shear strength at low normal stresses. Thus, further shear tests are carried out at low normal stresses with a newly developed mobile shear testing device. A new approach is being developed to describe the nonlinear shear strength envelope at low normal stresses and improve the approximation of the shear test results. Based on this new nonlinear approach, several design charts are created and can be used for the evaluation of slope stability, depending on the slope geometry and the material properties. The evaluation of erosion is carried out using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The required parameters for the material of the investigated Vietnamese waste <b>rock</b> <b>dumps</b> are determined and calculation results are matched with results from an on-site monitoring of erosion using a terrestrial 3 D-laserscanner. Based on RUSLE calculations with these parameters, a design chart for the evaluation of erosion of the waste <b>rock</b> <b>dump</b> slopes is being created. As a possible application for the developed methods and design charts is presented, using the example of a realized dump stabilization measure. The evaluation approaches for the evaluation of slope stability and erosion are implemented in a cost comparison model to identify the most economical stabilization concept. As further application, the implementation of the developed approaches in a Geographic Information System (GIS) is outlined in an outlook. The new approaches allow an improved calculation of slope stability and erosion in a GIS...|$|R
