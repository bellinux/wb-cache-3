40|$|A robust {{mathematical}} model of one-dimensional flow for sloping, blocked-end border irrigation was developed using the four-point implicit method {{to solve the}} Saint-Venant equations, the volume-balance solution method, and the implementation of new algorithms to avoid numerical instability and solution divergence. The model has the capability of successfully simulating all surface irrigation phases in blocked-end borders {{for a range of}} inflow rates (0. 01 - 0. 05 m 3 /s per m), <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slopes</b> (up to 1. 00 %), and border lengths (100 - 500 m). To achieve numerical stability over the specified parameter ranges, the model was divided into three parts: (1) advance-phase simulation which uses the four-point implicit solution method of the Saint-Venant equations, with an algorithm that changes the spatial and temporal weighting, in addition to an algorithm that handles the water depth profile at the blocked-end downstream boundary upon completion of the advance phase; (2) simultaneous advance-recession-phase calculations using a hybrid algorithm to solve the governing equations; and (3) recession-phase simulation using the four-point implicit method until (and if) divergence occurs, then the volume-method is applied to complete the simulation. The three parts also involve the use of computational grid management algorithms and a parabolic equation which defines the Chezy coefficient as a function of water depth. The model incorporates the downhill simplex optimization method to determine the recommended inflow rate and irrigation cutoff time, maximizing a composite irrigation efficiency (water requirement efficiency and application efficiency). Different optimum values of inflow rate and irrigation cutoff time for a range of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slopes,</b> border lengths, and soil types were generated. Most of the optimum values are for relatively high inflow rate and rapid cutoff time. In addition, exponential relations were developed, based on the simulation results, to determine the best irrigation time for maximization of the composite irrigation efficiency for specified, non-optimal inflow rates. The exponential relations are particularly useful in practice when it is not feasible to use the optimum inflow rate due to constraints at the water source, or because of irrigation scheduling issues...|$|R

Therefore, the understanding and prediction of entrainment and transport dynamics of woody material of different shapes, density and dimensions is of great interest for river managers.

The previous 2 D SPH sediment initiation model is expanded by combining the effects of both transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sloping</b> beds in a practical 3 D situation. To validate the developed model, a laboratory flume experiment was carried out to study the clear water scouring around a vertical cylinder under unidirectional current, in which high-speed video cameras were used for the real-time monitoring of sediment movement.

40|$|In {{article was}} {{formulated}} and {{solved the problem}} of conditional nonlinear technical and economic optimization of the distance between intermediate supports, uniform in height, during {{the design of the}} cable metro lines in highly urban-ized city environment. The optimization problem involves a single-criterion objective function that expresses the cost of construction of the cable metro line (total cost of intermediate supports and their foundations, traction and carrying steel cables and technical equipment). The specified objective function subject to minimization by finding the optimal combination of the distance between intermediate supports and tension carrying ropes with accounting constructive, modal, structural and planning constraints in the form of nonlinear inequalities. The optimization algorithm was based on the direct method of optimization type, Hooke-Jeeves, which was modified taking into account the need of varying the height of intermediate supports with a constant step equal to the step of unification. When constructing the objective function were considered three possible forms sagging of carrying ropes, which can be implemented for various values of the efforts of their tension. Analysis was done of the influence of the step unification and minimum size of interme-diate supports on their optimum step, the cost of intermediate supports, the cost of 1 km cable metro line for different values of the angle of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slope</b> of the surface relief along the cable metro line. The graph of height of uni-fied supports from the angle of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slope</b> of the surface relief has discrete-step type. With the increase of the step unify the discreteness increases: the width of the range of angles of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slope</b> of the surface relief within which the height of the supports remains constant, increases. The graph of step installation of unified supports along the cable metro line from the angle of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slope</b> of the surface relief also has discrete-step type. The transition to a larger height unified intermediate supports determines the need for installation of supports with a large pitch. Its value then begins to decrease monotonically with further increase of the angle of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slope</b> of the surface relief until it needs to transition to the new size of supports. Synchronous change in the optimal values of the height and step of the installation of intermediate supports, depending on the angle of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slope</b> of the sur-face relief leads {{to the fact that the}} optimal cost characteristics of the cable metro lines are smooth functions. It has an extreme character with a minimum at angles of inclination of the surface elevation ~ 5 degrees, which is associated with the form of sagging of the load-bearing ropes. Unification of intermediate supports has little effect on the optimal cost characteristics of the cable metro lines. Even for a sufficiently large step of the unification the largest difference in op-timal value is almost insignificant: it lies in the range of 2 [...] . 3 %, increasing with increasing the angle of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slope</b> of the surface relief and unit cost of the intermediate support. Unification of intermediate supports according to the height and their step practically does not affect the optimal value for horizontal tension on the load-bearing ropes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study dealing with the risk for heavy vehicles in ramps. Two approaches are used. On one hand, statistics are applied on several accidents databases to detect if ramps are more risky for heavy vehicles and to define a critical value for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slope.</b> test confirmed the risk in ramps and statistical analysis proved that a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slope</b> superior to 3. 2 % represents a higher risk for heavy vehicles. On another hand, numerical simulations allow defining the speed profile in ramps for two types of heavy vehicles (tractor semi-trailer and 2 -axles rigid body) and different loads. The simulations showed that heavy vehicles must drive more than 1000 m on ramps to reach their minimum speed. Moreover, when the slope is superior to 3. 2 %, tractor semi-trailer presents a strong decrease of their speed until 50 km/h. This situation represents a high risk of collision with other road users which drive at 80 - 90 km/h. Thus, both methods led to the determination of a risky configuration for heavy vehicles: ramps with a length superior to 1000 m and a slope superior to 3. 2 %.

Two ASCAT and three SeaWinds products are compared in nine regions (classified as rainy or dry) in the tropical Pacific between 10 S and 10 N and 140 and 260 E for the period November 2008 to October 2009. Monthly and regionally averaged longitudinal and transverse structure func-tions are calculated using along-track samples. To ease the analysis, the following quantities were estimated for the scale range 50 to 300 km and used to intercompare the wind products: (i) structure function slopes, (ii) turbulent kinetic energies (TKE), and (iii) vorticity-to-divergence ratios. All wind products are in good qualita-tive agreement, but also have important differences. Structure function slopes and TKE differ per wind prod-uct, but also show a common variation over time and space.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research project called IRCAD, which aimed at developing a global system to warn drivers in real time, when their behaviour is not adapted to infrastructure characteristics. The warning system is based on the comparison between the speed of a vehicle before a curve and a safety speed. This safety speed is defined as the maximum speed value before crash all along the curve (safety speed profile). These thresholds values of speed are calculated in real time depending both on constant parameters like infrastructure geometry (radius of curvature, cross and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>slopes)</b> and changing parameters like skid resistance, which is evolving with the weather conditions (wind, rain). This study is divided into three parts. In a first step, a water-depth model was developed to predict the water film thickness in the curve taking into account the road geometry and the rainfall intensity. On a second step, the skid resistance decrease due to the water film is evaluated. Then, the maximum speed is calculated by considering these corrected friction values. In a third step, experimentation is realized on two sites located on French secondary roads. To conclude, this system is proved to be very efficient and useful considering the fact that the models use data easy to obtain for road managers and that the warning sign only starts when the situation presents a real risk...|$|R
