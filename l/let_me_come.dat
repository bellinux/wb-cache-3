2500|$|In a March 30, 2010 {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel explained why {{she decided to}} move on from the character: I had {{tried to make it}} work with All My Children. I don’t have a business head, so I don’t really make business decisions; every decision I make in my life is emotional and it was difficult to feel that the show wasn’t... that Bianca was getting lost. That who she was, was getting lost. I went back several times and they were so lovely to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>come</b> back and play a character I love with the people I love so many times. But I felt that the people making the show didn’t really understand what Bianca was about anymore... It troubled me. I got letters from people to whom Bianca meant a great deal essentially saying, [...] "Please don’t come back. We can't take it anymore." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Good-bye once more, {{my dearest}} Father. You will, I trust, receive this budget {{about the time}} of your birthday. How I think of you day and night, and how I thank you for all your love, and perhaps most of all, not only <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>come</b> to Melanesia, but for your great love in never calling me away from my work even to see your face once more on earth.|$|R

But I'd have died if I couldn't have come. And she wasn't a bit cross when I told her I {{had gone to the}} magic lantern show. That's an awful bad sign.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} two methods {{to solve the}} Simultaneous Localization And Mapping problem are presented. The {{classical}} extended Kalman filter {{is used as a}} reference from where an efficient particle filter is examined, which uses deterministic samples called sigma points. Most of the effort is put on implementing these algorithms together with the Symmetries and Permutations Model, but a preliminary comparison of the methods has been done as well. Experiments show that linearization errors make the map inaccurate over long periods of time, and methods are discussed which decrease these effects. i Acknowledgements I {{would like to thank the}} Robotics, Perception and Real Time Group at the Centro Politécnico Superior of the Universidad de Zaragoza for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>come.</b> Pr.
