5|$|As far {{as can be}} determined, between arches 2 to 21, {{the outer}} facing of the {{superstructure}} consists of four <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> brick, followed by <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> rough stonemasonry bound with mortar. In contrast, between arches 22 and 26, {{as well as in}} both ramps on either end, the facing consists of ashlar blocks. The two repaired arches 27a and 27b are differentiated from the earlier work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly placed brick tiles. In arch 26, the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of the falsework.|$|E

5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> the peridium.|$|E

5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|Above these ignimbrites {{are found}} {{sedimentary}} rocks of the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. These were deposited in water, probably in a caldera lake, as the volcanic rocks weathered and were eroded. Structures in these rocks suggest the faults were still active and the caldera was still subsiding. <b>Layers</b> <b>of</b> tuff and lapilli-tuff indicate some ongoing volcanism.|$|E
5|$|Algorithmic {{analysis}} {{of images of}} artworks, for example using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art.

5|$|All of the localities that Eolambia were {{discovered}} in belong to the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. Predominant rocks in the Mussentuchit consist of interleaved light gray to gray <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> muddy sandstone and mudstone. Deposits representing two separate river channel systems are also present in the Mussentuchit. The lower of these systems consists of four layers, respectively of muddy sandstone, fine-grained sandstone, silty mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone, with the latter two layers bearing plant debris. The Cifelli #2 Quarry is associated with this system. The upper system consists of greenish fine-grained sandstone. Three <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> bentonite clay layers, representing volcanic ash deposits, are also present in the Mussentuchit, being respectively whitish-gray, yellow, and tan in color. The middle of these layers cuts through the Cifelli #2 Quarry. Bentonite is also present within the sandstone itself throughout the Mussentuchit. In the Cifelli #2 quarry, the bones themselves are blackened, having been replaced by calcite, quartz, pyrite, and carbonate-hydroxyapatite.|$|E
5|$|All three {{ships were}} {{fitted with a}} shallow anti-torpedo bulge {{integral}} to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship.

5|$|Although the <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> pinacocytes and choanocytes {{resemble}} the epithelia of more complex animals, {{they are not}} bound tightly by cell-to-cell connections or a basal lamina (thin fibrous sheet underneath).
