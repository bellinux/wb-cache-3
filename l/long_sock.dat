25|$|The {{pitch is}} {{rectangular}} with rounded corners 55 metres (60 yards) by 33 metres (36 yards) with three hoops of varying heights at either end. The sport {{was created in}} 2005 and is therefore still quite young. However, quidditch is played {{around the world and}} actively growing. The ultimate goal is to have more points than the other team by the time the snitch, a tennis ball inside a <b>long</b> <b>sock</b> hanging from the shorts of an impartial official dressed in yellow, is caught. Rules of the sport are governed by the International Quidditch Association, or the IQA, and events are sanctioned by either the IQA or that nation's governing body.|$|E
25|$|The snitch is {{a tennis}} ball placed {{at the bottom of}} a yellow <b>long</b> <b>sock</b> which is {{attached}} to the back of the snitch runner's shorts as if it were a tail. The snitch runner may do everything in their power to protect the snitch from being caught by seekers. Only seekers may make advances towards the snitch or the snitch runner, and no forceful contact with the snitch runner is allowed. If the snitch is not caught within a certain period of time, a series of handicaps go into effect against the runner to limit their freedom of movement, one at a time. The game ends when one of the seekers grabs the snitch, awarding 30 points to their team.|$|E
5000|$|Carlin {{eventually}} {{gets his}} revenge on Banks. He uses a makeshift cosh from a <b>long</b> <b>sock</b> with two snooker balls inside to beat Banks's crony, then confronts Banks {{in the bathroom}} and replaces him as the [...] "Daddy" [...] of the ward. Carlin later acquires power over the adjacent wing of the borstal by administering a vicious beating to the adjacent wing's Daddy.|$|E
5000|$|Lerby {{always played}} with his [...] "socks down" [...] - short <b>socks</b> or <b>long</b> <b>socks</b> rolled down but always without shin pads. This was quite {{uncommon}} {{of the day}} and would be against the rules today.|$|R

50|$|Knickerbockers {{are often}} worn in {{baseball}} as pants, a custom {{that has been}} practiced even since long pants became widely used in the U.S. The traditional knickerbockers of old were more like pants that had been folded back with <b>long</b> <b>socks.</b>|$|R
50|$|New Zealand whitebait {{are caught}} in the lower reaches of the rivers using large, open-mouthed, {{hand-held}} scoop nets, <b>long</b> <b>sock</b> nets, or rigid, typically wedge-shaped set nets. Whitebaiters must constantly attend the nets in order to lift them as soon as a shoal enters the net, otherwise the whitebait quickly swim back out of the net. Whitebaiters may fish from platforms known as a 'stand', which may include screens to direct the fish and systems for raising and lowering nets.|$|E

5000|$|A woman's {{customary}} {{dress was}} a lilac kircher or bonnet with ribbons, {{and a large}} frock worn as the main garment, with ribbons of various colors tying them across the waist. A man wore a waistcoat, short trousers and <b>long</b> <b>socks</b> with a hat.|$|R

40|$|Around Christmas 1942, Pope Pius XII {{issued a}} small {{notebook}} to {{prisoners of war}} held in POW camps in Italy. Compact in its 14 cm x 9 cm dimensions, {{the first half of}} the 48 -page notebook comprised a calendar month per page, and blank 'memorandum' pages. On each page of {{the first half of the}} booklet were brief quotes taken from speeches by Pope Pius, presumably offered for reflection and inspiration. Christmas and Easter hymns populated the remaining pages. Although its compact size did not provide for extensive diary entries, it offered more than enough for a POW to record key dates, places, and names. It kept track of the welcome issue of Red Cross parcels, and of mail from home. Owing to the source of its distribution, it was considered to be reasonably immune from confiscation by camp authorities. Conveniently, it was a perfect size for an escaped POW to stuff into a kit bag, under a shirt, or into a <b>long</b> <b>sock...</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{cultural}} confusion {{between the}} dag and bogan archetypes {{in the media}} is exemplified by the 1998 film, Dags, which whilst incorporating a few features of archetypal dag clothing style for the men such as <b>long</b> <b>socks,</b> Hawaiian shirts and sandals, has the women in tank tops and hot pants quite unassociated with the dag archetype, and portrays typical bogan archetypes throughout the film of slovenliness, substance abuse and indiscriminate sex.|$|R
5000|$|The Aaron Monument is {{a public}} art work by artist Brian Maughan. [...] It is located {{in front of the}} Miller Park stadium west of {{downtown}} Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The sculpture depicts Hank Aaron, a member of the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team, in a batting stance. The figure wears the uniform of the winners of the 1957 World Series: <b>long</b> <b>socks,</b> loose-fitting knee-length pants, a button-front short-sleeved jersey and a cap. The sculpture was dedicated on April 5, 2001.|$|R

The girls' uniform is complemented by white ankle socks and black school shoes.|$|R
5000|$|Argyle {{knitwear}} became fashionable in Great Britain {{and then}} in the USA after the First World War of 1914-1918. Pringle of Scotland popularised the design, helped by its identification with the [...] Duke of Windsor (in office 1937-1972). Pringle's website says that [...] "the iconic Pringle argyle design was developed" [...] in the 1920s. The Duke, like others, used this pattern for golf clothing: both for jerseys and for the <b>long</b> <b>socks</b> needed for the plus-fours trouser fashion of the day.|$|R
50|$|Carnwath also {{hosts the}} oldest foot race in Scotland - and {{probably}} Europe - The Red Hose Race, {{dating back to}} March 13th 1508! It has seen many changes over almost 500 years but the running of The Red Hose is still a strong tradition in Carnwath. Just incase you are wondering, hose was the Scots word for stockings or <b>long</b> <b>socks,</b> and each year a foot race is run at Carnwath and the local Laird must provide a pair of red stockings as the prize.|$|R

500|$|... "Borderline" [...] {{was added}} to the set list of the first leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour in 2008 during the [...] "Old School" [...] section of the performance. Madonna wore gym shorts, sneakers and <b>long</b> <b>socks</b> in this section. The outfit was {{designed}} by Jeremy Scott and was a reference to Madonna's old days in New York. A punk-pop version of the song was performed by Madonna while playing a purple electric guitar on a microphone as the backdrops displayed Keith Harring's cartoons and graphical imagery.|$|R
5000|$|Stirrup socks {{are worn}} {{on top of}} <b>long</b> <b>socks</b> called [...] "sanitaries," [...] usually white in color. This is because early color dyes in the outer stirrup sock were thought to pose health issues, {{as well as the}} fact that the inner, less {{expensive}} white sock could be changed more frequently. The stirrup sock lacked a foot, instead having a loop ("stirrup") which fits within the instep of the foot. Over the years, the stirrup loop tended to get longer, exposing more of the white undersock, thus creating a look unique to baseball.|$|R

Williams, and Melonville's corrupt Mayor Tommy Shanks. Other characters included the cheerful Leutonian clarinetist Yosh Shmenge, who was {{half of the}} Happy Wanderers {{and the subject of}} the mockumentary The Last Polka, folksy fishin' musician Gil Fisher, handsome if accent-challenged TV actor Steve Roman, Pippy <b>Long</b> <b>Socks,</b> hapless children's entertainer Mr. Messenger, corrupt soap-opera doctor William Wainwright, smut merchant Harry, [...] "the Guy With the Snake on His Face", and Giorgy, everyone's favourite Cossack.|$|R
5000|$|The raw shellac, which {{contains}} bark shavings and lac bugs removed during scraping, {{is placed in}} canvas tubes (much like <b>long</b> <b>socks)</b> and heated over a fire. This causes the shellac to liquefy, and it seeps out of the canvas, leaving the bark and bugs behind. The thick, sticky shellac is then dried into a flat sheet and broken into flakes, or dried into [...] "buttons" [...] (pucks/cakes), then bagged and sold. The end-user then crushes it into a fine powder and mixes it with ethyl alcohol before use, to dissolve the flakes and make liquid shellac.|$|R
5000|$|Perry is {{also known}} as [...] "Socks" [...] because of the high <b>long</b> <b>socks</b> he wore during his college and NBA career. A quick and {{slashing}} player in college, his ability to alter his shot in mid-air to draw a foul from his defender made him very dangerous to defend. Lack of quality supporting players forced Perry to carry the U of M team on his skill. During his senior year Anfernee Hardaway had been scheduled to be his teammate, but Hardaway's academic qualifying woes ensured he was red-shirted, and these two never were able to team up.|$|R

50|$|Fourstars Allstar was a {{bay horse}} {{with a white}} blaze and a <b>long</b> white <b>sock</b> on his left foreleg bred in New York by his owner Richard Bomze. The colt was trained {{throughout}} his racing career by Leo O'Brien.|$|R
50|$|The British Army and the Navy {{required}} men to wear long woolen knee highs. They were to worn {{for protection}} in the trenches, preventing foot rot. Many women sent <b>long</b> knitted <b>socks</b> to the troops during both World Wars.|$|R
50|$|Socks are avoided, {{especially}} on shorter races, to give faster transitions, {{as they are}} not legal in swimming. If they are used they should be fast to put on. Not using socks can cause abrasion which might be painful. Triathletes should practice running the intended distance in the racing shoes without socks. There are triathlon specialty shoes with seamless insides, prepared for <b>long</b> distances without <b>socks.</b> On the Ironman distance some athletes use <b>long</b> compression <b>socks</b> in the expectation that an enhanced endurance will compensate for the extra time spent to put them on.|$|R
