The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of <b>Luke,</b> <b>and</b> one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.|$|E
5|$|Bach had {{composed}} his Christmas Oratorio, {{based on}} the gospels of <b>Luke</b> <b>and</b> Matthew, in 1734, a work in six parts to be performed on six occasions during Christmas tide.

The text for the Ascension Oratorio, a compilation of several biblical sources, free poetry and chorales, was presumably written by Picander who had written the libretti for the St Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio, among others. It follows {{the story of the}} Ascension as told in Luke, Mark and the Acts of the Apostles.|$|E
