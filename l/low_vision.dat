In netball, she was a goal keeper and goal attack, represented Victoria several times and was named as an emergency for the Australian U16 team. In the Victorian league's Championship Division, she represented both Palladians and Altona Lightning. In basketball, she represented the Geelong Cats {{for five years and}} also represented Victoria Country. At that time, her goal was to become a professional netball or basketball player.

We obtain tight bounds on the complexity, {{considered as a}} function of two variables simultaneously: the number of processors, the required precision. This result seems to be new even in serial case. Our results will provide a benchmark for the intrinsic difficulty of visual surface reconstrution. With this, one can compare its computational complexity with the cost any algorithm that solves the problem to tell how well the given algorithm measures up.

The {{association between}} performance on several <b>low</b> contrast spatial <b>vision</b> measures, glare recovery, color discrimination, flicker sensitivity, stereopsis and ocular disease status at baseline and acuity loss 4. 4 years later was examined {{in a large}} aged random sample with good initial acuity. In univariate analyses, several vision measures, retinal disease status and age were each significant predictors of subsequent acuity loss. In a multiple regression analysis, only <b>low</b> contrast spatial <b>vision</b> was a significant predictor, but the other vision measures, retinal disease status and age were not. For each doubling of <b>low</b> contrast spatial <b>vision</b> threshold at baseline, individuals were more than two {{times as likely to}} suffer subsequent significant visual acuity loss.

25|$|Studies {{indicate}} that children carrying the disease genotype benefit from presymptomatic counseling {{in order to}} prepare for the physical and social implications associated with progressive vision loss.

Corrective visual aids and personalized vision therapy provided by <b>Low</b> <b>Vision</b> Specialists may help patients correct slight disturbances in visual acuity and optimize their remaining visual field.

Hence, using customized <b>low</b> latency <b>vision</b> sensors for the purposes of machine vision presents a feasible alternative. A suitable example of such a low latency, <b>low</b> power <b>vision</b> sensor is the event-driven 128 x 128 pixel CMOS vision sensor, DVS 128, which responds to changes in log intensity in the observed scene.

It was a Venice all of evil that had broken out for them alike, so that they were together in their anxiety, if they really could have met on it; a Venice of cold lashing rain from a low black sky, of wicked wind raging through narrow passes, of general arrest and interruption, with the people engaged in all the water-life huddled, stranded and wageless, bored and cynical, under archways and bridges. Our young man's mute exchange with his friend contained meanwhile such a depth of reference that, had the pressure been but slightly prolonged, they might have reached a point at which they were equally weak. Each had verily something in mind that would have made a hash of mutual suspicion and in presence of which, as a possibility, they were more united than disjoined. But it was to have been a moment for Densher that nothing could ease off--not even the formal propriety with which his interlocutor finally attended him to the portone and bowed upon his retreat. Nothing had passed about his coming back, and the air had made itself felt as a non-conductor of messages. Densher knew of course, as he took his way again, that Eugenio's invitation to return was not what he missed; yet he knew {{at the same time that}} what had happened to him was part of his punishment. Out in the square beyond the fondamenta that gave access to the land-gate of the palace, out where the wind was higher, he fairly, with the thought of it, pulled his umbrella closer down. It couldn't be, his consciousness, unseen enough by others--the base predicament of having, by a concatenation, just to take such things: such things as the fact that one very acute person in the world, whom he couldn't dispose of as an interested scoundrel, enjoyed an opinion of him that there was no attacking, no disproving, no (what was worst of all) even noticing.
