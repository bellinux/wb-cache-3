50|$|Traditional rocket designs {{use this}} sweet spot to their {{advantage}} via staging. For instance the Saturn Vs used a lower stage powered by RP-1 (kerosene) and upper stages <b>powered</b> by <b>LH2.</b> Some of the early Space Shuttle design efforts used similar designs, with one stage using kerosene into the upper atmosphere, where an <b>LH2</b> <b>powered</b> upper stage would light and go on from there. The later Shuttle design is somewhat similar, although it used solid rockets for its lower stages.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{configurations}} of Vulcan {{will use the}} same Centaur upper stage as the Atlas V, with its existing RL10 engines. A later advanced cryogenic upper stage — called the Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES) — is conceptually planned for full development by ULA in the late 2010s. ACES would be LOX and liquid hydrogen (<b>LH2)</b> <b>powered</b> by one to four rocket engines yet to be selected. This upper stage will include the Integrated Vehicle Fluids technology that could allow long on-orbit life of the upper stage, measured in weeks rather than hours.|$|R

5|$|Aerobatic {{competitions}} {{take place}} for both <b>powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> and gliders, {{with up to}} 30 events {{each year in the}} UK and Ireland. Starting at the Beginner level, pilots can move up to Standard (<b>powered</b> <b>aircraft)</b> or Sports (glider) levels, and then on to Intermediate, Advanced, and finally Unlimited classes. Each step up requires a wider repertoire of aerobatic figures and progressively more performance from the aircraft. National championships are awarded annually at Standard/Sports, Intermediate, Advanced (<b>powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> only), and Unlimited levels, and pilots who have reached Advanced and Unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent the UK in international competition.|$|R
