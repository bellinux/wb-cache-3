5|$|From {{the success}} of the Strøget's {{transformation}} into a pedestrian zone in Copenhagen in the 1960s and his influential book Life Between Buildings, Jan Gehl earned an international reputation in urban design.

His work has often drawn on Copenhagen and its bicycle culture, {{to improve the quality of}} public space in city centres.|$|E
5|$|In February 1996, {{a single}} Shore Line East weekday round trip was {{extended}} from Old Saybrook to New London.

Weekend Shore Line East service between Old Saybrook and New Haven Union Station began in 2008, but no regular weekend trains ran to New London.|$|E
5|$|The planned railway had two tracks {{each for}} freight and {{passenger}} traffic.

5|$|Accompanying Pratap {{were other}} Indians from the Berlin Committee, notably Champakaraman Pillai and the Islamic scholar and Indian {{nationalist}} Maulavi Barkatullah. Barkatullah {{had long been}} associated with the Indian revolutionary movement, having worked with the India House in <b>London</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York from 1903. In 1909, he moved to Japan, where he continued his anti-British activities. Taking the post of Professor of Urdu at Tokyo University, he visited Constantinople in 1911. However, his Tokyo tenure was terminated under diplomatic pressure from Britain. He returned to the United States in 1914, later proceeding to Berlin, where he joined the efforts of the Berlin Committee. Barkatullah had as early as 1895 been acquainted with Nasrullah Khan, the brother of the Afghan Emir, Habibullah Khan.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the Hong Kong dollar {{left its}} 16:1 peg with the Pound {{sterling}} and {{switched to the}} current US-HK Dollar peg. Hong Kong's competitiveness in manufacturing gradually declined due to rising labour and property costs, {{as well as new}} development in southern China under the Open Door Policy introduced in 1978 which opened up China to foreign business. Nevertheless, towards the early 1990s, Hong Kong had established itself as a global financial centre along with <b>London</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York City, a regional hub for logistics and freight, one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia and the world's exemplar of Laissez-faire market policy.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, Governor Dannel Malloy {{announced}} that 5 weekend round trips would {{be extended to}} New London beginning in April 2013. However, the extension was dependent on ongoing negotiations with the marine industry over mandated closings of the Old Saybrook – Old Lyme bridge. Two weekday midday trips were added in May 2013, while weekend service began on June 1, 2013, after the application for additional bridge closings {{was approved by the}} state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Because Shore Line East service to New London is limited, Amtrak honors monthly Shore Line East passes on select intercity trains between New <b>London</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Haven.|$|E

BOAC ordered seven Model 302s but never took delivery, instead they were taken on by airlines including Aeronaves de México and Ghana Airways. The main long-range series were the 310s, of which BOAC took 18 and, after deliveries began in September 1957, put them into service between <b>London</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York City; in March 1964 BOAC owned 50 aircraft, 10 being Britannia 312s.

5|$|The Worldwide Tanker Normal Freight Scale, often {{referred}} to as Worldscale, is established and governed jointly by the Worldscale Associations of <b>London</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York. Worldscale establishes a baseline price for carrying a metric ton of product between any two ports in the world. In Worldscale negotiations, operators and charterers will determine a price based on a percentage of the Worldscale rate. The baseline rate is expressed as WS 100. If a given charter party settled on 85% of the Worldscale rate, it would be expressed as WS 85. Similarly, a charter party set at 125% of the Worldscale rate would be expressed as WS 125.|$|E

The first North American leg of the tour began April 26 in San Diego and April 28 at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and contained 26 dates. This leg contained openings by The National, St. Vincent, and Electrelane. The band then began an 11-date European leg at Glastonbury Festival on June 22 before returning to North America for 10 more LCD Soundsystem-supported dates beginning September 15 at Austin City Limits. The Neon Bible tour continued with 14 more dates in Europe between October 25 and November 19, and six dates beginning January 18, 2008 in Australia and New Zealand as part of the Big Day Out festival. The tour then ended after three more shows from February 7 in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba {{was forced}} to find {{employment}} as a child {{after the death of}} her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognised when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, <b>London,</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government.|$|E
5|$|Following the conquest, many Anglo-Saxons, {{including}} {{groups of}} nobles, {{fled the country}} for Scotland, Ireland, or Scandinavia. Members of King Harold Godwinson's family sought refuge in Ireland and used their bases in that country for unsuccessful invasions of England. The largest single exodus occurred in the 1070s, {{when a group of}} Anglo-Saxons in a fleet of 235 ships sailed for the Byzantine Empire. The empire became a popular destination for many English nobles and soldiers, as the Byzantines were in need of mercenaries. The English became the predominant element in the elite Varangian Guard, until then a largely Scandinavian unit, from which the emperor's bodyguard was drawn. Some of the English migrants were settled in Byzantine frontier regions on the Black Sea coast, and established towns with names such as New <b>London</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York.|$|E
