40|$|Abstract Background Genetic maps {{based on}} single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are {{increasingly}} being used {{as an alternative to}} microsatellite maps. This study compares linkage results for both types of maps for a neurophysiology phenotype and for an alcohol dependence phenotype. Our analysis used two SNP maps on the Illumina and Affymetrix platforms. We also considered the effect of high linkage disequilibrium (LD) in regions near the linkage peaks by analysing a "sparse" SNP map obtained by dropping some markers in high LD with other markers in those regions. Results The neurophysiology phenotype at the main linkage peak near 130 MB gave <b>LOD</b> <b>scores</b> of 2. 76, 2. 53, 3. 22, and 2. 68 for the microsatellite, Affymetrix, Illumina, and Illumina-sparse maps, respectively.

Our analysis indicates that appropriately thinning a SNP map in regions of high LD should give more accurate <b>LOD</b> <b>scores.</b> These results suggest that SNPs can be an efficient substitute for microsatellites for linkage analysis of both quantitative and qualitative phenotypes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Previous linkage {{analyses}} of 19 cutaneous malignant melanoma/dysplastic nevi (CMM/DN) kindreds showed significant evidence of linkage and heterogeneity to both chromosomes 1 p and 9 p. Five kindreds also showed evidence of linkage (Z> 0. 7) to both regions. To further examine these findings, we conducted two-trait-locus, two-marker-locus linkage analysis. We examined one homogeneity and one heterogeneity single-locus model (SL-Hom and SL-Het), and two-locus (2 L) models: an epistatic model (Ep), in which CMM {{was treated as}} a genuine 2 L disease, and a heterogeneity model (Het), in which CMM could result from disease alleles at either locus. Both loci were modeled as autosomal dominant. The <b>LOD</b> <b>scores</b> for CMM alone were highest using the SL-Het model (Z = 8. 48, theta =. 0). There was much stronger evidence of linkage to chromosome 9 p than to 1 p for CMM alone; the <b>LOD</b> <b>scores</b> were approximately two times greater on 9 p than on 1 p. The change in <b>LOD</b> <b>scores</b> from an evaluation of CMM alone to CMM/DN suggested that a chromosome 1 p locus (or loci) contributed to both CMM and CMM/DN, whereas a 9 p locus contributed more to CMM alone. For both 2 L models, the <b>LOD</b> <b>scores</b> from 1 p were greater for CMM/DN than for CMM alone (Ep: Z= 4. 63 vs. 3. 83; Het: 4. 94 vs. 3. 80, respectively).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare variance components linkage results using different density marker maps in data from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). Marker maps having an average spacing of 10 cM (microsatellite), 0. 78 cM (SNP 1), and 0. 31 cM (SNP 2) were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting maximum number of alcoholic drinks consumed in a 24 -hour period (lnmaxalc). Results Heritability of lnmaxalc was estimated to be 15 %. Multipoint variance components linkage analysis revealed similar linkage patterns among the three marker panels, with the SNP maps consistently yielding higher <b>LOD</b> <b>scores.</b> Robust <b>LOD</b> <b>scores</b> > 1. 0 were observed on chromosomes 1 and 13 for all three marker maps. Additional LODs > 1. 0 were observed on chromosome 4 with both SNP maps and on chromosomes 18 and 21 with the SNP 2 map. Peak <b>LOD</b> <b>scores</b> for lnmaxalc were observed on chromosome 1, although none reached genome-wide statistical significance. Quantile-quantile plots revealed that the multipoint distribution of SNP results appeared to fit the asymptotic null distribution better than the twopoint results.
