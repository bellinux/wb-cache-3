40|$|The last CCPR intercomparison in 1985 showed {{variations}} of #+-# 1 % in the units of <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> (<b>candela)</b> and luminous flux (lumen) maintained by 14 and 10 participating laboratories, respectively. Meanwhile, the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) {{and some of}} the participating laboratories changed their units, as reported by BIPM. Therefore, VNIIOFI and PTB have an interest in the cooperation on important scientific work in photometry, and this also provides the framework for this bilateral intercomparison. Measurements were carried out at both laboratories to compare the values of luminous intensity, photometric responsivity and luminous flux assigned to artifacts. At VNIIOFI the primary standard of luminous intensity is a high-temperature blackbody. Its temperature is determined by help of a non-selective cavity radiometer. A (primary) photometer with a liquid V(#lambda#) -correcting filter transfers the unit to a group of luminous intensity standard lamps, which are used for the maintenance of the unit. At present, luminous intensity and illuminance calibrations at VNIIOFI are carried out as substitution method with groups of standard lamps and V(#lambda#) -corrected (silicon) photometers. The luminous flux calibrations are carried out by means of a group of luminous flux reference standard lamps and a 2 -meter integrating sphere. The value of luminous flux was established during bilateral comparisons with the BIPM, 1990 and the CSIRO (Australia, 1991). At PTB, the photometric base unit of luminous intensity is realised annually based on radiometric power measurements with absolute radiometers. The unit is maintained by groups of incandescent lamps. In any case, the maintained unit was within the uncertainty range of the realisations and no adjustments were carried out within the last decade. The luminous flux unit is derived fundamentally from the luminous intensity unit by goniophotometric methods and maintained by incandescent lamps. The magnitude of all photometric units have remained unchanged at PTB since the CCPR intercomparison in 1985. (orig.)

40|$|NIST has {{recently}} established a detectorbased <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> unit (<b>candela,</b> cd), which {{is derived from}} the NIST absolute cryogenic radiometer. Subsequently, the luminous flux unit (lumen, lm) and the luminance unit (cd/m 2) have been established based on the detector-based candela, and now all the NIST photometric units are tied to the cryogenic radiometer. The illuminance unit is realized and maintained on five standard photometers. The large dynamic range of the standard photometers eliminates the need for maintaining many working standard lamps of various wattages. The <b>luminous</b> <b>intensities</b> of lamps are determined from the illuminances measured with these photometers and the distances measured with a linear encoder system. Transfer photometers and illuminance meters are calibrated by direct comparison with the standard photometers with no distance measurements involved. The luminous flux unit is realized using an absolute integrating sphere method newly developed at NIST. The luminance unit is realized on an integrating sphere source, which is used for calibration of other luminance sources and luminance meters. These detector-based methods have made it possible to reduce the uncertainties of photometric calibrations and to provide more varieties of photometric calibration services at NIST.
