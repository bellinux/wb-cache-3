40|$|Reconstruction of {{a ceiling}} in the {{north-eastern}} wing {{of a former}} water fortress in Jeseník was carried out during the repair of its roof structure and replacement of the roof. The most damaged parts of the bearing <b>ceiling</b> <b>beams</b> were removed and partially replaced with new timber in the 70 s of the 20 th C. The way the work was carried out corresponded to the methods and approaches of the cultural heritage protection of that time. The replacement of damaged heads of <b>ceiling</b> <b>beams</b> with new timber that was fitted without connection to the original <b>ceiling</b> <b>beams</b> and only simply hanged on a metal girder can be considered highly provisional from the current perspective. That is why the repair of timber structures of the water fortress included also a reconstruction of the original ceiling system...|$|R
