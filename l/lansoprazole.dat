25|$|Rabeprazole {{is a novel}} {{benzimidazole}} compound on market, since 1999 in USA. It {{is similar}} to <b>lansoprazole</b> in having no substituents on its benzimidazole part and a methyl group at site 3 on the pyridine, {{the only difference is}} the methoxypropoxy substitution at site 4 instead of the trifluoroethoxy group on <b>lansoprazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dexlansoprazole was {{launched}} as a follow up of <b>lansoprazole</b> in 2009.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lansoprazole,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Prevacid among others, is a {{medication}} which inhibits the stomach's production of acid. There {{is no evidence that}} its effectiveness is different from that of other PPIs. <b>Lansoprazole,</b> given through a nasogatric tube, effectively controls pH inside the stomach and is an alternative to intravenous pantoprazole in people who are unable to swallow solid-dose formulations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lansoprazole</b> {{interacts with}} several other drugs, either due to its own nature or as a PPI.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the drugs}} omeprazole, <b>lansoprazole,</b> pantoprazole, and {{rabeprazole}} share common structure and mode of action, each differs somewhat in its clinical pharmacology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lansoprazole</b> was {{the second}} of the PPI drugs to reach the market, being {{launched}} in Europe in 1991 and the US in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Dexlansoprazole is an (R)-(+)-enantiomer of <b>lansoprazole,</b> {{marketed as}} Dexilant. After oral {{appliance}} of the racemic <b>lansoprazole,</b> the circulating drug is 80% dexlansoprazole. Moreover, both enantiomers have similar {{effects on the}} proton pump. Consequently, the main advantage of Dexilant is not {{the fact that it}} is an enantiopure substance. The advantage is the pharmaceutical formulation of the drug, which is based on a dual release technology, with the first quick release producing a blood plasma peak concentration about one hour after application, and the second retarded release producing another peak about four hours later.|$|E
25|$|The <b>lansoprazole</b> {{molecule}} is off-patent and so generic {{drugs are}} available under many brand names in many countries; there are patents covering some formulations in effect as of 2015.|$|E
25|$|Since 2009, <b>lansoprazole</b> {{has been}} {{available}} over the counter (OTC) in the U.S. in a marketed by Novartis as Prevacid 24HR. In Australia, it is marketed by Pfizer as Zoton.|$|E
25|$|Proton pump inhibitors (such as <b>lansoprazole,</b> esomeprazole, or omeprazole) that {{decrease}} stomach acid, are a {{risk for}} bone fractures if taken {{for two or}} more years, due to decreased absorption of calcium in the stomach.|$|E
25|$|It is {{effective}} {{in the treatment of}} stomach infections of Helicobacter pylori. When used to treat H. pylori infection it is combined with <b>lansoprazole,</b> clarithromycin, omeprazole and others in varying amounts and dosage schedules. It is also used to treat Lyme disease in children under eight-years old.|$|E
25|$|PPIs can {{be split}} into two groups based on their basic structure. Though all have a {{substituted}} pyridine part, one group has it linked to various benzimidazoles but the other has it linked to a substituted imidazopyridine. All marketed PPIs (omeprazole, <b>lansoprazole,</b> pantoprazole, etc.) are in the benzimidazole group.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{comparison}} of pantoprazole sodium with other anti-secretory drugs {{showed that it}} was significantly more effective than H2-receptor antagonists and either equivalent or better than other clinically used PPIs. Another study states rabeprazole undergoes activation over a greater pH range than omeprazole, <b>lansoprazole,</b> and pantoprazole, and converts to the sulphenamide form more rapidly than any of these three drugs.|$|E
25|$|Optimization of {{substituted}} benzimidazoles {{and their}} antisecretory effects were studied on the newly discovered proton pump to obtain higher pKa {{values of the}} pyridine, thereby facilitating accumulation within the parietal cell and increasing the rate of acid-mediated conversion to the active mediate. As {{a result of such}} optimization the first proton pump inhibiting drug was released on the market, omeprazole. Other PPIs like <b>lansoprazole</b> and pantoprazole would follow in its footsteps, claiming their share of a flourishing market, after their own course of development.|$|E
25|$|Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): The PPIs include {{omeprazole}} (Prilosec, Losec), <b>lansoprazole</b> (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Protonix, Pantoloc), and esomeprazole (Nexium). The reduced secretion of {{gastric acid}} and pepsin produced by PPIs can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary) vitamin B12, but not supplemental vitamin B12. Gastric acid {{is needed to}} release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption. Reduced vitamin B12 levels may be more common with PPIs than with H2 antagonists, {{because they are more}} likely to produce achlorhydria (complete absence of gastric acid secretion). Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency is unlikely, unless PPI therapy is prolonged (2 years or more) or dietary vitamin intake is low. Vitamin B12 levels should be monitored in people taking high doses of PPIs for prolonged periods.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 1975, {{timoprazole}} {{was found to}} inhibit acid secretion irrespective of stimulus, extracellular or intracellular. Studies on timoprazole revealed enlargement of the thyroid gland due to inhibition of iodine uptake as well as atrophy of the thymus gland. A literature search showed that some substituted mercapto-benzimidazoles {{had no effect on}} iodine uptake and introduction of such substituents into timoprazole resulted in an elimination of the toxic effects, without reducing the antisecretory effect. A derivative of timoprazole, omeprazole, was discovered in 1979, and was the first of a new class of drug that control acid secretion in the stomach, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Addition of 5-methoxy-substitution to the benzimidazole moiety of omeprazole was also made and gave the compound much more stability at neutral pH. In 1980, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application was filed and omeprazole was taken into Phase III human trials in 1982. A new approach for the treatment of acid-related diseases was introduced, and omeprazole was quickly shown to be clinically superior to the histamine H2 receptor antagonists, and was launched in 1988 as Losec in Europe, and in 1990 as Prilosec in the United States. In 1996, Losec became the world's biggest ever selling pharmaceutical, and by 2004 over 800 million patients had been treated with the drug worldwide. During the 1980s, about 40 other companies entered the PPIs area, but few achieved market success: Takeda with <b>lansoprazole,</b> Byk Gulden (now Nycomed) with pantoprazole, and Eisai with rabeprazole, all of which were analogues of omeprazole.|$|E
