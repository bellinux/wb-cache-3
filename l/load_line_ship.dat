5000|$|Growth of {{the city}} and trade came with the rise of England's American colonies in the 17th century. Bristol's {{location}} {{on the west side of}} Great Britain gave its ships an advantage in sailing to and from the New World, and the city's merchants made the most of it. The 18th century saw an expansion of England's role in the Atlantic trade in Africans taken for slavery to the Americas. Bristol and Liverpool became centres of the Triangular Trade. In the first side of the slavery triangle, manufactured goods were shipped to West Africa and exchanged for Africans; the enslaved captives were transported across the Atlantic to the Americas in the Middle Passage under brutal conditions. In the third side of the triangle, plantation goods such as sugar, tobacco, rum, rice, cotton and a few slaves (sold to the aristocracy as house servants) returned across the Atlantic. Some household slaves were baptised in the hope this would mean their freedom in England. The Somersett Case of 1772 clarified that slavery was illegal in England. At the height of the Bristol slave trade from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried a conservatively estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The Seven Stars public house, where abolitionist Thomas Clarkson collected information on the slave trade, is still operating.Fishermen from Bristol, who had fished the Grand Banks of Newfoundland since the 15th century, began settling Newfoundland permanently in larger numbers during the 17th century, establishing colonies at Bristol's Hope and Cuper's Cove.

5000|$|Once a DC {{operating}} point {{is defined by}} the DC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> an AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> can be drawn through the Q point. The AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is a straight line with a slope equal to the AC impedance facing the nonlinear device, which is in general different from the DC resistance. The ratio of AC voltage to current in the device is defined by this line. Because the impedance of the reactive components will vary with frequency, the slope of the AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> depends on the frequency of the applied signal. So there are many AC <b>load</b> <b>lines,</b> that vary from the DC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> (at low frequency) to a limiting AC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> all having a common intersection at the DC {{operating point}}. This limiting <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> generally referred to as the AC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> is the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> of the circuit at [...] "infinite frequency", and can be found by replacing capacitors with short circuits, and inductors with open circuits.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a <b>load</b> <b>line</b> {{is to ensure that}} a ship has {{sufficient}} freeboard (the height from the water line to the main deck) and thus sufficient reserve buoyancy. The freeboard of commercial vessels is measured between the lowest point of the uppermost continuous deck at side and the waterline and this must not be less than the freeboard marked on the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> certificate issued to that ship. All commercial ships, other than in exceptional circumstances, have a <b>load</b> <b>line</b> symbol painted amidships {{on each side of the}} ship. This symbol is also permanently marked, so that if the paint wears off it remains visible. The <b>load</b> <b>line</b> makes it easy for anyone to determine if a ship has been overloaded. The exact location of the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is calculated and verified by a classification society and that society issues the relevant certificates.
