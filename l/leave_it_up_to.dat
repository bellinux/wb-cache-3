These include Catherine O'Hara, Michael McKean, Parker Posey, Bob Balaban, Jane Lynch, John Michael Higgins, Harry Shearer, Jennifer Coolidge, Ed Begley, Jr. and Fred Willard. Guest and Levy write backgrounds for each of the characters and notecards for each specific scene, outlining the plot, and then <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the actors to improvise the dialogue, which is supposed to result in a much more natural conversation than scripted dialogue would. Typically, everyone who appears in these movies receives the same fee and the same portion of profits.|$|E

Ogilvy had also starred in both of Reeves's two previous feature films, Revenge of the Blood Beast and The Sorcerers, and was the natural first choice for the role of Witchfinders heroic lead. Describing his working relationship with Reeves, Ogilvy noted that [...] "his mastery of the technical aspects was absolute", but added [...] "Mike never directed the actors. He always said he knew nothing about acting, and preferred to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> us." [...] Ogilvy enjoyed working with Price, finding him to be [...] "very funny, in a 'queeny' sort of way." ...|$|E

500|$|The Grammy Award-winning {{score for}} the film was {{composed}} by David Arnold and recorded with an orchestra of 90, a choir of 46, [...] "and every last ounce of stereotypical Americana he could muster for the occasion". The film's producer Dean Devlin commented that [...] "you can <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a Brit to write {{some of the most}} rousing and patriotic music in the history of American cinema." [...] The soundtrack has received two official CD releases. RCA released a 50-minute album {{at the time of the}} film's release, then in 2010, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 2-CD set that comprised the complete score plus 12 alternate cues. The premiere of Independence Day live took place at the Royal Albert Hall in September 2016, with the film's score was performed live to a screening of the film. This celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the film's release, and the event also featured a pre-film talk by David Arnold.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} {{originally}} conceived to encourage cricket-playing Europeans living in India. But {{as it was}} financed by the Maharajah of Patiala, the team played Indian sides, rather than the European sides envisaged by the tour's organisers. Gilligan, in contrast to many Englishmen, was happy to play Indian teams and actively encouraged Indians to organise their own cricket rather than <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> white Englishmen. According to the cricket writer Mihir Bose, Gilligan, unlike others, [...] "met Indians on terms of perfect equality". He successfully encouraged the Indians to form their own cricket board and promised {{to make a case}} with the Lord's authorities for India to become a Test playing team. He did so, and in 1929 India {{became a member of the}} Imperial Cricket Conference. Bose points out that Gilligan's positive attitude towards Indians, and that of the MCC when granting India Test status, was markedly different from that of most Englishmen. In terms of the advancement of Indian cricket, Bose writes that [...] "Gilligan's influence was immense".|$|E

A reviewer from Vibe praised it as [...] "the perfect theme song". Abe Dewing, a member of the Cambridge Symphony Orchestra, described it as a [...] "sharp, hip tune" [...] in the Boston Herald. He compared its opening trumpet riff to music by British composer Herbert Chappell, who created the theme for the 1975 television series Paddington. Chappell also composed music for the 1986 concerto [...] "Paddington Bear's First Concert". Dewing praised Stefani and Willams' ability [...] "to compose new music for existing source material intended for children". A reviewer from the website antiMusic described the recording as [...] "even more feel good" [...] than the pair's collaboration on [...] "Spark the Fire". Daniel Sannwald gave it three and a half stars out of five, favorably comparing its melody to the chorus of Irish rock band The Cranberries's 1994 single [...] "Zombie".

500|$|Sixty {{tracks of}} the {{original}} Final Fantasy X soundtrack by Nobuo Uematsu, Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano were rearranged. Hamauzu and Nakano took charge {{of most of the}} revised music, with Tsutomu Narita and Ryo Yamazaki also making select arrangements. The soundtrack for Final Fantasy X-2 by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi was carried over from the original PlayStation 2 version. For the credits of the HD remaster, scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote the audio drama Final Fantasy X: Will as an appendix taking place two years after X-2. Nojima and Nomura felt {{that it was a good}} opportunity to expand upon the universe of X. They opted for the audio drama format as the team did not want to create a solid visual impression, instead intending to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> interpretation. The team wanted the audio drama to be the [...] "direct opposite" [...] to the upbeat feel and happy ending of X-2. This wish for a more melancholy atmosphere resulted in them bringing Sin, the main antagonistic force in X, back into the story, as the team wanted to keep it involved in a similar fashion to Sephiroth, the main antagonist of Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. The drama's open ending was also intentional, as Kitase [...] "wanted to leave something up to the player's imagination." ...|$|E
500|$|When first {{designing}} Ventus, Tetsuya Nomura {{already decided}} the character {{should look like}} Sora or Roxas, and decided to choose the latter when thinking that Vanitas being revealed to have Sora's appearance would give a big impact to the gamers. Nomura wanted Ventus' personality to more closely resemble Sora's, which led to his outgoing personality, {{yet at the same}} time he wanted him to become more serious as the game progressed to make them distinct. Ventus was first shown in the secret endings of Kingdom Hearts II and its rerelease Kingdom Hearts II: Final Mix. Ventus' name first appeared as a code in a 2006 Tokyo Game Show promotional video of the games. While making Final Mixs ending, Nomura had only developed the backstory for Terra, Aqua and Ventus and not their appearances, but had to finish their design for the end of game cameo. Nomura did not reveal their identities, and only stated that the three character were from the chronological past of the Kingdom Hearts series. Following their release, Nomura stated that his nickname was Ven. Ventus was first mentioned by the character Lingering Sentiment in Final Mix as Ven, while his full name was still unrevealed. He also mentioned a connection between him and Xemnas but wanted to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> people's imaginations as he still could not reveal his identity.|$|E

500|$|Although Terra, Ventus and Aqua first {{appeared}} in the secret ending of Kingdom Hearts II wearing armor, director Tetsuya Nomura still had not designed their final look, having only thought about their story. Despite not revealing their identities, Nomura still said that they are characters from the past from the Kingdom Hearts series. Following the release of the Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, Nomura revealed a connection between them and the game's villain Xemnas, but wanted to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> people's imaginations as he still could not reveal their identities. Terra's face was first shown in the 2006 Tokyo Game Show in which he was described as an avenger against Xehanort. Nomura also confirmed that the Lingering Will was connected with Terra. He also stated that his name, meaning [...] "earth" [...] from Latin, follows the [...] "land" [...] theme Riku represents, as well as connecting him with the other main characters' names from the series. In October 2007, Nomura was asked if the Lingering Will was actually Terra due to their similarities, but he responded it was still uncertain. When asked about the Will's true nature after being revealed to contain Terra's memories, Nomura stated it was not a Heartless. Nomura expressed that the fans liked the inclusion of the Will's battle due to his challenging difficulty, which led the staff to design another hard boss character for Birth by Sleep.|$|E

Poco failed to duplicate the success achieved by Legend, with each album performing more poorly than its predecessor. Furay, Schmit and Grantham had, since their departures, each guested with Poco at various times. Inamorata in 1984 included contributions by all three former members.

I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere.

The claim that MMA was contracted by CP (and not WFS) was later drawn into question. Blanchet stated “I will <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> lawyers, but let’s be clear: under the law on environmental quality, the minister does not ask for, or suggest, compensation ... he orders it."

Rose focused on more distressing themes, while Witherspoon, who had just become a father, focused his lyrics on responsibility and commitment. The album's first single, [...] "Unraveling", was co-written by Lowery and is about the collapse of a relationship, while [...] "Confession" [...] indirectly addresses Lowery quitting and returning to the band. On Lowery's return, Rose spoke [...] "Since we all write, it's hard to tell exactly what each song is about, but we like to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the listeners to decide for themselves," [...] Rose says. [...] "It's funny because in the end you almost don't know what you wrote. I remember telling John one time, 'Dude, that was an amazing line you wrote,' and he went, 'What are you talking about?
