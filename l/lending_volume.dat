We first identify two series of ECB policy shocks at the euro area aggregated level and then include them in country-specific structural VAR. The main result is that only the pass-through from the ECB rate to interest rates has been really effective, consistently with the existing literature, while the transmission mechanism of the ECB rate to volumes and of quantitative easing (QE) operations to interest rates and volumes has been null or uneven over this sample. One argument to explain the differentiated pass-through of ECB monetary policies is that the successful pass-through from the ECB rate to interest rates, which materialized as a huge decrease in interest rates during the sample period, had {{a negative effect on}} the supply side of loans, and offset itself its potential positive effects on <b>lending</b> <b>volumes...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{examine how}} the informational {{structure}} of loan markets interacts with banks' strategic behavior in determining lending standards, <b>lending</b> <b>volume,</b> and the aggregate allocation of credit.

40|$|Posting {{collateral}} encourages credit provision {{under the}} assumption that lenders can appropriate the pledged assets in case of default. When institutions work imperfectly, though, banks discount the value of effective collateral, thereby reducing <b>lending</b> <b>volume.</b> This process has been described in US states with difficult foreclosure procedures, but here we show that it also matters for poor countries after a violent conflict, when collateralizable assets have a heightened probability of being destroyed. We use firm-level data on loans in Sub-Saharan Africa to show that to get a loan, firms in countries with recent conflict need to pledge additional collateral. While some OLS offer supporting evidence, the effect is larger and more precisely estimated when we use quantile regressions to focus on the subgroup of firms that face tougher collateral requirements, which suggests that this effect is heterogeneous within countries. This mechanism is a novel channel that relates peace to economic growth and convergence through financial markets. Artículo de publicación SCOPU...|$|E
