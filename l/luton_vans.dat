50|$|This {{style of}} body was {{designed}} to accommodate the high volume low weight loads of straw hats which were part of Luton's industry. Straw hats were wrapped in hessian in long cylinders to fit across {{the width of the}} van. It was incidental that it was the home of Bedford although all the early <b>Luton</b> <b>vans</b> were on Bedford chassis.|$|E
50|$|Other {{special bodies}} graced {{the pages of}} the 400E range catalogue, {{including}} tower wagons, <b>luton</b> <b>vans,</b> and an unusual flat truck with an air compressor. Called the Powertruc this was no ordinary air compressor truck, for it featured a design whereby the engine of the compressor also propelled the Vehicle from its position {{at the rear of the}} cab. The Powertruc name appeared at the front in place of the usual Thames nameplate.|$|E

50|$|Having {{set up the}} Free School with John Ord, Bill Murphy went on to {{establish}} and concentrate on a new venture, Liverpool Community Transport. This began in ramshackle premises, but soon moved to a large disused transport depot in Leeds Street. A number of vehicles were acquired, including two Leyland PD2 double-decker buses, a coach, and a <b>Luton</b> <b>van.</b> The buses were used to take Free School children on school visits and camping trips to Carrog in Wales, and to Coniston in the Lake District, as well as giving local families and pensioners outings such as visits to the Blackpool Illuminations. Most notably, a double-decker took a busload of activists across the Snake Pass in the Pennines to support the Clay Cross councillors who were refusing to implement the rate-capping provisions of the Conservative government's Housing Finance Act.|$|R

GM invested in two new [...] double story factories, built between 1955 and 1957, which covered an area of 46 acre. The resultant production line was 1 mi long, and the entire site employed 5,500 people, on an average wage of Â£10 per week.|$|R

In April 2007, {{it was confirmed that}} the Ellesmere Port would produce the next generation Astra from 2010.|$|R
