In 1974, Loftleiðir and Cargolux amalgamated their maintenance and engineering departments, and by 1975, Cargolux enjoyed new facilities consisting of central offices and two hangars.|$|E
25|$|Yves Klein {{had been}} a {{precursor}} of performance art with the conceptual pieces of Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle (Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility) 1959–62, Anthropométries (1960), and works like the photomontage, Saut dans le vide (<b>Leap</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Void). In the late 1960s Earth artists as diverse as Robert Smithson, Dennis Oppenheim, Michael Heizer and Carl Andre created environmental pieces that predict the performance art of the 1970s. Works of conceptual artists in the early 1980s, like Sol LeWitt, who converted mural-style drawing into an act of performance by others, were influenced by Yves Klein and the Earth artists as well.|$|E
25|$|He bowls {{fast and}} {{obviously}} scorns to conserve his strength. He is {{in a hurry}} to be at the batsman. He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at a great pace, throws up his arm high, and then makes a terrifying <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air—a leap which one feels should be accompanied by a yell. At the end of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes it hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. With it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E

25|$|Combat in Mass Effect: Andromeda {{takes place}} in real-time, and unlike {{previous}} installments in the series, pausing the game to aim or use skills from a menu {{is no longer a}} feature. During action sequences, the player has direct control of Ryder from an over-the-shoulder perspective, who can move around the battlefield in a variety of ways, including a side-to-side dash or vertical <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air using a jetpack. When the player approaches an object, Ryder will automatically take cover, providing the player with protection in battle. The game encourages players to keep moving during combat with large, open battlefields and enemies that attack from all angles, but also allows for both aggressive and defensive strategies.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} {{this version of the}} story is that the 18-pounders were on the lower deck, so it would take a very lucky drop to reach them from high above. Captain Pearson speculated that either a grenade had been thrown {{through a hole in the}} hull, from Bonhomme Richard’s gun deck, or that the charge had been ignited by accident. Whatever the cause, the effect was devastating. As the ignited charge blew up, it {{scattered}} burning gunpowder, setting off other charges nearby, and ultimately the chain reaction covered the entire rear half of Serapis’ lower gun-deck, killing or severely burning many of the gunnery crewmen, forcing some to <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea to extinguish their burning clothes, and putting five guns out of action. In the confusion, some of the crew clambering back on board after jumping into the sea were nearly mistaken for American boarders.|$|E
25|$|That same evening, {{his fellow}} friends, about 25 {{students}} from the medical and dental faculties of the College of Medicine decided to give Yoong a proper burial within {{the grounds of the}} hospital. One of the five trenches dug out earlier for air raid purposes was converted into a grave for Yoong. As the grave was being prepared, they were spotted by Japanese gunners which began pouring a heavy barrage of shells at the defenceless students. Some quick-footed students managed to flee to safety towards the College building. However, those left behind only had time to <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trenches and Yoong's grave. As a result, 11 of the students were killed, three were wounded and only two managed to escape injury in the aftermath. Those who were killed instantaneously were given a burial on the morning of 16 February, a day after the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese, in the trenches where they fell.|$|E

25|$|Greenhough first {{played for}} Lancashire {{as early as}} 1951, after coming from the League club Fieldhouse, but until 1956 he played very little for the first eleven. That season, however, he took 66 wickets for less than {{eighteen}} runs apiece, and formed a remarkable trio of spinners with Roy Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton. In 1957, however, Greenhough seemed to lack spin and in 1958 played only eight games out of twenty eight for the first eleven. It was thus a surprise that, in the dry summer of 1959, Greenhough was able to not only displace both Tattersall and Hilton, but even <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Test side against India. Although he did well even when India's lack of batting prowess was taken into account, Greenhough was soon reported for persistently running down the pitch during his follow-through. Once Greenhough corrected this problem he bowled as well as before. Greenhough's record of 93 wickets in eighteen county games suggested that, had he not missed five games correcting his run-up, he would probably have taken around 150 wickets, which would have made him the leading wicket-taker in England.|$|E

Lennon adapted the lyrics from Timothy Leary's book , which equates the realisations brought about through LSD with the spiritually enlightened state achieved through meditation. Originally recorded as [...] "Mark I", the eventual title came via a Ringo Starr malapropism.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1860s the railroads had {{extended}} their rails to Minneapolis/St. Paul {{and they began}} to actively advertise Minnesota as a tourist destination. [...] The 1878 Chicago, Burlington & Quincy railway promotional booklet, A Guide to the Summer Resorts of Minnesota, told of the delights and health benefits of travel to Minnesota: [...] "The scenery is unequaled and the invigorating air is so rich in oxygen and ozone that it is unsurpassed anywhere in the world and is sure to offer to the tourist and the invalid a hearty welcome, confident that the one will surely find rest and enjoyment, and the other that much coveted of earthly blessings — health." [...] The booklet describes the coach ride from Minneapolis to Minnehaha Falls: [...] "One of the famous trips that few tourists miss taking is that from Minneapolis to St. Paul by carriage. [...] Starting from the former place {{on the west side of}} the river, a pleasant drive of four miles over a level prairie, brings the traveler to Where the Falls of Minnehaha Flash and gleam among the oak trees.

On July 28, 2010, Rintarō Okabe and his friend Mayuri Shiina head towards the Radio Kaikan building for a conference, where Rintarō finds a girl named Kurisu Makise lying in a pool of blood. As Rintarō sends a text message about the incident to his friend, Itaru [...] "Daru" [...] Hashida, he experiences a strange phenomenon and the people around him disappear, with no-one else noticing anything had changed. After later running into Kurisu, who is strangely alive and well, and discovering the message he had sent to Itaru had arrived a week before he sent it, Rintarō soon deduces that the 'Mobile Microwave' he and his friends had been developing is, in fact, a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past. He and his friends soon learn that SERN, an organization that has been researching time travel for some time, has actually succeeded in sending humans into the past although they seem to have all resulted in the test subjects' deaths. Rintarō begins experimenting with , which begin to cause major differences in the timeline. Kurisu also manages to create a device to send a person's memories through the microwave, allowing that person to effectively <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> past.|$|E

500|$|The Mr. Hankey {{character}} {{was based on}} an idea Trey Parker's father created when he was toilet-training Trey as a child. Parker said he refused to flush the toilet as a child, so his father told him if he did not flush down his stool, which he called [...] "Mr. Hankey", it would come to life and kill him. The concept stayed with Parker throughout his childhood; starting in elementary school and throughout his entire education, he would often draw the character in class, wearing a sailor's hat instead of the Santa Claus hat he would later wear in South Park. Parker shared the concept with future South Park co-creator Matt Stone when the two met at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the duo immediately knew they wanted to create a film or production involving Mr. Hankey. The two discussed filming a three-minute short film involving a boy who befriended the talking stool, but Mr. Hankey would not come alive for anybody else, prompting others to believe the boy was crazy. They planned for the boy's parents to find him holding a stool in the bathroom and blame the child for smearing feces along the walls when it was actually Mr. Hankey's fault; they also planned to have him visit a school counselor, where Mr. Hankey would <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> counselor's coffee mug and the boy would be blamed. At the end, it would turn out that the boy was indeed crazy and Mr. Hankey was not real at all, but a figment of the boy's imagination. Parker and Stone never made the short film, but practically all of its elements were included in the future South Park episode [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", with the notable exception of the ending.|$|E

2500|$|The larva of Cicindela dorsalis, the [...] eastern beach tiger beetle, {{is notable}} {{for its ability}} to <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air, loop its body into a {{rotating}} wheel and roll along the sand at a high speed using wind to propel itself.

2500|$|Common {{bottlenose}} dolphins {{have been}} observed using another technique. One dolphin acts as a [...] "driver" [...] and herds a school of fish towards several other dolphins who form a barrier. [...] The driver dolphin slaps its fluke which makes the fish <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air. [...] As the fish leap, the driver dolphin moves with the barrier dolphins and catches {{the fish in the}} air. This type of cooperative role specialization seems to be more common in marine animals than in terrestrial animals, perhaps because the oceans have more variability in prey diversity, biomass, and predator mobility.|$|E
