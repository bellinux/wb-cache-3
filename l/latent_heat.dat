40|$|Recent {{satellite}} determinations {{of global}} distributions of absolute gravity wave (GW) momentum fluxes {{in the lower}} stratosphere show maxima over the summer subtropical continents and little evidence of GW momentum fluxes associated with the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). This {{seems to be at}} odds with parameterizations forGWmomentum fluxes, where the source is a function of <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> rates, which are largest in the region of the ITCZ in terms of monthly averages. The authors have examined global distributions of atmospheric <b>latent</b> <b>heating,</b> cloud-top-pressure altitudes, and lower-stratosphere absolute GW momentum fluxes and have found that monthly averages of the lower-stratosphere GW momentum fluxes more closely resemble the monthly mean cloud-top altitudes rather than the monthly mean rates of <b>latent</b> <b>heating.</b> These regions of highest cloud-top altitudes occur when rates of <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> are largest on the time scale of cloud growth. This, plus previously published studies, suggests that convective sources for stratospheric GW momentum fluxes, being a function of the rate of <b>latent</b> <b>heating,</b> will require either a climate model to correctly model this rate of <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> or some ad hoc adjustments to account for shortcomings in a climate model's land-sea differences in convective <b>latent</b> <b>heating...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) {{as a part}} of NASA's Earth System Enterprise is {{the first}} mission {{dedicated}} to measuring tropical rainfall through microwave and visible sensors, and includes the first spaceborne rain radar. Tropical rainfall comprises two-thirds of global rainfall. It is also the primary distributor of heat through the atmosphere's circulation. It is this circulation that defines Earth's weather and climate. Understanding rainfall and its variability is crucial to understanding and predicting global climate change. Weather and climate models need an accurate assessment of the <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> released as tropical rainfall occurs. Currently, cloud model-based algorithms are used to derive <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> based on rainfall structure. Ultimately, these algorithms can be applied to actual data from TRMM. This study investigates key underlying assumptions used in developing the <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> algorithms. For example, the standard algorithm is highly dependent on a system's rainfall amount and structure. It also depends on an a priori database of model-derived <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> profiles based on the aforementioned rainfall characteristics. Unanswered questions remain concerning the sensitivity of <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> profiles to environmental conditions (both thermodynamic and kinematic), regionality, and seasonality. This study investigates and quantifies such sensitivities and seeks to determine the optimal <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> profile database based on the results. Ultimately, the study seeks to produce an optimized <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> algorithm based not only on rainfall structure but also hydrometeor profiles...|$|R

Although the height of maximum <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> remained nearly constant at around 7 km {{in all of the}} years, the year-to-year changes in the magnitudes of maximum <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> over the region were noticeable. The interannual variations of the convective-stratiform rainfall and <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> over the southern SCS were highly anti-correlated with the Ni (n) over tildeo- 3 index, with more (less) rainfall and <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> during La Ni (n) over tildea (El Ni (n) over tildeo) years. Analysis of the large-scale environment revealed that years of active rainfall and <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> corresponded to years of large deep convergence and relative humidity at 600 hPa. The moisture budget diagnosis indicated that the interannual variation of humidity at 600 hPa was largely modulated by the vertical moisture advection. The year-to-year changes in rainfall over the southern SCS were mainly caused by the interannual variations of the dynamic component associated with anomalous upward motions in the middle troposphere, while the interannual variations of the thermodynamic component associated with changes in surface specific humidity played a minor role.

Melting temperatures and <b>latent</b> <b>heats</b> are determined from peaks in the heat capacities; cohesive energies are obtained for solid clusters from the <b>latent</b> <b>heats</b> and dissociation energies determined for liquid clusters. The melting temperatures, <b>latent</b> <b>heats,</b> and cohesive energies for the aluminum cluster anions are compared to previous measurements for the corresponding cations. Density functional theory calculations have been performed to identify the global minimum energy geometries for the cluster anions. The lowest energy geometries fall into four main families: distorted decahedral fragments, fcc fragments, fcc fragments with stacking faults, and “disordered” roughly spherical structures. The comparison of the cohesive energies for the lowest energy geometries with the measured values allows us to interpret the size variation in the <b>latent</b> <b>heats.</b> Both geometric and electronic shell closings contribute to the variations in the cohesive energies (and <b>latent</b> <b>heats),</b> but structural changes appear to be mainly responsible for the large variations in the melting temperatures with cluster size.

Based on a cloud physics parameterization and the thermodynamic equilibrium equation, a simple algorithm is proposed to estimate <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> from a combination of radiosonde and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) data, specifically, the radar reflectivity and the rain-rate estimates. An evaluation of the algorithm against 6 -hourly areal averages from diagnostic budget studies during the South China Sea Monsoon Experiment (SCMEX) suggests that the algorithm captures well the vertical structure of <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> between the top of the moist layer and the cloud-top detrainment layer. The retrieval algorithm was applied systematically over the Indian subcontinent and Tibetan plateau within a region comprising 158 – 328 N and 708 – 958 E during June, the month of monsoon onset, for three different years (1999, 2000, and 2001). The estimated <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> profiles exhibit large spatial and temporal variability in the magnitude and position of maximum <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> within the same TRMM overpass, and from one year to the next.

5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E

5|$|The {{first stage}} of a {{thunderstorm}} is the cumulus stage or developing stage. During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The trigger for this lift can be solar illumination, where the heating of the ground produces thermals, or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as cumulus clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air.

One of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) facility rain-rate algorithms is based upon passive microwave observations from the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI). In Part I of this series, improvements of the TMI algorithm that are required to introduce <b>latent</b> <b>heating</b> as an additional algorithm product are described.
