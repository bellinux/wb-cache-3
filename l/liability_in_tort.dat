25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the seventeenth}} century, the great bulk of {{litigation}} in England was conducted through the various forms of action which had developed from trespass. This remained the case until the nineteenth century, when these kinds of forms of action were abolished in succession by statute. By 1875, all remaining forms had been replaced by a single form uniform writ whereby the plaintiff endorses the statement for a claim. By that time, the change was purely procedural, but it also freed the substantive law from the old medieval forms of action. It permitted the development of broad concepts, such as <b>liability</b> <b>in</b> <b>tort</b> which could never have come about when confined by the old forms of action, such as trover. This served to rationalize the law. Just as forms of assumpsit replaced debt, so in the seventeenth century trover replaced detinue.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{liability}} can {{be traced}} from ancient Anglo-Saxon law through the time of Bracton. From Alfred the Great: [...] "A man acts at his own peril. If a man have a spear over his shoulder, and any man stakes himself upon it, that man will pay the wer but not the wite... if he be accused of wilfulness in the deed, let him clear himself according to the wite, and with that, let the wite abate. And let this be: if the point be three fingers higher than the hindmost part of the shaft; if they both be on the level, {{the point of the}} hindmost part of the shaft, be that without danger. If a man leaves his arms about, and another knocks them over so that they kill or injure a man, the owner is liable. If a man lend his horse to another and the borrower is injured, the lender is liable." [...] This is similar to the modern concept of strict <b>liability</b> <b>in</b> <b>tort.</b> Liability, at that time, was not dependent upon negligence, but the act.|$|E

2500|$|In principle, UK law {{guarantees}} {{trade unions}} and their members freedom of association. This means people can organise their {{affairs in the}} way they choose, a right reflected in the ILO Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 and the European Convention on Human Rights, article 11. Under the ECHR article 11, freedom of association can only be restricted by law as is [...] "necessary in a democratic society". Traditional common law and equity was superficially similar, since unions form through contract, and the association's property is held on trust for its members according to the association's rules. However, before Parliament became democratic, unions were suppressed for allegedly being in [...] "restraint of trade" [...] and their actions (particularly strikes to improve conditions at work) could be regarded as criminal conspiracy. Nineteenth century reformers, who recognised that unions were democratic, gradually succeeded in guaranteeing unions' freedom of association. The Trade Union Act 1871 aimed to keep the courts away from unions' internal affairs, while the Trade Disputes Act 1906 finally confirmed the right of unions to take collective action, free from <b>liability</b> <b>in</b> <b>tort,</b> if it was [...] "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute". The basic philosophy of [...] "legal abstention" [...] from union organisation lasted until 1971 when the Conservative government attempted comprehensive regulation. This intervention was reversed by Labour in 1974, but after 1979 unions became heavily regulated.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{consensus}} {{about the status of}} the right to strike at common law. On the one hand, the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed that [...] "to cease work except for higher wages, and a strike in consequence, was lawful at common law", that [...] "right of workmen to strike is an essential element in the principle of collective bargaining", [...] "that workmen have a right to strike", and that this is [...] "a fundamental human right". This view would accord with international law, and see the right to stop work in a good faith trade dispute as an implied term in every employment contract. On the other hand, differently composed courts have asserted that the common law position sits at odds with international law: that a strike is a breach of contract, and this creates tortious liability for unions organising collective action, unless it falls within an immunity from statute. On this view, even though an employer is not liable for economic loss to workers who are collectively dismissed, a union could be liable to the employer for taking collective action. Economic torts have been said to include conspiracy to injure, inducement of breach of contract, and tortious interference with a contract. However, TULRCA 1992 section 219 contains the classic formula, that collective action by a trade union becomes immune from any <b>liability</b> <b>in</b> <b>tort</b> if done [...] "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute". This said, various further hurdles must be jumped for a union to be certain of immunity from employers suing for damages, or an injunction to stop a strike.|$|E
2500|$|Problems arise where serious torts, and {{particularly}} fatal injuries {{occur as a}} result of actions by company employees. All torts committed by employees in the course of employment will attribute liability to their company even if acting wholly outside authority, so long as there is some temporal and close connection to work. It is also clear that acts by directors become acts of the company, as they are [...] "the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation." [...] But despite strict <b>liability</b> <b>in</b> <b>tort,</b> civil remedies are in some instances insufficient to provide a deterrent to a company pursuing business practices that could seriously injure the life, health and environment of other people. Even with additional regulation by government bodies, such as the Health and Safety Executive or the Environment Agency, companies may still have a collective incentive to ignore the rules in the knowledge that the costs and likelihood of enforcement is weaker than potential profits. Criminal sanctions remain problematic, for instance if a company director had no intention to harm anyone, no mens rea, and managers in the corporate hierarchy had systems to prevent employees committing offences. One step toward reform is found in the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007. This creates a criminal offence for manslaughter, meaning a penal fine of up to 10 per cent of turnover against companies whose managers conduct business in a grossly negligent fashion, resulting in deaths. Without lifting the veil there remains, however, no personal liability for directors or employees acting in the course of employment, for corporate manslaughter or otherwise. The quality of a company's accountability to a broader public and the conscientiousness of its behaviour must rely also, in great measure, on its governance.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} succeed <b>in</b> a <b>tort</b> suit under {{negligence}} per se, a victim must {{be of the}} class of persons protected by the statute and his injury must be of the type that the statute was intended to prevent. Referring to them as 2 ̆ 2 the limiting liability conditions 2 ̆ 2, this Article calls for a diminishment of their role <b>in</b> determining <b>liability</b> <b>in</b> <b>torts.</b> It is argued that whenever non-compliance with a statutory provision increases risks to the class of persons the victim belongs to or of the type of injury the victim suffered and those risks are foreseeable, there is a strong prima facie case for recognizing liability. This is valid even when the risks that materialized are usual, or background, risks that in themselves would not justify the enactment of the statute. The Article also shows that many court decisions that applied the limiting liability conditions and excluded tort liability because the conditions were not met could have reached the same outcome but on different grounds.

40|$|This Article {{considers}} {{the possibility of}} imposing <b>liability</b> <b>in</b> <b>torts</b> for a wrongfully created risk of future harm. We examine the American and English court decisions pertaining to this issue and consider whether a probability-based compensation for the victim 2 ̆ 7 s expected—albeit not yet materialized—harm is just and efficient. We demonstrate how the virtues of a legal regime that allows a tort victim to recover compensation for her expected harm overshadow its vices. We conclude that a person 2 ̆ 7 s risk of sustaining harm in the future should be actionable whenever the risk is substantial. We further conclude {{that it should be}} left to the victim to decide whether to recover for his or her expected harm, or else wait and see if the risk materializes and recover only if it does. We observe that allowing victims to make this choice might create a collective action problem. Because expedited compensation for a victim 2 ̆ 7 s expected harm erodes the wrongdoer 2 ̆ 7 s ability to compensate future claimants, victims would opt for an early recovery for expected harm even when their substantive remedial preferences are different. We demonstrate, however, that this problem can be resolved...|$|R
