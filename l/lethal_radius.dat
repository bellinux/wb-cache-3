5|$|However, a {{burst of}} intense neutron and gamma {{radiation}} came directly from the fireball. Its <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> was , covering {{about half of the}} firestorm area. An estimated 30% of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation, but died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries would have become apparent. Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of radiation injuries. Among injured survivors, 30% had radiation injuries from which they recovered, but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk. To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors' children.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E
25|$|ERWs {{are more}} {{accurately}} described as suppressed yield weapons. When the yield {{of a nuclear}} weapon is less than one kiloton, its <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> from blast, , is less than that from its neutron radiation. However, the blast is more than potent enough to destroy most structures, which are less resistant to blast effects than even unprotected human beings. Blast pressures of upwards of 20 PSI are survivable, whereas most buildings will collapse with a pressure of only 5 PSI.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} warhead for the Hydra 70 rocket is the M151 [...] "10-Pounder," [...] {{which has a}} blast radius of 10 meters and <b>lethal</b> {{fragmentation}} <b>radius</b> of around 50 meters.|$|R
50|$|The mine is {{normally}} tripwire triggered, with the tripwire pulling a safety pin {{out of the}} fuze, releasing a striker to hit a stab sensitive detonator. The mine {{is reported to be}} <b>lethal</b> to a <b>radius</b> in excess of 30 meters, although it is more typically <b>lethal</b> to a <b>radius</b> of 10 meters.|$|R
5000|$|Under good conditions, the W-71 warhead had a <b>lethal</b> exo-atmospheric <b>radius</b> {{as much as}} 30 miles km, {{although}} it was later stated to be 12 miles km against [...] "soft" [...] targets, and as little as 4 mi against hardened warheads.|$|R
25|$|Even as the Nike was {{undergoing}} testing, planners grew {{concerned about the}} missile's ability to attack formations of aircraft. Given the low resolution of the tracking radars available at the time, a formation of aircraft would appear on the radars as a single larger return. Launched against such a formation, the Nike would fly towards {{the center of the}} composite return. Given the Nike warhead's relatively small <b>lethal</b> <b>radius,</b> if the missile flew {{into the middle of the}} formation and exploded, it would be highly unlikely to destroy any of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The 2A70 rifled gun {{is capable}} of firing guided and unguided shells. 34 {{ready-to-use}} unguided HE-Frag shells are carried in the turret of the vehicle. The 100mm gun is fitted with an autoloader that fires {{at a rate of}} 10-12 rounds per minute, with the time of each shell loading being 5â€“6 seconds. The two variants of HE-Frag shells available for the Bakhcha-U are the 3UOF17 and 3UOF19; the former having a muzzle velocity of 250m/s with the latter achieving 355m/s. The 3UOF19 also provides a substantially larger proximity detonation which increases the <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of the explosion. When implemented in the Bakhcha-U turret, the range of the 2A70 is increased to 7km with its unguided rounds.|$|E
500|$|The [...] DC was {{modified}} {{for use with}} nose and tail fairings for safe usage, in case the aircraft had to ditch, the DC would not explode. It had a hydrostatic pistol which meant it would explode at [...] or more. (This was later found to be too deep.) Other weapons, such as the [...] depth bomb, exploded on contact and was likely to porpoise. [...] DCs were standard until September 1941 but were dangerous for use with aircraft that could not confirm accurate heights. At night, [...] DCs were used instead.

The pistols with a [...] setting were available and Torpex-filled weapons were now in circulation.|$|E
5000|$|Evidence {{supporting}} {{the idea that}} warheads could be [...] "hardened" [...] against the effects of ablation generated shock waves, exists in the two lethal ranges stated for the W71, which had a <b>lethal</b> exo-atmospheric <b>radius</b> of 12 miles km against warheads without countermeasures, but as little as 4 miles km against warheads that did. Although the systems used to counter these attacks remain secret, some details have become public over time. US warheads are known to use aerogel in their structure, a system known as FOGBANK, {{but it is not}} clear if this is used to deaden the shockwave or for other purposes.|$|R
50|$|Technically speaking, all {{low yield}} {{nuclear weapons are}} {{radiation}} weapons, including non-enhanced variants. Up to about 10 kilotons in yield, all nuclear weapons have prompt neutron radiation as their furthest-reaching lethal component, after which point the lethal blast and thermal effects radius begins to out-range the <b>lethal</b> ionizing radiation <b>radius.</b> Enhanced radiation weapons also fall into this same yield range and simply enhance the intensity and range of the neutron dose for a given yield.|$|R
50|$|Henceforth, one's {{chance of}} {{survival}} at 11 km goes from the previous 50% chance of death if they just stood there, gazing at the 1-megaton fireball as it emits all its energy over tens of seconds, to now a mere sunburn, or a 1st-degree burn injury on exposed skin. With the 50% lethal thermal range being thus downrated to being equivalent to a 550 kt explosion, the 50% <b>lethal</b> thermal <b>radius</b> goes from the previous 11 km without ducking and covering to ~7 km with prompt duck and covering within 2 seconds. One can {{think of this as}} going from a scenario were before the majority of people caught in the open, who just stood there staring at the fireball out to a radius of 11 km would probably die from lethal 3rd-degree burns on their unclothed skin, to a scenario now were instead {{the vast majority of people}} who 'duck and cover' from 7 km out to 11 km would remain alive, with generally non life-threatening 1st-degree burns and 2nd-degree burns over their exposed skin, with the burn severity naturally depending on their range from the explosion.|$|R
2500|$|The {{inherent}} inaccuracy of {{anti-aircraft artillery}} {{means that when}} shells reach their targets they are randomly distributed in space. This distribution is {{much larger than the}} <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of the shells, so the chance that any one shell will successfully hit the target is very small. Successful anti-aircraft gunnery therefore requires as many rounds to be fired as possible, increasing the chances that one of the rounds will get a [...] "hit". German gunners estimated that an average of 2,800 shells were required to down a single Boeing B-17.|$|E
2500|$|After earlier combat trials proved troublesome, the Norden bombsight and its {{associated}} AFCE were used on a wide scale {{for the first time}} on the 18 March 1943 mission to Bremen-Vegesack, Germany; The 303d Bombardment Group dropped 76% of its load within a [...] ring, representing a CEP well under [...] As at sea, many early missions over Europe demonstrated varied results; on wider inspection, only 50% of American bombs fell within a [...] of the target, and American flyers estimated that as many as 90% of bombs could miss their targets.

A [...] bomb, standard for precision missions after 1943, had a <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of only [...]|$|E
50|$|It {{contained}} a 150 g high explosive charge in a cylindrical can; the total weight was about 440 grams. The grenade could be thrown about 30 to 50 meters; the <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> {{was up to}} 5 meters; the maximum <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> was up to 15 meters.|$|E
50|$|The SRCM Mod. 35 is an {{offensive}} type hand grenade {{meaning that it}} scatters light shrapnel, <b>lethal</b> within a <b>radius</b> of less than the maximum distance of the throw, their purpose being to cover the advance of the thrower without the thrower having to seek cover. Typical throwing range is 20-25 meters and the effective range of the shrapnel 10-15 meters. The outer shell of the grenade is aluminum, containing 43 grams of TNT and dinitronaphthalene with an internal wire wrapped around it that turns into shrapnel {{at the time of}} the explosion. It has two safeties, a manual one consisting of a crossbar with brass handle and an automatic one, consisting by a cross bar of aluminum connected to an external handle.|$|R
5000|$|Type 65 (Chinese) - HE-FRAG 4.6 kg. Warhead {{contains}} approx 780 balls - <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> 20 m. Muzzle velocity 175 m/s. Max range 1750 m.|$|E
5000|$|In its antipersonnel capacity, the APAV 40 {{is used in}} {{indirect}} fire. The APAV 40 has a <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of 12 metres and its shrapnel {{is dangerous}} up to 100 metres away.|$|E
50|$|The Type 67 82mm mortar can use {{different}} types of shells. The shrapnel of this mortar weights 3.32 kg, with a 0.4 kg TNT, and the <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of this shrapnel is 26m.|$|E
50|$|The grenade has a <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> {{of between}} 4 and 10 meters, and a safety radius of 25 meters. It can be thrown 30 to 40 meters. The grenade is {{currently}} in production in Russia and Ukraine, and is in service {{with a number of}} other countries.|$|E
50|$|A {{bouncing}} grenade, the VOG-25P, is also available. On impact, a small {{charge in}} {{the nose of the}} grenade is detonated; this raises the grenade 0.5 to 1.5 m in the air, before an impact delay fuse detonates it. The VOG-25P also has a <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of 6 meters.|$|E
50|$|All of {{the early}} Falcons had a small 7.6 lb (3.4 kg) warhead, {{limiting}} their <b>lethal</b> <b>radius.</b> Also limiting them tactically {{was the fact that}} Falcon lacked a proximity fuze: the fuzing for the missile was in the leading edges of the wings, requiring a direct hit to detonate.|$|E
50|$|Type 69 75mm {{airburst}} anti-personnel high-explosive (HE): {{created for}} anti-personnel purposes. This is mostly meant to combat against entrenched forces since the rocket, after gaining {{impact on the}} ground, bounces to a height of around 2m then airbursts over the target area, scattering about 800 anti-personnel steel balls over a <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of 15m.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the mine}} is scattered, {{the top is}} ejected, {{allowing}} the spring-loaded legs to fold down. Also four tripwires are launched away from the mine. After a short period the mine is armed, from that point on, any disturbance of the trip wires will trigger the mine, scattering fragments to a <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of approximately 15 meters.|$|E
50|$|The missile was a {{two-stage}} rocket with inertial guidance, {{which could}} not be corrected after launch. The missile carried a nuclear depth bomb warhead of up to 10 kilotons in yield. The warhead could detonate at a depth of up to 200 m and had a <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of 1.2 to 1.5 km against a submarine target.|$|E
50|$|The missile, {{designated}} R-23, entered {{service in}} January 1974, the SARH version as the R-23R, the IR version R-23T. Both versions {{used the same}} motor and warhead, which had a <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of 8 m (26 ft). In the west these were known as the AA-7A and AA-7B, respectively. An inert training round, the R-23UT, was also developed.|$|E
50|$|When {{used as a}} {{stake mine}} the mine is {{inverted}} and an MUV type pull fuse is inserted into {{the base of the}} mine, and the normal pressure fuse hole is used to attach the mine to the stake. When used with the fragmentation jacket the mine has a <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of 15 metres, although the fragments may be lethal at greater range.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{plans for}} solving this problem were rather advanced. The large {{airframe}} left {{plenty of room}} in the nose, which the designers intended to fill with a self-contained radar unit called Elsass. In the short term it was planned to use some sort of proximity fuze while flying the missile through the bomber stream. The warhead, of which several were studied, {{was to have a}} nominal <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of 45 m.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} other rockets were {{developed}} for the launcher, including a dual purpose anti-personnel/anti-vehicle rocket whose warhead contains 1,600 steel balls along with a smaller HEAT antiarmour warhead. The steel balls have a <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of approximately 20 metres and the shaped charge is capable of penetrating up to 100 millimetres of steel plating. A smoke round was developed, that produces smoke for approximately 35 seconds; and an illumination round that produces 300,000 candela for 30 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Raytheon {{successfully}} conducted {{flight tests}} in October 2010, {{and it may}} be used to arm the AAI RQ-7 Shadow. It weighs 13 lbs kg, and originally had a 7 lb warhead. On April 18, 2011, Raytheon successfully tested a new 5 lb warhead for the weapon. Though lighter, the new warhead has a significantly improved blast-fragment capability. Designed for low collateral damage, its <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> is only 15 ft, with non-lethal effects extending further but lethality dropping dramatically.|$|E
50|$|The grenade {{launchers}} fire {{a series}} of special 40 mm grenades. Originally, the main grenade was the VOG-15 (7P17) fragmentation grenade. This was superseded by the steel-cased VOG-25 fragmentation grenade. The VOG-25 has a <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of six meters. Rounds for the muzzle-loaded GP-25 consist of a single piece containing both propellant and warhead, unlike the more traditional two piece casing-and-projectile design of the comparable American 40x46mm round used in breech-loaded grenade launchers, such as the M203.|$|E
50|$|ERWs {{are more}} {{accurately}} described as suppressed yield weapons. When the yield {{of a nuclear}} weapon is less than one kiloton, its <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> from blast, 700 m, is less than that from its neutron radiation. However, the blast is more than potent enough to destroy most structures, which are less resistant to blast effects than even unprotected human beings. Blast pressures of upwards of 20 PSI are survivable, whereas most buildings will collapse with a pressure of only 5 PSI.|$|E
5000|$|To {{test the}} system fully, the Army {{took control of}} Kwajalein Island from the US Navy, and began {{building}} an entire Zeus site on the island. By 1962 the system was ready for testing, and after some initial problems, demonstrated its ability to intercept warheads launched from California. Eventually fourteen [...] "all up" [...] tests were carried {{out over the next}} two years, with ten of them bringing the missile within the <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of its warhead, sometimes within a few hundred meters.|$|E
50|$|The {{resultant}} weapon {{carried a}} 1.5-kiloton W25 nuclear warhead and was {{powered by a}} Thiokol SR49-TC-1 solid-fuel rocket engine of 162 kN thrust. It had a range of slightly under 10 km. Targeting, arming, and firing of the weapon were coordinated by the launch aircraft's fire-control system. Detonation was by time-delay fuze, although the fuzing mechanism would not arm the warhead until engine burn-out, to give the launch aircraft sufficient time to turn and escape. <b>Lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of the blast {{was estimated to be}} about 300 m.|$|E
50|$|This {{leads to}} a catch-22 situation. As the FOV is reduced, the seeker becomes more accurate, and this also helps {{eliminate}} background sources which helps improve tracking. However, limiting it too much allows the target {{to move out of}} the FOV and be lost to the seeker. To be effective for guidance to the <b>lethal</b> <b>radius,</b> tracking angles of perhaps one degree are ideal, but to be able to continually track the target safely, FOVs on the order of 10 degrees or more are desired.|$|E
50|$|The missile {{typically}} mounts a 195 kg fragmentation warhead, with proximity, contact, {{and command}} fusing. The warhead has a <b>lethal</b> <b>radius</b> of about 65 m at lower altitudes, but at higher altitudes the thinner atmosphere {{allows for a}} wider radius of up to 250 m. The missile itself is accurate to about 75 m, which explains why two were typically fired in a salvo. One version, the SA-2E, mounted a 295 kg nuclear warhead of an estimated 15 kiloton yield or a conventional warhead of similar weight.|$|E
