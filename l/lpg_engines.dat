50|$|Until {{the late}} 1990s, all Hong Kong taxis ran on diesel fuel, aside from 4-passenger taxis which ran on petrol. In 1996, a few taxis that ran on LPG {{appeared}} {{as part of}} the government's test project for alternative fuel. This project proved successful, leading to all new taxis being factory-built LPG since 1999. To speed up the replacement of diesel taxis with LPG ones, from mid 2000 to the end of 2003, the government offered a cash grant to each taxi owner who purchased a new LPG taxi during that period. Since 1 August 2001, no more diesel taxis were allowed to be imported into Hong Kong, and from 1 January 2006, driving a diesel taxi on the streets of Hong Kong became illegal. Therefore, all taxis in Hong Kong are currently running on LPG.Although LPG-powered vehicles are supposed to be relatively non-polluting, and do indeed reduce roadside pollution, a 2007 study by Polytechnic University indicated that older LPG taxis emitted at least double the amount of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons compared to diesel.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate and compare the performance and emission characteristics of the liquefied petroleum gas (<b>LPG)</b> -fuelled <b>engine</b> generator and the conventional gasoline-fuelled engine generator. The approach involves converting a gasoline engine generator, commonly used in Malaysian night markets to generate electricity, to the <b>LPG</b> <b>engine</b> generator. A four-stroke SI single-cylinder engine is equipped with an LPG injection system with minor modifications and then tested with both LPG and gasoline fuels. A venturi mixer (carburettor) was designed and in house constructed and then installed to deliver a proper A/F ratio to the combustion chamber. The commercial computational fluid dynamics software FLUENT was used for simulation of air flow inside the mixer. The converted engine was tested at constant speed for its brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), efficiency, exhaust temperature, and exhaust gas emissions. The results show that the performance and emission characteristics of the LPG-fuelled engine are well suited for use in night markets. Average BSFC and average efficiency for the <b>LPG</b> <b>engine</b> over a range of loads were quite similar to those for the gasoline engine: the average BSFC was 0. 95 kg/kWh for the <b>LPG</b> <b>engine</b> and 1 kg/kWh for the gasoline engine. The lower energy content of LPG causes only a slight reduction in efficiency as 17 per cent reduction in average efficiency was recorded over the entire load range; however, the <b>LPG</b> <b>engine</b> fared better at higher loads than the gasoline engine for which only as low as 4 per cent reduction was recorded at high loads. Emission testsseemto verify the minimal pollution products; there are significant reductions in the emission concentration results when LPG is used. Average decreases of 32 per cent for nitrogen oxide, 10 per cent for carbon dioxide, and 40 per cent for carbon monoxide were recorded. However, higher values of hydrocarbon were recorded, but as high as 50 per cent reduction in HC was found for loads higher than 700 W. The study verified the more favourable features ofLPGcompared to gasoline as it is one of the best alternative fuels to gasoline for spark-ignition engine generators to solve the air pollution problem in night markets...|$|R

40|$|Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is an {{alternative}} fuel in spark ignited premix combustion engine and emissions from <b>LPG</b> <b>engines</b> are lower than those in gasoline engines. This article presents a novel method of changing the ignition curve in an LPG/Gasoline bi-fuel engines which still use the converter and mixer models. The goal {{of this research was}} to get the best engine power in fuel operating mode both gasoline and LPG. It is known that the gasoline and LPG have different properties, especially burning speeds. In order to obtain optimum engine performance in both fuels, there should be two ignition curves, one for gasoline and the other for LPG. A circuit Simple Electronic Spark Module (SESM) was applied to manipulate the feedback voltage from a Manifold Absolute Pressure Sensor (MAPS). In the gasoline mode when idle, feedback from the MAPS was 1. 4 volts. In this study, the standard ignition curve was maintained for the gasoline operation mode, whereas, in the LPG operation mode, feedback from MAPS was varied at 1. 4; 1. 2; 1. 0; 0. 8; and 0. 6 volts at idling respectively. The Toyota 5 A-FE engine was tested on a chassis dynamo meter to confirm the performance of the circuit.

The concentrations of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water-soluble ions, and up to 40 elements (Na to U) were determined. The average PM 2. 5 mass concentrations were 229 ± 90, 129 ± 95, 69 ± 12, 49 ± 18 μg m- 3 in the urban tunnel, cross boundary roadside, urban roadside, and urban ambient environments, respectively. Carbonaceous particles (sum of organic material [OM] and EC) were the dominant constituents, on average, accounting for ~ 82 % of PM 2. 5 emissions in the tunnel, ~ 70 % at the three roadside sites, and ~ 48 % at the ambient site, respectively. The OC/EC ratios were 0. 6 ± 0. 2 and 0. 8 ± 0. 1 at the tunnel and roadside sites, respectively, suggesting carbonaceous aerosols were mainly from vehicle exhausts. Higher OC/EC ratio (1. 9 ± 0. 7) occurred at the ambient site, indicating contributions from secondary organic aerosols. The PM 2. 5 emission factor for on-road diesel-fueled vehicles in the urban area of Hong Kong was 257 ± 31 mg veh- 1 km- 1, with a composition of ~ 51 % EC, ~ 26 % OC, and ~ 9 % SO 4 =.
