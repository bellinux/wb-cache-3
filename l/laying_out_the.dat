5|$|Another {{portion of}} modern VT 14, between East Brookfield and Williamstown center, {{was to be}} {{improved}} by another turnpike corporation, the Williamstown Center Turnpike, which was chartered on November 14, 1803. The charter provided that the road {{be turned over to}} the state after having been in operation for 25 years (later amended to 40 years).

5|$|Strange {{arranged}} the Pro Tools session {{in a more}} traditional manner by <b>laying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> drums, bass instruments, guitars, keyboards, main vocals and overdubs from left to right. While mixing, he began with drums, then the main vocals. He added the chorus and bridge, followed by other instrumentation. Strange mixed the track to satisfy Eminem, who, after entering the studio, made his own adjustments, providing additional production; by then, Resto's tracks were added. Strange made adjustments to Boi-1da's tracks, using SSL equalization (EQ) and some compression. To keep the track in tune from pitch fluctuation, Strange used Trim and Auto-Tune on Resto's TR-808 kick. Strange arranged reverberation tools, including the Bricasti, Eventide 2016, the Lexicon 480, Lexicon PMC70, and the Yamaha SPX90.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after Randolph {{finished}} <b>laying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Plan, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina {{presented his}} own {{plan to the}} Convention. As Pinckney did not write it down, the only evidence of the plan are Madison's notes, so the details are somewhat vague. It was a confederation, or treaty, among the thirteen states. There {{was to be a}} bicameral legislature made up of a Senate and a House of Delegates. The House would have one member for every one thousand inhabitants. The House would elect Senators who would serve by rotation for four years and represent one of four regions. Congress would meet in a joint session to elect a President, and would also appoint members of the cabinet. Congress, in joint session, would serve as the court of appeal of last resort in disputes between states. Pinckney did also provide for a supreme Federal Judicial Court. The Pinckney plan was not debated, but it may have been referred to by the Committee of Detail.|$|E
5|$|Aberdour Castle was {{reserved}} to his mother-in-law, Countess Katherine, until 1564, when Mary, Queen of Scots, confirmed Morton's {{right to the}} whole barony of Dalkeith and Aberdour. In 1566, Morton was involved in planning a rebellion against the Queen, {{which resulted in the}} murder of Queen Mary's secretary, David Riccio, but failed to gain further momentum, and Morton was forced to flee to England. However, {{by the end of the}} year he had returned, and by July the following year, Mary was imprisoned and had been forced to abdicate by the Scottish noblemen. Morton was appointed Regent of Scotland, for the child King James VI in 1572. He undertook extensions to the castle in the 1570s, rebuilding the south block of c. 1500, and extending it further south to form the present central range. He also drew inspiration from contemporary gardens in England, such as Hampton Court, in <b>laying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> terraced gardens. The Privy Council met at Aberdour Castle in August 1576, but Morton's regency came to an end in 1578. He was later implicated in the 1567 murder of Queen Mary's husband, Lord Darnley, and executed in 1581 on the orders of the young King.|$|E

25|$|At {{the entry}} to the churchyard are an {{adjoining}} stile, a lychgate and a former mortuary. The stile dates from the 19thcentury.

The former mortuary, which is now used as a store, is a stone building which was used for <b>laying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> corpses of drowned sailors.|$|E

The Old Wagon Road was established along the creek from Waterville, Washington to Ritzville, Washington in 1888.|$|E
