40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{navigation}} is a safe and efficient leading of the ship between various points. This process should be safely and efficiently. The process of safe movement of the ship in the area is called safe navigation. These areas are called as <b>limited</b> <b>waters.</b> The manoeuvring of ships on each water area is connected with the risk of accident, which is unwanted event in results of this can appear the losses. Among water areas there are those where ship manoeuvring is restricted more than in other sea areas. These areas are called as <b>limited</b> <b>waters.</b> They are mainly characterised a relatively high number of navigation accidents. The assessing of navigation safety requires the application of proper criteria, measures and factors. The criteria {{make it possible to}} estimate the probability of navigational accident for certain conditions. The safety of ship’s movement can be identified as admissible risk, as a combination of probability of accident and losses. The overall risk of ship movement in water area in then the sum of these single risks depehd on the under keel clearance, distance to navigational obstruction, air drought, collision with other floating craft and berthing energy. Such way permits to assess of safety of ship’s manoeuvring by quantity.

40|$|The humic acids from podzolic soils of {{north-western}} {{and western}} Tasmania have the general chemical and optical {{properties of the}} group {{as described in the}} literature. They do not correspond closely to the humic acids of the classical Northern Hemisphere podzol in that they have higher C : H ratios and lower optical densities. In addition they provide a far higher proportion of the total humic substances than do the humic acids of the classical podzol. All samples of humic acids extracted from the Tasmanian soils exhibit very strong solvent activity towards minerals, particularly those of economic deposits. For example, 50 ml of a 500 mg/ solution of the humic acids from soil developed under white topped stringybark (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), extracted 2 500 pg of lead from 7. 6 g of 0. 3 to 0. 6 mm diameter grains of galena in 24 hours. Even gold is soluble in solutions of humic acids and {{it is likely that the}} formation of gold humates is the important mechanism of transport of this metal in wet temperature climates. The aggressive action of humic acids towards minerals in the experimental studies, leaves no doubt as to their potential in weathering. Since the minerals of economic deposits are highly vulnerable, the rapid degradation of sulphides and secondary minerals may explain the poor development of gossans over mineralisation in Tasmania during the current erosional cycle. The activity of humic acids presents a problem in geochemical prospecting since secondary dispersion patterns may be weakened or obliterated. The mechanism of the interaction of humic acids with minerals and cations has been investigated by means of pH measurements, potentiometric titration, polarography, x-ray diffraction, electrophoresis and infra-red spectroscopy. All these indicate that complexation is an important mechanism of reaction. Polarographic studies also suggest that the most probable value for the standard reduction potential of humic acids is about 0. 7 V. Reaction kinetic studies of several of the rapid reactions between humic acids and minerals indicate that the reactions involved are of first order. The simple organic compounds of soils, such as amino acids for example, are no more active in mineral degradation than are humic acids. In view of the low concentration and rapid bacterial utilisation of these compounds their contribution to weathering must be <b>limited.</b> <b>Waters</b> enriched in CO 2 also appear less efficient as solvents than humic acids, since on the basis of equivalent carbon contents the latter are far more effective. From an extremely conservative estimate, it appears that some 150 000 tonnes of humic substances flow to the sea from an aggregate catchment of about 20 000 km 2 in western Tasmania every year. Thus these substances have both the power and quantity to play an important role in the wet temperate weathering cycle...|$|E
40|$|Recent work {{indicates}} that nitrogen stable isotopic signatures of aquatic biota {{can be used}} to link nutrient inputs in the marine environment to terrestrial sources. While this technique of tracing nutrients {{has been shown to be}} effective in environments that are not nutrient limited, it has not been proved that this method is effective in oligotrophic environments. This study examined whether nitrogen stable isotopic signatures of marine biota {{can be used to}} trace the distribution of sewage effluent in highly mixed, nitrogen <b>limited</b> <b>waters,</b> by examining the δ 15 N values of marine biota situated close to and distant from a secondary treated sewage outlet. The study was conducted in the vicinity of the Marmion Marine Park, off the coast of Ocean Reef, Western Australia. The study comprised two experimental components. The first component tested whether the δ 15 N value of three macroalgal species (Ulva australis, Vidalia sp. and Eklorzia radiata) with varying nutrient uptake capacities (high, medium and low respectively) were representative of the distribution of sewage dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) over different time periods. Also, whether the δ 15 N values of two filter feeding species (Clathria sp. and Pyura australis) were representative of the distribution of sewage particulate organic matter (POM). The second component was a laboratory experiment designed to confirm that this same set of species were actually able to develop an isotopic signature representative of sewage, when exposed to low concentrations of sewage in seawater. Results from the laboratory experiment confirmed that all species, with the exception of E. radiata, developed higher isotopic signatures when exposed to very low concentrations of sewage nitrogen (1 : 500 dilution in seawater). In the field experiment, the three species of macroalgae sampled north and south of the sewage outlet generally had higher δ 15 N values than organisms sampled west of the outlet and at the reference site. This is consistent with our current knowledge of effluent dispersal in the area. The results also suggest the plume moves further north than previously expected. Thus it was confirmed that the δ 15 N signature of macroalgae can be used to trace sewage disposed in well mixed waters. It also appears that macroalgae are able to log a unique time-integrated record of ambient sewage, which can be used to provide data on the short and medium-term accumulation of sewage N into the benthic system. It is less likely that the low nutrient uptake species selected for this study (E. radiata) is capable of representing long term pattern in effluent dispersal. δ 15 N values of benthic filter feeders did not provide comprehensive evidence to suggest that they can be used to represent the distribution of sewage POM, however trends found in the field experiment for Chlathria sp. warrants further investigation. These results demonstrate that the δ 15 N values of marine biota, specifically macroalgae, can be used to map the distribution of terrestrial nutrient sources affecting marine ecosystems in an oligotrophic environment and on a limited range of time scales...|$|E

This study aimed at quantifying the least <b>limiting</b> <b>water</b> range and demonstrating its potential in soil and water management in irrigated agriculture. In order to determine the least <b>limiting</b> <b>water</b> range, soil water retention curves and soil resistance to penetration were determined from undisturbed soil samples.

Soil compression and least <b>limiting</b> <b>water</b> range were evaluated with undisturbed samples at a depth of 0. 00 - 0. 05 m. In order to evaluate parameters of soil compressibility, the soil samples were saturated with water and subjected to - 10 kPa matric potential and then submitted to a uniaxial compression test under the following pressures: 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1600 kPa. Cover crops decreased the preconsolidation pressure of constructed soils after coal mining and the greatest soil reclamation was obtained with the H. altissima cover crop, where the lowest degree of soil compactness and soil load capacity were observed.
