50|$|In the 1930s he {{launched}} his lifelong {{struggle for the}} recognition in Italy of garden and landscape design as a modern profession. In the world of Italian architecture and town planning non-architects were generally excluded from landscape design.In 1937 Porcinai began writing for the magazine Domus (magazine) directed by Giò Ponti, which rapidly become Europe’s most influential design publication. This gave him not only his own professional opening, but also the opportunity to educate both architects and {{the public at large}} in the importance of landscape design.In 1938 Porcinai settled a studio in Florence with the architects Nello Baroni and Maurizio Tempestini. This dynamic studio rapidly became a benchmark in the cultural life of the city, introducing Porcinai to the influential business dynasties who were to remain his loyal clients throughout his professional career.In 1948 in Cambridge {{he was one of the}} 17 founder members of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA). A staunch defender of the natural and <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage,</b> at length he championed the cause of a proper training in landscape and garden architecture in Italy, coming up against a wall of indifference in the schools and even the universities. In 1950, with a handful of other pioneers, he fathered the foundation of the Italian section of the IFLA in the form of the AIAP (Italian Association of Garden and Landscape Architects) of which Porcinai was for many years secretary and, from 1979 on, Honorary President.In Italy the post-war economic reconstruction produced a new moneyed class of industrial entrepreneurs: manufacturers of televisions and textiles, and executives in the burgeoning empires of petroleum and technology. The Italian practice of holding design competitions for public projects provided more visibility for his expanding practice. From designing private gardens for industrialists it was a logical step to projecting sites for factories and offices: notable examples include the Mondadori centre in Segrate, Milan (in collaboration with Oscar Niemeyer), and the Brion Vega plant in Caselle d’Asolo, Venice. A growing reputation for swimming pool design led to commissions from hotels, including the Hotel des Bains at the Venice Lido and resort complexes such as the holiday village in Nicotera Marina in southern Italy.In the 1970s public parks and urban design projects became an important part of Porcinai’s practice, with an increasing number of commissions from outside Italy. Major projects included plans for parks in four Saudi Arabian cities (in collaboration with Albini, Helg and Partners), the Place Beaubourg in front of the Pompidou Centre in Paris (as consultant to the architects Piano and Rogers), a design for the Parco Sempione in Milan (with the architect Viganò), and the Parco della Favorita in Palermo, Sicily. He was also engaged in large-scale projects such as the new Brennero motorway in northern Italy and the intricate relocation of the Egyptian temple of Abu Simbel for UNESCO.Porcinai was convinced of the need to apply the lessons of the garden to the ecology of the urban context. He attacked the arrogant imposition of architectural theory on the modern city. However, he did not confine his criticism to the architectural profession: he was prepared to indict modern society for the twin evils of materialism and collectivism. The solution must lie in a process of education - in his words “a task of evangelisation”.Frustrated by the architects’ domination of design education in the Italian universities, in the 1960s Porcinai resolved to establish an educational centre at Villa Rondinelli.The villa would become in the 20th century what the neighbouring Villa Medici was in the Quattrocento - a meeting place for artists and philosophers. The new studios were constructed in the villa garden for this purpose.Unfortunately, the dream faded in the 1970s. Although Porcinai had acquired clients among the new elite, he had also made enemies. A period of enforced exile, during which he opened an office in Beirut, undermined the financial basis of the educational centre.Committed to the profession, he took an active part in a number of international conferences; in 1971 he took part in the First International Symposium on the protection and restoration of historic gardens in Fontainebleau held by ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites) where he promoted the ICOMOS-IFLA International Committee for Historic Gardens, which in 1982 drew up The Florence Charter on preservation of historic gardens, a set of rules governing the maintenance, conservation, restoration and reconstruction of historic gardens.|$|E

Thus, conserving the rural landscape heritages is significant to ensure that it not been taken up by rapid development, climate change and also other threats. The study on rural <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> conservation is still new in Malaysia. There is much information needed in order to preserve and conserve rural <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> in Malaysia. One of the issues is on community perception on the rural <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> conservation. This research is aimed to evaluate the community perception on the rural <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> conservation. Three objectives has been developed to achieve the goal of this research. First is to understand the community perception on the rural <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage.</b> Second is to investigate the views of the rural landscape from community perspectives. Third is to recommend fundamental ways in enhancing the rural landscape value in Malaysia. Methods used to gather the data are visual observation, questionnaires survey and focus group discussion. Study area were consisted of a rural landscape area in Lenggong, Perak. Observation includes taking a photograph of rural landscape of Lenggong as guided by a set of criteria. Selected photographs used in the questionnaires. It consisted of demographic profile, Likert-scale questions and open ended questions. Focus group discussion conducted to support data needed. The data were analyzed by using SPSS and manual transcription. Then it was triangulated between questionnaire survey and focus group discussion.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1994 Dr. Janet Anne SchapperThe {{aim of the research}} is to develop key criteria for the evaluation of landscape as heritage. Evolution of the concept of heritage as it applies to landscape is examined to lay the foundation for establishing the criteria. To set up an understanding of the criteria which could be useful, current <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> theory is analysed. This analysis clarifies the modern concept of <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> value, establishes the component values which contribute to it, and explains the relationship of the criteria to the components. Two aspects of heritage practice are investigated to determine whether criteria identified from the theory are useful. Heritage organisations in Australia and the criteria they aim to use - or believe they use – are investigated. The investigation consists of a review of documents produced by selected heritage organisations and interviews with the staff responsible for landscape assessment. Statements of significance or listings (summary statements encapsulating the reasons why a place is considered to have heritage value) are then analysed using content and cluster analysis techniques. This determines the criteria that heritage organisations actually use for designating <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> value. Conclusions from the theoretical and practical investigations are synthesised and key criteria for evaluating <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> are deduced. Two groups of criteria are necessary: principal criteria and secondary criteria. Principal criteria are the components of value which determine the presence of <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> value, and they include symbolic, aesthetic, historic, scientific, social and archaeological value. Secondary criteria are the measures of value which are applied to the components of value to determine the level of <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> value. They include integrity, state of preservation or condition, authenticity, uniqueness, rarity, representativeness and example. Economic value is rejected as a criterion for assessment. <b>Landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> typing assists in the evaluation process. Typical criteria profiles exist for each landscape type. A method of assessment is proposed in which criteria are systematically evaluated for each landscape type, bearing in mind the criteria profile. Thus the likely dominant criteria are anticipated for that landscape type. This method permits like to be compared with like, and streamlines and simplifies assessment. The research provides a basis for any community or nation to gain a stronger sense of its own identity through greater understanding of its natural and cultural landscapes, their significance, and how they should be valued. Such improved understanding should contribute to Australia's efforts to define itself in the global community. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Usually {{heritage}} {{landscape is}} seen as a natural and a cultural resource. But, in the base of those landscapes we can meet social practices, an intangible heritage that give cohesion to the natural and cultural aspects. Our scope it's to debate ideas comparing examples. Between the well preserved Chinese rice heritage landscapes, suported by millenary social and farming practices, and the abandonned European terraces, an essential social question emerges: the preservation of the <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> is supported not only by natural and cultural elements but also by social practices, technical knowlegde and ways of understanding Nature. Efforts to the heritage landscape maintenance has been limited to the natural and cultural elements preservation, forgotting often the referred social cohesion factors. To safeguard heritage, the cultural landscape should be duly interpreted which means the understanding of the ecological, social and even economic functionality of the landscape structures. Aim of the presentation: The main aim of the communication is to analyse how the preservation and interpretation of the <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> depend not only on natural and cultural elements but also on the existence of traditional practices and social cohesion. This analysis is accompained with the comparision of existing terrace landscapes from Europe and others. The authors propose a <b>landscape</b> <b>heritage</b> monitoring method through the introduction of new indicators and the development of weighting coeficients strategies. Résumé of your experience in working with or studying interpretation: The authors are studying interpretation of cultural landscapes since the eighties (Project COST G 2).
