40|$|Abstract: Osteosynthesis of intraarticular tibial pilon {{fractures}} is preferably achieved using locking plates via a {{minimally invasive}} technique. If combined with severe soft tissue damage {{there is a}} high risk of wound-healing deficits after plate osteosynthesis. Thus our aim was to find an alternative method of treatment for those cases with combined soft tissue injuries. We report on five cases with comminuted fractures of the joint surface combined with critical soft tissue condition that were treated with <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> and external fixation (AO) applied across the ankle joint. All five patients were followed up, undergoing clinical and radiological examination. Using this approach we achieved fracture healing of comminuted fractures without further complications. Clinical follow-up after an average of 55. 6 (36 – 75) months revealed a mean AOFAS score of 81 (62 – 100). We therefore propose combined treatment using <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> with external fixation as a practical treatment option for those fractures for which <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> combined with a locking plate are not feasible or when {{there is a high}} risk of wound-healing deficits due to severe soft tissue damage...|$|R
50|$|Dynamic hip screw (DHS) or Sliding Screw Fixation {{is a type}} of {{orthopaedic}} implant designed for fixation of certain types of hip fractures which allows controlled dynamic sliding of the femoral head component along the construct. One common use is internal fixation of intertrochanteric fractures of the femur, which are common in older osteoporotic patients. There are 3 components of a dynamic hip screw, including a <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> (inserted into the neck of the femur), a sideplate and four cortical screws (fixated into the proximal femoral shaft). The idea behind the dynamic compression is that the femoral head component is allowed to move along one plane; since bone responds to dynamic stresses, the native femur may undergo primary healing: cells join along boundaries, resulting in a robust joint requiring no remodeling.|$|E

5000|$|Biggest {{problem here}} is {{determining}} the offset correctly. The home is usually stone or brick and the walls are never true and plumb - {{the distance from the}} casing to several points on the masonry can be scary. Measure {{from the face of the}} casing to the face of the structure.

An offset that's too great will always work; one that's even the slightest bit too small will never work.

50|$|If the {{displacement}} at fracture {{is less than}} 2 mm, it may be managed conservatively. However, displacement of more than 2mm requires open reduction and internal fixation with 1-2 <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> to prevent onset of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.|$|R

30|$|Although {{use of a}} distal femur lateral {{locking plate}} with or without {{application}} of <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> has been the gold standard during the last decade, most recent works reported high rates of defective callus formation, delayed union, nonunion, malrotation, and implant failure, especially in comminuted cases, despite use of a single ordinary or mini-invasive lateral or anterolateral approach [26 – 30]. This {{could be due to}} a mechanical problem related to application of this plate, particularly in the absence of fragment compression and primary autogenous bone grafting. In this study, the lateral locked plate was applied in all cases, with 100  % union rate, which could be attributed to the easily applied isolated multidirectional compression <b>lag</b> <b>screws,</b> the medial support plating, and the primary autogenous bone grafting, although it added a second site of potential morbidity in 25  % of patients.|$|R

For the twin hook, gradual increase of load and torque occurred during impaction of the bone supporting the hooks. The peak loads and torques were higher for the <b>lag</b> <b>screw,</b> but were similar for both devices after 8 rum deformation. The stiffness was higher for the <b>lag</b> <b>screw,</b> but in counter-clockwise rotation the stiffness for the <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> was negligible.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Lag</b> <b>screw</b> cut-out failure {{following}} fixation of unstable intertrochanteric {{fractures in}} osteoporotic bone remains an unsolved challenge. This study tested if resistance to cut-out failure {{can be improved}} by using a dual <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implant {{in place of a}} single <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implant. Migration behavior and cut-out resistance of a single and a dual <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implant were comparatively evaluated in surrogate specimens using an established laboratory model of hip screw cut-out failure. Methods Five dual <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implants (Endovis, Citieffe) and five single <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implants (DHS, Synthes) were tested in the Hip Implant Performance Simulator (HIPS) of the Legacy Biomechanics Laboratory. This model simulated osteoporotic bone, an unstable fracture, and biaxial rocking motion representative of hip loading during normal gait. All constructs were loaded up to 20, 000 cycles of 1. 45 kN peak magnitude under biaxial rocking motion. The migration kinematics was continuously monitored with 6 -degrees of freedom motion tracking system and the number of cycles to implant cut-out was recorded. Results The dual <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implant exhibited significantly less migration and sustained more loading cycles in comparison to the DHS single <b>lag</b> <b>screw.</b> All DHS constructs failed before 20, 000 cycles, on average at 6, 638 ± 2, 837 cycles either by cut-out or permanent screw bending. At failure, DHS constructs exhibited 10. 8 ± 2. 3 ° varus collapse and 15. 5 ± 9. 5 ° rotation around the <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> axis. Four out of five dual screws constructs sustained 20, 000 loading cycles. One dual screw specimens sustained cut-out by medial migration of the distal screw after 10, 054 cycles. At test end, varus collapse and neck rotation in dual screws implants advanced to 3. 7 ± 1. 7 ° and 1. 6 ± 1. 0 °, respectively. Conclusion The single and double <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implants demonstrated a significantly different migration resistance in surrogate specimens under gait loading simulation with the HIPS model. In this model, the double screw construct provided significantly greater resistance against varus collapse and neck rotation in comparison to a standard DHS <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implant. </p...|$|E

30|$|Hoffa {{fractures}} are intraarticular fractures. Most of them need surgical open {{reduction and}} internal fixation to achieve good outcome (Lewis et al. 1989; Letenneur et al. 1978; McDonough and Bernstein 2000; Manfredini et al. 2001). But the operation approach and fixation method are still been improving. It is generally accepted that screw fixation {{is a good}} fixation method for treating Hoffa fractures. In Type I and Type III Hoffa fractures, an anterolateral (or anteromedial) incision is usually used, and two anteroposteriorly placed <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> are inserted from the non-articular area just proximal to the patella-femoral joint to engage the fractured condylar fragment. One screw is inserted into the femoral shaft to provide rotational stability (Ostermann et al. 1994).
