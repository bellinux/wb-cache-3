Everything went in slow motion. I could almost feel the bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I felt like I was a million miles away, <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> all a dream.|$|E
25|$|The Englewood {{community}} was largely {{defined by the}} Englewood Shopping Center at 63rd & Halsted, a large pedestrian mall. The City, social services, and mall management worked with community leaders and groups to integrate the mall with the community. The goal {{was to make the}} mall {{a vital part of the}} community, and a central part of everyday life. It was the site of numerous community events, parades, outdoor concerts, live radio broadcasts and the <b>like.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> spearheaded by the Englewood Business Men's Association and its director, Richard Drew. Mr. Drew died in 1978, and with his passing the Association lost its community focus. The Center subsequently lost its major anchor tenants, including Sears Roebuck, and became a collection of smaller merchants.|$|E
25|$|The two-year {{war between}} the ABA and the USBA was perhaps the ugliest rivalry that BMX has ever saw. It seems the USBA was making most of the {{aggressive}} moves. The motivation for rivalries <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the $2 million to $4 million in revenue yearly that BMX generated at the time. Compared to other older more established sports like baseball, European football (soccer), American football and auto racing, this was a pittance but still enough to generate bad promoters and political infighting between and within sanctioning bodies. Track operators had quite thin profit margins to work with, which perhaps made the back biting even worse since there was so little to go around. There was a slump in the BMX racing market as mentioned {{with the growth of}} Freestyle, the resurgence of skateboarding siphoning off young people and the insurance crises to drain resources further. Pretty desperate times for the organizers of BMX racing, and desperate times generate desperate acts, including actions straight out of Watergate.|$|E

There were so many pre-episode pictures up that I thought the funeral would take up half the show, then it was five minutes and it wasn't sad at all.

500|$|Anderson {{sought to}} capture the nostalgic feel of the 1950s. In this effort, he used several themes {{associated}} with the time period, including alien invasion movies, nuclear threats, Cold War paranoia, and optimism in the future. About the time period, Anderson said [...] "it seemed <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{a time when you}} could say with a straight face, 'I'm fighting for truth, justice and the American way.'" [...] For the characters Anderson was picturing George Reeves's Superman and Noel Neill's Lois Lane as portrayed in the 1950s television series Adventures of Superman. One reviewer noted that Anderson's portrayal of Lex Luthor is that of the post-Crisis on Infinite Earths amoral businessman and Batman was more reminiscent of a 1930s-style or a [...] ""-style Batman where he is actively pursued by the police.|$|E

Madonna {{wanted to use the}} commercial to launch [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] globally before its actual release—the first time something <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> being done in the music industry. Pepsi also benefited from having their product associated with Madonna, thereby creating promotion. According to the company's advertising head Alan Pottasch, [...] "the global media buy and unprecedented debut of this long awaited single will put Pepsi first and foremost in consumer's [...] minds". Madonna had initially refused to dance and sing in the commercial, but later accepted after being introduced to choreographer Vince Paterson.|$|E

500|$|According to Palmer, songwriters {{adapted the}} phrase for other artists {{and it was}} [...] "soon absorbed into the lingua franca of blues, jazz, and rock and roll". [...] In 1955, songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller used the riff for [...] "Riot in Cell Block Number 9" [...] (later {{reworked}} by the Beach Boys as [...] "Student Demonstration Time") and [...] "Framed" [...] for the R group the Robins. [...] "Trouble", another Leiber and Stoller composition that uses the riff, was sung by Elvis Presley in the 1958 musical drama film King Creole. [...] American composer Elmer Bernstein quoted the figure in another film, The Man with the Golden Arm, which received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1955. [...] Dixon remarked, [...] "we felt <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a great achievement {{for one of these}} blues phrases to be used in a movie".|$|E
500|$|Reception of Super Columbine Massacre {{has been}} {{extremely}} negative amongst the mainstream media and those personally affected by the shootings. Upon revealing Columbine's identity as Ledonne, Kovacs said [...] "One of the girls who died [...] {{was a friend of}} mine, Rachel. We were in the same church group. Anyone playing this game can kill Rachel over and over again." [...] The father of one victim remarked to the press that the game [...] "disgusts me. You trivialize the actions of two murderers and the lives of the innocent." [...] One victim of the shooting played the game and voiced reserved support, remarking that [...] "It probably sounds a bit odd for someone like me to say, but I appreciate the fact at least to some degree that something <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> made." [...] While he took issue with what he saw as glamorization of the shooters, he also believed it would help open a dialogue about the shooting.|$|E
500|$|Move <b>Like</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on May 10, 2011, and debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The album received generally positive reviews from critics: in a three-and-a-half star review, Rolling Stone praised the [...] "skillful restraint" [...] {{of the band}} and Lee's production work, describing the album as [...] "taut, sleek, seamless, [...] efficient". The A.V. Club awarded the album a [...] "B" [...] rating, praising the [...] "catchy" [...] "Blue Tip" [...] and [...] "Sad Song", and noting the latter song's similarity to [...] "My Best Friend's Girl" [...] from the band's 1978 debut. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album {{four out of five}} stars, describing the album as [...] "as bright, infectious, and tuneful as the Cars at their prime." [...] Spin, however, granted the album a 5 out of 10 rating, criticizing the [...] "clunkiness" [...] of Ocasek's lyrics. NPR's Elizabeth Nelson called Move Like This a [...] "fine new album" [...] and singled out [...] "Blue Tip" [...] as [...] "an incandescent pop gem" [...] with a [...] "brilliant" [...] musical structure and [...] "an absolutely relentless sing-along chorus".|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} and produced entirely in Hokkaido, including the album's cover artwork and music videos. When writing the songs, Yamaguchi thought up imagery for each song, {{and asked the}} other band members to picture this while creating and performing the songs. Yamaguchi created the album's music and melody while thinking about how they would be received by other people, but wrote the lyrics entirely introspectively. [...] "Mikazuki Sunset" [...] and [...] "Shiranami Top Water" [...] were the first songs produced by the band, and were the band's first attempts at making club-style music. Due to their success on college radio, Yamaguchi felt <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> proof that the mix of dance music with Japanese melodies was a good direction, and continued to make music in this style. Yamaguchi {{was inspired by the}} differences in house and techno music styles when writing the album. Yamaguchi was mindful about how to reach a wide audience, and considered that live instruments were important to stress how the album was rock music, as pure dance music was based on electronic and sampled instruments. One convention the band kept for the album was to record everything at 126BPM, {{to make it easier for}} the band's drummer, who had not experienced performing dance music before.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Murphy {{announced}} that the cast of Glee would be replaced {{at the end of}} the third season to coincide with their graduation.

[...] He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: [...] "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving {{at the end of the}} third season, and Colfer commented on the report, saying, [...] "We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate eventually. I don't think I thought it was going to happen so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> coming." [...] However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation does not mean that they will leave the show. Falchuk insisted that [...] "it was never our plan or our intention to let them go.... They are not done with the show after this season." ...|$|E
