40|$|Source Specific Multicast (SSM) is {{a viable}} {{solution}} for current multicast applications, since the driving applications to date are one to many, including Internet TV, distance <b>learning,</b> <b>file</b> distribution and streaming media, etc. It brings many benefits in billing, address allocation, and security. However, SSM still confronts the serious state scalability problem when there are {{a large number of}} simultaneous on-going multicast groups in the network. In this paper, we propose a protocol to improve the state scalability of Source Specific Multicast, which is called Aggregated Source Specific Multicast (ASSM). We design the detailed ASSM protocol and show that our solution can obtain significant multicast state and tree management overhead reduction while achieving transparency to end-users, compatibility with existing multicast technologies and low overhead...|$|E
40|$|In the IP {{multicast}} model, {{a set of}} ho & can be aggrc-gated into a {{group of}} hosts with one address, to which any host can send. However, Internet TV, distance <b>learning,</b> <b>file</b> distribution and other emerging large-scale multicast applications strain the current realization of this model, which lacks a basis for charging, lacks access control, and is difficult to scale. This paper proposes an extension to IP multicast to support the channel model of multicast and describes a specific realization called EXPlicitly REquested Single-Source (EXPRESS) multicast. In this model, a multi-cast channel has exactly one explicitly designated source, and zero or more channel subscribers. A single protocol supports both channel subscription and efficient collec-tion of channel information such as subscriber count. We argue that EXPRESS addresses the aforementioned problems, justifying this multicast service model in the Internet,...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Source Specific Multicast (SSM) is an {{acceptable}} solution for current multicast applications; since the driving applications to date are one to many, including Internet TV, distance <b>learning,</b> <b>file</b> distribution and streaming media. Approach: It was useful for billing, address allocation and security.

Results: In this study, a scheme had been devised to improve the state scalability of source specific multicast. The scheme consisted of two stages: Conclusion/Recommendations: The first stage was to cluster the receivers based on their IP addresses and the second stage was to reduce the multicast state at routers. In order to prove the correctness of the proposed scheme, it had been applied to multicast trees built by other researchers. The results of the comparison approved our statement...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{forecast}} {{blowing snow}} in mountainous regions one needs precise {{information on the}} velocity {{and direction of the}} wind. In order to reach this objective, we have developed a statistical application (VENTOSE) for the fOIe-casting of wind parameters at ground level by using as long as possible series of data. These data are collected by automatic measurements in a high altitude location (Col du Lac Blanc in the French Alps, alt. 2800 m-) which is exposed to strong winds during the winter season. This experimental site has been well equipped for studies of snowdrift. For this study, various atmospheric parameters from the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecast) data archives have been extracted and statistical relationships between these parameters and wind measurements at the site have been established. A multi-linear method was used to calculate equations in order to estimate the wind velocity and the wind direction for the follONing day. The comparison between observed and forecast wind done with this method was calculated in the same location during a winter period not included in the <b>learning</b> <b>file.</b> In most cases, wind velocity is well estimated (correlation coefficient equal to 0. 77). In the framework of a joint research project with the VI (Icelandic Meteorological Office) that started in 1997, we have tested this method in Icelandic locations. The project has been initiated in order to enhance the exchange of expertise between VI and Meteo-France in research on snowdrift and a-lanche hazard. The testing phase will take place in Iceland where simulated snowdrift will be compared to observations. The method and {{the results of this study}} will be shown and discussed in the presentation...|$|E
40|$|Before {{adopting}} {{new systems}} and procedures, IT managers should ensure {{they are not}} unwittingly following the herd. As unprecedented IT development continues to produce many investment opportunities, imperfectly informed IT managers keep trying to acquire credible external signals to update their knowledge about each new technology. Such learning processes usually help them reach better IT adoption decisions. However, in some cases, independent of their private information, the majority of IT managers quickly {{come to the same}} adoption decision. IT managers who want to think dynamically and strategically must understand the causes of herding and its implications for IT adoption and diffusion. Information economists have suggested that herd behavior may arise because of informational cascades [1 – 3], which occur when rational individuals ignore their private information and instead mimic the actions of previous decision makers. Basic cascade models have been tested in laboratory experiments. Empirical evidence of informational cascades has been documented in the realms of financial investment, emerging technology adoption, animal mating behavior, and television programming. In the world of IT, By Xiaotong Li such behavior results in adoption herding. In the uncertain business world, IT managers must independently make technology adoption decisions with incomplete information. In many cases, such decisions are difficult to reverse because of significant technology switching costs. These costs could easily exceed the price of the technology itself when technology adopters have such sunk costs as <b>learning,</b> <b>file</b> creation, and the development or purchase of extrinsic complementary systems. To avoid being locked into an inferior technology, decision makers may wait to let uncertainties be resolved over time. For example, by taking advantage of the option to wait, they can learn about potentially superior alternative technologies [9]. Also, they can obtain more information about the technology and the IT project as a whole by observing the adoption decisions of those who move earlier. So, with asymmetric information, later IT adopters can benefit from information externality—the spillover of nonpublic information from others ’ adoption decisions. But information cascading and herding behaviors can occur among later adopters a...|$|E

40|$|Systems Engineering is {{fundamental}} to good engineering, which in turn depends on the integration and application of engineering lessons learned and technical standards. Thus, good Systems Engineering also depends on systems engineering lessons learned from within the aerospace industry being documented and applied. About {{ten percent of the}} engineering lessons learned documented in the NASA Lessons Learned Information System are directly related to Systems Engineering. A key issue associated with lessons learned datasets is the communication and incorporation of this information into engineering processes. Systems Engineering has been defined (EINIS- 632) as "an interdisciplinary approach encompassing the entire technical effort to evolve and verify an integrated and life-cycle balanced set of system people, product, and process solutions that satisfy customer needs". Designing reliable space-based systems has always been a goal for NASA, and many painful lessons have been learned along the way.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{requirement of}} censorship resistance is content availability and discoverability — {{it should be}} easy for users to find and access documents. At the same time, participating storage providers should be unaware {{of what they are}} storing to preserve plausible deniability. Fulfilling these requirements simultaneously seems impossible — how does a system maintain a searchable index of content for users and yet hide it from storage providers? These paradoxical requirements have been previously reconciled by requiring out-of-band communication to either find ways to connect to the system, locate <b>files,</b> or <b>learn</b> <b>file</b> decryption keys — an unacceptable situation when easy content discovery is critical. This paper describes a design for a peer-to-peer, permanent, and unblockable content store which is easily searchable and yet self-contained, i. e. does not require out-of-band communication. To achieve this, we separate file data, metadata, and encryption keys such that someone searching for information about a specific topic can retrieve all three components and reconstruct the file, but someone who only stores at most two components can neither determine the nature of the file content nor locate the missing component. We begin by identifying the core requirements for unblockable storage systems to resist state-level Internet censorship, construct a system that fulfills those requirements, and analyze how it avoids the problem of prior attempts at censorship resistance. Finally, we present measurements of a deployed proof-of-concept implementation, demonstrating the feasibility of our design...|$|R
