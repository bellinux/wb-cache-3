5|$|The Mortara case {{is given}} <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> in most Risorgimento histories, {{if it is}} {{mentioned}} at all.|$|E
5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>attention</b> {{was paid}} to the {{character}} during the 18th and 19th centuries. However, Troilus has reappeared in 20th and 21st century retellings of the Trojan War by authors who have chosen elements from both the classical and medieval versions of his story.|$|E
5|$|Passing was {{published}} in April 1929 by Knopf in New York City. Sales of the book were modest: Knopf produced three small print runs each under 2,000 copies. While early reviews were primarily positive, it received <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> beyond New York City.|$|E
60|$|Attim, {{without any}} remark save a wag of his tail, arose promptly, entered the hut, and lay down. You see, he was {{accustomed}} to <b>little</b> <b>attentions</b> of the sort.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Dryland came to tea, and the Vicar's wife {{surrounded}} him with <b>little</b> <b>attentions.</b> She put an extra lump of sugar in his tea, and cut him even a larger piece of seed-cake than usual.|$|R
60|$|And {{everyone}} had agreed that never had Lady Blakeney looked more radiantly beautiful than on this night. She seemed absolutely indefatigable; a perfect hostess, full of charming <b>little</b> <b>attentions</b> towards every one, although more than ordinarily absorbed by her duties towards her many royal guests.|$|R
5|$|Sheppard's efforts {{contributed to}} the {{contemporary}} debate on European colonialism and imperialism in the region, particularly amongst those of the African American community. However, it has been noted that he traditionally received <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> in literature on the subject.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, kibbutz Beit Guvrin, {{was founded}} on the former town's lands. The {{excavated}} areas of the successive Judahite, Hellenistic, Roman-Byzantine and Crusader towns {{have been included in}} a large Israeli national park with major points of attraction for tourists. There is little focus on any traces of Arab presence within the park, the period from the 7th century onward receiving <b>little</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain and the coastal forts, {{included}} Portland, received <b>little</b> <b>attention.</b> A 1623 survey reported that the castle was equipped with three culverins, nine demi-culverins and a saker, but that the fortifications had suffered badly from sea erosion and required extensive repairs. Fourteen years later, the castle had 15 guns and a garrison of a captain and 12 men.|$|E
60|$|On the way home, Peter Ruff was genial--Miss Brown silent. He {{had escaped}} from a {{difficult}} position, and {{his sense of}} gratitude toward his companion was strong. He showed her many <b>little</b> <b>attentions</b> on the voyage which sometimes escaped him. From Dover, they had a carriage to themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pass your hand," [...] I said, [...] "over the wall; you cannot {{help feeling}} the nitre. Indeed {{it is very}} damp. Once more let me implore you to return. No? Then I must {{positively}} leave you. But I must first render you all the <b>little</b> <b>attentions</b> in my power." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ovid lingered {{near his}} cousin: {{neither of them}} had seen what Teresa had done. He rose reluctantly to go. Feeling his <b>little</b> <b>attentions</b> gratefully, Carmina checked him with {{innocent}} familiarity as he left his chair. [...] "I must thank you," [...] she said, simply; [...] "it seems hard indeed that you, who cure others, should suffer from illness yourself." ...|$|R
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} exactly why Thomas {{decided to build}} Dunstanburgh. Although it was located on a strong defensive site, it was {{some distance from the}} local settlements and other strategic sites of value. Thomas held some lands in Northumberland, but they were insignificant in comparison to his other estates in the Midlands and Yorkshire, and until 1313 he had paid them <b>little</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|E
5|$|Smithers' {{devotion to}} Mr. Burns was {{inspired}} from how numerous Fox executives {{and staff members}} acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> should be drawn to it. Smithers' first name (Waylon) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
5|$|The 5th National Congress again {{amended the}} party constitution, adding {{a chapter on}} control {{commissions}} and their aims but devoting <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> to their operations. Partly because of this, the control commissions actively participated in several party rectification campaigns during the late 1920s and early 1930s. At that time the commissions tended to participate in political struggles, most notably the purges of Zhang Guotao and Wang Ming.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Inglethorp {{came down}} last. She still looked agitated, {{and during the}} meal there was a {{somewhat}} constrained silence. Inglethorp was unusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with <b>little</b> <b>attentions,</b> placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing {{the part of the}} devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp retired to her boudoir again.|$|R
6000|$|But Mr Donnithorne did not answer. He {{was looking}} up the hymn for Mrs D, who, being short-sighted, claimed {{exemption}} from the duty of [...] "looking up" [...] anything. Besides, he was a kind, good man at heart--though rather fond of smuggling and given to the bottle, according to Oliver Trembath's account of him--and liked to pay his wife <b>little</b> <b>attentions.</b>|$|R
60|$|On {{the side}} of the Goyle not much was known or cared about Wilfred's <b>little</b> <b>attentions,</b> which were {{generally}} out of sight of Magdalen, and did not amount to much; but Paula saw enough of them to consult Agatha on, and to observe that Flapsy was going on just as she used to at Filsted, and she thought Hubert would not like it.|$|R
5|$|The {{launch of}} the Expedition 1 crew {{occurred}} {{a week before the}} United States presidential election, so it got <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> in the United States. At the time of the mission, the station was expected to be completed in 2006, and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015. Due to several delays, including the fallout from the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, the station was completed in late 2011, thanks to STS-134.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} soundtrack album {{has been}} hailed as an excellent video game music album, while the Chrono Cross Music Selection mini-album has garnered <b>little</b> <b>attention.</b> Songs from the soundtrack have been played at various orchestral concerts, {{such as the}} personal arrangements by Mitsuda for the Play! A Video Game Symphony concert series. Chrono Cross music has also been extensively remixed by fans, and such remixes {{have been included in}} both official and unofficial albums.|$|E
5|$|While {{the console}} {{versions}} of the game are fully three-dimensional, the Game Boy Advance version is rendered in an isometric style that incorporates both 2D sprites and 3D models. This version is a more traditional Tony Hawk's game, with <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> given to story or customization. The mobile phone version is similarly restricted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, there's Mammy," [...] said Marie, [...] "I think it's selfish of her {{to sleep}} so sound nights; she knows I need <b>little</b> <b>attentions</b> almost every hour, when my worst turns are on, and yet she's so hard to wake. I {{absolutely}} am worse, this very morning, for the efforts I had to make to wake her last night." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'No! Oh! {{it was the}} relief!' said Theodora, {{throwing}} off her shawl, as if to free herself from oppression. Percy took it from her, placed her in the arm-chair, and rendered her all the <b>little</b> <b>attentions</b> in his power {{with a sort of}} trembling eagerness, still silent; for she was very much exhausted,--not so much from present agitation as from the previous strain on mind and body.|$|R
5|$|A merging draft, BioCode, was {{published}} in 1997 {{in an attempt to}} standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted. The BioCode draft has received <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed. A revised BioCode that, instead of replacing the existing codes, would provide a unified context for them, was proposed in 2011. However, the International Botanical Congress of 2011 declined to consider the BioCode proposal. The ICVCN remains outside the BioCode, which does not include viral classification.|$|E
5|$|After the {{practice}} of lynching was suppressed in central Texas, it received <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> from local historians. However, Waco developed a reputation for racism—propagated in part by American history textbooks—to the vexation of the city's white residents. In the years following the lynching, African Americans often held Waco in disdain, and some viewed the 1953 Waco tornado outbreak as divine retribution. White leaders of Waco took a non-violent approach in response to demonstrations during the Civil Rights Movement, possibly owing to a desire to avoid stigmatizing the city again.|$|E
5|$|Anticholinergics {{and surgery}} (lesioning of the corticospinal pathway {{or some of}} the basal ganglia structures) were the only {{treatments}} until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> until the mid 20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim Louis Benabid and colleagues at Grenoble, France, emerged as a possible treatment.|$|E
60|$|What {{was to be}} done, then, on mornings {{that were}} dark with sleet? Pancrazio would bring a kettle of hot water at about half-past eight. For had he not {{travelled}} Europe with English gentlemen, {{as a sort of}} model-valet! Had he not loved his English gentlemen? Even now, he was infinitely happier performing these <b>little</b> <b>attentions</b> for Alvina than attending to his wretched domains.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{his early}} successes, Trova's later constructivist {{abstract}} sculptures attracted <b>little</b> critical <b>attention</b> outside of St. Louis.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have learned}} to get along very well by simply making the best of it," [...] {{continued}} Lydia. [...] "And to tell the truth, I {{have learned to}} respect these rugged fellows. They are uncouth; they have no manners, but their hearts are honest and true, and that is of much greater importance in frontiersmen than the <b>little</b> <b>attentions</b> and courtesies upon which women are apt to lay too much stress." ...|$|R
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{year of the}} revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The {{available}} land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, along with Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its epicentre. The Median general Datis, an expert on Greek affairs, was certainly dispatched to Ionia by Darius at this time. It is therefore possible {{that he was in}} overall command of this Persian offensive.|$|E
5|$|Current Electoral College rules {{effectively}} force {{candidates to}} focus disproportionately {{on a small}} percentage of pivotal swing states, while sidelining the rest. A study by FairVote reported that the 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states received very <b>little</b> <b>attention.</b> The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no TV advertising. This means that swing state issues receive more attention, while issues important to other states are largely ignored.|$|E
5|$|Debs appealed his {{conviction}} to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on Debs v. United States, the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I and socialism. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches {{in an attempt}} to comply with the Espionage Act, the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. stated in his opinion that <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> was needed since Debs' case was essentially {{the same as that of}} Schenck v. United States, in which the Court had upheld a similar conviction.|$|E
50|$|The letter {{lead to a}} {{nationwide}} discussion on church and state interaction. Previously, corresponding issues drew <b>little</b> public <b>attention.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{the next}} house they visited, {{they were in}} great glory; for, there, resided the six {{children}} who were so enraptured with the public actions of the phenomenon, and who, being called down from the nursery {{to be treated with}} a private view of that young lady, proceeded to poke their fingers into her eyes, and tread upon her toes, and show her many other <b>little</b> <b>attentions</b> peculiar to their time of life.|$|R
50|$|Johnston's novels have {{attracted}} <b>little</b> critical <b>attention,</b> {{although they are}} well documented in bibliographies by Larson, Peer, and in Contemporary Authors.|$|R
