Os objetivos da pesquisa foram os seguintes: a) desenvolver uma linha de base epidemiológica para o estudo das doenças cardiovasculares ateroscleróticas e os fatores de risco representados pelas dislipidemias, obesidades, hipertensão e diabetes melito e de suas relações com características pessoais, familiares e sociais; b) encaminhar para tratamento clínico-educativo os indivíduos doentes ou portadores de risco. A metodologia empregada é a primeira parte de uma série destinada à divulgação dos resultados da pesquisa. Tendo em vista os objetivos, optou-se por se trabalhar integradamente com os centros de saúde e associações comunitárias locais na fase de coleta de dados em campo. Por isso, a metodologia empregada foi a de trabalhar em pequenas áreas geográficas, homogêneas do ponto de vista socioeconômico, denominadas "áreas de estudo". A caracterização de grupos sociais foi feita através do conceito de classes sociais, operacionalizado por meio de indicadores como renda, escolaridade, ocupação, posição na ocupação, posse de propriedade e respectiva dimensão e emprego de mão-de-obra. Foram estabelecidas as seguintes classes sociais: burguesia, pequena burguesia tradicinal, proletariado e sub-proletariado. Foram realizados inquéritos clínicos, bioquímico, alimentar e entrevistas para se obter informações de caráter demográfico, socioeconômico e de estilo de vida. O inquérito clínico constou de tomada de medidas antropométricas, pressão arterial, eletrocardiograma e informações sobre antecedentes pessoais e familiares de hipertensão, obesidade, cardiopatias e outras morbidades. O inquérito bioquímico constou da medida dos seguintes constituintes sangüíneos: colesterol total, HDL colesterol, LDL colesterol, triglicérides, magnésio, glicose, sódio, potássio, cálcio e fósforo. O inquérito alimentar envolveu informações sobre a história alimentar do indivíduo. A intervenção clínico -educativa foi feita com a participação de associações comunitárias e centros de saúde, que criaram programas locais de atendimento aos doentes e portadores de risco.

The research project had the following objectives: a) {{the development of an}} epidemiological baseline {{for the study of the}} risk factors for the atherosclerotics cardiovascular diseases represented by the <b>lipemics</b> disorders, obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus and their relationship with personal, family and social characteristics; b) the for clinical-educative treatment of pacients or people at risk. In view of the objectives above it was decided that the project should in an integrated way with the local health centers and community associations in the field work phase. For this purpose, the methodology adopted was that of establishing small geographical areas, denominated "study areas", in accordance with socioeconomic criterion. Clinico-biochemical and eating surveys were carried out and interviews held with a view to obtaining data on socioeconomic and demographic and life-style characteristics. The clinical survey collected data on anthropometric measurements, arterial pressure, electrocardiogram and symptoms of heart disease. The biochemical survey consisted of the measurement of the following constituents of the blood: total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerids, magnesium, glucose, sodium, potassium and phosphorous. The eating survey covered data of historic food consumption. By means of indicators such as income, schooling, occupation, position held in the occupation, ownership of property and respective size of property and employment of labour, the social classes were established. The clinico-educative intervention was carried out in the following way: a) the team made contact with the community associations and the health centers, that begin to participate in the project, permitting the use of their physical space for the carrying out of surveys and clinical exams and taking part in the work of publishing and explaining the project; b) those individuals with positive diagnosis or who are found at risk were referred to the health centers which then include assistance for the diseases in question in their permanent activities.

Our aim was to assess the comparability of automated spectrophotometric detection and visual inspection of <b>lipemic,</b> icteric and hemolyzed samples. Methods: This study was performed on 1727 routine biochemistry serum samples. Automated detection was performed using the Olympus AU 2700 analyzer. We assessed: 1) comparability of visual and automated detection of <b>lipemic,</b> icteric and hemolyzed samples, 2) precision of automated detection, and 3) inter-observer variability for visual inspection. Results: Weighted κ coefficients for comparability of visual and automated detection were: 0. 555, 0. 529 and 0. 638, for <b>lipemic,</b> icteric and hemolyzed samples, respectively. The precision for automated detection was high for all interferences, with the exception of samples being only slightly <b>lipemic.</b> The best overall agreement between observers was present in assessing lipemia (mean weighted κ= 0. 698), whereas the lowest degree of agreement was observed in assessing icterus (mean weighted κ= 0. 476).

40|$|Objectives: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{identify}} the causes of severe lipemia in an academic medical center patient population and to determine the relationship between lipemia and hemolysis. Design and methods: Retrospective study was done on the data from the core clinical laboratory at an academic medical center. <b>Lipemic</b> indices were available for all chemistry specimens analyzed over a 16 -month period (n= 552, 029 specimens) and for serum/plasma triglycerides concentrations ordered for clinical purposes over a 16 -year period (n= 393, 085 specimens). Analysis was performed on Roche Diagnostics cobas 8000 analyzers. Extensive chart review was done for all specimens with <b>lipemic</b> index greater than 500 (severely <b>lipemic)</b> and for all specimens with serum/plasma triglycerides greater than 2000 Â mg/dL. We also determined the relationship between lipemia and hemolysis. Results: The most frequent suspected causes of very high <b>lipemic</b> index (> 500) were found to be lipid-containing intravenous infusions (54. 4 % of total; fat emulsions for parenteral nutrition â 47 %; propofol â 7. 4 %) and diabetes mellitus (25 % of total, mainly type 2). The most frequent suspected causes of very elevated serum/plasma triglycerides (> 2000 Â mg/dL) was diabetes mellitus (64 %, mainly type 2) and hyperlipidemia (16. 9 %). The frequency of hemolysis increased with increasing <b>lipemic</b> index.

40|$|In vitro {{lipoprotein}} lipase enhances the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) -mediated transfer of cholesteryl esters from high density lipoproteins (HDL) to very low density lipoproteins {{as a result}} of lipolysis-induced alterations in lipoprotein lipids that lead to increased binding of CETP. To determine if there are similar changes during alimentary lipemia, we measured the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to apo B-containing lipoproteins in incubated fasting and postprandial plasma. In seven normolipidemic subjects there was 2 - 3 -fold stimulation of cholesteryl ester transfer in alimentary <b>lipemic</b> plasma. Cholesteryl ester transfer was stimulated when either the d less than 1. 063 -or d greater than 1. 063 -g/ml fraction of <b>lipemic</b> plasma was recombined with its complementary fraction of fasting plasma. To determine the distribution of CETP, plasma was fractionated by agarose chromatography and CETP activity was measured in column fractions in a standardized assay. In fasting plasma, most of the CETP was in smaller HDL, and a variable fraction was nonlipoprotein bound. During lipemia there was increased binding of CETP to larger phospholipid-enriched HDL and in two subjects an increase in CETP in apo B-containing lipoproteins. The total CETP activity of fractions of <b>lipemic</b> plasma was increased 1. 1 - 1. 7 -fold compared with fasting plasma. <b>Lipemic</b> CETP activity was also increased when measured in lipoprotein-free fractions after dissociation of CETP from the lipoproteins. When purified CETP was incubated with phospholipid-enriched HDL isolated from alimentary <b>lipemic</b> or phospholipid vesicle-treated plasma, there was increased binding of CETP to the phospholipid-enriched HDL compared with fasting HDL, with a parallel stimulation in CETP activity. Thus, the pronounced stimulation of cholesteryl ester transfer during alimentary lipemia is due to (a) an increased mass of triglyceride-rich acceptor lipoproteins, (b) a redistribution of CETP, especially increased binding to larger phospholipid-enriched HDL, and (c) an increase in total activity of CETP, perhaps due to an increased CETP mass...|$|E

For comparison, the plasma lipoproteins of 8 healthy dogs of other breeds (HDOB) and 3 diabetic dogs of other breeds (DDOB) were similarly evaluated. Lipemia ranged from slight to marked in the HLMSs, and was marked in the DLMSs. The HDOBs and DDOBs all had clear plasma. Four of the HNMSs had historical evidence of fasting lipemia, yet had clear plasma when sampled for the present study. ^ The <b>lipemic</b> miniature schnauzers (HLMSs and DLMSs) all had hypertriglyceridemia associated with excess VLDL, and the most markedly <b>lipemic</b> dogs had chylomicronemia as well. Hypercholesterolemia and hyperphospholipidemia were present in dogs with marked lipemia; all or most of these excess lipids were associated with the VLDL and chylomicrons. Four of the HLMSs lacked detectable amounts of LDL. Four of the HNMSs had mild hypertriglyceridemias associated with increased amounts of VLDL, and all 4 of these dogs lacked LDL. Two of the hypertriglyceridemic HNMSs were dogs with historical evidence of fasting lipemia. The plasma lipoproteins of the DDOBs were essentially indistinguishable from those of the HDOBs, whereas the lipoproteins of the DLMSs were very {{similar to those of the}} most markedly <b>lipemic</b> HLMSs. ^ The results indicate that the hyperlipidemia of miniature schnauzers is due to a familial disorder resulting in delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the circulation. It appears likely that, while some affected dogs have only a type IV hyperlipoproteinemia due to the effects of the familial disorder alone, others have converted to type V hyperlipoproteinemia because of complicating conditions, such as a high fat diet or development of acquired diseases that also cause hypertriglyceridemia. The familial disorder of the miniature schnauzers bears similarities to familial hypertriglyceridemia in humans. Affected dogs may be at risk of developing pancreatitis and/or diabetes mellitus. ...|$|E

40|$|The lipemia-clearing {{response}} to intravenous heparin {{in the normal}} dog has been compared with that in dogs injected intravenously with Thorotrast. In normal dogs, intravenous heparin caused clearance of the lipemia (optical density) of approximately 77 per cent of the total amount possible. Dogs receiving low total amounts of Thorotrast (50 to 100 ml.) responded to heparin with a re-duced ability to clear an alimentary lipemia, while dogs receiving large total amounts of Thorotrast (150 ml. or more) responded to heparin by becoming even more <b>lipemic.</b> The lipemia inducing effect of protamine was similar in both normal and Thorotrast-injected animals. INTRAVENOUS injection of heparin andcertain other anticoagulants will clear an. alimentary lipemia in vivo. 1 " 6 Recent work suggests that a tissue substance, found pri-marily in abdominal and thoracic viscera, catalyzes the conversion of heparin and a plasma component to "clearing factor, " and that "clearing factor, " {{in the presence of}} a coprotein, causes a reorientation in the dis-tribution of the plasma lipoproteins in such a way that the optical density of the plasma is decreased. 6 ' 7 Once produced in vivo this factor is active in vitro, and clearing of <b>lipemic</b> optical density can be obtained by incubating plasma from heparinized animals with <b>lipemic</b> plasma, 6 ' 8 fat emulsions 9 or milk. 10 The total plasma lipid level is not altered during the reaction, but there is a change in the physico-chemical state of the blood lipids as determined with the ultracentrifuge. 7 The lipemia-clearing effect of heparin can be reversed in vivo and the lipemia restored with intravenous injection of protamine. 5 ' u The report of Anfinsen, Boyle and Brown, 6 that only the abdominal and thoracic regions produce high levels of "clearing factor, " sug-gested the possibility that the reticulo-endo-thelial system might be a source of some part or parts of the "clearing factor " system. In the work to be presented, this possibility ha...|$|E

40|$|The study, part of {{the project}} "Atherosclerotic {{cardiovascular}} diseases, <b>lipemic</b> disorders, hypertension, obesity and diabetis mellitus in a population of the metropolitan area of the southeastern region of Brazil", had the following objectives: a) the characterization and distribution among typical human socio-economic groupings, of the prevalence of some particular habits which constitute aspects of life-style-the use of tobacco, the use of alcohol and sedentary activity; b) the establishment of the interrelation between the above-mentioned habits and some <b>lipemic</b> disorders. The prevalence of the habits cited behaved in the following manner: the use of tobacco predominated among men, distributed uniformly throughout the social strata; among the women the average percentage of smokers was 18, 9 %, a significant difference occurring among the highest socio-economic class, where the average was of 40. 2 %. The sedentary style of life presented high prevalence, among both men and women with exception of the women of the highest socio-economic level and of the skilled working class. The use of alcohol, as one would expect, is a habit basically practised by the men, without any statistically significant differences between classes. For the purpose of establishing associations between these risk fictors and <b>lipemic</b> conditions four situations were chosen, of the following characteristics: 1 - total cholesterol > or = 220 mg/dl and triglycerides > or = 150 mg/dl; 2 - HDL cholesterol or = 150 mg/dl; 3 - HDL cholesterol or = 150 mg/dl, and the following independent variables: age, use of tobacco and the interactions between obesity and smoking, age and sedentary lifestyle, sex and obesity (R 2 = 22 %); the standardized B coefficient showed that the variables with the greatest weight in the forecasting of the variation in the levels of cholesterol were smoking and the interaction between obesity and smoking. The hypercholesterolemia accompanied by triglycerides levels or = 150 mg/dl was inversely associated with obesity and the interaction smoking/ age and directly with age (R= 31 %). The standardized B coeffients, indicated that the variables obesity and the interactions smoking/age possessed a weight three times greater than age alone in accounting for the variation in the serum levels of HDL cholesterol. When accompanied by triglycerides < 150 mg/dl there was no association between and the independent variables and the set of them presented R equal to 22 %. The sum of top, in the population stutied in this project, the component habits of life-style (smoking, alcohol consumption and sedentary activity) which constitute risk factors which determine morbidity from atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases are be found distributed through all the typical social groupings of this particular form of social organization. On the other hand, the seven independent variables used in the multiple regression models for the explanation of the <b>lipemic</b> conditions considered presented multiple determination coefficients which varied, approximately, between 20 % and 30 %. Thus it is important that in the genetic epidemiology the study of the morbidities in question be emphasized...|$|E
40|$|No estudo de população constituída de 3. 792 indivíduos, procurou-se caracterizar o estado dos níveis lipêmicos, segundo sexo, idade e a presença ou ausência de fatores de risco de doenças cardiovasculares, expressos pelo hábito de fumar, obesidade, antecedentes diabéticos e uso de contraceptivos orais. Os indivíduos que não apresentaram nenhuma patologia e qualquer dos fatores de risco considerados foram denominados "isentos". Os dados foram submetidos à análise de variância constatando-se que a obesidade apresentou-se como o fator de risco mais relevante, para todos os grupos etários de ambos os sexos. Entretanto, para as mulheres encontraram-se diferenças menores, embora significantes, ao se comparar as médias dos níveis séricos lipêmicos, entre "isentas" e portadoras de fatores de risco. Para o grupo etário acima de 50 anos, sexo feminino, os níveis lipêmicos foram altos independentemente dos fatores de risco abordados. An {{attempt was}} made to caracterize <b>lipemic</b> levels {{according}} to sex, age and presence or absence of cardiovascular disease risk factors, in a population of 3, 792 people between the ages of 20 and 59, in terms of smoking habits, obesity, family history of diabetes and use of oral contraceptives. Those individuals who did not present any of the risk factors mentioned were classified as "exempt". After submitting the data to variance analysis it was found that: - for men between 20 and 49 years of age there were high significant differences in the averages obtained for the seric levels of total lipids, triglycerides and total cholesterol between "exempt" and obese and "exempt" and obese with a family history of diabetes; - for the 50 to 59 age group there were significant differences in the average of the values corresponding to the seric levels of total lipids between "exempt" and those individuals in whom obesity appeared associated with smoking habits or associated with a family history of diabetes. The averages obtained for seric triglycerides were significantly different between "exempt" and non-obese with a family history of diabetes, obese, obese smokers and obese with a family history of diabetes. On the other hand, the averages relating to seric levels of total cholesterol were different, at significant levels, between "exempt" and obese smokers; - the risk represented by the smoking habit showed no relevance with regard to the <b>lipemic</b> levels in any group except for that of men between 30 and 39 years of age. In their case, there were significant differences between the averages obtained for the seric levels of total lipids, triglycerides and total cholesterol, between "exempt" and smokers and between "exempt" and obese smokers. It is to be noted that the differences obtained with regard to the averages relating to <b>lipemic</b> levels as between "exempt" and obese were less those obtained between "exempt" and obese smokers, thus showing the possible relevance of the risk presented by the smoking habit; - among the women there were less accentuated differences in the averages corresponding to the <b>lipemic</b> levels as between "exempt" and those who presented one or more risk factors. Thus, for the age group from 20 to 29 there were significant differences in the averages obtained for total lipids as between "exempt" and obese. The averages of the serie levels of total cholesterol were significantly different as between "exempt" and obese and between "exempt" and obese with a family history of diabetes, irrespective of their smoking; - for the age group from 30 to 39, there were significant differences in the averages obtained for the serie levels of triglycerides as between "exempt" and obese. The averages relating to serie levels of total cholesterol were significantly different as between "exempt" and obese and between "exempt" and those who used oral contraceptives; - for the age group between 50 and 59, the <b>lipemic</b> levels were high, especially those of total cholesterol, for all groups, irrespective of risk factors; - for all age groups, of both sexes, obesity was the most important risk factor...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{limitations}} for ranking foods and meals for healthiness {{on the basis of}} the glycaemic index (GI) is that the GI is subject to manipulation by addition of fat. Postprandial lipemia, defined as a rise in circulating triglyceride containing lipoproteins following consumption of a meal, has been recognised as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases. Many non-modifiable factors (pathological conditions, genetic background, age, sex and menopausal status) and life-style factors (physical activity, smoking, alcohol and medication use, dietary choices) may modulate postprandial lipemia. The structure and the composition of a food or a meal consumed also plays an important role in the rate of postprandial appearance and clearance of triglycerides in the blood. However, a major difficulty in grading foods, meals and diets according to their potential to elevate postprandial triglyceride levels has been the lack of a standardised marker that takes into consideration both the general characteristics of the food and the food’s fat composition and quantity. The release rate of lipids from the food matrix during digestion also has an important role in determining the postprandial <b>lipemic</b> effects of a food product. This article reviews the factors that have been shown to influence postprandial lipemia with a view to develop a novel index for ranking foods according to their healthiness. This index should take into consideration not only the glycaemic but also <b>lipemic</b> responses...|$|E
