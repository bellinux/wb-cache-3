40|$|Small {{environmental}} disturbances accumulating over a {{long period}} of time may cause a regime shift in marine ecosystems, particularly in sensitive oligotrophic waters. Pearl oyster aquaculture, which has a 50 yr history in Australia, has been regarded as an anthropogenic activity with low environmental risk. To assess the long-term environmental effects of pearl oyster farming, sediment cores taken in Cygnet Bay, Western Australia, were used to reconstruct environmental processes covering an approximately 90 yr period. Biogeochemical parameters in sediment cores from inside and outside a pearl farming area displayed contrasting characteristics over time. Total organic carbon, total nitrogen, biogenic silica (BSi), and fine-grained sediment at the farming site displayed significant increases with the expansion of oyster stocking. In contrast, only small variations in response to climatic signals (rainfall and temperature) occurred over time in the cores outside the farm. The variation in the C:N ratio, delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 ranges over time suggested that increased organic matter was mainly contributed by autochthonous sources rather than terrestrial input. The sequential t-test for a regime shift detected approximately 2 -to 3 -fold increases in organic matter, 1 -to 5 -fold increases in silt proportion and 2 -to 5 -fold increases in BSi concentrations after pearl oyster farming, in contrast to the control site. The rapid development of modern <b>long-line</b> <b>culture</b> since the late 1980 s is presumed to have been the dominant driver of environmental changes in sediments. The results provide insight into the magnitude of environmental change which can occur over decades as a result of even minimal anthropogenic activity...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{seasonal variation}} in the reproductive output and proximate composition of tissues (protein, lipid, and carbohydrate) of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas Thunberg, at the top (0 – 2 m) and bottom (3 – 5 m) of a <b>long-line</b> suspended <b>culture</b> in Gosung Bay, Korea. The water temperature was 2 – 3 °C higher at the surface than at the bottom from early spring to mid-summer. The chlorophyll a level was also higher at the surface during March and April, when a spring phytoplankton bloom occurred in the bay. The seasonal {{variation in the}} proximate composition of oyster tissues differed between the surface and the bottom as well. Carbohydrate levels in oysters at the surface were somewhat higher in fall and winter, when the oysters were actively accumulating carbohydrates in their tissues for future growth and reproduction. Oysters at the surface tended to produce more eggs during the spring to early summer spawning period; the gonadosomatic index (GSI) was significantly higher in surface oysters than in bottom oysters (p  <  0. 05). The overall growth and reproduction rates of the surface oysters were higher, even though the bottom oysters were located only 1 – 3 m below them. Accordingly, our data suggest that culture depth in the traditional <b>long-line</b> suspended <b>culture</b> needs to be re-evaluated to maximize oyster production...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} ecological {{effects of}} commercial oyster mariculture activities on eelgrass beds (Zostera marina) and estuarine tideflat communities {{are the focus}} of regional concern for several natural resource agencies throughout Washington, Oregon, and northern California. In particular, empirical studies are currently underway at several locations throughout the Pacific Northwest to evaluate alternative shellfish farming practices and develop policies designed to minimize degradation to eelgrass beds and still allow for oyster cultivation on a commercial scale that is profitable to the mariculture industry. Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) have been grown in the intertidal zone of Humboldt Bay, CA for over 60 years, and recent management steps have been taken to discontinue the practices of bottom-culture and harvesting with a mechanical dredge in an effort to reduce damage to eelgrass beds. To further understand the potential ecological effects of off-bottom (<b>long-line)</b> oyster <b>culture</b> on eelgrass communities, we worked in cooperation with the Humboldt Bay- Mariculture Monitoring Committee to establish a series of experimental oyster long-line plots and eelgrass reference areas (controls). The experimental design included evaluation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for th...|$|R
40|$|Carposporophytes of the seaweed, Kappaphycus striatum, {{from the}} wild were made to shed spores in the {{laboratory}} and grown in multi-step culture method until they reached maturity. For each succeeding transfer onto increasingly bigger culture vessels, there was a marked increase {{in the growth of}} carposporelings. When plantlets were ready for outdoor culture, they were placed in aquaria and concrete tanks and later moved to the sea in net cage and <b>long-line</b> for grow-out <b>culture.</b> Successfully growing sporelings from carposporophytes in the laboratory until they reach market size seems to depend on the stage of sporelings and environmental factors such as photoperiod and temperature. In this study, carpospore progenies (diploids) also matured into tetrasporophytes and haploid progenies showed resistance to higher temperature...|$|R
40|$|The turbellarian Urastoma cyprinae (Urastomidae) {{was found}} parasitizing Mytilus galloprovincialis in natural beds and <b>culture</b> <b>long-lines</b> at Ensenada, Baja California, north-west Mexico. The {{parasite}} caused some {{damage to the}} gills of the host. Prevalence was monitored between January 1995 and January 1996 and ranged from 0 to 100 % according to sampling locality. Mussels from polluted water at the Ensenada pier showed a low prevalence rate (0 - 13 %) and intensity of infection (0 - 5 parasites/host). Cultured mussels showed the highest prevalence (50 - 100 %) and intensity of infection (0 - 84), while mussels from the upper intertidal zone of an exposed rocky shore showed intermediate prevalence (10 - 87 %) and intensity of infection (0 - 20). This is the first report of U. cyprinae in mussels from the Pacific coast of North America...|$|R
40|$|The {{length of}} the rugged Norwegian coastal line {{including}} all islands exceeds the circumference of the earth, and the coastal zone contains many sheltered areas that are potentially suitable for bivalve farming. However, a large fraction of the coastal environment exhibits close to oligotrophic conditions and has significantly lower seston (e. g. food) concentration compared to most bivalve aquaculture sites currently operating worldwide. Aquaculture in low seston environments is a concern, {{partly because of the}} food requirement for bivalves to grow (e. g. particulate organic carbon (POC) ~ 200 μg L-¹ or chlorophyll a (Chl a) ~ 1 mg L-¹), but also because bivalves were reported to stop feeding at low seston concentrations (Chl a between 0. 5 to 0. 9 μg L-¹). Low seston environments have an increased risk of food depletion that can reduce bivalve production due to food limitation, especially when bivalves are kept at high stocking density as in culture. In order to manage bivalve farming in low seston environments {{there is a need for}} bivalve production and carrying capacity models. The objective of the thesis was to study the functional feeding responses of two commercially important bivalve species (Pecten maximus and Mytilus edulis) to the dietary conditions in a natural low seston environment. Further objectives were to determine the net zero growth and net zero energy balance of the bivalves to help facilitate growth predictions. On a cultivation unit scale, the aim was to describe physical and biological components of seston depletion processes in <b>long-line</b> suspension <b>culture,</b> to optimize cultivation unit design, carrying capacity assessment and site selection. Studies were carried out to facilitate an improved understanding of the seasonal feeding behavior, physiology and growth of the great scallop (P. maximus) and the blue mussel (M. edulis) under natural low (e. g. suspended particulate matter (SPM) < 1 mg L-¹ or Chl a < 1. 5 mg L-¹) and diluted seston concentrations and to provide data for aquaculture and ecosystem models. The results were novel in that they showed that these species do not stop feeding, but rather maintain intermediate to high feeding rates at all low seston concentrations employed. The feeding response to seston quantity was unimodal as previously reported for scallops and mussels, but the response curve was skewed toward lower seston concentrations. Positive tissue growth was detected at seston concentrations of 80 μg POC L-¹ and 0. 4 μg Chl a L-¹, which is less than half the values previously reported. The ability of the bivalves to grow under the low seston quantities was primarily caused by continuous feeding at typically high rates and the high net absorption efficiency (range 40 – 80 %). Net energy balance predictions for both species overestimated actual growth owing to a wide range of factors including; the inability of bulk seston characteristics to adequately characterize the seasonably variable energy content of the seston and spawning. To increase the accuracy of growth estimates, the biopolymeric constitute of seston should be considered as an alternative to utilizing constant POC/energy conversion factors for ingested food. The spatial distribution of mussel condition index in a long-line (200 x 15 meter) mussel cultivation unit was studied in relation to physical flow reduction and seston depletion by mussel grazing. The food availability, expressed as the product of current speed and Chl a concentration, decreased to less than 20 % of ambient within the first 30 meters of the unit. The strong reduction in food availability was the apparent cause of the lengthwise reduction in condition index detected from the edges toward the centre of the unit. The physical and biological data obtained from the long-line mussel unit was used to develop a model of current speed reduction and production capacity according to cultivation unit layout. The model output highlighted the need to optimize the farm length to width ratio to reduce seston depletion and improve flow characteristics. The model has increased the awareness of measuring current speed and seston concentration to identify suitable farming sites in Norway and has motivated farmers to rearrange the farm layout...|$|R
