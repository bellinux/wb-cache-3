5|$|Operation Veritable was {{designed}} to bring the 21st Army Group {{to the west bank}} of the Rhine River, the last natural obstacle before entering Germany. Initially scheduled for December 1944, the operation was delayed until February by the German Ardennes Offensive. Plans were developed to breach three successive defensive lines: the outpost screen; a formidable section of the Siegfried Line running through the Hochwald Forest; and finally the Hochwald <b>Layback</b> covering the approach to the ultimate objective of Xanten. The first phase began on 8February 1945, with the 2nd Division's advance following up one of the largest artillery barrages seen on the Western Front. The Germans had prepared significant defences in depth, both within the outpost screen and the Siegfried Line itself, and to add to the Canadians' difficulties, constant rain and cold weather obscured the battlefield. However, by the end of the first day, the 2nd Division had captured their objectives—the fortified towns of Wyler and Den Heuvel. On 11February, the division moved southeast to assist British XXX Corps in their assault on Moyland Wood.|$|E

25|$|His skating {{techniques}} {{include the}} Biellmann spin and the doughnut spin. Both {{are known for}} their difficulty, for male skaters especially, due to the flexibility required. Other signature moves include the <b>layback</b> Ina Bauer, hydroblading and side lunge. His jumps are praised for their precision, flow and extraordinary ice coverage. Hanyu is known for his difficult triple Axel entries, usually from a back counter or spread eagle. He stated his preference for edge jumps, and notably featured all three edge jumps in his short program for the 2016-17 season.|$|E
25|$|Crack {{climbing}} {{is a type}} of {{rock climbing}} that ascends cracks and uses specialized climbing techniques. Cracks used in climbing vary in size from the width of a finger to those that fit an entire body. Climbers use techniques such as jamming, <b>laybacking,</b> and stemming. Some climbers use gloves made out of athletic tape to protect their hands.|$|R
50|$|Harding's most {{important}} contribution to climbing technique was to perfect and popularise the hand jam; a method of climbing cracks using the fleshy part of the thumb {{in conjunction with the}} back of the hand to grip the inner part of the crack. He is sometimes credited with inventing the technique, though {{it is more likely that}} he rediscovered a method which had been used occasionally since the late 19th century. However, he did much to promote the use of hand jams at a time when most climbers preferred to climb fist-width cracks by tiring <b>laybacking,</b> or by forcing their hands against opposite sides of the crack, as if opening sliding doors. Using the hand jam, Harding claimed, it was possible to hang comfortably from one hand, while smoking a cigarette with the other - and he would regularly demonstrate this.|$|R
40|$|E‐governance is {{a momentous}} {{currency}} in contemporary society, and it manifests {{in virtually all}} areas of life, which include, among others, banking, insurance, trade and commerce, and democracy. The deployment of Information Communication Technology (ICT) and Information Technology (IT) devices for democratic governance {{has been successful in}} technologically advanced countries, and has inspired countries from the developing South, such as Nigeria to contemplate or commence e‐elections for democratic sustainability. The elections regulatory body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had contemplated exploring e‐elections in the country but later dropped the idea on grounds of unpreparedness. Electoral process or election however, has its several components: voter registration, registration review/update, electioneering campaigns, actual voting, and release of election results. These naturally come with their challenges and have informed a school of thought that based on Nigeria’s economic instability, corruption, resources mismanagement, and technologically backward climate, including unstable power supply, e‐elections would be far‐fetched. The other school of thought however, exhibits hope and optimism. This paper, with data scooped through questionnaire administration and from literature, examines the challenges and prospects as well as the peculiarity of Nigerian electoralsystem and the e‐election system, which will be marooned in the general Nigerian politicandl economic climate. Findings show that the prospects are and will always be good for the country, but that the stakes are far too high at a moment of huge infrastructural <b>laybacks</b> of the country. Moreover, not too many people have confidence in the electoral regime, let alone going ahead with such a venture as e‐elections. It therefore recommends, among other things, that the nation should develop the sub‐sectors of the economy that can sustain e‐elections before INEC goes ahead with the capital‐intensive enterprise for democratic sustainability in Nigeria...|$|R
25|$|In March 2010, Kim competed at the 2010 World Championships in Turin, Italy. Kim {{said she}} had {{struggled}} with finding the motivation to compete at the World Championships after winning the {{gold medal at the}} Olympic Games. Kim placed seventh in the short program with 60.30 points. She opened with a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, but had problems with her <b>layback</b> spin and spiral sequence after unseen problems with her boots. She rebounded in the free skate to win the program with 130.49 points completing a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, a triple flip, a double axel–double toe loop–double loop combination, a double axel–triple toe loop combination and a triple lutz, but having trouble with her triple salchow and double axel. She won the silver medal totaling 190.79 points.|$|E
2500|$|She is {{well known}} for her {{signature}} triple-triple jump combinations including triple lutz–triple toe loop, and triple flip–triple toe loop,. [...] She can also execute a triple lutz–double toe loop–double loop jump combination. Another signature jump in her repertoire is a <b>layback</b> Ina Bauer or spread eagle that leads to either a double axel, a double axel–triple toe loop jump combination or a double axel–double toe loop–double loop jump combination - a difficult transition given the required shift in weight and edges. Kim personally stated that her favorite jumps are the lutz, flip and axel. [...] Commentators and analysts consistently refer to her jumps as textbook standard. [...] Her jump techniques are well praised for their high speed entry, height, position and quality of running edges. She has received +2.20 grade of execution for the quality of her jumps.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, she was {{the subject}} of a Lenox figurine called [...] "Katia's Celebration of Life", which depicts her {{performing}} a <b>layback</b> spin in the tribute she skated for Grinkov. She also appeared in the 2003 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue as a featured athlete. In 2003, she appeared on the ice for the first time with Daria. The pair performed a duet during a Mother's Day show and have taken the ice together several times since then, including two different versions of Amy Grant's [...] "Children of the World" [...] at Kristi Yamaguchi's [...] "Family & Friends" [...] shows in 2005 and 2006. During that show in 2007, the mother-daughter duo became a trio when they were joined by Gordeeva's younger daughter, Liza, and all three skated together to [...] "Homesick" [...] performed live by The Cheetah Girls. Daria gave up figure skating in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Sliding is {{the most}} {{effective}} braking technique for downhill skateboarders. It allows a skater to reduce his or her speed much quicker than footbraking, but requires a wider area depending on his ability to control the slide. It has also evolved into its own discipline of skateboarding, with riders performing various tricks and rotations while sliding. A few names of these slides include the coleman slide, bert slide, and pendelum. Sliding can be performed on any wheel. Harder wheels (83-86a) will slide less smoothly and break traction easier while softer wheels (70-80a) will be harder to break traction but will lead to a smoother more controllable slide. Softer wheels, especially (70-75a), tend to wear out faster. Slides can be done standing upright or with one or two hands placed on the road to allow the rider to execute technical slides in any number of positions. When performing hands-down slides, protective slide gloves must be worn. These gloves can be purchased or made at home. They are usually leather gloves with sliding pucks made of hard, low-friction plastics such as UHMWPE, Corian, or Delrin attached by velcro or glue. Sliding gloves can also be bought online or at local skate shops. Gloves are commonly made by companies such as Sector 9, Vault, Landyachtz, Arbor and Loaded. Slides can also be performed on banks and transitions in a skate park. When a skater slides to a complete stop, it is called a shutdown slide. A drift that reduces the rider's speed without bringing him to a complete stop is called a speed check. Riders will also do a partial slide called a pre-drift before a corner to trim speed and then hook back up and grip the corner. When the board rotates more than 90 degrees and then returns to its original position {{over the course of the}} slide it is called a pendulum. There are myriad more technical and challenging slides that can be done such as <b>laybacks,</b> pressure spins, 5-0 slides, and stand-up rotations. One of the most popular slide and most basic hands-down slide is called the Coleman. Made popular by Cliff Coleman, the Coleman slide {{is the most}} popular slide used to come to a complete stop, as you do a complete 180 degree turn with one hand on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Upright spin {{variations}} include <b>layback,</b> Biellmann, haircutter, layover <b>layback,</b> and pearl.|$|E
50|$|A <b>layback</b> spin {{can also}} be {{performed}} with the torso leaning more towards the side, in which case it {{is known as a}} side <b>layback</b> or sideways-leaning spin. Both backwards and sideways-leaning positions in a <b>layback</b> spin are considered a feature that adds difficulty under the ISU Judging System.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>layback</b> spin is {{an upright}} spin {{in which the}} back is arched and head dropped back. A {{variation}} of this spin is the catch foot <b>layback</b> or haircutter, in which the skater grabs the free blade and pulls it toward their head while in the <b>layback</b> position.|$|E
50|$|An {{attitude}} spin looks {{a little}} bit like a very shallow <b>layback,</b> the skater turns her head and looks to the side, instead of arching and looking up, while the free leg is held in attitude position as for a <b>layback</b> spin. The leg position is the feature of this variation. It is often taught as an introductory position while learning a <b>layback.</b>|$|E
50|$|Paul Roach is {{credited}} with inventing the <b>layback</b> manoeuvre in the dropknee style; this manoeuvre was later introduced to stand-up surfing.The <b>layback</b> involves the upper body of the surfer being arched backwards.|$|E
50|$|A <b>layback</b> spin is {{an upright}} spin, usually {{performed}} by women, {{in which the}} back is arched and head dropped back, the free leg in an attitude position, and the arms often stretched to the ceiling. A common variation of this spin is the catch foot <b>layback</b> or haircutter, in which the skater grabs the free blade and pulls it toward her head while in the <b>layback</b> position.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{variations}} of the <b>layback</b> spin include ones where the free leg is gradually lowered so that it finally almost touches the ice. If it is performed {{in a manner that}} causes the spin to accelerate, it is considered a feature that adds difficulty. Various hand and arm positions are included to create individuality and artistry in the spin, including one and two-handed leg grabs, known to the judging panel as [...] "haircutter" [...] spins. The <b>layback</b> can also be performed to the side, which, if held long enough, can be considered a difficulty variation and adds to the level. Adding a Biellmann position to a <b>layback</b> spin is also considered a feature that adds difficulty. It is possible to perform a back <b>layback</b> spin and a change <b>layback</b> spin, however due to the difficulty both are rare.|$|E

50|$|She is {{credited}} {{as being the}} inventor of the camel spin along with its catchfoot variation and the <b>layback</b> spin. Although not named after her, {{she was one of the}} first skaters who transitioned from a <b>layback</b> spin to a one hand Biellmann spin in her free programs.|$|E
50|$|The flying <b>layback</b> spin {{is rarely}} {{performed}} {{because of the}} physical danger posed by landing with a hyperextended spine {{and the fact that}} few coaches know how the move is performed.

50|$|In {{competitive}} figure skating, the <b>layback</b> or sideways-leaning spin is {{a required}} element for ladies {{in the short}} program. Few male skaters perform this spin {{because it is not}} a required element at any level of men's competition. In addition, most males lack the back flexibility required by the position (a problem that is known to plague some female skaters as well). Male skaters to perform the <b>layback</b> in competition include Rohene Ward.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{variation}} is the flying <b>layback,</b> that is, a <b>layback</b> spin that is entered through a jump. [...] Differing techniques {{exist for the}} air position, but all require the skater to leap {{up into the air}} with an arch in the back and the free leg held to the side and the skating leg tucked like a flying sit. Since it is a same-foot flying spin, it requires fewer difficult features to attain a high level.|$|E
