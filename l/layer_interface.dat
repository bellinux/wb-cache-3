40|$|In {{modelling}} applications, recursive Kirchhoff-Helmholtz extrapolation {{through a}} layered medium requires plane-wave decomposition and synthesis at the <b>layer</b> <b>interfaces</b> {{in order to}} take transmission effects into account. For inverse applications (downward extrapolation of the measured data into the subsurface), this plane-wave decomposition and synthesis is superfluous: transmission effects are automatically taken into account, since the extrapolated two-way (downgoing and upgoing) wavefield is continuous at <b>layer</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Two-way wavefield extrapolation, however, is very sensitive to errors in the model of the layered medium. Therefore, in practice one-way extrapolation schemes are preferred. It appears that for backward extrapolation of the primary upgoing wavefield, the recursive Kirchhoff-Helmholtz approach again accounts automatically for transmission effects at the <b>layer</b> <b>interfaces.</b> This approach is particularly attractive for situations where the contrasts at the <b>layer</b> <b>interfaces</b> are high...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of bending and compressive/tensile loading cases of multilayered composites is given. Bending {{perpendicular to the}} <b>layer</b> <b>interfaces</b> is suggested as a sensitive and experimentally convenient method for determining the elastic modulus of compliant isotropic layers within a multilayered composite. Different approaches to analyze the strain and compliance behavior of the composite and individual layers are derived. Ranking of the relevant equations with respect to strain sensitivity is made, which favors the bending test perpendicular to the <b>layer</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The derived relationships permit a prediction of the bending behavior and the flexural rigidity of the composite. Furthermore, the properties of a layer within the structure can be determined. Limitations that exist for the bending perpendicular to the <b>layer</b> <b>interfaces</b> {{in the case of}} low stiffness of the layers can be overcome using either a compressive or a tensile loading mode. Application of the formulas to buckling and interfacial delamination is considered. Materials, such as plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings, that are supposed to behave elastically different in tension and compression are given special consideration. Although determination of elastic moduli is the main interest, in the case of known elastic moduli, the formulas can be used to determine the thickness of individual layers within a composite structure...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that point scatterers appear as hyperbolas in ground-penetrating radar (GPR) B-scans {{and that the}} <b>layer</b> <b>interfaces</b> appear as horizontal lines. In this paper the shape and location of the hyperbolas, together with {{the location of the}} <b>layer</b> <b>interfaces,</b> are used to estimate the soil dielectric permittivity for a layered soil. For this, a procedure composed of following steps is used: (1) reflection detection, (2) hyperbola detection, (3) refinement of hyperbola parameters and estimation of the corresponding scatterer location and soil effective dielectric permittivity, and (4) computation of scatterer depth and layer permittivity taking into account the properties of the upper layers. The reflection detection step takes the GPR B-scan as input and produces a ‘reflection binary image’ as output. The binary image highlights reflections of interest, which includes the hyperbolas and the soil <b>layer</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The effective soil dielectric permittivity is estimated by fitting a theoretically computed hyperbola to the ‘reflection binary image’ for each reflection detected. Then, hyperbola parameters are refined by optimizing a cost function which is computed on the original Bscan for each detected hyperbola. Finally, the soil layer dielectric permittivity and scatterer depth are derived from the hyperbola parameters, taking into account the properties of the upper layers. The procedure is applied to simulated data, showing good accuracy in soil dielectric permittivity estimation and high computational efficiency...|$|R

50|$|IPv6 routers do {{not support}} {{fragmentation}} or the Don't Fragment option. For IPv6, Path MTU Discovery works by initially assuming the path MTU {{is the same as}} the MTU on the link <b>layer</b> <b>interface</b> where the traffic originates. Then, similar to IPv4, any device along the path whose MTU is smaller than the packet will drop the packet and send back an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (Type 2) message containing its MTU, allowing the source host to reduce its Path MTU appropriately. The process is repeated until the MTU is small enough to traverse the entire path without fragmentation.|$|E
