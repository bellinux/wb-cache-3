5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characterisations of heavy metals {{need to be}} treated with caution, as the metals involved are not always consistently defined. As well as being relatively dense, heavy metals tend to be less reactive than <b>lighter</b> metals and have much less soluble sulfides and hydroxides. While it is relatively easy to distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a <b>lighter</b> metal such as sodium, a few heavy metals, such as zinc, mercury, and lead, have some of the characteristics of <b>lighter</b> metals, and, <b>lighter</b> metals such as beryllium, scandium, and titanium, have some of the characteristics of heavier metals.|$|E
