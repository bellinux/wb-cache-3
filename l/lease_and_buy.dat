40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of leasing as an alternative to purchasing a vehicle, there is very little research on how consumers choose among various <b>leasing</b> <b>and</b> financing (namely <b>buying)</b> contracts <b>and</b> how this choice affects the brand they choose. In this paper therefore, we develop a structural model of the consumer's choice of automobile brand and the related decision of whether to lease or buy it. We conceptualize the <b>leasing</b> <b>and</b> <b>buying</b> of the same vehicle as two different goods, each with its own costs and bene¯ts. The differences between the two types of contracts are summarized along three dimensions: (i) the "net price" or financial cost of the contract, (ii) maintenance and repair costs and (iii) operating costs, which depend on the consumer's driving behavior. Based on consumer utility maximization, we derive a nested logit of brand and contract choice that captures the tradeoffs among all three costs. The model is estimated on a dataset of new car purchases from the near luxury segment of the automobile market. The optimal choice of brand and contract is determined by the consumer's implicit interest rate and the number of miles she expects to drive, both of which ar...|$|R

40|$|The skyrocketing gas prices, {{environmental}} impact, {{and reducing}} long term {{dependence on oil}} {{are some of the}} few issues which have really pushed both the consumers and the vehicle makers to consider vehicles powered with alternate sources of energy such Hydrogen Gas, Fuel cell, Hybrid Battery and Gasoline powered, and finally Battery only powered or also known as Electric vehicle. Of the above mentioned options Electric Vehicles are widely popular (trending) in the current vehicle purchase market. In this report an attempt has been made to explore both <b>lease</b> <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> options and make a recommendation as to which one would be a better alternative for the consumer in said vehicle. The results of economic analysis show that, it is generally better to lease the vehicle at lower APR and when the lease period is shorter. On the other hand, it is better to buy the vehicle at a higher APR than to lease it, since leasing will make one pay almost as high in interest as the one buying the vehicle. It was also shown that since the market fluctuation for used vehicles is uncertain, it is more risky to buy the vehicle if one intends to use it for a shorter period, since vehicles generally depreciate quicker in the first few years -­‐ being able to sell it for an anticipated market value might be difficult...|$|E

40|$|Internationally, the {{accounting}} and finance literature provides {{a basis for}} identifying a range of rationales used in <b>lease</b> decision-making, <b>and</b> a number of accounting and financial factors purported to influence the <b>lease</b> versus borrow <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> decision, {{particularly with respect to}} finance leases, has been identified. In this paper the <b>lease</b> versus borrow <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> decision is characterised as multidimensional and multi-factorial. A simple trend analysis of archival, statistical data of leasing in Australia over sixteen financial years (1985 - 86 to 2000 - 01) is presented to form a basis for examining and discussing these factors {{within the context of the}} International literature on leasing. The trend analysis and literature review provided evidence to suggest that much of the conventional, theoretical wisdom concerning the factors important in <b>lease</b> versus borrow <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> decisions may be overemphasised, particularly that related to the influence of accounting treatments and the impact of tax regimes on leasing. Based on the review we develop and describe a constituted, multi-dimensional model of <b>lease</b> decision-making <b>and</b> offer suggestions for the development of improved lease or purchase decision frameworks and for further research in the area that will be more capable of handling this multi-dimensionality.

40|$|Diffusion of {{microgeneration}} technologies, particularly rooftop photovoltaic (PV), {{represents a}} key option in reducing {{emissions in the}} residential sector. We use a uniquely rich dataset from the burgeoning residential PV market in Texas to study {{the nature of the}} consumer's decision-making process in the adoption of these technologies. In particular, focusing on the financial metrics and the information decision-makers use to base their decisions upon, we study how the <b>leasing</b> <b>and</b> <b>buying</b> models affect individual choices and, thereby, the adoption of capital-intensive energy technologies. Overall, our findings suggest that the leasing model more effectively addresses consumers' informational requirements and that, contrary to some other studies, buyers and lessees of PV do not necessarily differ significantly along socio-demographic variables. Instead, we find that the leasing model has opened up the residential PV market to a new, and potentially very large, consumer segment—those with a tight cash-flow situation...|$|R

The conclusion is to evaluate the most effective form of financing a car fleet of the model company. The most effective form of financing the fleet cars is loan financing.

40|$|It can {{be proved}} that, under certain assumptions, buying is financially {{equivalent}} to leasing. However, this {{is merely a}} convenient device to explore why leasing or buying {{is not a matter}} of indifference to users of real estate, plant or equipment. This paper shows why the responsibility for the real estate is one of the main reasons that the choice is of importance. The care of real estate by owners and tenants is likely to be more important than would be the case for other leased assets such as manufacturing plant and equipment, which are the subject of most of the leasing literature. Using data collected by the Property Council of Australia for the costs of occupying and looking after office space, the consequences of leasing or buying are explored. Three aspects of the maintenance and management of properties may affect the choice between owning and renting commercial premises. These are the availability of specialised skills, the willingness to bear the uncertain expenses and the lack of care that may arise from splitting the interests in the property between a landlord and a tenant. Using a combination of data and simulation of the choice between <b>leasing</b> <b>and</b> <b>buying,</b> it i...|$|R

40|$|We use {{a uniquely}} rich dataset from {{the rapidly growing}} {{residential}} photovoltaic (PV) sector to study individual decision-making. We focus on what financial metrics and information decision makers base their decisions on, and how their decision {{is affected by the}} structuring of rebates and business models. In particular, we study how the <b>leasing</b> <b>and</b> <b>buying</b> models affect individual choices. We find that in the early market we studied (Texas), a majority of PV adopters use payback period not net present value (NPV) as the decision-making financial criterion. Those who opt to buy PV systems display a systematic optimism in the value of solar. On the contrary, those who lease typically have a tighter cash flow situation, which in addition to less uncertainty about technological performance when leasing, are the main reasons for them to lease. We also are able to calculate individual-level discount rate using a measure of implied net present value. Across a range of scenarios, buyers of PV systems have discount rates of 8 - 21 % lower than the leasees. Overall, our results suggest that the leasing business is able to address informational requirements of consumers more effectively than the <b>buying</b> model, <b>and</b> that the <b>leasing</b> model has also opened up the residential PV market to a new, and potentially a very large, consumer segment—those with a tight cash flow situation...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons that leasing is a {{financial}} alternative so popular in the world is the one that synthesize its own „philosophy”: It’s not ownership of the assets but their effective use is the one leading to profit.

The Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, personally visited the area and during a meeting, Chandrabhan Sharma motivated him to give the land free of cost for this purpose. Simultaneously, a young engineer from Denmark, Søren Kristian Toubro had obtained a major contract in Mumbai. As a result, vast tracts of land were leased to him by Mr. Sharma to set up what would become Larsen & Toubro.Powai's modernisation started with Mr. Sharma's construction business in 1975 under the flagship of GHP Corporation. Prashant Apts was the first modern building to come up in Powai, followed by the 13-floor Bhawani Tower. After 1985, the Hiranandani builders obtained permission from the government to convert this agricultural land to residential complex. They went on to purchase vast tracts of land between the Vikhroli hill & Powai lake and set up the present day township. Today, the prevalence of amenities such as shopping malls, hospitals, schools and educational institutions like the IIT and NITIE, entertainment hubs, banks and other financial institutions have all contributed to Powai becoming an ideal residential destination.|$|R

At the same time the demand for high quality office premises still exists on the market but with new requirements to the standards of the office working space. It is happening because the employees’ needs and requirements become more oriented to the comfort and safety of the working place. The employers try to keep and motivate employees by providing the most efficient and comfortable office space to work in and balance on cost-quality issues at the same time. In order to influence on demand from tenants’ and empower tenant search process the landlords have to use new, more competitive methods.
