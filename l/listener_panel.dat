30|$|Objective {{speech quality}} {{measurement}} replaces the <b>listener</b> <b>panel</b> with a computational algorithm, thus facilitating automated real-time quality measurement. Indeed, {{for the purpose}} of real-time quality monitoring and control on a network-wide scale, objective speech quality measurement is the only viable option. Objective measurement methods aim to deliver quality estimates that are highly correlated with those obtained from subjective listening experiments. As mentioned previously, for VoIP communications objective quality measurement can be classified as either signal based or parameter based. Such measurement methods are described in the subsections to follow.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} different electrical parameter settings on the intelligibility of speech in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) bilaterally treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Ten patients treated with DBS for 15 +/- 5 months (mean, SD) with significant (P < 0. 01) symptom reduction (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III) were included. In the medication off condition, video laryngostroboscopy was performed and then, in random order, 1 1 DBS parameter settings were tested. Amplitude was increased and decreased by 25 %, frequency was varied in the range 70 to 185 pps, {{and each of the}} contacts was tested separately as a cathode. The patients read a standard running text and five nonsense sentences per setting. A <b>listener</b> <b>panel</b> transcribed the nonsense sentences as perceived and valued the quality of speech on a visual analogue scale. With the patients' normally used settings, there was no significant (P = 0. 058) group difference between DBS OFF and ON, but in four patients the intelligibility deteriorated with DBS ON. The higher frequencies or increased amplitude caused significant (P < 0. 02) impairments of intelligibility, whereas changing the polarity between the separate contacts did not. The settings of amplitude and frequency have a major influence on the intelligibility of speech, emphasizing the importance of meticulous parameter adjustments when programming DBS to minimize side effects related to speech...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{compared the}} speaker recognition performance of human listeners {{to that of}} computer algorithms/systems. Listening protocols were developed analogous to procedures used in the algorithm evaluation run by the U. S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the same telephone conversation data were used. For "same number" testing, with three-second samples, <b>listener</b> <b>panels</b> and the best algorithm had the same equal-error rate (EER) of 8 %. Listeners were better than typical algorithms. For "different number" testing, EER's increased but humans had a 40 % lower equalerror rate. Other observations on human listening performance and robustness to "degradations" were made. 1. INTRODUCTION The development of automatic speaker verification technology has been greatly facilitated by the recent development of uniform training and test materials and of procedures and metrics for evaluating verification performance [1, 2]. For many, the performance goal for automatic verif [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Online {{presentation}} has two user modes, namely (1) Presenter Mode, and (2) Listener Mode. In presenter mode, {{the user}} has over-all control of slide change, cursor position, zooming function and annotation function. Users in listener mode can only monitor who {{have joined the}} presentation, but {{does not have the}} rights to control the slides. The <b>listener’s</b> presentation <b>panel</b> serves as a passive listener where it displays what is on the presenter’s presentation panel.|$|R

New songs were chosen {{with the help of the}} <b>listener</b> advisory <b>panel.</b>|$|R
40|$|Aims: To study {{speech with}} regard to {{articulation}} and perceptual speech symptoms related to velopharyngeal dysfunction, intelligibility and language ability in patients born with a) an isolated cleft palate with or without additional malformations/syndromes, or b) 22 q 11 deletion syndrome (22 q 11 DS). Materials and methods: Fifty-three patients (aged 3 - 10 years) born with an isolated cleft palate and 30 non-cleft children participated in studies I and II, and 65 consecutively referred patients with 22 q 11 DS confirmed by a FISH-test participated in studies III and IV. Audiotape-recorded speech samples from all participants in studies I III were presented for a <b>listener</b> <b>panel</b> in random order and were blindly rated according to predefined variables and scale definitions. Phonetic transcription of articulation errors and acoustic analysis were also included. In study IV, tests of expressive language and receptive vocabulary were performed. Results: Papers I & II: A high prevalence of velopharyngeal impairment was found among patients born with an isolated cleft palate {{as a part of}} a syndrome or together with additional malformations. All patients with persistent glottal articulation belonged to this group. The best speech was found among patients with a cleft in the soft palate only, without any known additional malformations. Small changes in the magnitude of velopharyngeal impairment between 3 and 10 years of age were found. Papers III & IV: Almost 90 % of patients with 22 q 11 DS had velopharyngeal impairment, irrespective of whether or not they had a cleft in the palate, and 11 % had glottal articulation. The majority of the five to eight year-old patients had a language impairment. The most substantial difficulties were problems in retelling a narrative and the use of short sentences. Eighty percent of the 5 - 10 year-old patients had reduced intelligibility to varying degrees. An area of concern was the low reliability of the perceptual assessments. Conclusion: Patients with an isolated cleft palate {{as a part of a}} syndrome or accompanied with additional malformations should be considered at risk for severe speech problems. Both velopharyngeal impairment and speech and language difficulties seem to be typical features of the phenotype in 22 q 11 DS...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} listeners' {{perception of the}} speech naturalness of people who stutter (PWS) speaking under delayed auditory feedback (DAF) with particular attention for possible <b>listener</b> differences. Three <b>panels</b> of judges consisting of 14 stuttering individuals, 14 speech language pathologists, and 14 naive listeners rated the naturalness of speech samples of stuttering and non-stuttering individuals using a 9 -point interval scale. Results clearly indicate that these three groups evaluate naturalness differently. Naive listeners {{appear to be more}} severe in their judgements than speech language pathologists and stuttering listeners, and speech language pathologists are apparently more severe than PWS. The three listener groups showed similar trends with respect to the relationship between speech naturalness and speech rate. Results of all three indicated that for PWS, the slower a speaker's rate was, the less natural speech was judged to sound. The three listener groups also showed similar trends with regard to naturalness of the stuttering versus the non-stuttering individuals. All three panels considered the speech of the non-stuttering participants more natural. Educational objectives: The reader will be able to: (1) discuss the speech naturalness of people who stutter speaking under delayed auditory feedback, (2) discuss listener differences about the naturalness of people who stutter speaking under delayed auditory feedback, and (3) discuss the importance of speech rate for the naturalness of speech.
