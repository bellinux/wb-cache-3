A language {{is one of the most}} important and effective modes of communication between the people belonging to different communities and cultures. The <b>language</b> acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> among us and helps in creating a bond among our cultures. Therefore, to learn mother <b>language</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> other new <b>languages</b> is very important for us. The dictionary is one of the important tools that can be used for learning new languages. A word is basically an association of linguistic sound and meaning. The spelling does not always easily correlate with the sound of a word. A dictionary helps us both with the spelling and pronunciation of such words. Electronic dictionaries are very popular nowadays and many users can be accessed simultaneously on Online. This paper describes the Development of Multilingual Assamese Electronic Dictionary (MAED). The MAED contains four languages, namely Assamese, Bengali, English and Hindi. We have developed Assamese-Bengali, English and Hindi (A-BEH) Dictionary in MAED. The A-BEH Dictionary is a user friendly dictionary and user can easily look up the meanings of words and other related information of the words like word Id, POS, synonyms and examples from Assamese language to Bengali, English and Hindi languages on Online. This dictionary will be beneficial for Assamese people as well as other people living in India...|$|R

For example in our case study of “Integra” we found a key decision to adopt <b>a</b> new programming <b>language</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Integration <b>bridge</b> between RED and GREEN. This decision seemed good {{at the time it was}} taken and was motivated by two reasons: (a) the language’s efficiency for the job; (b) the language was shared between RED and GREEN, tentatively helping in the creation of <b>an</b> organisational <b>bridge</b> between the two communities. Eventually, however, the decision caused the addition of new technicians to the organisational and social structure which caused fear factors to emerge in the rest of developers. Consequent condescending behaviour resulted in managers and software architects to issue a project slow-down, for problem-solving. At the end of the study, we confirmed that problems related to that decision were still causing slowdowns. This not withstanding, this property might be related to the exploratory nature of our study. Since we introduced social debt only after the interviews, it would have been impossible for interviewees to point out direct relationships between social debt and socio-technical decisions, if any.|$|R

40|$|Both formal {{analysis}} {{in the sense of}} proving theorems about the properties of agent and mechanism design and the use of formalisms <b>as</b> representation <b>languages</b> have been central elements in the foundation of multi agent systems research. The choice and frequently the development of formalisms for the specification and description of multi agent systems has been guided by intuition regarding the importance and nature of such concepts as belief and intention. An alternative to this foundational approach is a representational approach developed by modellers of observed social systems who design agents and mechanisms to capture observed behaviour and modes of social interaction. While the foundational approach has had an important influence on the research agenda of agent based social simulation, the representational techniques of agent based social simulation modellers have had no discernable influence on formalistic approaches to software engineering for multi agent systems. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to define a means of making available the lessons of real social systems to adopting formal approaches to MAS design. The means employed turns on the development of a canonical model capturing features of an observed social system in a way that relates explicitly to concepts such as belief, desire, intention, commitment, norms, obligation and responsibility. As a result, it is possible to define these concepts with minimal ambiguity either <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alternative to the use of formalisms <b>as</b> representation <b>languages</b> or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> to such formalisms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract�Finger {{spelling}} {{is an art}} {{of communicating}} by signs made with fingers, and has been introduced into sign <b>language</b> to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> between the sign language and the verbal language. Previous approaches to finger spelling recognition are classified into two categories: glove-based and vision-based approaches. The glove-based approach is simpler and more accurate recognizing work of hand posture than vision-based, yet the interfaces require the user to wear a cumbersome and carry a load of cables that connected the device to a computer. In contrast, the vision-based approaches provide an attractive alternative to the cumbersome interface, and promise more natural and unobtrusive human-computer interaction. The vision-based approaches generally consist of two steps: hand extraction and recognition, and two steps are processed independently. This paper proposes real-time vision-based Korean finger spelling recognition system by integrating hand extraction into recognition. First, we tentatively detect a hand region using CAMShift algorithm. Then fill factor and aspect ratio estimated by width and height estimated by CAMShift are used to choose candidate from database, which can {{reduce the number of}} matching in recognition step. To recognize the finger spelling, we use DTW(dynamic time warping) based on modified chain codes, to be robust to scale and orientation variations. In this procedure, since accurate hand regions, without holes and noises, should be extracted to improve the precision, we use graph cuts algorithm that globally minimize the energy function elegantly expressed by Markov random fields (MRFs). In the experiments, the computational times are less than 130 ms, and the times are not related to the number of templates of finger spellings in database, as candidate templates are selected in extraction step. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{much has}} been written about Coleridge’s ideas {{concerning}} language, less has been said about the role that communication plays in his work, particularly his use of <b>language</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> medium for <b>bridging</b> the distance between himself and others. Coleridge felt that great poetry could successfully overcome this gap, and in his poetry there are moments when he felt that he was fully tuned-in to an intelligible universe created by an all-loving and all-communicating God. Such moments, when the “One Life” was revealed to him were based upon a theory of communication in which the universe was the medium of divine communication. More frequently, however, Coleridge was troubled by bad reception, by what he understood to be a failure of communication, times when he was denied complete participation in a fully intelligible world and when the gap separating himself from others and from nature appeared <b>as</b> <b>a</b> chasm. “Sometimes when I earnestly look at a beautiful Object or Landscape,” he writes in a notebook, “it seems as if I were on the brink of a Fruition still denied [...] as if Vision were <b>an</b> appetite: even <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man would feel, who having put forth all his muscular strength in an act of prosilience, at that very moment held back [...] he leaps & yet moves not from his place” (Notebooks III, no 3767). At such times, Coleridge felt “held back,” wanting desperately to move forward from his sense of isolation but unable to do so. This state of tension, in the desire for complete communication in a context of communication breakdowns, characterizes Coleridge’s best writing. For Coleridge, poetry was the highest form of human communication, and the task of a poet was to use language to move his readers beyond the need for words. When communication failed, he felt that he was a failed poet. This essay will examine Coleridge’s commitment to the idea of perfect communication at the same time as it suggests that one aspect of Coleridge’s strength <b>as</b> <b>a</b> writer lies in those moments when he grappled with the fallibility of human communication and sought to build community in a world in which our relationship to others also includes isolation, misdirection, darkness, strangeness, and ghosts...|$|R
