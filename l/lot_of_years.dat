500|$|DuVall joined Alice in Chains as {{lead singer}} during the band's reunion concerts. Duff McKagan again joined the band for the reunion tour, playing rhythm guitar on {{selected}} songs. Cantrell explained the reunion, [...] "We want to celebrate {{what we did}} {{and the memory of}} our friend. We have played with some [...] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [...] rich legacy. It's a tough thing to go through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing {{to take a chance on}} it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on." [...] Before the tour, Kinney mentioned in an interview that he would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains.|$|E
500|$|On the October 31, 2007 {{episode of}} the reality show Phenomenon, Paranormalist Jim Callahan {{performed}} a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover {{the contents of a}} locked box. [...] Although fellow judge Uri Geller praised the performance, Angel called it [...] "comical" [...] and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an [...] "ideological bigot", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, [...] "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came out with my spoon bending..." [...] Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, [...] "I guess this is a 'no,'" [...] and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an index card with the numbers [...] "911" [...] printed on it for September 11, 2001. Angel's explanation was this: [...] "If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives". The other envelope's contents were scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of Criss Angel: Mindfreak.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s, Velásquez began {{focusing}} on {{national and international}} companies in addition to local growers. [...] "It {{was a big mistake}} to go after individual farmers," [...] he said, [...] "instead of {{focusing on}} the large corporations. [...] We spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> doing that, and it was a mistake." [...] From 1970 to 1983, Velasquez implemented a long-term strategy to build public support for the farmworkers, publicizing the discrimination, low wages, and often appalling working conditions they faced. In 1976, workers at a tomato cannery in Warren, Indiana, struck over the employer's tactic of overrecruiting workers in order to force down wages. The workers spontaneously barricaded themselves inside the cannery, refusing to allow the perishable crop inside until their grievances had been addressed. The workers asked FLOC to intervene. A federal district court issued an injunction requiring that the workers vacate the premises, but they refused. Although nearly all the workers were arrested, there was extensive publicity about the strike, the employer's overrcruitment tactic, the low wages and unsanitary conditions the workers suffered, {{and the use of the}} Immigration and Naturalization Service to intimidate workers and avoid paying them (through deportation proceedings). Velásquez later said the tomato cannery strike helped improve FLOC's negotiating and worker mobilization skills and provided a trial run for the union's dealings with large corporations.|$|E
