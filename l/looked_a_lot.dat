500|$|.....We felt {{because it}} was 20 years earlier, these are much younger Spartans. They aren't quite as {{experienced}} as Master Chief, and we <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> at combat infantry going into actual wars, and typically {{at the beginning of}} a war, especially the Vietnam War, if you look at the infantry, they're all loaded up. They have all the backpacks on, they have all the belts on, every single bit of armor is there, and they're carrying around lots of armor. At the end of the war, they've lost it all and just carry what they need. This is all they have. So if you look at our Spartans, they have more pieces of armor on going into the war. They have more markings on there, more pieces of armor. They've still got the belts on, they're still carrying around everything.|$|E
500|$|... "Bullfrog" [...] was {{the name}} Frank [...] "Shorty" [...] Harris and Ernest [...] "Ed" [...] Cross, the prospectors who started the Bullfrog gold rush, gave to their mine. As quoted by Robert D. McCracken in A History of Beatty, Nevada, Harris said during a 1930 {{interview}} for Westways magazine, [...] "The rock was green, almost like turquoise, spotted with big chunks of yellow metal, and <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like {{the back of a}} frog." [...] The Bullfrog Mining District, the Bullfrog Hills, the town of Bullfrog, and other geographical entities in the region took their name from the Bullfrog Mine. [...] "Bullfrog" [...] became so popular that Giant Bullfrog, Bullfrog Merger, Bullfrog Apex, Bullfrog Annex, Bullfrog Gold Dollar, Bullfrog Mogul, and most of the district's other 200 or so mining companies included [...] "Bullfrog" [...] in their names. [...] The name persisted and, decades later, was given to the short-lived Bullfrog County.|$|E
500|$|An early {{difficulty}} was {{the implementation}} of texture mapping. Neurath had experimented unsuccessfully with the concept on an Apple II computer in the late 1980s, but {{he believed that the}} more powerful IBM PCs of the time might be able to process it. He contacted Lerner Research programmer Chris Green—an acquaintance from his past work with Ned Lerner—who created a working algorithm. Using the Space Rogue engine, Green's algorithm, assembly code from Lerner Research's Car and Driver and original programming, the Blue Sky team completed a prototype of Underworld after roughly a month of work. Neurath described the prototype as [...] "fast, smooth, and [...] true texture mapped walls, though the ceiling and floor were flat shaded and the corridors and rooms were all 10' [...] high—it <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like Wolfenstein-3D in fact." [...] The team demonstrated it at the June 1990 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and impressed Origin Systems. Origin producer Warren Spector later said, [...] "I remember Paul showing me that demo [...] at CES and being totally floored by it. None of us had ever seen anything like it." [...] The two companies reached a publishing agreement that summer, and Origin suggested that the game be reworked to fit into the Ultima universe. The team agreed, and the game was renamed Ultima Underworld. While Spector had hoped to produce the game, he was not assigned to the role; and he later said that he [...] "sort of watched [...] jealously from the sidelines." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dassault's {{resulting}} prototype, dubbed Mirage IV 01, <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{like the}} Mirage IIIA, {{even though it}} had double the wing surface, two engines instead of one, and twice the unladen weight. The Mirage IV also carried three times more internal fuel than the Mirage III. The aircraft's aerodynamic features were very similar to the III's but required an entirely new structure and layout. This prototype was [...] long, had a [...] wingspan, [...] of wing area, and weighed approximately [...] It was considerably more advanced than the Mirage III, incorporating new features such as machined and chem-milled planks, tapered sheets, a small amount of titanium, and integral fuel tanks in many locations including the leading portion of the tailfin.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Firebird's introduction, DeLorean turned his {{attention}} to development of an all-new Grand Prix, the division's personal luxury car based on the full sized Pontiac line since 1962. Sales were sagging by this time however, but the new for 1969 model would have its own distinct body shell with drivetrain and chassis components from the intermediate-sized Pontiac A-body (Tempest, LeMans, GTO). Delorean knew Pontiac Division couldn't finance the new car alone so Delorean went to his former boss Pete Estes and asked to share the cost of development with Pontiac having a one-year exclusivity before Chevrolet would release the 1970 Monte Carlo. The deal was done. The 1969 Pontiac Grand Prix <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like a slightly scaled down Cadillac Eldorado with its razor-sharp bodylines and a [...] hood. Inside was a sporty and luxurious interior highlighted by a wraparound cockpit-style instrument panel, bucket seats and center console. The new model offered a sportier, high performance, somewhat smaller and lower-priced alternative to the other personal luxury cars then on the market such as the Ford Thunderbird, Buick Riviera, Lincoln Continental Mark III, and Oldsmobile Toronado. The 1969 Grand Prix production ended up at over 112,000 units, far higher than the 32,000 1968 Grand Prix built from the full-sized Pontiac body.|$|E

2500|$|Jo Garfein at TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} preview, saying, [...] "This episode {{has more of}} an early X-Files feel, in a good way... To {{those of you who}} have either given up on the series or are on the fence, I recommend that you give Fringe another try. If 'Inner Child' is any indication, we are in for a very satisfying and engaging journey for the rest of the season." [...] Alan Sepinwall's review in The Star-Ledger was overall positive, [...] "As far as the episode as a whole goes, I thought it was fairly solid procedural hour of 'Fringe.' No, it didn't follow up on any of the revelations from 'Ability,' but it also didn't feature any of Agent Harris, and both the serial killer case and Olivia's rapport with the kid were compelling enough that I can wait on the mythology stuff for later." [...] Jane Boursaw at TV Squad rated the episode very highly in her recap, and also mooted a theory about the Child, [...] "My theory is that the boy is another Observer. They certainly <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> alike, didn't they? Could the boy have come from another dimension and ended up beneath the building? And why did the CIA guy say that they'd found 'another one.'" [...] Apparently, they're keeping track of these creatures or Observers. And if so, where are the others?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Even Australia's {{collapse}} {{gave them}} a lead of 52 on a wicket which had dried out and <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> better for batting, but the England openers failed again. Peter Richardson was brilliantly caught and bowled by Richie Benaud who had relieved Alan Davidson. Peter May sent in Trevor Bailey—"The Barnacle"—at number three, a very negative move given his reputation as England should have been looking to runs. He was soon joined by Tom Graveney when Milton was caught by Wally Grout off Davidson at 34/2. The stylish Graveney was often criticised for getting out carelessly, but he survived two l.b.w. appeals in an over from Benaud, who beat the bat twice more without success. They took the score to 92/2 {{by the end of}} the day, a lead of 40 runs, with only 122 runs coming in the day. On the fourth day Graveney was halfway down the wicket going for an easy single when Bailey sent him back and he was run out for 36 after staying in for nearly three hours. May was soon out to Benaud (4/66), but Colin Cowdrey (28) stuck in for over two hours before he was caught by Lindsay Kline at grass level. Umpire McInnes was unsighted, but after a nod from Umpire Hays at square-leg umpire gave Cowdrey out, even though he was briefly called back by Harvey, who doubted that the ball had carried. [...] "The Boil" [...] remained glued to the crease for 357 minutes making the slowest 50 by an Englishman in Tests. [...] "Trevor was apt to enjoy playing a character part. 'Barnacle Bailey' as a sobriquet had stuck all too firmly...to the infinite frustration of the crowds—which here at Brisbane showed their feeling by simply staying away" [...] wrote E.W. Swanton, who questioned [...] "whether victory, if it should come, is worth the cost in terms of sterile, boring play that makes one sick at heart to watch". To be fair to Bailey he had [...] been hailed as a saviour playing in this fashion in 1953 and 1954–55 and was unlikely to change his style at the end of his career. Benaud did not help as he set the field to cut off the stonewaller's limited repertoire of strokes, with Meckiff bowling down the leg side. One pressman roused himself to ask when Bailey had last scored a run, [...] "Twenty minutes past two" [...] answered the England scorer George Duckworth, [...] "Today or yesterday?" [...] was the reply. Just before stumps Bailey suddenly rushed down the pitch to take a swipe at Mackay, missed and was bowled for 68. It was a strangely reckless end as a few more minutes would have allowed Peter May the use of the heavy roller in the morning to break up the wicket for his bowlers. Bailey had batted for 458 minutes and scored from only 40 of the 427 balls he faced. Only 106 runs were made in a full day's play, the lowest in an Ashes Test.|$|E

"Of course," [...] said he, [...] "Little Chief's {{father taught}} him how to make hay, and his father's father taught him, and so on way back to the days when the world was young and Old Mother Nature made the first Pika or Coney, {{whichever}} you please to call him, and set him free on a great mountain to prove whether he was worthy to live or was so helpless that there was no place for him in the Great World. Now Mr. Pika, who was promptly called Little Chief, no one remembers now just why, was exactly like Little Chief of today. He was just about a fourth as big as you, Peter. In fact, he <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> like one of your babies, excepting his legs and his ears. His legs were short and rather weak, and his ears were short and rounded. He was very gentle and timid. He had neither the kind of teeth and claws for fighting nor long legs for running away, and it did seem as if Little Chief's chances of a long life and a happy one were very slim indeed, especially as it happened that he was set free to shift for himself just {{at the beginning of the}} hard times, when the big and strong had begun to hunt the small and weak.|$|E
