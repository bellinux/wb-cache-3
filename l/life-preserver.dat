25|$|Last aboard was the ship's master, Capt. Lawrence J. Gallagher of Sacramento, Calif., {{who refused}} to pause in his {{direction}} of abandon-ship efforts long enough to don a <b>life-preserver.</b> A rope thrown {{to him from the}} last waiting lifeboat fell short and the captain was never seen after the war freighter went down.|$|E
2500|$|Grahamona was {{reported}} to be introducing a number of design innovations, including white enameled [...] bunks and walls in the crew’s quarters, a combination dressing table and <b>life-preserver</b> receptacle in the woman’s cabin, and lockers in each officer’s stateroom. [...] The walls, the ceiling and the cabin exterior were all built of kiln-dried cedar for lightness of weight.|$|E
60|$|Regardless of the danger, Tom flew {{across the}} deck to {{where there was a}} <b>life-preserver,</b> {{attached}} to a hundred feet of small, but strong, rope. Once at the stern again, he threw the <b>life-preserver</b> as far out as possible.|$|E
5000|$|... legal {{requirements}} governing lifeboats and out-dated <b>life-preservers</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{will it be}} time," [...] asked Mrs. Lecks, [...] "for us {{to put on the}} <b>life-preservers?</b> When {{the water}} gets nearly to the seats?" ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{knew that}} two <b>life-preservers</b> {{would not be}} needed by Mrs. Lecks, and would greatly {{inconvenience}} her, I accepted the one offered me, but declined {{to put it on}} until it should be necessary, as it would interfere with my movements.|$|R
60|$|In {{about an}} hour I made {{out that it was}} {{something}} round, with something white raised above it, and then I discovered that it was a <b>life-preserver,</b> which supported a little stick, to which a white flag, probably a handkerchief, was attached. Then I saw that on the <b>life-preserver</b> lay a little yellow mass.|$|E
60|$|I {{supposed}} {{that when the}} ship came near us she would stop and lower a boat, but {{there seemed to be}} no intention of the kind. A group of men stood in her bow, and I saw that one of them held a round <b>life-preserver</b> in his hand,--it was one of the India-rubber kind, filled with air, and to it a line was attached. When the ship was just opposite to us, this man shouted something which I did not hear, and threw the <b>life-preserver.</b> It fell close to the raft. I thought, indeed, it was coming right into the midst of us. The red-faced man with the gold ear-rings was nearest to it. He made a grab at it, and missed it. On went the ship, and on went the <b>life-preserver,</b> skipping and dancing over the waves. They let out lots of line, but still the <b>life-preserver</b> was towed away.|$|E
60|$|I {{replied that}} by {{the help of a}} <b>life-preserver</b> a person who could swim might reach the ship.|$|E
60|$|Captain Hubbell roared out {{orders to}} throw out <b>life-preservers</b> and lower a boat; but, remembering {{that he was not}} on board a vessel of the olden times, he changed the order and {{commanded}} that a patent boat-hook be used upon the man in the water.|$|R
6000|$|... "If we must die, let us die {{together}}!" [...] said Dick, {{and they}} kept together {{as well as they}} could. Old Jerry was with them, and said he would do all he could for them. He had already passed around <b>life-preservers,</b> and these they put on with all possible speed.|$|R
60|$|As no lamps {{are allowed}} in the rooms at night, {{darkness}} added to the alarm, and it was some time before the real state of the case was known. Mrs. Homer went at once to the frightened girls, and found Ethel clinging to Jenny, {{who was trying to}} find the <b>life-preservers</b> lashed to the wall.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Caryll {{advanced}} menacingly {{upon the}} tipstaff. Mr. Green stepped back, {{and fell into}} a defensive attitude, balancing a short but formidable-looking <b>life-preserver.</b>|$|E
60|$|Again {{she came}} plowing along before us, {{the same group}} on her bow; again the <b>life-preserver</b> was thrown, {{and this time the}} captain seized it.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. CURWEN: [...] "It's {{quite enough}} for the purpose. Couldn't you put on a <b>life-preserver,</b> Mr. Miller, and go ashore and get help from the natives?" ...|$|E
60|$|I had a hope, {{which was}} not quite strong {{enough to be a}} belief, that, {{supported}} by their <b>life-preservers,</b> the two women might paddle themselves along; and that, by giving them in turn a helping hand, I might eventually get them to the steamer. There was a strong probability that I would not succeed, but I did not care to think of that.|$|R
60|$|But I did {{not intend}} to stand there. A good many men were already rushing from their rooms and hurrying up the steep stairs that led {{from the rear of the}} saloon to the deck, and I could hear ladies calling out from their rooms as if they were hurrying to get ready to come out. The stewardess, a tall colored woman, was just going to one of these ladies, who had her head out of the door. I told Rectus to run up on deck, see how things were going on, and then to come back to the Chippertons' door. Then I ran to our room, jerked the cork <b>life-preservers</b> from under the pillows, and came out into the saloon with them. This seemed to frighten several persons, who saw me as I came from our room, and they rushed back for their <b>life-preservers,</b> {{generally}} getting into the wrong room, I think. I did not want to help to make a fuss and confusion, but I thought it would be a good deal better for us to get the <b>life-preservers</b> now, than to wait. If we didn't need them, no harm would be done. Some one had turned up several lamps in the saloon, so that we could see better. But no one stopped to look much. Everybody, ladies and all,--there were not many of these,--hurried on deck. The Chippertons were the last to make their appearance. Just as their door opened, Rectus ran up to me.|$|R
25|$|Crewmen {{on board}} steamboats in the 1890s did not wear <b>life-preservers.</b> Drownings often {{occurred}} if they {{fell into the}} river. In late May, 1890, while Harvest Queen was coming upriver from Astoria to Portland, George P. Ward, of Portland, a watchman, was drowned when he was struck with a gang plank as the boat was preparing for a landing and knocked into the river.|$|R
6000|$|Seizing the <b>life-preserver</b> with {{an earnest}} [...] "thank God" [...] {{in his heart}} if not on his lips, he clung to it and looked anxiously around.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I am," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine, [...] "but I {{never thought}} that {{a person with a}} <b>life-preserver</b> on would go clean under the water." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>life-preserver</b> was a {{circular}} one, filled with air. In {{the centre of}} this, Mary, by means of many strings, had probably secured a stick in an upright position; she had then fastened a handkerchief {{to the top of}} the stick. Bertha had written a message and Mary had wrapped it in a piece of oiled silk and fastened it to the <b>life-preserver.</b> She had then lowered this contrivance to the surface of the water, hoping that it would float to me or I would float to it.|$|E
5000|$|Brigadeer-General James O'Connor, the {{military}} {{officer in charge}} of building the highway, described {{the difficulty of the}} work. [...] "Engineer troops worked 10-12 hours a day through temperatures that ranged down to 70 below, hacking their way through forests, plunging into icy streams in <b>life-preservers</b> to sink bridge pilings, sweating through steaming summer days amid plagues of mosquitoes and 'no-see-ums,' to push the road through." ...|$|R
60|$|The vessels came {{together}} before I could follow his advice. We {{must have been}} struck squarely amidships, for I saw nothing, the strange steamboat having passed beyond my line of vision. The Martinez heeled over, sharply, {{and there was a}} crashing and rending of timber. I was thrown flat on the wet deck, and before I could scramble to my feet I heard the scream of the women. This it was, I am certain,—the most indescribable of blood-curdling sounds,—that threw me into a panic. I remembered the <b>life-preservers</b> stored in the cabin, but was met at the door and swept backward by a wild rush of men and women. What happened in the next few minutes I do not recollect, though I have a clear remembrance of pulling down <b>life-preservers</b> from the overhead racks, while the red-faced man fastened them about the bodies of an hysterical group of women. This memory is as distinct and sharp as that of any picture I have seen. It is a picture, and I can see it now,—the jagged edges of the hole {{in the side of the}} cabin, through which the grey fog swirled and eddied; the empty upholstered seats, littered with all the evidences of sudden flight, such as packages, hand satchels, umbrellas, and wraps; the stout gentleman who had been reading my essay, encased in cork and canvas, the magazine still in his hand, and asking me with monotonous insistence if I thought there was any danger; the red-faced man, stumping gallantly around on his artificial legs and buckling <b>life-preservers</b> on all comers; and finally, the screaming bedlam of women.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{that idea}} {{came into my}} head, I jumped {{up and began to}} walk about. What could I do? I {{certainly}} ought to be ready to do something when the time came. I thought of getting <b>life-preservers,</b> and strapping one on each of us, so that if the Water-devil turned over the vessel and shook us out, we shouldn't sink down to him, but would float on the surface.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it would}} be so nice to catch a burglar and crunch him. I feel almost bloodthirsty since I hit that fellow with the <b>life-preserver,</b> and find that I didn't kill him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it was. He {{told me not}} to omit seeing I had a <b>life-preserver</b> in my state-room; {{said the}} boat {{supplied}} them, too. But where are they? I don't see any. What are they like?" ...|$|E
60|$|With great {{difficulty}} the boat got {{near to the}} port quarter of the ship, and Pike stood up ready in the bow with a line, to which was attached a loaded cane, something like a large <b>life-preserver.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Lying in his hot {{steerage}} bunk, {{stripped to}} his under-shirt, Carl {{peered through the}} [...] "state-room" [...] window to the swishing night sea, conscious of the rolling of the boat, of the engines shaking her, of bolts studding the white iron wall, of <b>life-preservers</b> over his head, of stokers singing in the gangway as they dumped the clinkers overboard. The Panama was pounding on, on, on, and he rejoiced, [...] "This is just what I've wanted, always." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Wellington was now groaning and {{creaking}} {{in every}} timber, {{as if she}} was aware that her last hour {{on the surface of the}} lake had come. She was, as Tom had said, an old [...] "tub," [...] and should have been condemned years before. But the Canadians were used to her and handled the craft as skillfully as possible. They, too, provided themselves with <b>life-preservers</b> and, when Sam relieved his brother at the pump, Tom did likewise.|$|R
2500|$|Hoover's {{account of}} Elwood actions was disputed by the boat's captain, James Lee, and the mate and the fireman. [...] They {{stated that the}} steamer stopped before {{reaching}} the draw, tied up at the pivot pier, and did everything possible {{to help the people}} in the water, throwing over <b>life-preservers,</b> planks and staging. [...] They said they had launched a boat to try to save people. [...] Using the boat, they rescued the only man who survived the car's plunge into the river, who was found floating on the Elwoods gangplank.|$|R
60|$|He traced that gallant sorter to a still {{suburban}} square; He {{watched his}} opportunity, and seized him unaware; He took a <b>life-preserver</b> and he hit {{him on the}} head, And MRS. BROWN dissected him {{before she went to}} bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're too particular, Barb'ry Aleshine," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, [...] "about your comforts. If {{you find}} the ground too hard to sleep on, when you get there, you can put on your <b>life-preserver,</b> {{and go to bed}} in the water." ...|$|E
6000|$|He traced that gallant sorter to a still {{suburban}} square; [...] He {{watched his}} opportunity and seized him unaware; [...] He took a <b>life-preserver</b> and he hit {{him on the}} head, [...] And Mrs. Brown dissected him {{before she went to}} bed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to passenger comfort, the designers of Commonwealth also paid considerable attention to safety. Commonwealth was furnished with eight lifeboats, 600 <b>life-preservers</b> - enough for every passenger aboard - and 155 life-preserving seats. A {{large number of}} water pumps, operable either by machine or hand, were installed, each fitted with [...] "a great length of hose" [...] ready for use; also a number of [...] "steam fire annihilators". Even the staterooms themselves were arranged {{in such a way}} as to permit rapid access to the main deck in case of emergency.|$|R
60|$|By {{means of}} the endless fall our hero now hauled a heavy rope or cable from the wreck, {{the end of which}} he {{fastened}} round a large boulder. This rope, being hauled taut, remained suspended between the wreck and the cliffs some feet above the sea. Previous to fixing it a large block had been run upon it, and to this block was suspended one of those circular cork <b>life-preservers</b> which one usually sees attached to the bulwarks of ships. It was made into a sort of bag by means of a piece of canvas. The endless fall was then attached to this bag so that it could travel with its block backwards and forwards on the thick cable.|$|R
60|$|He {{found her}} making their state-room look homelike with their {{familiar}} things {{when he came}} with their daughter's steamer letter and the flowers and fruit she had sent. She said, Very well, they would all keep, and went on with her unpacking. He {{asked her if she}} did not think these home things made it rather ghastly, and she said if he kept on in that way she should certainly go back on the pilot-boat. He perceived that her nerves were spent. He had resisted the impulse to an ill-timed joke about the <b>life-preservers</b> under their berths when the sound of the breakfast-horn, wavering first in the distance, found its way nearer and clearer down their corridor.|$|R
