Many design decisions taken by urban planners –form, density, roof type and orientation – {{have a significant}} effect on the conditions of such buildings, although urban planners might not always be aware of the effect of their design. This study examines the effects of important design decisions on the solar energy potential of net zero energy solar buildings. Typical Swedish building blocks with varying form, density, roof type and orientation were used to simulate the annual solar irradiation and energy production, and to calculate the <b>load</b> <b>match</b> for heating and electricity under Swedish conditions. Results of this study show that the urban density is the most influential parameter on the solar potential of building blocks. Furthermore, flat roofs often returned the highest <b>load</b> <b>match</b> value, while the effect of orientation on the solar potential turned out not to be that straightforward. With the results of this study, urban planners can make better informed decisions, while it also provides a ground for the net zero energy solar buildings discussion by exposing the boundaries of such buildings in the urban environment...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the <b>load</b> <b>matching</b> factor {{is used as}} a measure for the quality of <b>load</b> <b>matching</b> to the {{photovoltaic}} (PV) array. An optimization approach is used to solve the <b>load</b> <b>matching</b> problem with the objective of maximizing the <b>load</b> <b>matching</b> factor, and consequently the PV output energy. Thig approach is then applied to resistive loads (with and without an internal emf) connected to the array. Results show that optimum matching can be achieved by carefully selecting the array parameters with respect to the load parameters. The temperature of the array has little effect on the optimum matching factor. However, the optimum matching parameters are greatly affected by the array temperature. A maximum power tracker may not be needed if optimum or near optimum matching is achieved. A battery of selected parameters can be included if the load characteristic results in poor matching performance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} an equivalent resistive-reactive load for the optimum energy harvesting from vibration sources. In photovoltaic applications, the converter impedance that ensures the maximum power is real and the Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) uses a single variable optimization algorithm (resistive <b>load</b> <b>matching).</b> The piezoelectric generator, instead, {{is characterized by a}} high capacitive impedance. Thus, the optimal power generation is obtained by a resistive and reactive load impedance (resistive and reactive <b>load</b> <b>matching).</b> Taking into account that the <b>load</b> <b>matching</b> inductor should be changed depending on the excitation frequency and it is usually impractically large if implemented by a passive element, the adaptive resistive-inductive (RL) impedance is here implemented using a bidirectional dc-dc converters and their parameters are tuned using a two-dimentional MPPT using the downhill simplex method. Simulation and experimental results obtained on a prototype, where the digital control has been implemented on a microcontroller platform, confirm the proposed analysis and the performance achievable by the proposed method. The resistive and reactive <b>load</b> <b>matching</b> strongly increases the power generation especially for excitation frequencies different from the resonant and antiresonant frequencies of the piezoelectric generator...|$|E

Jumping robot {{belongs to a}} variable constraints system because every phase has different constraint conditions. An unified dynamics equation during stance phase and flight phase is established based on floated-basis space. Inertia matching is used to analyze actuator/gear systems and select the optimum gear ratio based on the transmission performance between the torque produced at the actuator and the torque applied to the load. <b>Load</b> <b>matching</b> is an important index which affects jumping performance and reflects the capability of supporting a weight or mass.

Inertia matching manipulability and directional manipulability are easy to analyze and optimize the <b>load</b> <b>matching</b> parameters. A 5 th order polynomial function is defined to plan COG trajectory of jumping motion, taking into account the constraint conditions of both velocity and acceleration.
