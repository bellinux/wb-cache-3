40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of interfaith marriage has been analyzed with {{the approach of}} theology, sociology, law, politics, and public policy. The original contribution {{of this study is}} its effort and aim to approach this phenomenon with psychological perspective. This study placed the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> one’s <b>identification</b> <b>towards</b> sexual values as predictors for his/her perceived risk of interfaith marriage, of which the values cannot be separated from metropolitan culture. This research is a quantitative research by employing predictive correlational design. The samples were 271 students (99 men, 172 women; Mage = 20. 59 years, SDage = 1. 67 years) from five campuses in and around Jakarta. Research data analyses, by using multiple linear regression, show results which indicate that there is interaction between the gender with sexual values in influencing the risk perception. There are {{differences between men and women}} in terms of correlation between the two variables. In men, sexual values are not able to predict the perceived risk. In the Moslem women, two sexual values, i. e. absolutism and hedonism, are able to predict it. The results provide new insights regarding the relationship between sexuality with religion and marriage, particularly in urban areas in Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} recognises {{the importance}} of social capital as a key asset in developing innovation capabilities. However, most research treats social capital as homogenous in terms <b>of</b> <b>level</b> and quality, irrespective of who has the capital inside the organisation. This may not be an appropriate representation of the situation, because many social groups coexist inside a single organisation. This research explores inter-group differences regarding social capital and how and why they may explain intraorganisational differences in innovation capabilities and innovation readiness. To this end we conduct an in-depth case study within a small industrial company, where we find three groups of employees who are distinct in (1) the network configuration of the structural dimension of social capital, (2) the presence of shared narratives and goals, and (3) the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> trust and <b>identification</b> <b>towards</b> the organisation. For each group we are able to track the reasons for these differences in terms of the drivers of social capital (stability, closure, interaction and interdependence). Finally, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> innovation readiness and innovation capability at the group level is analysed and explained in terms <b>of</b> differences in <b>levels</b> and drivers <b>of</b> social capital. We find that higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> social capital are associated with increased innovative capability, and we contribute to understanding the nature of this connection, which can be used for capability developmen...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} amount of growth in soccer game attendance and media coverage since the Premier Soccer League (PSL) in South Africa was established in 1996. However, match attendance started to decline from the 2013 season. PSL teams need to do something to get the fans back into the stadiums. A stable fan base is of vital importance for a team’s competitive advantage since the growing commercialisation of sport. The South African PSL is no exception and teams need to comprehend the importance of loyal fans. Team identification is linked to higher game attendance and more fans that are loyal and, therefore, it is relevant to the PSL teams. Higher game attendance will increase the teams’ revenues through ticket sales. Highly identified fans are loyal fans and increase the likelihood of better sponsorship deals for a team. Higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> team <b>identification</b> with a team could be obtained through a unique brand personality. Brand personality is necessary for sport team managers in order to understand fans’ perception regarding a team brand. As such, managers will be able to better position the teams’ brand and reach the target market accordingly. In South Africa, members of the Generation Y cohort made up 38 percent of the country’s population in 2014 (Statistics South Africa, 2014 : 9), which in terms of its size, make this cohort a highly relevant market segment. Generation Y, specifically African Generation Y, represents an important current and future market segment for PSL teams. This study focuses on the student segment of the Generation Y cohort. Given that a tertiary qualification generally is associated with a higher future earning capacity and a greater role model status within a society, university students are likely to be of particular interest to marketers. The main {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the influence of African Generation Y students’ perceived brand personality of South African PSL teams on their PSL team identification. The study used an adapted version <b>of</b> a team <b>identification</b> scale (Swanson et al., 2003) and sport brand personality scale (Braunstein & Ross, 2010) to measure the perceptions. The sampling frame for the study comprised the 26 public registered higher education institutions (HEIs) situated in South Africa. The study used one traditional university and one university of technology located in the Gauteng province. A non-probability convenience sample of 450 full time African Generation Y students was taken from the two HEIs. Of the questionnaires completed, 438 were usable. The statistical analysis of the collected data included exploratory factor analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis and independent sample t-tests. The findings suggested that Generation Y students exhibit a positive <b>level</b> <b>of</b> team <b>identification</b> <b>towards</b> their favourite team. Generation Y students perceived their favourite PSL team more hard working, confident, respected, skilled and successful. The results also suggest that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> team <b>identification</b> with the PSL teams could be predicted by two dimensions (successfulness and ruggedness) of brand personality. Generation Y male and female students only differ regarding the perception of two of the brand personality dimensions (successfulness and sophistication). The findings of this study contribute to the limited literature available concerning the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> team <b>identification</b> and brand personality perceptions of sport teams in the South African context. The study shed light specifically on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> team <b>identification</b> and brand personality perceptions of Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs. These were the top two teams identified by the respondents. These findings will assist these PSL teams to understand the brand personality perceptions of the team amongst African Generation Y fans better. The study also indicates some relationship between brand personality and team identification. The results suggest teams can use their brand personality to influence team identification amongst fans positively. These results can be used to assess and alter their current marketing strategies.

40|$|AbstractGoals, events, {{and actions}} can be mentally {{represented}} within a hierarchical framework {{that ranges from}} more abstract to more concrete <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> A more abstract <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> involves general, superordinate, and decontextualized mental representations that convey the meaning of goals, events, and actions, “why” an action is performed, and its purpose, ends, and consequences. A more concrete <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> involves specific and subordinate mental representations that include contextual details of goals, events, and actions, and the specific “how” details of an action. This review considers three lines of evidence for considering that dysregulation <b>of</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> goal/action <b>identification</b> may be a transdiagnostic process. First, {{there is evidence that}} different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> have distinct functional consequences and that in non-clinical samples <b>level</b> <b>of</b> goal/action <b>identification</b> appears to be regulated in a flexible and adaptive way to match the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> goal/action <b>identification</b> to circumstances. Second, there is evidence that <b>level</b> <b>of</b> goal/action <b>identification</b> causally influences symptoms and processes involved in psychological disorders, including emotional response, repetitive thought, impulsivity, problem solving and procrastination.

40|$|International audienceCoral reefs {{around the}} world are facing {{increasing}} disturbance; however, the ability to monitor them is constrained by cost and experience factors. The Line Intercept Transect (LIT) method is usually used with an expert <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> (30 benthic categories and sometimes coral genera), but these are time-consuming, require a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> expertise and are therefore expensive. Over the last 20 years, surveys performed by non-specialist volunteers have provided data for increasing numbers of reefs, using simplified sampling methods and more basic <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> In between these extremes, new stakeholders (e. g. environmental assessment agencies, consultancy firms, marine nature reserves, etc.) requiring an intermediate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> expertise and resolution are now carrying out coral reef surveys. Across all levels, it is desirable to identify monitoring methods that optimize the data provided and the ease of implementation according to the users’ needs. In this study on surveys from Réunion Island collected between 2003 and 2013, we used multivariate analyses to compare four increasing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> using the LIT method. For each level, we studied the structure of the benthic community and its spatial (reef flat vs. outer slope) and temporal (before vs. after a cyclone) variation. The most basic <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> showed differences between the reef flat and outer slope, but did not show a significant effect of the cyclone on the benthic community. The two highest <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification,</b> both <b>of</b> which we rated ‘expert’, showed the highest differences in variation. The intermediate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> supplied the same information as the expert levels, but required less effort and was therefore less expensive. Next, we compared the LIT with the Point Intercept Transect (PIT) method. At a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> appropriate to the interval used, PIT supplied an almost equivalent <b>level</b> <b>of</b> information as LIT, while reducing the time spent underwater. Thus, when managing coastal areas or carrying out impact studies to monitor disturbance, it may be useful to (i) perform surveys with an intermediate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification,</b> and (ii) using PIT rather LIT...|$|R

Through an ethnography in a hospital unit where four professional groups operate jointly, we show how highly identified actors appraise the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the members of different professional groups {{on the basis of}} the observations of the extra-role behaviors that colleagues enact.

Moreover, our findings show that knowledge transfer between different professional groups can be interpreted as an unexplored type of organizational citizenship behavior. In fact, knowledge transfer implies the unrequired sharing of operational practices specific to a professional group with members of different professionals groups, which enables these latter to perform, in their turn, extra role behaviors to support the organization. More generally, our study suggests extensions to the model <b>of</b> organizational <b>identification.</b> It also contributes to research on knowledge transfer by highlighting how the processes <b>of</b> organizational <b>identification</b> can promote knowledge flows between heterogeneous groups...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the construction of}} a general theory for conditional models by making explicit the role of the exogenous randomness in the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> conditional models.

We display a hierarchy <b>of</b> four <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> in conditional models and show that the weakest level may entertain rather peculiar properties, in particular {{about the role of the}} sample size. Secondly, we look at identification as a necessary condition for the existence of an estimator with suitable properties.

While the collegiate licensing business {{is expected to}} increase financial resources for the participating universities and textiles and apparel companies, little is known as to why people buy university licensed merchandise. Recently university alumni have been recognized as a substantial source of financial support for university (McAlexander, Koenig, & Schouten, 2006). In order to fill a gap in the current literature on collegiate licensing, {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine key factors influencing university alumni's purchase decisions of university licensed merchandise. Using the theoretical framework of Social Identity Theory (Hogg, 2006) as well as the Theory of Reasoned Action (Fishbein, 1975), this study aimed to examine the relationships among <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> with a university, integration with brand community, attitude toward purchasing university licensed merchandise, subjective norm, fan loyalty, and purchase behavior of university licensed merchandise. Online survey methods were used to examine the university alumni's purchasing behavior of university licensed merchandise. Recruitment emails containing the survey information and the link to the survey were sent to approximately 3, 000 randomly selected Oregon State University alumni from the Alumni Association. A total of 189 university alumni of Oregon State University participated in the online survey. The results showed that <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> was positively related to brand community and also to attitude toward purchasing university licensed merchandise. Integration with brand community was positively related to subjective norm and attitude. Furthermore, brand community was a significant mediator of the relationship between <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> and attitude. As hypothesized, fan loyalty was positively correlated with attitude. Attitude and subjective norm were found to be significant predictors of purchase behavior. These findings provide empirical evidence to support the importance of understanding why university alumni purchase university licensed merchandise. <b>Level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> university alumni have towards the university they attended affected their integration into a brand community and their attitude toward purchasing university licensed merchandise. Integration into a brand community was also found to be a mediator between <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> and attitude. Results also showed that brand community has an effect on attitude and subjective norm. Purchase behavior was found to be influenced by attitude and subjective norm. Results showed that fan loyalty was influenced by subjective norm. Both retailers and those in charge of licensing at universities will benefit from this information. Understanding why university alumni purchase university licensed merchandise will help to target a market with a large amount of buying power, benefitting both the retailers and the universities financially.

This same 2 -way interaction within the negative feedback condition also predicted post-feedback <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> as a college student, though {{it did not seem}} to affect post-feedback <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> academic <b>identification.</b> Strongly-identified participants receiving negative feedback identified less as a college student if they were under stereotype threat while weakly-academically identified participants identified more. <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> post-feedback <b>identification</b> as a college student negatively predicted performance...|$|R
40|$|In this study, in-group {{stereotyping}} {{was examined}} {{as a function}} of variations in social context and perceiver factors. The social context consisted of different comparison groups and different domains of comparison. Comparison group and comparative domain were expected to interact in determining the content of the in-group stereotype. This prediction was confirmed with in-group stereotyping being strongest in conditions where the combination of comparison group and comparative domain made the in-group seem most similar to an out-group. The perceiver's <b>level</b> <b>of</b> in-group <b>identification</b> was also positively related to the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> in-group stereotyping. Moreover, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> was shown to be dependent on the immediate social context and mediated the relationship between social context and in-group stereotyping. This pattern is explained in terms of a search for in-group distinctiveness...|$|R
