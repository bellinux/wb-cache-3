50|$|Many {{species of}} Malvaceae sensu lato {{are known for}} their wood, with that of Ochroma (balsa) being known for its lightness, and that of Tilia (<b>lime,</b> <b>linden,</b> or basswood) as a popular wood for carving. Fruit of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) are used as an {{ingredient}} for chocolate. Kola nuts (genus Cola) are notable for their high content of caffeine, and in past were commonly used for preparing of various cola drinks. Other well-known members of Malvales in the APG II sense are daphnes, hibiscus, hollyhocks, okra, baobab trees, cotton, and kapok.|$|E
50|$|The lake {{banks are}} low and are flooded with raising water level. They are {{therefore}} swampy and {{are rich in}} reed, hosting ducks, geese and swans. The coastal region is covered with dense virgin forests. Major tree types are coniferous, but also common are <b>lime</b> (<b>linden),</b> elm and European Alder. Common mammals include elk, brown bear, wolf, fox, hare, squirrel, lynx, pine marten, European badger, as well as American muskrat and mink which {{were introduced to the}} area in the early 20th century. About 200 bird species from 15 families have been observed in the lake basin.|$|E

50|$|The title {{character}} Siegfried, son of King Siegmund of Xanten, masters {{the art of}} forging a sword at the shop of Mime. Siegfried hears the tales {{of the kingdom of}} Burgundy, the kings who rule there, as well as of Kriemhild, the princess of Burgundy. Siegfried announces he wants to win her hand in marriage, much to the amusement of the smiths. Siegfried demands to be told the way. Mime, who is envious of Siegfried's skill as a swordsmith, claims there is a shortcut to Burgundy through the Wood of Woden, wherein dwell all kinds of dangerous creatures. Siegfried encounters a dragon, and deviates from his path to slay it. He touches its hot, yellow blood and suddenly understands the language of the birds, who instruct him to bathe in the dragon's blood in order to become invincible — except for one spot on his shoulder blade, covered by a falling <b>lime</b> (<b>linden)</b> leaf.|$|E
40|$|Many {{species of}} plants produce leaves with {{distinct}} teeth around their margins. The presence and nature of these teeth can often help botanists to identify species. Moreover, {{it has long been}} known that more species native to colder regions have teeth than species native to warmer regions. It has therefore been suggested that fossilized remains of leaves {{can be used as a}} proxy for ancient climate reconstruction. Similar studies on living plants can help our understanding of the relationships. The required analysis of leaves typically involves considerable manual effort, which in practice limits the number of leaves that are analyzed, potentially reducing the power of the results. In this work, we describe a novel algorithm to automate the marginal tooth analysis of leaves found in digital images. We demonstrate our methods on a large set of images of whole herbarium specimens collected from Tilia trees (also known as <b>lime,</b> <b>linden</b> or basswood). We chose the genus Tilia as its constituent species have toothed leaves of varied size and shape. In a previous study we extracted [Formula: see text] leaves automatically from a set of [Formula: see text] images. Our new algorithm locates teeth on the margins of such leaves and extracts features such as each tooth's area, perimeter and internal angles, as well as counting them. We evaluate an implementation of our algorithm's performance against a manually analyzed subset of the images. We found that the algorithm achieves an accuracy of 85 % for counting teeth and 75 % for estimating tooth area. We also demonstrate that the automatically extracted features are sufficient to identify different species of Tilia using a simple linear discriminant analysis, and that the features relating to teeth are the most useful...|$|E

In the south of its range it is restricted to high elevations.|$|R
50|$|A natural {{phenomenon}} occurring in Molde and the adjacent district, are frequent winter days with temperatures above 10 C, sometimes even above 15 C. This {{is due to}} foehn wind from south and south-east. Combined with a steady influx of warm, moist south-westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean, warmed by the North Atlantic Current, it gives Molde a climate much warmer than its latitude would indicate. The sheltered location of the city, facing south with hills to the north, mountains {{to the east and}} mountainous islands to the west, contributes to Molde's climate and unusually rich plant life, especially among species naturally growing on far lower latitudes, like maple, chestnut, oak, tilia (<b>lime</b> or <b>linden),</b> beech, yew, and others.|$|R
50|$|The {{arms were}} {{approved}} by the Interior Ministry in Mainz in 1959. The <b>lime</b> tree, or <b>linden</b> (Linde in German) is a canting charge for the municipality’s name, Lindenberg. The wall represents the long-vanished castle, and the inescutcheon in the tree represents the castle’s owners, the Lords of Hirschhorn (whose name meant “hart’s horn”, thus making the antler yet another canting charge). Saint Cyriacus recalls the chapel near the castle.|$|R
50|$|The church, a {{striking}} building with three towers, {{is a local}} landmark. The bend sinister wavy azure (that is, the slanted wavy stripe) is a canting charge meant {{to refer to the}} placename ending —bach, German for “brook” (Boden—, on the other hand, means “ground” or “bottom” - it is cognate with the latter - but there is no charge suggesting this part of the name). The spokes in the wheel, shaped like limetree leaves, stand for a very old <b>lime</b> (or <b>linden)</b> at the church, planted to commemorate the wars of liberation in 1813. The wheel itself refers to the municipality’s rural structure, while its tincture, vert (that is, green), stands for the wealth of woodland that the municipality has.|$|R
5000|$|Bast fibre (also called phloem fibre or skin fibre) is plant fibre {{collected}} from the phloem (the [...] "inner bark", sometimes called [...] "skin") or bast surrounding the stem of certain dicotyledonous plants. They support the conductive cells of the phloem and provide strength to the stem. Some of the economically important bast fibres are obtained from herbs cultivated in agriculture, as for instance flax, hemp, or ramie, but also bast fibres from wild plants, as stinging nettle, and trees such as <b>lime</b> or <b>linden,</b> wisteria, and mulberry {{have been used in}} the past. Bast fibres are classified as soft fibres, and are flexible. Fibres from monocotyledonous plants, called [...] "leaf fibre", are classified as hard fibres and are stiff.|$|R
5000|$|Plant {{surnames}} {{are found}} in other languages. For example, in Sweden, where [...] "Lind" [...] means the <b>Lime</b> or <b>Linden</b> tree, the 100 most common surnames in 2015 included at 17 Lindberg (Lime-hill), at 21 Lindström (Lime-stream), at 22 Lindqvist (Lime-twig), at 23 Lindgren (Lime-branch), and at 99 Lindholm (Lime-island). Other tree names in the top 100 were 46 Björk (Birch), 56 Löfgren (Leaf-branch), 66 Björklund (Birchwood), 77 Ekström (Oak-stream), 79 Hedlund (Heathwood) and 87 Ek (Oak). Many of these names are toponymic; however, suffixes like -gren and -qvist are often metaphorical, meaning an offshoot of a family. From around 1686, Swedish soldiers started to adopt military surnames; short monosyllabic tree-names like Al (Alder), Alm (Elm) and Ek (Oak) were popular.|$|R
40|$|Street tree {{alignments}} {{are among}} the most common green spaces within urban areas. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the interspecific variability and the degree of defoliation of the trees within street alignments situated along four of the most common boulevards from Bucharest, namely Kiseleff, Ştefan cel Mare, Virtuţii and Timişoara. The total evaluated distance was 17. 6 km. 1621 trees were sampled and more than 30 taxa were recorded. Autochthonous species were more numerous, compared with the allochthonous ones, but the non-indigenous trees were better represented, mainly due to the large number of London plane tree, northern red oak and horse-chestnut. The most common autochthonous species were smallleaved <b>lime,</b> silver <b>linden</b> and narrow-leafed ash. Half of the species were large, reaching heights up to 25 m or more. All four boulevards were dominated by three species. Almost 80...|$|R

Primarily, people have named their children in his honor; Linnaeus and Linné have been used as given names, usually for boys, and simple modification makes the name gender female. Secondarily, people have named their children after the twinflower Linnaea; which was itself named to honor Linnaeus. Linnaeus' family name in turn is derived from the Swedish word [...] "Lind", the <b>linden</b> (<b>lime</b> tree).|$|R
60|$|Still {{higher in}} the {{evolutionary}} scale than the elastic fruits are those airy species which have taken to themselves wings like the eagle, and soar forth upon the free breeze in search of what the Americans describe as 'fresh locations.' Of this class the simplest type {{may be seen in}} those forest-trees, like the maple and the sycamore, whose fruits are flattened out into long expansions or parachutes, technically known as 'keys,' by whose aid they flutter down obliquely to the ground at a considerable distance. The keys of the sycamore, to take a single instance, when detached from the tree in autumn, fall spirally through the air owing to the twist of the winged arm, and are carried so far that, as every gardener knows, young sycamore trees rank among the commonest weeds among our plots and flower-beds. A curious variant upon this type is presented by the <b>lime,</b> or <b>linden,</b> whose fruits are in themselves small wingless nuts; but they are born in clusters upon a common stalk, which is winged on either side by a large membranous bract. When the nuts are ripe, the whole cluster detaches itself in a body from the branch, and flutters away before the breeze by means of the common parachute, to some spot a hundred yards or more, where the wind chances to land it.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} honey is mainly {{determined}} by its sensorial, chemical, physical and microbiological properties. The {{purpose of this}} research was to evaluate microbiological properties of 72 honey samples and to determine the number and/or presence of aerobic mesophilic and spore-forming bacteria, moulds, yeasts, sulphite-reducing clostridia, bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family and Staphylococcus aureus. Microbiological quality of tested samples was considered good and pathogenic bacteria were not present. Inhibitory potential of selected honey samples was also investigated. Among tested honey concentrations (0. 1 %, 5 %, 10 %, 25 %, 50 % and 75 %), the final concentration of 75 % had the highest potential. Honeydew and chestnut honey exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect against tested bacterial species, while the lowest inhibition was exhibited by <b>linden</b> (<b>lime</b> tree) honey. Comparing the samples of the same honey type, considerably different inhibitory activity can be detected. Overall, the most sensitive bacterium to the inhibitory effect of tested honey samples was S. aureus, while the most resistant one was Enterococcus faecalis...|$|R
6000|$|As we {{proceeded}} {{on our way}} in the afternoon, {{the western}} bank became lower, or receded farther from the channel in some places, leaving a few trees only to fringe the water's edge; while the eastern rose abruptly here and there into wooded hills fifty or sixty feet high. The bass, Tilia Americana, also called the <b>lime</b> or <b>linden,</b> which was a new tree to us, overhung the water with its broad and rounded leaf, interspersed with clusters of small hard berries now nearly ripe, and made an agreeable shade for us sailors. The inner bark of this genus is the bast, the material of the fisherman's matting, and the ropes and peasant's shoes of which the Russians make so much use, and also of nets and a coarse cloth in some places. According to poets, this was once Philyra, one of the Oceanides. The ancients {{are said to have}} used its bark for the roofs of cottages, for baskets, and for a kind of paper called Philyra. They also made bucklers of its wood, [...] "on account of its flexibility, lightness, and resiliency." [...] It was once much used for carving, and is still in demand for sounding-boards of piano-fortes and panels of carriages, and for various uses for which toughness and flexibility are required. Baskets and cradles are made of the twigs. Its sap affords sugar, and the honey made from its flowers is said to be preferred to any other. Its leaves are in some countries given to cattle, a kind of chocolate has been made of its fruit, a medicine has been prepared from an infusion of its flowers, and finally, the charcoal made of its wood is greatly valued for gunpowder.|$|R
40|$|Tea is {{the most}} {{important}} non-alcoholic beverage in the world being appreciated for its stimulant properties and health benefits. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the content in caffeine, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, as well as the antioxidant activity of five different herbal infusion samples in oder to compare the amount of these bioactive compounds from traditional Romanian medicinal plants and Chinese tea plants. Green tea, black tea, <b>linden</b> (<b>lime</b> tea), mint, and St. John's wort were chosen as materials for the preparation of infusion and laboratory analyses. The caffeine was extracted with dichloromethane and then was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the extract at 260 nm. The quantification of total phenolic compounds was achieved by Folin-Ciocalteu method, while the flavonoid content was determined using a chromogenic system of NaNO 2 -(Al(NO 3) 3 -NaOH based on spectrophotometric method. The antioxidant capacity of each tea sample was assessed by evaluating their radical scavenging  activity on DPPH radical. The largest content in antioxidant compounds was found in green, but also in the mint infusion sample, while black tea has registered the highest caffeine content. Following the results obtained it can be stated that all the analysed samples contain remarkable amounts of biologically active compounds essential for the human body healt...|$|R
