50|$|CO-MIMO, {{also known}} as network MIMO (net-MIMO), or ad hoc MIMO, uses {{distributed}} antennas which belong to other users, while conventional MIMO, i.e., single-user MIMO, only employs antennas belonging to the <b>local</b> <b>terminal.</b> CO-MIMO improves {{the performance of a}} wireless network by introducing multiple antenna advantages, such as diversity, multiplexing and beamforming. If the main interest hinges on the diversity gain, it is known as cooperative diversity. It can be described as a form of macro-diversity, used for example in soft handover. Cooperative MIMO corresponds to transmitter macro-diversity or simulcasting. A simple form that does not require any advanced signal processing is single frequency networks (SFN), used especially in wireless broadcasting. SFNs combined with channel adaptive or traffic adaptive scheduling is called dynamic single frequency networks (DSFN).|$|E
50|$|The {{remote console}} {{features}} of the DRAC allow an administrator to interface with the computer as if {{sitting in front of}} it, and one can share the local inputs from keyboard and mouse as well as video output (DRAC does not support remote sound). Remote-console capability relies on either an Active X or Java plug-in, or HTML5 in the later models, which displays a window showing the video output on the <b>local</b> <b>terminal</b> and which takes mouse and keyboard input. This behavior closely resembles that of other remote access solutions such as VNC or RDP but also works if the operating system of the server doesn't work any more (unlike VNC or RDP). It is used to take the server console remotely.|$|E

This paper presents a research work aim to implement a simple, customize and portable emergency medical care for the FECG monitoring system from remote location. After acquisitions of the abdominal wall fetal electrocardiography (AFECG) signal from the pregnant mother (patient), the <b>local</b> <b>terminal</b> then transfers this AFECG signal as data to the remote terminal at the expert physician for diagnosis purpose. At the remote terminal, the FECG signals are then extracted from the AFECG signals by our developed software. In this case, computer network establishes {{a bridge between the}} patient and a distant expert physician. The network program developed based on the client/server applications. The developed network program is capable to support both the AFECG data transfer and online chat session simultaneously.
