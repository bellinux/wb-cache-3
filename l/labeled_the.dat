5|$|Despite Riggs' publication, Henry Fairfield Osborn, who was {{a strong}} {{opponent}} of Marsh and his taxa, <b>labeled</b> <b>the</b> Apatosaurus mount of the American Museum of Natural History Brontosaurus. Because of this decision the name Brontosaurus was commonly used outside of scientific literature for what Riggs considered Apatosaurus, and the museum's popularity meant that Brontosaurus {{became one of the}} best known dinosaurs, even though it was invalid throughout nearly all of the 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E

Halo 2 sold 2.4million copies making US$125 million in the first 24hours after its release beating the record for highest grossing entertainment release. Halo 3 grossed US$170million on its first day, $45million more than its predecessor. Halo 2 and Halo 3 are also the best selling titles of their respective consoles, the Xbox and the Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|Until 2008, signs at exit43A in {{downtown}} Cumberland <b>labeled</b> <b>the</b> exit as {{providing access to}} WV28 Alt. Because of this, many truckers used this exit to get to WV28. This created problems on WV28 Alt. in Ridgeley, West Virginia, as trucks became stuck under a low railroad overpass, blocking traffic through Ridgeley. To reduce this problem, the Maryland State Highway Administration removed references to WV28 Alt. from guide signs for exit43A and placed warning signs in Cumberland and on I-68 approaching Cumberland advising truckers to instead use exit43B to MD51, which allows them to connect to WV28 via Virginia Avenue, bypassing the low overpass in Ridgeley.|$|E

The decision to have Mr. Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production of the first season had begun. The original map of the show's setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives as part of his pitch to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house, and instead <b>labeled</b> <b>the</b> Krusty Krab as both characters' residence.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, the Yankees' 27 World Series {{championship}}s are 16 {{more than}} the number won by the St. Louis Cardinals, who have the second-most titles among MLB teams.

The 40 AL titles won by the Yankees places them 17 {{in front of the}} Cardinals for the most pennants won by an MLB team. The Giants and Dodgers are the only other clubs with 20 or more pennants. The Baseball Hall of Fame has inducted over 40 players and managers who have worn Yankees pinstripes.

He became established in Dallas and was <b>labeled</b> <b>the</b> richest man in the nation in 1948 by Fortune Magazine. A scandal emerged in 1975, after his death, when it was discovered that he had had a hidden bigamous relationship, with his second wife living in New York.|$|E

5|$|On 31 August 1957, the British {{territory}} of Malaya received {{its independence from}} the Crown {{as a part of}} Britain's colonial withdrawal from the Far East, after nearly a decade of tortuous counter-insurgency warfare by British and Commonwealth troops against Malayan rebels in the Malayan Emergency. British plans dictated that the new state would be federated with the British colonies of Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei in northern Borneo in order to better protect British military and economic interests in those regions. Brunei did not join, but Sarawak, Sabah, and Singapore had all agreed to join the new Federation by 1963. This project, <b>labeled</b> <b>the</b> 'Grand Design' by politician Malcolm MacDonald in the 1950s, became the cornerstone of British strategic thinking concerning Southeast Asia, and led to the initial federation of the numerous Malayan states in spite of their multifarious differences, with Singapore and the Borneo states to join later. This plan also earned the support of the Malaysian government, which hoped to forestall claims from Indonesia on Borneo.|$|E
5|$|The {{identified}} seven ecotypes inhabit isolated ecological niches. Of three orca ecotypes in the Antarctic, one preys on minke whales, {{the second}} on seals and penguins {{and the third}} on fish. Another ecotype lives in the eastern North Atlantic, while the three Northeast Pacific ecotypes are <b>labeled</b> <b>the</b> transient, resident and offshore populations, as discussed above. The research supported a proposal to reclassify the Antarctic seal- and fish-eating populations and the North Pacific transients as a distinct species, leaving the remaining ecotypes as subspecies. The first split in the orca population, between the North Pacific transients and the rest, occurred an estimated 700,000 years ago. Such a designation would mean that each new species becomes subject to separate conservation assessments.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads that}} have carried US12 in Michigan {{have been given}} a number of {{memorial}} highway names. In 1922, after the publication of Main Street by Sinclair Lewis that street name took on a pejorative connotation. The newspaper in Jackson advocated that the main road from Detroit to Chicago which formed the main street through many communities in southern Michigan should be given a new name. It was already <b>labeled</b> <b>the</b> Michigan–Detroit–Chicago Highway on travel maps of the time, so the paper suggested that the roadway should be renamed to create the longest street in the country. Both Chicago and Detroit had streets named Michigan Avenue, so that is what the newspaper suggested for a new name. Albion was the first community to change the name of its street followed by Jackson and Marshall in 1924, Battle Creek in 1928 and Kalamazoo in 1929.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} limited debate on {{the place of the}} Holocaust in Lithuanian {{national}} memory; historically Lithuanians have denied national participation in the Holocaust or <b>labeled</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian participants in genocide as fringe extreme elements. The memories of that time and the discussion of those events in Jewish and Lithuanian historiographies are quite different, although Lithuanian historiography {{in the past two decades}} has improved, compared to the Soviet historiography, with the works of scholars such as Alfonsas Eidintas, Valentinas Brandišauskas and Arūnas Bubnys, among others, being positively reviewed by the Western and Jewish historians. The issue remains controversial to this day. According to Lithuanian historians, the contentious issues involve the role of the Lithuanian Activist Front, the Lithuanian Provisional Government and participation of Lithuanian civilians and volunteers in the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|Under Knight Ridder, The Inquirer {{continued}} to be editorially independent. However, conservative commentators have <b>labeled</b> <b>The</b> Inquirer left leaning, and the paper has not endorsed a Republican candidate for President of the United States since Gerald Ford in 1976. Throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, groups supportive of Israel such as the Zionist Organization of America often accused The Inquirer of being anti-Israel. At the same time, Edward S. Herman, a University of Pennsylvania media analyst, has written many articles accusing The Inquirer of having given in to conservative pressure and including a conservative slant in the paper's reporting and editorial page. In 2006, The Inquirer {{became one of the}} only major United States newspapers to print one of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons. Afterwards, protesting the printing of the cartoon, Muslims picketed outside The Inquirer Building.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into ten subject-related chapters. The first chapter {{provides}} an introduction to how Stursberg entered the CBC scene, how he viewed his role replacing the retiring Harold Redekopp as the executive {{vice president in charge}} of English services, and previews what challenges he would encounter. The second chapter covers his experience entering CBC senior management amid contract negotiations with its union, the resulting lock out during summer 2005, and the relations between what he <b>labeled</b> <b>the</b> Gang of Four (senior management) and the Central Committee (union representatives). In the third chapter, Entertainment, he explains his plan for re-orienting CBC television towards entertainment which would use audience numbers to gauge success. He cancelled critically acclaimed shows (Da Vinci's City Hall, This Is Wonderland, and Opening Night) which had low ratings and ordered what he expected would be more audience-friendly shows. Beginning in summer 2006, the first new show under Stursberg's strategy, , received very low ratings and was quickly cancelled. That Autumn's schedule, though, was successful, introducing Little Mosque on the Prairie, The Tudors, Heartland. The nest year's schedule introduced the successful The Border and Being Erica but also the unsuccessful MVP and jPod. Strusberg's move of Marketplace to Friday nights resulted in higher ratings but his plan to move The National to 11pm was denied by the CBC board of directors. In the fourth chapter, The French, he details his relationship with his French counterpart, the style differences between English and French television shows, the disproportionate funding given to the French services, and the lack of CBC Board members who can understand French. As a means of trying to bridge the two cultures, he ordered English versions of the popular Quebec shows Rumours and Sophie but both received low ratings in English Canada.|$|E
