40|$|Is {{marital status}} a disappearing issue? Reading {{demographic}} literature one may {{get the impression}} that information on marital status no longer helps to explain demographic phenomena, at least in industrialized countries. The argument is that <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> differs strongly from actual living arrangements for, as an example, an increasing number of people prefer to live in a consensual union instead of getting married. The aim of this research is to answer the question whether it is still useful to analyze the populations past and possible future marital status composition. We cannot refuse to believe in the continued increase of non-traditional living arrangements that are a consequence of changing values and attitudes. This, however, does not mean that <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> analysis has become obsolete. Analysis for different industrialized countries even demonstrates the opposite. In the recent past, that is the period 1960 - 1985, changes in the marital composition became increasingly important for explaining various demographic processes. Fertility changes were more and more due to the increase in the proportion of non-married people. Similarly, household changes could more and more be attributed to changes in the marital structure of the population. Both are demonstrated by decomposition analysis. Furthermore, using marital status information for population projections results in significant differences already in the short run. Consequently, when analyzing demographic changes or projecting populations and households, demographers should even now regard <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> as one of their main input variables...|$|E
40|$|Does single {{motherhood}} {{adversely affect}} infant health? This {{question is not}} easy to answer because of the endogeneity of coresidence during pregnancy. In this paper, we exploit quasi-natural variation in single motherhood from the moment of conception to that of birth arising from marriageable age restrictions and the reform of the laws in Korea. The Korean birth certificate dataset is unique in that it allows us to distinguish coresidence and <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> and further to identify the duration of pregnancy period without a partner. Results show that although coresidence with the partner during pregnancy is seemingly beneficial for infant health, it is mostly driven by selection into coresidence. Further, we do not find any significant advantage of legal marriage among young mothers...|$|E

At Lyon's municipally-funded poor hospital, the Hotel-Dieu, widows and wives of surgeons, repentant prostitutes, birth attendants, and. women» cared for the destitute and sick of Lyon, in the capacity of midwives, physicians, surgeons, and barbers. Though the records almost always identify women practitioners simply as «women» or by their first and last name, many of them engaged in the identical tasks as male practitioners.

40|$|Demographers {{have been}} slow to {{reassess}} the value of the traditional concept of marital status. Until the beginning of the 1960 s, a person's living arrangement could be predicted reasonably well by looking at the individual's <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status.</b> During the 1980 s, the situation altered dramatically. We know that unmarried couples have always existed; however, in the past they were so rare that little importance was attached to this living arrangement. It was also difficult to study the phenomenon because cohabitation was not yet a generally accepted lifestyle. That is no longer the case. Today, in many European countries many couples live together before marriage, and {{a significant portion of the}} adult population chooses cohabitation instead of marriage. It is therefore no longer possible not to consider consensual unions when studying marital-status or living arrangement structures. The book provides an authoritative and up-to-date review and interpretation of the development of the cohabitation phenomenon across Europe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether health inequalities exist between lone and cohabiting mothers across Europe, {{and how these}} may differ by welfare regime. Data from the European Social Survey are used to compare self-rated general health, limiting longstanding illness and depressive feelings {{by means of a}} multi-level logistic regression. The 27 countries included in the analyses are classified into six welfare regimes (Anglo-Saxon, Bismarckian, Southern, Nordic, Central-Eastern new-EU and Central-Eastern non-EU). Lone motherhood is defined as mothers not cohabiting with a partner, regardless of the <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status.</b> Results indicate that lone mothers are more at risk of poor health than cohabiting mothers. This is most pronounced in the Anglo-Saxon regime for self-rated general health and limiting longstanding illness, while for depressive feelings it is most pronounced in the Bismarckian welfare regime. While the risk difference is smallest in the Central-Eastern regime, both lone and cohabiting mothers also reported the highest levels of poor health compared to the other regimes. Results also show that a vulnerable socioeconomic position is associated with ill-health in lone mothers, and that welfare regimes differ in the degree that they moderate this association...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examines}} stereotypes of and emotional reactions to singles by choice and singles not by choice. Participants (N = 480) read a scenario describing persons, who were either single by choice or single not by choice and rated {{their thoughts and}} feelings about these persons. Singles by choice are perceived as more lonely and miserable, and as less warm and sociable, than singles not by choice. However, they are perceived as more successful and potent. Anger and sympathy mediate the relations between choosing singlehood and stereotyping levels. These findings extend {{the way in which}} the Attribution Theory explains activation of stereotypes. In recent years, researchers have increasingly used the term " socially single ", which suggests that what matters most in everyday life is whether a person is in a significant romantic relationship or not, regardless of his or her <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> (DePaulo & Morris, 2006). The goal of our study was to examine whether " socially single " people are perceived differently than coupled people, and to determine whether a choice to remain single affected the intensity of stereotypes. In addition, we examined whether the emotions experienced regarding people who are single by choice and people who are single not by choice mediate the activation of stereotypes...|$|E

40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} century, Population and Development Review (PDR) {{published}} an article with the visionary title Demographic dimensions in forecasting: adding education to age and sex (Lutz et al. 1999). In this contribution the authors (W. Lutz, A. Goujon and G. Doblhammer-Reiter) systematically discuss the criteria governing the choice of particular dimensions (i. e. covariates, breakdowns or sources of heterogeneity) that should be explicitly and routinely addressed in demographic analysis. The three criteria were: (1) To the users the dimension is interesting in its own right and therefore desirable as an explicit output parameter; (2) The dimension is a relevant source of demographic heterogeneity with an impact on the dynamics of the whole system and therefore on the resulting population size; and (3) It is feasible (in terms of data and methodology) to consider the dimensions explicitly (Lutz et al. 1999 : 42). Each criterion is then applied to a series of candidates: age, sex, <b>legal</b> <b>marital</b> <b>status,</b> place of residence, educational attainment, ethnicity, region of origin and others. While many of these dimensions seem to be of great substantive importance for specific research questions, only three are seen to meet all three criteria and are hence considered candidates for standard demographic analysis. Not surprisingly, age and sex are among them, while the third recommended standard dimension is the level of educational attainment [...] ...|$|E

However, <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> is a social construct, whereas union status is the residential one, and although marriage is universal, it is different in differ-ent places and at different times. Using fairly recent census data from nine countries around the world, the authors examined how well <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> helps indicate union status.

40|$|There {{were three}} {{purposes}} of this study. The first was to describe the association between stable <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> and serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and cigarette smoking. The second purpose {{was to determine whether}} individuals who were married at one point and became widowed or divorced/separated had higher serum cholesterol, higher systolic blood pressure or were more likely to smoke prior to the change in <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> compared with individuals who did not change <b>marital</b> <b>status.</b> The third purpose was to determine whether the changes in <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> described above were related to increases in serum cholesterol or in cigarette smoking behavior. The rationale for the study was to determine whether previously reported associations between <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> categories and cardiovascular mortality may be mediated through higher values of risk correlates for cardiovascular disease among unmarried individuals. ^ The study group selected for this dissertation was a sample from the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP) population. The HDFP population was aged 30 - 69 years at the initial visit and included blacks and whites, males and females. The population was followed five years after the initial visit and periodic measurements of serum cholesterol, blood pressure and cigarette smoking behavior were obtained. ^ Serum cholesterol was not associated with stable <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> category or with <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> prior to change. Changes in serum cholesterol were associated with <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> categories after change but the serum cholesterol values deceased rather than increased. Married individuals were shown to have higher serum cholesterol values compared with unmarried. Selection of the HDFP population may have influenced an ability to detect a significant association between <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> and serum cholesterol but it is doubtful that use of a general population would alter the direction of the association. ^ Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher at the initial visit among unmarried white males and females compared with their married counterparts. No association between systolic blood pressure was found among black males or females. Those individuals who were married at the initial visit who experienced a change in <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> were found to have higher systolic blood pressure prior to the change in <b>marital</b> <b>status....</b> (Author 2 ̆ 7 s abstract exceeds stipulated maximum length.

40|$|The {{proposition}} that persons are selected {{into and out}} of marriage {{on the basis of their}} health or disability status has often been advanced, but remains untested. This article (1) presents a theoretical rationale for the proposition; (2) provides an initial test of that proposition by comparing the <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> of a sample of persons with spinal cord injury with the <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> of the general public; and (3) elaborates on the proposition by examining the extent to which other factors account for differences in <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> among members of this disabled group. The selected factors were sex, severity of disability (indicated by need for assistance, perceived health, and extent of paralysis), socio-economic status (indicated by adequacy of income and welfare status), current age, and age at onset of disability. A secondary analysis of existing survey data on 251 Oregon residents with spinal cord injury (182 males, 69 females) yielded the following results. (1) The marital selection proposition was supported in that the <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> of this sample differed markedly from that of the general population. (2) The disability exerted a greater effect on the <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> of females than of males. (3) All the selected variables were significantly associated with <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> for one or for both sexes. Discriminant function analyses, employing these variables, identified correctly the <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> of 67. 6 % of the males, and 75. 4 % of the females.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{to what extent}} the often found association between <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> and self-assessed health is influenced by the marital composition of the country people live in. Four hypotheses explaining why the national <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> composition may be influential are derived and tested. Whereas earlier research in this field solely focused on divorce rates, this study includes six different indicators of the national <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> composition to provide a comprehensive test of our expectations. We employ data on 29 European countries (European Social Survey 2002, 2004, and 2006, N= 97, 797). Multilevel regression analyses demonstrate that both the strength of the relationship between <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> and health, and which unmarried group is most disadvantaged, vary across European countries. Living in a country with a high proportion of married people appears to be beneficial to the health of never married persons, but detrimental for widowed people. Additionally, our findings contradict the argument that divorced, widowed, and never married persons may be best off when living in countries with high proportions of {{people who are in the}} same situation. Finally, our results show that the never married are worst off in countries with a high proportion of cohabitants. This may reflect stronger health selectivity into cohabitation in countries where cohabitation is more common. We conclude that the ways through which the <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> composition influences the association between <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> and health appear to be complex and highly dependent on the exact <b>marital</b> <b>status</b> groups that are examined...|$|R
