5|$|Nora took {{an unusual}} path, making {{landfall}} twice as a hurricane in Baja California. Weakening quickly after landfall, its remnants <b>lashed</b> the Southwestern United States with tropical-storm-force winds, torrential rain and flooding. The storm was blamed for two direct casualties in Mexico, {{as well as}} substantial beach erosion on the Mexican coast, flash flooding in Baja California, and record precipitation in Arizona. It persisted far inland and eventually dissipated near the Arizona–Nevada border.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the Florida Straits, the hurricane {{turned to the}} northeast, producing tropical storm winds along the Florida Keys. High rainfall caused flooding, while three tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged houses in the Miami area. The hurricane reached peak winds of 125mph (205km/h) on October6 while moving through the Bahamas. It subsequently weakened and became extratropical on October8. The former hurricane <b>lashed</b> the coast of Nova Scotia with high winds and rain, leaving about $1million (1933CAD) in damage. Rough seas sank several ships and killed nine people in the region.

After this, a disappointed Kumar asked Kapoor to re-arrange the film's marketing schedule.|$|E

5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over the deck of the British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, <b>lashed</b> the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1140, Nigel, the Bishop of Ely, whose castles Stephen had confiscated the {{previous}} year, rebelled against Stephen as well. Nigel hoped to seize East Anglia and established his base of operations in the Isle of Ely, then surrounded by protective fenland. Stephen responded quickly, taking an army into the fens and using boats <b>lashed</b> {{together to form a}} causeway that allowed him to make a surprise attack on the isle. Nigel escaped to Gloucester, but his men and castle were captured, and order was temporarily restored in the east. Robert of Gloucester's men retook some of the territory that Stephen had taken in his 1139 campaign. In an effort to negotiate a truce, Henry of Blois held a peace conference at Bath, to which Stephen sent his wife. The conference collapsed over the insistence by Henry and the clergy that they should set the terms of any peace deal, which Stephen found unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Director Jewison can put {{his cards}} on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid also has a less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates <b>lashed</b> together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E

5000|$|Semi-permanent <b>lashes,</b> {{also known}} as {{individual}} eyelash extensions, are eyelashes applied with an adhesive which is usually cyanoacrylate. There are different types of cyanoacrylates including ethyl, methyl, butyl, and octyl, which are designed for bonding to different surfaces. <b>Lash</b> adhesives are made from methyl-2-cyanoacrylate {{which is designed to}} bond a smooth surface (the eyelash extension) to a porous surface (the natural eyelash). it is designed to be used around the eyes and on the natural <b>lashes,</b> but not on the skin as it may cause irritation.Eyelash extensions are waterproof and give the appearance of having mascara on without the messy clumps and smudging of makeup. Generally, a single <b>lash</b> is applied to each natural <b>lash.</b> When applied properly, neither the extension <b>lash</b> nor the glue should touch the eyelid. The bond is designed to last until the <b>lashes</b> naturally fall out, usually around 3-4 weeks new <b>lash</b> growth will need to be bonded, making <b>lash</b> extensions a regular monthly service if one wishes to maintain the full look.|$|R

The storm began to influence the weather at Philadelphia on the night of August 24.
