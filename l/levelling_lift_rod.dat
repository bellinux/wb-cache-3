50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> system ran {{vertically}} up the mineshaft, {{either to}} transfer {{power to the}} individual sets of shaft pumps (when they were known as pump rods) or, {{in the case of}} man engines, to operate the man engine rods. In some cases the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> system performed both duties. It consisted of roughly 19 to 20 centimetre thick squared spruce timbers. The poles were dovetailed at the ends and sides and were fixed to one another with correspondingly mortised wooden joints (Holzlaschen). These joints were tightly bound {{to the ends of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>rods</b> with iron collars. In addition the iron collars were prevented from slipping by bolts inserted through them. At set distances there were also hooks on the sides that were used to hang the piston rods (Kolbenstangen). So that the horizontal movement of the flat rods could be turned into a vertical movement, a rotating cross-shaped lever (Kunstkreuz) was fitted to the <b>lifting</b> <b>rods.</b> Connexion to the cross lever was achieved using a crank (Kunstschloss). To balance the load it was usual to have two <b>lifting</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to give an {{innovative}} concept to handle the bore well rescue operations. Nowadays child often falls down in the borehole which is left uncovered and get trapped. It is difficult and also risky to rescue the trapped children to aid in such rescue we proposed a system of designing robots {{to the rescue of}} a child in a borehole. The robot structure consists of power supply, switch pad, gear motors, Oxygen concentrator, camera and Microcontroller. The condition of trapped child is captured with CCTV camera and monitored on a TV. A safety balloon is introduced in order to provide extra safety. Once the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> reaches a safe position under the child, an air compressor is operated to pump air to the bladder attached {{to the end of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> through an air tube that runs downwards inside the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod.</b> The bladder provides a safe seating to the child. When the child is secure, the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> is contracted to its maximum position. The motor is then reversely operated so as to unclamp the system. Simultaneously, it is lifted out of the well using a chain or rope. The programming language is Embedded C which is executed by MP lab Integrated Development Environment. This robot type machine can rescue trapped body from the bore well in a minimum amount of time and safety...|$|R
50|$|The fine {{balancing}} procedure called multi-balance aids in almost eliminating the residual imbalances in tumbler screening machines, thus leading to less risk of {{vibration and resonance}} effects in steel fabrications or concrete buildings.The highly flexible docking system uses pneumatically operated lifting system with <b>lifting</b> <b>rods</b> and puts no additional weight on machine. It accelerates the process of inspection/ changing of screen significantly.|$|R
40|$|Impact {{vibrations}} which {{occur at}} the instantaneous opening of ball valves under high pressure were observed by a syncro-oscilloscope. These investigations were made under the alteration of valve port's diameter, lifted heights of ball valve, pressure, and the diameter of <b>lifting</b> <b>rod.</b> It was {{made clear that the}} pressure amplitude is affected awfully by pressure change, but not by the lifted height of ball valves, and the period is affected by the diameter of valve port...|$|R
25|$|When a ball rolls {{back to the}} ball-lift wheel, {{friction}} {{lifts the}} ball up to the side where it catches on two <b>lift</b> <b>rods</b> covered with a rubber material. Wedged in between, the ball is rolled upward. When {{it gets to the}} top, it is deposited onto a metal track that usually leads underground, and is pushed along by a long accelerator belt. Finally, the ball is pushed upward by two wheels located {{at the head of the}} ball return track, where it is deposited.|$|R

While letting the senko bait fall on slack line, one may also <b>lift</b> the <b>rod</b> {{to give the}} worm a moving look and keep it above ground longer. If left {{for up to a}} minute and still no bite, one should shake the line to give the appearance of a moving organism, or <b>lift</b> up the <b>rod</b> and let the lure fall to the ground again.|$|R
5000|$|Another high <b>level</b> <b>lift</b> canal {{from above}} Krishna river {{location}} [...] up to 90 m MSL would be constructed to join Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond (FRL 75 m MSL) irrigating lands en route along Krishna river in Guntur district. During drought years, the water transferred by this canal to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond is further lifted to Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam reservoirs {{with the existing}} pumped storage hydro units for use in all the projects receiving water from these reservoirs. This high <b>level</b> <b>lift</b> canal is an alternative to Dummugudem to Sagar lift canal planned in Telangana region which would transfer Godavari river water from Dummugudem to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond.|$|R
5000|$|Lifts, which {{look like}} {{clothing}} buttons, {{can move the}} robot or an object up or down by one <b>level.</b> <b>Lifts</b> are activated {{by an increase in}} pressure; if the robot or an object moves onto a lowered lift, it will raise by one level. If the robot or an object moves onto a raised lift, it will lower by one <b>level.</b> Raised <b>lifts</b> cannot be lowered at their base and become immovable obstacles at ground level.|$|R
