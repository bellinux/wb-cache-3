2500|$|Zeitgeist {{received}} mixed reviews, {{indicated by}} {{a score of}} 59/100 on Metacritic. Some negative criticism of the album stemmed from the absence of half of the original lineup, with Pitchfork Media's Rob Mitchum suggesting the name was revived for [...] "cash or attention or both." [...] Qs Paul Rees commented that [...] "at least half of Zeitgeist {{is made up of}} grinding songs that amount to riffs, pummelling and little else," [...] and that Zeitgeists emotional range is [...] "limited and wearing", but praised Chamberlin's drumming, stating that he [...] "remains {{one of the most powerful}} drummers in rock." [...] In addition, Modern Drummer proclaimed that the album contains [...] "Chamberlin's greatest drumming ever put to CD." [...] NME gave it a score of five out of ten and said, [...] "It's best treated as a curio in the Smashing Pumpkins' legacy; and for those who grew up on 'Today', '1979' and 'Ava Adore', you're better left with your memories." [...] The A.V. Club gave it a C+ and said that it [...] "ends up sounding like a Corgan career retrospective in B-side form." [...] musicOMH gave it a score of two-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "Recounting such thoughts, by this point almost an hour has been spent in the company of a record which stares back at you with the appeal of an ex you'd rather not have bumped into." [...] Hot Press gave it a mixed review and said, [...] "The best you can offer is that it’s not a disaster – now do you want to tell Billy or should I?" [...] Robert Christgau simply gave the record a [...] "Dud" [...] rating (...)

50|$|Brinton {{sometimes}} {{slips into}} anachronism, for example using the adjective 'nice' in ways {{it was not}} employed in Austen's time. Brinton makes less use than Austen of dialogue generally, especially banter, but spends more time reflecting on her characters' inner lives and motivations. Some of the plot elements feel recycled from Austen's work—for example, an episode of charades at Pemberley (instead of Mansfield Park), the severe tongue-lashing Lady Catherine administers to Mary Crawford (instead of Elizabeth Bennett), or the illness of Kitty (instead of Marianne Dashwood) precipitated by unrequited love. While these may be deliberate homages to Austen, they can come off as a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> on Brinton's part.|$|E

But that doesn't negate the way Offerman’s honest Americanist attitude regularly leads to laughs and insight." ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} said that 'Necessity is the mother of invention' and there can be few countries, if any, where this is more true than in South Africa. In the late 1930 's, prior to World War II, the South African Artillery was {{severely}} restricted due to its <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> mobility. The <b>inventiveness</b> shown in tackling this probelm is surely not {{a thing of the past}} and the possiblity of adapting South African artillery to current South african needs in warfare should not be overlooked. The South African Defence Force is not able to purchase armament in a free and open market place and the costs of developing new artillery are prohibitive in a country of South Africa's size. it will be argued that it is necessary and possible, in the short term, to take what is currently available and adapt this to South Africa's needs. </p...|$|R
50|$|The non-obvious {{requirement}} is explained in Beloit Canada Ltd. v. Valmet Oy. Justice Hugessen contrasted {{the concepts of}} anticipation and non-obviousness: “They are, of course, quite different; obviousness is {{an attack on a}} patent based on its <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness.</b> The attacker says, in effect, ‘Any fool could have done that’. Anticipation, or lack of novelty, on the other hand, in effect assumes that there has been an invention but asserts that it has been disclosed to the public prior to the application for the patent.”It should be clarified that while Justice Hugessen says “any fool”, the proper standard in patents is a person skilled in the art.|$|E

[...] He gave a favorable review but heavily discussed Grohl's guitar skills and songwriting as lacking: [...] "The biggest problem on the album is Grohl's complete <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> as a guitar player[...] [...] Had Dave Grohl used more guest musicians instead of trying to do everything himself, Probot would have been much better."

50|$|Tchaikovsky biographer David Brown {{writes that}} Zaremba's chief deficit was a {{complete}} lack of true inventiveness musically or of any other sort of imagination. Sticking to the composition handbook of his teacher, Adolph Bernhard Marx, Zaremba sent his students from there to study strict counterpoint and church modes as explained by Heinrich Bellermann. Because of his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness,</b> Zaremba's only way to improve a student's composition was to impose the straight-and-narrow rules of composition which he apparently learned so thoroughly himself. Zaremba apparently had few, if any, creative energies of his own, having composed little and published nothing. He reportedly wrote at least one symphony, a quartet {{in the style of}} Joseph Haydn, according to Tchaikovsky, and an oratorio entitled John the Baptist. For a professor of composition at a conservatory, this meagerness of output was unusual.|$|E

Patenting activity in new technological fields follows a sigmoid (S-shaped) path. Qualitative and quantitative models in management and economics literature explain why such patterns of productivity may occur. TRIZ analysis suggests that patents are generated in bursts during {{the evolution of a}} product and that they are at different levels <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness.</b> The tendency is for the inventiveness to reduce as the product is more mature. This makes it possible to guess at the lifetime stage of a product and gauge its maturity and profitability.

40|$|Some neologisms attract our {{attention}} by their inventiveness, while others pass unnoticed. This article reports on {{an exploration of}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> in lexicogenesis. Inventiveness is not currently a notion present in morphological research, while the semantically related creativity is found in discussions of the opposition between word-formation and word-creation, i. e. the application of morphological rules vs. the extra-grammatical production of neologisms. The question is: Does inventiveness {{have anything to do with}} this opposition? One way of investigating a subjective notion like this is to ask informants to provide judgments. In two investigations, the informants read neologisms with short definitions and produced scores <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> for each unit. The neologisms were rank-ordered by inventiveness scores and the ten most and least inventive units were compared. Transparent units, i. e. words with a simple form-meaning relationship, were generally judged less inventive than those with more complex relationships. Also, fabricated words, blends and units with splinters were judged more inventive. Overall, these observations confirm a prototypical distinction between word-formation and word-creation...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} the current study is the {{individual}} and environmental attributes <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> among children and adolescents. Research was conducted on the young inventors who were part of a nation-wide inventive ideation contest for children and adolescents in P. R. China. A total of 621 (303 boys, 318 girls, Mage = 13. 9, SD = 2. 5) 4 th to 12 th grade students from 112 schools all over China participated in the study. Among them, 38 (20 boys, 18 girls, Mage = 14. 9, SD = 3. 3) reported holding one or more patents. Independent t-test showed, compared to their lower-level counterparts, higher-level young inventors were more intrinsically motivated for inventive endeavours and were more open to new experiences. They also reported more encouragement and resources for invention from their schools. Logistic regression showed that school encouragement made the major contribution in discriminating these two groups. 2 × 3 MANONA revealed a significant main effect of gender and age group but no significant interaction between the two factors. Results of the univariate tests challenged the stereotyped view against the inventive ability of girls. Girls scored higher in Openness and lower in executive thinking style. The aesthetic appeal of their inventive products was also rated higher by experts. Albeit this superiority, girls, however, reported less encouragement from their parents to make inventions. Results of the cross-sectional study of the different age groups did not support a hypothesized growth <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> from the lower to the higher grades. Instead, an uneven developmental pattern in inventiveness and the relevant domains were revealed, which was on the large part attributed to the influence of the educational environment. Taken together, the results {{of the current study}} highlight the important role the environmental factors play in fostering or hindering the development <b>of</b> <b>inventiveness</b> among children and adolescents...|$|R
