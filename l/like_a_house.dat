25|$|In El Filibusterismo, Rizal had Father Florentino say: “...our liberty will (not) {{be secured}} at the sword's point...we must secure it by making {{ourselves}} worthy of it. And when a people reaches that height God {{will provide a}} weapon, the idols will be shattered, tyranny will crumble <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> of cards and liberty will shine out like the first dawn.” Rizal's attitude to the Philippine Revolution is also debated, not only based on his own writings, but also due to the varying eyewitness accounts of Pío Valenzuela, a doctor who in 1895 had consulted Rizal in Dapitan on behalf of Bonifacio and the Katipunan.|$|E
25|$|The last match saw two US {{champion}}s the 2006 champion Maria Sharapova and {{the current}} champion Samantha Stosur. Stosur, the No.7 seed at the year-end finale, turned the tables {{on one of the}} most lopsided head-to-heads in the upper echelon of the women's game, coming out <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> on fire then surviving some tense moments to close out a No.2-ranked, No.2-seeded Sharapova in straight sets 6–1, 7–5. Having lost her last 11 sets in a row to Sharapova, Stosur stormed through the opening set in just 28 minutes, then rallied from 3–0 down in the second set, with Sharapova missing a backhand return on match point. Both players had a similar number of winners throughout the match – Stosur 18, Sharapova 17 – but Sharapova's 30 unforced errors far outweighed Stosur's 17 miscues.|$|E
25|$|The kiang, or Tibetan wild ass, {{is common}} in the grasslands of Changthang, {{numbering}} about 2,500 individuals. These animals are {{in conflict with the}} nomadic people of Changthang who hold the Kiang responsible for pasture degradation. There are about 200 snow leopards in Ladakh of an estimated 7,000 worldwide. The Hemis High Altitude National Park in central Ladakh is an especially good habitat for this predator as it has abundant prey populations. The Eurasian lynx, is another rare cat that preys on smaller herbivores in Ladakh. It is mostly found in Nubra, Changthang and Zangskar. The Pallas's cat, which looks somewhat <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> cat, is very rare in Ladakh and not much is known about the species. The Tibetan wolf, which sometimes preys on the livestock of the Ladakhis, is the most persecuted amongst the predators. There are also a few brown bears in the Suru valley and the area around Dras. The Tibetan sand fox has been discovered in this region. Among smaller animals, marmots, hares, and several types of pika and vole are common.|$|E

500|$|Though some remodelling {{work was}} done in the 13th and 14th centuries, with a {{northwest}} tower funded by Jasper Tudor, lord of Glamorgan from 1484–95, by the late 16th century the church had fallen into a state of disrepair. In 1594 the bishop complained that the cathedral was [...] "more like a desolate and profane place than <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> of prayer and holy exercises". The church continued to exist in a poor state, so that by 1692 choral services had to be suspended in fear that the roof would collapse. The battlements of the northwestern tower blew away during a storm in 1703, and the southwest tower fell down in 1722. In 1734, John Wood of Bath was hired to restore the cathedral, but his work on the temple was still not complete by 1752 and remained that way. [...] It was not until 1840 that in the wake of industrial development in Cardiff that the cathedral could raise the funds to commence a full restoration.|$|E

500|$|On October 8 1976, Bryant and Scott {{delivered}} a twenty-page treatment entitled , which executives Barry Diller and Michael Eisner liked. In the treatment, Kirk {{and his crew}} encounter beings {{they believe to be}} the mythical Titans and travel back millions of years in time, accidentally teaching early man to make fire. Planet of the Titans also explored the concept of the third eye. With the studio's acceptance of this treatment Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to refocus on Star Trek, and the screenwriters and Isenberg were swamped with grateful fan mail. Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators. Key amongst these were famed production designer Ken Adam, who said that [...] "I was approached by Gene Roddenberry and we got on <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> on fire", and thus he was employed to design the film. In turn Adam employed artist Ralph McQuarrie fresh off the yet to be released Star Wars. They worked on designs for planets, planetary and asteroid bases, a black hole [...] "shroud", a crystalline [...] "super brain", and new concepts for the Enterprise, including interior concepts which Adam later revisited for the film Moonraker and a flat-hulled starship design (frequently credited to McQuarrie, but which McQuarrie's own art of book identifies as an Adam design). McQuarrie wrote that [...] "there was no script" [...] thus much of the work was [...] "winging it". When that film folded after three months for Adam and [...] "a month and a half" [...] for McQuarrie, their concepts were shelved, although a handful of them were revisited in later productions.|$|E

2500|$|A {{study of}} {{international}} transport [...] "mega-projects" [...] led by Professor Harry Dimitriou of University College London concluded that tolls on the East West Link {{would have to}} be a minimum of $10.50 to produce a profit for investors, and the government would come under pressure to toll the Eastern Freeway. Two contributors to the study, Sophie Sturup and Nicholas Low, suggested the large profits flowing to private consultants during the planning phase created a moral hazard—"because those who will make money from the road are not those who will invest in it or use it. Knowing that their employer and cash cow has committed itself to the construction, there is a strong incentive for consultants to invent reasons for the project from which they can walk away when the financial architecture they have created collapses <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> of cards." [...] Kenneth Davidson, a columnist for The Age and outspoken critic of the project, claimed the government's business case did not justify the road and that [...] "the financial burden on the Victorian taxpayer will be so big that it will 'crowd out' the state's core responsibilities for funding schools, hospitals, rail transport and even other roads for at least a generation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rochefort, with Huckins and Williams, states {{there were}} no dummy {{messages}} used at any time throughout 1941 and no effort by the Japanese to use serious deception. When asked after the attack just how he knew where Akagi was, Rochefort (who commanded HYPO at the time) said he recognized her [...] "same ham-fisted" [...] radio operators. (The Japanese contend that radio operators were left behind {{as part of the}} deception operation.) The critical DF-tracked radio transmissions show bearings that could have not come from the strike force. Emissions monitored from CAST, or CAST's report Akagi was off Okinawa on 8 December 1941, are examples, though some transmissions continue to be debated. The contention that [...] "low-powered" [...] radio (such as VHF or what the U.S. Navy called TBS, or talk between ships), might have been used, and detected, is contradicted as impossible due to the tremendous distances involved and when contact was lost, it was routinely presumed it was because low-powered radio and land line were being used. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for specific RDF reports remain wanting. [...] "A more critical analysis of the source documentation shows that not one single radio direction finder bearing, much less any locating [...] "fix," [...] was obtained on any Kido Butai unit or command during its transit from Saeki Bay, Kyushu to Hitokappu Bay and thence on to Hawaii. By removing this fallacious lynchpin propping up such claims of Kido Butai radio transmissions, the attendant suspected conspiracy tumbles down <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> of cards." ...|$|E
