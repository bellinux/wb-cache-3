40|$|The role of {{cholecystokinin}} (CCK) in {{the regulation}} of gastric emptying of physiological meals containing solids and liquids in humans remains controversial. We studied the role of endogenous CCK in the emptying of a solid/liquid meal administering the new, highly specific and potent CCK-A receptor antagonist <b>lintitript.</b> Gastric emptying was assessed in nine healthy male volunteers using a randomized, double blind, two-period crossover design with oral <b>lintitript</b> (15 mg 1 h prior to meal intake) or placebo on two different days. After ingestion of a pancake (570 kcal) labelled with 500 microCi of 99 mTc-sulfur colloid and 500 ml 10 % dextrose containing 80 microCi. 111 In-DTPA, subjects were studied in a sitting position, using a dual-headed gamma camera. Plasma CCK and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were measured by a specific RIA. <b>Lintitript</b> distinctly accelerated gastric emptying of solids, while gastric emptying of liquids was not significantly altered. The lag period was shortened by 20 % (P< 0. 05), AUC and half emptying time of solid emptying were lowered by 12 % and 13 %, respectively (P< 0. 03). <b>Lintitript</b> markedly increased postprandial plasma CCK release (P< 0. 001) while distinctly reducing postprandial PP levels (P< 0. 01) as compared to placebo. These data provide further evidence for a significant role of CCK {{in the regulation}} of gastric emptying of solids. The study demonstrates {{for the first time}} the marked gastrokinetic properties of the new CCK-A receptor antagonist <b>lintitript</b> in humans...|$|E
