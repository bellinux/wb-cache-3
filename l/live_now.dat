25|$|Trollope's {{popularity}} and critical success diminished {{in his later}} years, but he continued to write prolifically, {{and some of his}} later novels have acquired a good reputation. In particular, critics who concur that the book was not popular when published, generally acknowledge the sweeping satire The Way We <b>Live</b> <b>Now</b> (1875) as his masterpiece. In all, Trollope wrote forty-seven novels, as well as dozens of short stories and a few books on travel.|$|E
25|$|Yates {{returned}} to television in 2000 {{to direct the}} episodes of Greed, Envy and Lust for the BBC miniseries The Sins, starring Pete Postlethwaite, as well as The Way We <b>Live</b> <b>Now,</b> the acclaimed four-part television adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} by Anthony Trollope. Among the actors which Yates directed were David Suchet, Cillian Murphy and Miranda Otto in their roles as Augustus Melmotte, Paul Montague and Mrs. Hurtle respectively. Yates shared the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Serial with screenwriter Andrew Davies and producer Nigel Stafford-Clark at the 2002 BAFTA Awards.|$|E
25|$|The mass {{execution}} {{was soon}} called the ″Huruslahti Lottery″ as the victims {{seemed to have}} been selected randomly. Some witnesses said every tenth man was picked, some claiming every seventh. Although, the later {{studies have shown that the}} executed were actually not picked randomly but they were mostly Red Guard or trade union activists. The White commander C. G. E. Mannerheim had learned the manner on his years in the Russian Army. The idea was to suppress the military revolts by killing the leaders but let the ordinaries <b>live.</b> <b>Now</b> he presumably used the tactic against the Finnish Reds.|$|E

500|$|Murphy began {{appearing}} in independent films, such as John Carney's On the Edge, and in short films, including the Irish short Filleann an Feall, He {{also appeared in}} the BBC television mini-series adaptation of The Way We <b>Live</b> <b>Now.</b> In addition to Disco Pigs, he starred in many other plays, including Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, Neil LaBute's The Shape of Things, and Chekhov's The Seagull; Murphy considers this stage work to have been his [...] "training ground". Murphy also reprised his Disco Pigs role for the 2001 indie film version by Kirsten Sheridan, {{in which he was}} able to showcase his singing. During this period, he moved from Cork, relocating first to Dublin for a few years, then to London in 2001. In 1999 he had a role as a soldier in William Boyd's The Trench, a film about a group of young British soldiers {{on the eve of the}} Battle of the Somme.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Andrew Billen {{compared}} the contemporary cultural {{relevance of the}} series to The Way We <b>Live</b> <b>Now,</b> as a follow-up to his comparison of the first series with Vanity Fair: [...] "In previous years {{we have seen the}} anguish caused by infidelity, impotence and infertility. This season the characters face the hazards thrown up by miscarriage, alcoholism and a late-flowering career. Sustaining relationships looks as hard as ever. Yet there is nothing each protagonist wants more than old-fashioned domestic bliss." [...] The review resonated with other critics; in The Scotsman, Linda Watson-Brown wrote an overall positive review of the series in general—dismissing the spate of [...] "anti-Cold Feet" [...] reviews—but criticised [...] "the ease with which problems are resolved and morality used to slap the viewer in the face". The final episode set in Australia polarised critics; in a column focusing on Chewin' the Fat, Scotsman critic Aidan Smith accused the big-budget episode [...] "which somehow managed to squeeze the Harbour Bridge into every shot" [...] of being the point the series jumped the shark, and Times columnist Caitlin Moran complimented it, but was concerned that the series' original main characters—Adam and Rachel—were being sidelined by everyone including Mike Bullen.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} a [...] "certified fresh" [...] {{approval}} rating of 81% {{with an average}} rating of 7/10 based on 94 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes; the site's consensus states: [...] "Its jokes are profoundly bold and rude but incredibly funny at the same time." [...] It also has a 73 out of 100 rating based on 31 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews", at Metacritic. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film [...] "outrageously profane" [...] and [...] "wildly funny", writing that [...] "While censorship is the filmmakers' main target [...] favorite monster is the Motion Picture Association of America, self-appointed guardians of the nation's chastity. It's all in good dirty fun and in service of their pro-tolerance theme." [...] Stephen Holden of The New York Times heavily praised the film, regarding the film's [...] "self-justifying moral" [...] as [...] "about mass entertainment, censorship and freedom of speech." [...] He also praised Cartman's subjection to the V-chip, which he called [...] "the movie's sharpest satirical twist, reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange". Entertainment Weekly graded the film an A− and praised the film's message in a post-Columbine society, as well as Parker and Shaiman's musical numbers, which [...] "brilliantly parody / honor the conventions of Broadway show tunes and, especially, the Disney-formula ditties that began with Alan Menken and Howard Ashman." [...] The Washington Post Michael O'Sullivan neutrally regarded the offensive nature of the film, commenting [...] "Yes, the lampooning is more broad than incisive, but under the bludgeoning of this blunt instrument very few sacred cows are left standing." [...] In a review that was later quoted on the film's original home video cover, Richard Corliss from Time warned viewers [...] "You may laugh yourself sick – as sick as this ruthlessly funny movie is." [...] Corliss would later name the film his fifth favorite animated film of all time. The film had {{its fair share of}} critical detractors, without noting the conservative family groups offended by the film's humor. Jack Matthews of the Daily News suggested the film's running time made Parker and Stone [...] "run out of ideas", while Roger Ebert stated that the [...] "vicious social satire" [...] of the film both [...] "offended" [...] and [...] "amazed" [...] him. Ebert called the film [...] "the year's most slashing political commentary", but also said, [...] "It is too long and runs out of steam, but it serves as a signpost for our troubled times. Just for the information it contains about the way we <b>live</b> <b>now,</b> thoughtful and concerned people should see it. After all, everyone else will." ...|$|E

2500|$|One year later, Yates {{attended}} the 56th BAFTA Awards with a British Academy Film Award nomination for Best Short Film for the fourteen-minute production, Rank, which expressed the social elements of racism, friendship and adolescence through {{the story of}} a street gang that cross Glasgow to witness the arrival of a group of Somali refugees. Yates said that even though The Way We <b>Live</b> <b>Now</b> was [...] "a very big production" [...] and [...] "enormous fun to do", Rank was an opportunity to [...] "shake all that off" [...] and [...] "get back to [...] roots." [...] Of the casting, Yates said that he [...] "wanted to use non-actors to tell the story, to create a reality ... the kids we cast in Glasgow had never done a film before." [...] The film was noted for its gritty style and cinematography, with a review from Eye For Film stating that [...] "such intelligent use of camera and cast lifts Yates out of the pool of promising young directors into the front line of genuine hopefuls. This work demands respect." ...|$|E
