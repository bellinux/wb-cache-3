40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{estimate}} the impact of the removal of NTBs in trade between the EU and its selected CIS partners: Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan (CIS 5). The report includes a discussion of methodologies of measurement of non-tariff barriers and the impact of their removal, including a review of previous studies focusing on CEE and CIS regions. Further, we employ a computable general equilibrium model encompassing the following three pillars of trade facilitation: <b>legislative</b> and regulatory <b>approximation,</b> reform of customs rules and procedures and liberalization of the access of foreign providers of services. We conclude that a reduction of NTBs and improved access to the EU market would bring significant benefits to the CIS 5 countries in terms of welfare gains, GDP growth, increases in real wages and expansion of international trade. The possible welfare implications of deep integration with the EU range from 5. 8 % of GDP in Ukraine to sizeable expected gains in Armenia (3. 1 %), Russia (2. 8 %), Azerbaijan (1. 8 %) and Georgia (1. 7 %) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement (AA). It {{argues that}} this new legal framework, which has the objective to establish a unique form of political association and economic integration, is characterised by three specific features : comprehensiveness, complexity and conditionality. After a brief background of the EU-Ukraine relations, the following aspects are scrutinised: legal basis and objectives, institutional framework and mechanisms of enhanced conditionality and <b>legislative</b> <b>approximation.</b> In addition, constitutional challenges for the effective implementation of the EU-Ukraine AA are discussed. Based upon a comparison with other EU external agreements, it is demonstrated that the AA is an innovative legal instrument providing for {{a new type of}} integration without membership...|$|E
40|$|In their March 2015 Consultation {{paper on}} {{the review of the}} European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the European Commission and the High Representative raised the {{question}} whether the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs) “are the right objective for all or should more tailor-made alternatives be developed, to reflect differing interests and ambitions of some partners?” Such ambitious but complex trade agreements have now finally been signed with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, but they are still on the table for several Mediterranean ENP countries. Although these Mediterranean partners have a completely different political, economic and legal relationship with the EU, some important lessons can be drawn from the ‘Eastern DCFTA experience’. In particular, the DCFTA negotiators should avoid overly ambitious and ill-defined <b>legislative</b> <b>approximation</b> commitments and develop a comprehensive implementation strategy...|$|E
40|$|The European Union’s wider {{neighbourhood}} hosts {{some of the}} world’s main unresolved conflicts. As the EU developed {{its foreign}} and security policy, a blend of internal security and external stability concerns, {{as well as the}} reference to international legal and humanitarian norms, required it to try tackling (some of) these conflicts. Through both the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Stabilisation and Association Process the EU establishes contractual relations with its neighbours and tries to incentivise them for the adoption of economic and political reforms and <b>legislative</b> <b>approximation</b> to EU standards. Also, in some cases, the EU is providing support for conflict management through political dialogue, financial assistance or deployment of missions under the Common Security and Defence Policy. At its core, this paper is concerned with comparatively analysing the degree of integration between CSDP and the ENP and SAP frameworks respectively. The comparative case-study will therefore analyse CSDP missions undertaken in the Georgia/ Abkhazia and South Ossetia and Kosovo/Serbia cases, in order to identify common challenges across the two EU policy frameworks for its neighbourhood and to explore the perspectives for the emergence of an EU strategy of conflict management based on CSDP operations and various forms of engaging third countries...|$|E

The order of the <b>legislative</b> <b>approximation</b> in conditions of changing legislation of regulation of insurance mediation in European Union is characterized. A comparison of legal provisions to regulate insurance mediation in Ukraine and the EU is done. Suggestions of adaptation national legislation to the European in the area of regulation of insurance mediation in conditions of euro integration processes are represented. The main are the next:-it is advisable to expand the object and the scope of regulation of insurance mediation and set appropriate limits to the subjects for which the sale of insurance products is not the main activity;-it is necessary to introduce a regular improvement of the knowledge and skills for insurance distributors because of the development of insurance conditions and changing of economic environment;-it is necessary to create the order of compulsory professional indemnity insurance in accordance with the requirements of the Directive on insurance distribution;-before the signing of the contract it is necessary to disclosure to customers of insurance products the information about the status of insurance distributors and type of remuneration that they receive;-if the insurance product is in addition to the goods or services, insurance distributor shall inform the client about the possibility of buying various product components separately with the presentation of their characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Defence date: 7 December 2007 Examining board: Prof. Adrienne Héritier, EUI/RSCAS (EUI Supervisor); Prof. Olga Potemkina, Russian Academy of Science, Moscow; Prof. Gerda Falkner, Institute for Advanced Studies, Vienna; Prof. Marise Cremona, EUI, Department of LawThe EU {{has engaged}} in the {{promotion}} of an unprecedented process of policy export which involves not only candidates to enlargement, but also {{a wide range of}} countries beyond the Union’s present and future expected (at least at the moment) borders. In this framework, Russia and Ukraine have been an important test-case for the European Union which asked them to 'endeavour to ensure' that their legislation will be 'gradually made compatible with that of the Community' already in the mid- 90 s. This dissertation is intended to explore the mechanisms which have allowed the EU to promote <b>legislative</b> <b>approximation</b> in these 2 countries across 3 policy areas which are {{at the core of the}} internal market and where I, thus, expected the pressure for Europeanisation to be higher: competition policy, company law and consumers’ protection. In particular, I tried to understand if and how far the EU has been able to induce Russia and Ukraine towards the desired outcome as a result of the engagement of the parties in strategic inter-action. Then, on the other hand, I tried to assess if and how far rule adoption has been motivated by internalized, socially constructed identities, values and norms. The analysis has shown that there are interesting cases of Europeanisation not only in Ukraine, but also in Russia, allowing me to highlight the limits deriving from the use of conditionality in the new neighborhood and the need to reconsider the mix between different Europeanisation strategies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the general {{framework of the}} EU’s emerging relationship with its new neighbours and investigates the potential {{economic impact of the}} European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), both for the EU itself and for its neighbours. In particular, it seeks to develop an {{answer to the question of}} whether the ENP is sufficiently attractive so as to induce the governments in neighbourhood countries to adopt (or accelerate the adoption of) the types of economic and governance reforms that were implemented in the new member states during their accession processes. Although the specifics of the ENP are still being developed, the lack of incentives as regards to unclear accession to the EU is identified as the main weakness of the ENP. Economically, the ENP seeks to ease trade restrictions through the implementation of <b>legislative</b> <b>approximation</b> and convergence with EU standards, before accessing the EU’s single market can become a reality. Positively though, is that the access to the single market could improve significantly under the ENP. As experienced by the Central European states, FDI is instrumental to transform the economies of the Western CIS and the Caucasus. The ENP can be a supportive framework for improving investor confidence. Likewise, the new European Neighbourhood Instrument can add more coherence in technical assistance, and provide more financial support for creating capacities for trade infrastructures and institutional and private sector development. Finally, measures to promote increased labour migration between the new neighbours and the enlarged EU may be worth to put on the agenda for the future development and impact of the ENP.

40|$|This Working Paper {{offers a}} {{selection}} of the papers which were presented during the Workshop on “The European Neighbourhood Policy – A Framework for Modernisation?”, which was held on 1 - 2 December 2006 at the European University Institute of Florence {{under the auspices of}} the Academy of European Law. In particular, this Working Paper intends to explore from a trans-disciplinary perspective the objectives and instruments which have been devised in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and to consider in this light the capacity of the policy to promote a fundamental process of modernisation in the target countries. This is done in the conviction that a reconsideration of the coherence between instruments and objectives of the ENP is particularly urgent and it is likely to affect not only the effectiveness of the policy itself, but also the ability of the EU to create a circle of friends around its borders and, ultimately, its position in the international arena. To achieve this task, we have brought together the viewpoints of lawyers, political scientists and economists as they look at the wide range of questions prompted by the ENP. The first part of this volume is devoted to the analysis of the Objectives of the ENP. In this framework, a first paper will scrutinise the expectations from the new policy, then 5 more papers will examine the 3 major articulated objectives of the policy: stability, prosperity and security. The second part of the volume is focused on the Instruments of ENP. In particular, 3 papers will focus on <b>legislative</b> <b>approximation</b> and on the analysis of the tools which have been used in order to promote an unprecedented process of Europeanisation which goes far beyond the European continent. The last 2 papers have been devoted to the consideration of bilateralism-multilateralism and to the scrutiny of solutions which can be envisaged legally to develop the partnership with neighbouring countries in the framework of the ENP...|$|E
