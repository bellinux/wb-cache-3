5|$|A {{possible}} {{issue with}} the causeway's identification as a Roman structure in the <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century was its incorporation of many small bends along its course. Roman military roads are usually straight in both their overall course, and also typically from one vantage point to the next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns of 1664, the {{township}} of Sale had {{a population of}} about 365. Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more so during the <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century (due to the Industrial Revolution). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, Bowdon or Stretford. The increase in growth in the <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century also coincides {{with the arrival of the}} railway, indicative of Sale's growth as a commuter town. A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930. Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town's population. This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to new jobs. The table below details population changes since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E

5|$|Industrial metal {{developed}} in the late 1980s, as industrial and metal began to fuse into a common genre.

The industrial metal movement began to fade in the <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Over {{time the}} synagogue appealed {{to a broader}} {{constituency}} than just Roumanian-American Jews. Nevertheless, membership declined during the <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century as the upwardly mobile Jewish population of the Lower East Side moved to north Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. First Roumanian-American was particularly affected: as it was an Orthodox congregation, in order to attend Sabbath services its members had to live within walking distance.|$|E
5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since the <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, coinciding {{with the rise of}} cognitivism.
