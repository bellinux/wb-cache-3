Who shows up in Chinatown? None other than the Evil Queen, who claims “Regina never should have let me out to play.” And {{this is a war}} now. You thought the Big Bad for season 6 was Hyde? Try Dark Regina instead. And yes, I’m into it. Lana Parrilla {{is one of the best}} things about this show, and I’ll take {{anything}} that gives her a chance to flex her acting chops." ...|$|E
2500|$|Disliked by Bengalis for his {{criticism}} of the Bengali revolutionary Subhas Chandra Bose during the 1938 Tripuri Congress session, Rajagopalachari's appointment was unsuccessfully opposed by Bose's brother Sarat Chandra Bose. During his tenure as governor, Rajagopalachari's priorities were to deal with refugees and to bring {{peace and stability in}} the aftermath of the Calcutta riots. He declared his commitment to neutrality and justice at a meeting of Muslim businessmen: [...] "Whatever may be my defects or lapses, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> that I shall never disfigure my life with any deliberate acts of injustice to any community whatsoever." [...] Rajagopalachari was also strongly opposed to proposals to include areas from Bihar and Odisha as part of the province of West Bengal. One such proposal by the editor of an important newspaper led to the reply: ...|$|E

6000|$|I have delayed {{writing to}} you until now, hoping I {{might have been able}} to tell you of our {{dramatic}} plans, and of the day on which we purpose playing.

Mr. Kendricks, an English journalist, was taken away alive, but terribly injured, to the hospital. His companion, who seems to have been within a few feet of him when the explosion occurred, was unfortunately blown to pieces.

I regret the necessity for such means, but the man had his chance. I regret, also, the fate of the other poor people who lost their lives.

40|$|The title I {{have given}} this lecture evoked two {{different}} initial reactions {{from friends and}} acquaintances who heard about it or {{read it in the}} announcement. The first reaction was that of yearning coupled with lament: this is usually the feeling of many Lebanese, especially, Ras Beirut Protestants, who lament the total loss of the religious, specifically Protestant, character of AUB, and who yearn for the good old days when AUB was a Protestant institution. The second reaction was one of worry and apprehension. This came from people who are relieved that AUB no longer {{has anything to do with}} the Christian religion; and they are worried about any attempt to revive a Christian missionary character or role because it is simply either outdated or dangerous or wrong, or all of the above together. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> begin by <b>assuring</b> <b>you</b> that this lecture is motivated neither by a lament over a lost Protestant institution nor by the desire to revive AUB’s original missionary role. My concern is, first, to tell the story of AUB and religion and to interpret it, then to raise some questions about its ending. This is an attempt – on the part of someone deeply appreciative of, and involved in, both religion (it is my commitment, training and career) and AUB (as a graduate, a former lecturer and one whose family has been associated with this institution in one form or another for the last 117 years of its existence!) – an attempt to reflect on that marriage between religion and a Middle Eastern institution of higher learning that has ended up in divorce. Is it contextually and intellectually a defensible divorce? In other words, can an institution such as AUB – being what it is and located where it is – afford to continue ignoring “religion”...|$|R
