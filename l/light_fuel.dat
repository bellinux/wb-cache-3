5|$|Permission {{was granted}} for flight testing {{to begin in}} April 1935, and Bajdak {{conducted}} his first flight in the prototype on 22 April 1935. For this initial uneventful flight, no weapons were installed and a <b>light</b> <b>fuel</b> load was used. The following day, Bajdak put the IK-1 into unplanned aerobatic manoeuvres, after which the wing fabric was observed as being slack. An official from Ikarus checked it and stated that this would resolve once the fabric varnish had completely dried. Bajdak took the aircraft for a third test flight the next day, which involved more unplanned aerobatics. When the aircraft was at , Bajdak {{put it into a}} shallow dive and pulled up abruptly at high speed, at which point the wing fabric began to tear rapidly, {{to the extent that it}} could be seen from the ground. The aircraft dropped into a spin to starboard, and Bajdak baled out safely while the IK-1 crashed into the ground.|$|E

50|$|The podium {{positions}} stayed {{that way}} with Räikkönen cutting into the lead when Alonso pitted first {{out of the front}} three on lap 14, a sign that he was carrying a <b>lighter</b> <b>fuel</b> load during qualifying. Alonso did break the record for youngest driver to lead a race (the previous record having remained since 1951). Räikkönen circulated until lap 19, using the <b>lighter</b> <b>fuel</b> load to post faster lap times, and after his pit stop emerged ahead of Alonso.|$|R
25|$|Senna {{decided to}} try with a <b>light</b> <b>fuel</b> load to attack Mansell. He closed the gap to 7 seconds but because of that, {{he ran out of}} fuel on the last lap, which gave Mansell the {{opportunity}} to pick up the stranded Brazilian on his victory lap and drive him back to pit lane. Therefore, Mansell won ahead of Berger, Prost, Senna (classified fourth for starting final lap), Piquet and Gachot.|$|E
25|$|At the start, crowd {{favorite}} Juan Pablo Montoya {{pulled his}} Williams from third spot {{around the outside}} of Michael Schumacher's Ferrari into Turn 1. Side by side through the initial right-hander, the two avoided contact by inches as Schumacher {{closed the door and}} seized the advantage into the left-handed Turn 2. It soon became clear, however, that the fastest car on the track was the Ferrari of Rubens Barrichello, ostensibly carrying a <b>light</b> <b>fuel</b> load and on a two-stop strategy. The Brazilian took second from Montoya beginning Lap 3, then passed Schumacher two laps later for the lead.|$|E
25|$|After {{the race}} started, Alonso {{was the first}} driver to make a routine pit stop for fuel and tyres on lap 12, rejoining the race {{at the back of}} the field. He had put in a <b>light</b> <b>fuel</b> load in an attempt to pass the cars in front of him; most drivers that qualify in low {{positions}} tend to do the opposite and go for heavier fuel loads to make one less pit stop (approximately 30 seconds each in terms of time loss) than the leaders, as they do not want to waste a light car and an extra pit stop for a faster car that is stuck behind slower vehicles. Three laps later, Nelson Piquet Jr. hit the circuit wall at turn seventeen, one of the turns on the circuit which did not have a crane nearby, necessitating the deployment of the safety car.|$|E

40|$|The {{gas phase}} {{oxidative}} cracking (GOC) and non-oxidative pyrolysis of heavy hydrocarbons were investigated, with decalin (decahydronaphthalene) and tetralin (tetrahydronaphthalene) {{as the model}} compounds for naphthenic hydrocarbon and aromatic hydrocarbon, respectively. Unlike pyrolysis, the ring rupture of decalin or tetralin molecule and the decoking ability of system were significantly enhanced due {{to the introduction of}} O- 2 in GOC. For GOC of decalin, both the lower alkenes and the <b>light</b> <b>fuels</b> were obtained. At lower temperatures the <b>light</b> <b>fuels</b> mainly contained alkyl benzene, alkyl cyclohexane and isoparaffins, while it was rich in BTX (benzene, toluene and xylenes) at higher temperatures. A 38. 9 % yield of lower alkenes and 48. 0 % yield of <b>light</b> <b>fuels</b> (BTX mass content: 59. 9 %) at 100 % decalin conversion were obtained under the conditions of 800 degrees C and decalin/O- 2 = 0. 5. For GOC of tetralin, both the dehydrogenation and the cracking reactions dominated the reaction routes, resulting in a high mass content of alkyl naphthalene and alkyl benzene in the <b>light</b> <b>fuels.</b> The estimation of O- 2 distribution in the products demonstrated that O- 2 participated primarily in the oxydehydrogenation reactions at low temperatures, while mainly in the partial oxidation reactions at high temperatures to produce COx (x= 1, 2).

500|$|At the 1982 British Grand Prix, Brabham reintroduced {{the idea}} of {{re-fuelling}} and changing the car's tyres during the race, unseen since the 1957 Formula One season, to allow their drivers to sprint away {{at the start of}} races on a <b>light</b> <b>fuel</b> load and soft tyres. After studying techniques used at the Indianapolis 500 and in NASCAR racing in the United States, the team were able to refuel and re-tyre the car in 14 seconds in tests ahead of the race. In 1982 Murray felt the tactic did little more than [...] "get our sponsors noticed at races we had no chance of winning", but in 1983 the team made good use of the tactic. Refuelling was banned for 1984, and did not reappear until the 1994 season (until it was banned again in 2010 as a part of cost cutting measures), but tyre changes have remained part of Formula One.|$|E
500|$|Hülkenberg, who {{qualified}} eleventh, was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} session. His best time of 1:37.620 was 1.5 seconds slower than Webber's pace in the second session. He said eleventh place was a [...] "good position to start from" [...] despite losing the rear of his car in turn twelve, which caused him to abort one of his quick laps. Hülkenberg was followed in the times by the BMW Sauber drivers Kobayashi in twelfth and Heidfeld in thirteenth, followed by Sutil in the quickest of the two Force India cars. Petrov, who qualified in fifteenth, was penalised five positions on the grid because he had caused an avoidable accident with Hülkenberg {{at the start of}} the previous race at Suzuka. Petrov was aiming for a top ten grid position to minimise the effects of his grid penalty but he spun on his final timed lap after hitting a kerb; he was unable to set a quicker lap time because his tyres had become dirty. As a result, Jaime Alguersuari inherited 15th position, ahead of his teammate Sébastien Buemi who opted to run one flying lap with a <b>light</b> <b>fuel</b> load for his last run of the second session but made minor mistakes which cost him time. Vitantonio Liuzzi, Trulli and Timo Glock were the quickest drivers unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying. Liuzzi complained the tyre wear on his soft compound tyres was so excessive it had caused him to struggle with a large amount of oversteer through the last two sectors of the track. The tenth row of the grid was filled by Heikki Kovalainen (Lotus) and Lucas di Grassi (Virgin). The two Hispania drivers completed the final two positions on the grid; Yamamoto in twenty-third was 0.8 seconds faster than his teammate Senna in twenty-fourth.|$|E
2500|$|Alonso {{claimed his}} first victory and podium {{of the season}} by winning the [...] After {{performing}} strongly in practice, a fuel pressure problem {{in the second part}} of qualifying forced him to park the car, causing him to qualify 15th. In the race he started with a <b>light</b> <b>fuel</b> load on soft tyres, and pitted early when he realised that this would not be successful. However, teammate Piquet crashed bringing out the safety car, which eliminated the lead of the frontrunners. When they pitted after the pit lane was reopened, they rejoined behind those who had already stopped. This moved Alonso up among top six, and he ultimately won the race, earning the 20th win and 50th podium of his career. In September 2009, after being dropped by Renault, Piquet said that the crash had been intentional and had been requested by Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds. Alonso was declared to be innocent by the subsequent FIA investigation.|$|E

2500|$|Tractors {{and heavy}} {{equipment}} were often multifuel in the 1920s through 1940s, running spark-ignition and low-compression engines. Thus many farm tractors {{of the era}} could burn gasoline, alcohol, kerosene, and any light grade of fuel oil such as diesel fuel, heating oil, or tractor vaporising oil, according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time. On U.S. farms during this era, the name [...] "distillate" [...] often referred {{to any of the}} aforementioned <b>light</b> <b>fuel</b> oils. The engines did not start as well on distillate, so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting, and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later, after warm-up, to switch to distillate. Engine accessories such as vaporizers and radiator shrouds were also used, both with the aim of capturing heat, because when such an engine was run on distillate, it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature. Dieselization with dedicated diesel engines (high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition) replaced such systems and made more efficient use of the diesel fuel being burned.|$|E
2500|$|In the , Lewis Hamilton {{ran into}} the back of Alonso's Renault, heavily {{damaging}} the rear wing of Alonso's car, as well as his own nosecone. Stewards did not seek to investigate the incident but critics alleged he braked (or did not accelerate as expected) in front of Hamilton causing Hamilton to crash into him. The telemetry data from Alonso's car proved these accusations to be wrong. Hamilton himself stated [...] "I was behind him, and I moved to the right, and he moved to the right and that was it– a racing incident I guess". It was later revealed by McLaren that Hamilton's front wing, which was damaged when he hit Alonso earlier in the race, had broken seconds before the impact and has been identified as the cause of the crash. Alonso started the [...] with promising pace, qualifying on the front row in second place behind Kimi Räikkönen even though he had a <b>light</b> <b>fuel</b> load. He was running in fifth place when his engine blew on lap 35. He praised his team after finishing sixth in the , as he was behind the more competitive BMW cars at the end, and said that the result [...] "confirms the progress we have made, and is thanks to the hard work of everyone in the team".|$|E
2500|$|Alonso {{failed to}} {{score in the}} next two races, {{finishing}} tenth at the , after puncturing a tyre against the barrier and a collision with Nick Heidfeld and retiring from the [...] after crashing into the wall on lap 45, having qualified fourth. Alonso had been keeping pace with the BMW Saubers, who would eventually go on to record their maiden win with Robert Kubica after pitlane dramas plagued both Ferrari and McLaren. In France, Alonso qualified behind the two Ferraris in third, aided by Lewis Hamilton's grid penalty for the pit-lane accident in Canada. However, he was on a <b>light</b> <b>fuel</b> load, and his task was made much harder by being beaten by the slower Toyota of Jarno Trulli at the start. He then faded back to seventh and {{towards the end of the}} race while catching Mark Webber's Red Bull he ran wide at the Adelaide hairpin and slipped behind teammate Piquet, Jr. to finish eighth. Alonso finished sixth at Silverstone, saying that he had used up all of his available tyres for the unpredictable wet conditions, and that by using practically slick tyres towards the end, he lost a lot of time in certain places on the track. Despite qualifying fifth at the , he finished in eleventh after spinning off whilst battling with the Williams of Nico Rosberg. In the , he finished in fourth place having started seventh, aided by Lewis Hamilton's early puncture and Felipe Massa's engine failing in the closing stages.|$|E
