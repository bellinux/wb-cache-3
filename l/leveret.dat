40|$|ABSTRACT- Four {{hundred and}} {{two pairs of}} hares {{belonging}} to the mountain and brown haplotypes of the European hare Lepus europaeus Pallas, 1778 were raised in a farm lo-cated in central Italy over 4 years (from 2003 to 2006). The birth date, total number of young born, and number of surviving and weaned <b>leverets</b> were recorded for each pair. The start of reproduction, birth-interval, length of the repro-ductive season, number of birth per pair per year, number of <b>leverets</b> per pair, number of weaned <b>leverets</b> per pair and number of weaned <b>leverets</b> per birth were analysed {{in relation to the}} different haplotypes and years; the incidence of superfetation and pseudogestation was also considered. Results showed that the brown hare produced young at the beginning of February, whilst the mountain hare started reproduction significantly later. Brown hares showed a longer re-productive period than mountain hares (192 days vs 156 days) and a higher productivity. The most frequent gestation length was 37 - 41 days. The distribution of delivery intervals did not differ between the two haplotypes...|$|R

50|$|The Alaskan hare {{is mostly}} solitary, and usually only congregate in groups during mating season in April and May. They will {{normally}} have one litter per year of between four and eight <b>leverets,</b> {{with the young}} born during June and July. The <b>leverets</b> are active shortly after birth, and are born with full coats and open eyes. Hares can also carry Tularemia which is a bacterial disease that can be transmitted to pets and humans.

The young have an average weigh of around 130 g at birth.

[...] <b>Leverets</b> disperse during the day and come together in the evening close to where they were born. Their mother visits them for nursing soon after sunset; the young suckle for around five minutes, urinating while they do so, with the doe licking up the fluid. She then leaps away so as not to leave an olfactory trail, and the <b>leverets</b> disperse once more. Young can eat solid food after two weeks and are weaned when they are four weeks old. While young of either sex commonly explore their surroundings, natal dispersal tends to be greater in males. Sexual maturity occurs at seven or eight months for females and six months for males.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{describe}} the postnatal growth performance (period from birth to weaning) in Brown hare (Lepus europaeus) <b>leverets</b> in a rearing centre of Southern Italy. Three morpho- metric variables (body weight, hind foot length and ear length) were measured weekly from birth to wean- ing (at 21 days) in 78 <b>leverets.</b> Data were analysed by proc GLM (SAS) considering the effect of sex and birth period (1. January-February, 2. March-April, and 3. May-June). Birth period influenced significantly live weight at 14 14 th day of life, lower inperiod 2 thanin 3 (553 vs. 607 g;P period 2 than in 3 (553 vs. 607 g;P (553 vs. 607 g; P≤ 0. 05) and hind foot length at birth, shorter in period 1 compared to the period 2 and 3 (4. 4 vs. 4. 7 and 4. 8 cm; P≤ 0. 05), and at weaning, shorter in period 1 than in 3 (8. 6 vs. 9. 6 cm; P≤ 0. 05).

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out on 42 breeder couples (42 males and 42 females) of European brown hare (Lepus europaeus), divided into three groups fed three {{different}} experimental diets (14 couples/treatment). Two diets were supplemented with n- 3 and n- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; 2 % of linseed oil and soybean oil, respectively) and were compared with a control diet supplemented with a monounsaturated fatty acids (2 % of olive oil). During the experimental period (from 15 April to 30 September), the following parameters were recorded: days {{from the beginning of}} trial to the first parturition, parturition interval, number of parturitions, number of <b>leverets</b> born (alive and dead), dead during suckling, the total number of <b>leverets</b> weaned and feed intake per cage (of males, females and <b>leverets</b> until weaning). Feed intake was not influenced by treatments. In hares fed n- 3 and n- 6 diets, the days {{from the beginning of the}} trial to the first parturition and the parturition interval were similar and were lower compared with control group (63. 1 v. 70. 6 days, and 37. 8 v. 40. 9 days, respectively; P < 0. 05). Hares from n- 6 group had a higher (P < 0. 05) number of parturitions per cage during the experimental period than the n- 3 and control group that showed a similar value (3. 00 v. 2. 36, respectively). The total number of <b>leverets</b> born per cage and parturition in n- 6 and n- 3 groups increased with respect to those fed control diet (P < 0. 05). The leverets' mortality rate at birth was higher in n- 6 than in n- 3 and control group (3. 50 v. 2. 17, respectively; P < 0. 05). In control group, leverets' mortality rate during suckling was lower with respect to n- 3 (P < 0. 05) and n- 6 (P < 0. 05), showing the highest value for the latter (P < 0. 05). In spite of this higher mortality, the number of <b>leverets</b> weaned per cage and parturition was higher (P < 0. 05) in n- 6 compared with n- 3 group, being the latter higher than the control group (3. 12, 2. 79 and 2. 43, respectively).

50|$|The {{gestation}} period in leporids varies from around 28 to 50 days, and is generally {{longer in the}} hares. This is in part because young hares, or <b>leverets,</b> are born fully developed, with fur and open eyes, while rabbit kits are naked and blind at birth, having {{the security of the}} burrow to protect them. Leporids can have several litters a year, which can cause their population to expand dramatically in a short time when resources are plentiful.|$|R
30|$|A {{second reason}} for fruit {{avoidance}} by juveniles {{may be because}} of the high concentration of secondary compounds contained in fruits (Jordano 2000). Iason and Waterman (1988) found that reproductively active females and <b>leverets</b> of Lepus timidus ate smaller proportions of heather Calluna vulgaris, than non-reproducing females and males, due to secondary compounds contained in this plant. However, in this study no {{differences were found between the}} sexes. Similarly, Homolka (1987) found no significant difference in diet composition between males and females.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{information}} {{in regards to}} the reproduction phase of the Gaoligong Pika group, due to the accessibility of their habitat, in order to be observed and studied further. However, it is considered to presumably follow similar reproductive characteristics of the family Ochotonidae. The family Ochotonidae has a gestation period of about 25-30 days. Female Pikas give birth after a month of gestation and stay with their young for the first month of their life. Pikas can carry from two to three litters of <b>leverets</b> every year, however because of their dependence on environmental factors and survival, especially during the winter, the survival of more than one litter is not probable. During the beginning of the spring season Pikas begin mating, once the winter season is over, marked by the melting of the snow. Pikas can begin mating at the age of one year and can live up to 3-4 years. However, Pikas do not spend much of their life mating, as mating does not occur till the spring season of each year. When <b>Leverets</b> are born they appear to have a minimal amount of fur and a full set of teeth. They remain with their eyes close up until the 9th day after their birth.|$|R

50|$|In Yukon, 30-day {{survival}} of radio-tagged <b>leverets</b> was 46%, 15%, and 43% for the first, second, and third litters of the year, respectively.

The main proximate cause of mortality was predation by small mammals, including red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii).
