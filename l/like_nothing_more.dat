5|$|Mrs. Puff is SpongeBob's {{paranoid}} driving {{teacher and}} the owner of the town boating school, which is similar to a driver's education facility. She would <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than to pass SpongeBob, as he is her most dedicated and hard-working student, but he routinely panics when he tries to drive a boat and fails every driving test he takes. His failures often result in crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her best to be friendly and patient with her students, Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob's unintentional recklessness exasperating. She is the long-standing love interest and girlfriend of Mr. Krabs.|$|E
500|$|While rejecting this {{thematic}} {{concern as}} unrealized by Argento, McDonagh {{noted that the}} result of the director's experiment is a strange [...] "architectural landscape" [...] that becomes the [...] "key element in differentiating Tenebrae from Argento's earlier gialli." [...] Argento's use of unusual architectural space and so-called visual [...] "hyper-realism" [...] results in an enormously fake looking environment. Seizing on the director's additional comment, [...] "...I dreamed an imaginary city in which the most amazing things happen", she notes that the film's [...] "fictive space couldn't be less 'real'", with its [...] "vast unpopulated boulevards, piazzas that look <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than suburban American malls, hard-edged Bauhaus apartment buildings, anonymous clubs and parking garages." [...] The EUR district of Rome, where much of Tenebrae was filmed, was built in preparation for the 1942 World's Fair, and intended by then-Prime Minister of Italy Benito Mussolini to be a celebration of twenty years of fascism. Rostock believes that Argento used this location as an attempt to realize his theme of an imaginary city; the district gives a glimpse of a future Rome that never was, showing the city how it might have looked had fascism not fallen.|$|E
500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a B+. Browne said, [...] "Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed {{instruments}} both acoustic and electric." [...] He praised several songs as being [...] "as powerful as anything the band has done." [...] Browne criticized the album's production, saying [...] "like many self-produced efforts, it shows." [...] He added, [...] "With arrangements that crest and {{fall to the}} point where a road map would have helped, the overlong (16-song) album is often unwieldy and could have benefited from judicious trimming." [...] Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "it might seem <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than heavy metal, but a closer listen reveals that Soundgarden haven't tempered their ambitions at all." [...] The reviewer for Melody Maker said that [...] "their roots don't matter now. All I care for now is the immediacy of their pop moments." [...] Critic Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention of one star, describing it as [...] "brutal depression simplified" [...] and highlighted by the songs [...] "Ty Cobb" [...] and [...] "Applebite", while Jason Josephes from Pitchfork Media called it a [...] "double shot of grunge, no foam but plenty of caffeine." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The One After the Superbowl" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Lisa Davis of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called the guest appearances [...] "a blatant ploy to boost ratings." [...] The Charlotte Observers Tim Goodman said the episode's [...] "pathetic infusion of 'star appeal'" [...] made him [...] "nauseous" [...] and {{commented that the}} producers [...] "should just make Bernie Kopell a regular {{and turn it into}} the Love Boat all over again." [...] Diane Holloway of the Austin American-Statesman also noted the similarities with the television series Love Boat, known for its many guest stars: [...] " [...] had a couple of chuckles, but came off like a young Love Boat." [...] Entertainment Weekly called the episode [...] "fragmented, poorly paced, and only sporadically funny. Cramming the already crowded ensemble with celebs may have been a ratings grabber ... but the results are forced sitcomedy and stilted acting," [...] specifically citing Van Damme. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that the episode [...] "feels <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a big stunt to follow the big game." [...] He {{went on to say that}} the cameos of Willard and Castellaneta [...] "offers easily the best parts of the program." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the Daddies were {{experiencing}} commercial success {{under the guise}} of swing revivalists, having been declared the [...] "leaders" [...] of the movement by Rolling Stone, the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism. While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands, the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia-based mentality. Perry explained to Spin in July 1998, [...] "it's not our mission to be a swing band. I'm not a guy from the '40s. That's why we play ska and use heavy guitars", noting elsewhere [...] "I can't fully take us out of the retro classification, but we harp on the fact that we're contemporary music". Thusly, the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands, selecting Latin rock group Ozomatli and ska/soul band The Pietasters as support on their first headlining U.S. tour, and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour. At one point, the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized; said Perry, [...] "I know there are people who come to our shows who'd <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than for us to play swing 24/7...there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only. We're trying to find the audience who'll let us write songs and just be who we are".|$|E

Graham Hassell writes, [...] "he {{intrusion}} of Pozzo and Lucky [...] seems <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a metaphor for Ireland's view of mainland Britain, where society has ever been blighted by a greedy ruling élite keeping the working classes passive and ignorant by whatever means." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Variety, Todd McCarthy {{said the}} film [...] "is well {{observed}} in many particulars but is too familiar in its basic trajectory to be fresh or compelling [...] [...] [...] All the roles {{are in good}} hands, and it's mildly amusing in a voyeuristic way to watch the likes of Paltrow behave as we might imagine stars do at a party [...] [...] [...] Although the digital video imprint is still evident, ace vet lenser John Bailey has {{gone a long way}} toward making this look like a celluloid-shot picture, most successfully in the bright, daytime scenes, less so at night or under low lighting conditions, where the images sometimes appear washed out." [...] The Anniversary Party currently holds a 60% rating on review aggragator Rotten Tomatoes based on 112 collected reviews with the consensus [...] "This Party features a killer cast and many funny scenes, but the movie feels <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than an excuse for the actors to emote." ...|$|E
2500|$|Helena Mulkerns in Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "a rich mood piece of broad proportions" [...] and [...] "a glorious aural mosaic". The title track [...] "sails the {{listener}} gently into an ebb-and-flow movement that permeates the album" [...] that contains multi-vocals she described as [...] "distinctive" [...] and [...] "striking". She thought Roma's lyrics were [...] "unornamented but compelling", but its mutli-lingual touches [...] "enrich" [...] the listening experience without becoming too dominating. Kristine McKenna, in the Los Angeles Times, wrote a critical review who described it as [...] "a portentous pastiche that's drawn comparisons to ecclesiastical choir and Gregorian chant, but in fact sounds <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than unusually windy New Age music" [...] which [...] "makes for bland, bloodless music ideal for elevators; this is a record about sound rather than lyrics, melody, {{or any of the other}} things that invest music with emotion and ideas." [...] In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Ned Raggett rated the album five stars out of five, writing that it [...] "established her as the unexpected queen of gentle, Celtic-tinged new age music" [...] with a subtlety that produced strong tracks as a result. Raggett concluded: [...] "It's a perfect combination of timelessness and technology, an appropriate end to this fine album".|$|E
2500|$|... "Don't Cha" [...] {{received}} mainly positive reviews. Sal Cinquemani of {{described the}} song as [...] "brassy and sassy" [...] adding that, [...] "the Pussycat Dolls have certainly carved a niche {{for themselves in}} 21st century pop history. Stephen Thomas Erlewine also favored the song saying [...] "there {{has never been a}} sex song quite as knowingly ironic yet undeniably sexy as this." [...] Writing for musicOMH John Murphy described [...] "Don't Cha" [...] as [...] "a silky, sexy little number that will become ubiquitous {{by the end of the}} month." [...] However, he added that Busta Rhymes is annoying. [...] "It's a shame that Busta Rhymes is as typically annoying as ever, but he doesn't spoil the song too much." [...] Spence D. from IGN wrote that the track's [...] "sultry swagger-n-shuffle is the type of stuff that nasty boys and girls might enjoy grinding to." [...] A reviewer from Contactmusic.com gave the song 4 out 5 stars favoring the [...] "serious dose of high energy and raunchy message," [...] while criticized the song for not having [...] "any vocal talent." [...] Lisa Haines from BBC described the track as [...] "memorable". She continued saying [...] " [...] a groovy R duet with Busta Rhymes, is easily the best." [...] Isaac McCalla from About.com praised the song. [...] "This single is a serious dose of high energy, wickedly fun and slammin' house music." [...] Azeem Ahmad also from musicOMH in a separate review commented, [...] "strangely enough 'Don't Cha' isn't purely eye candy." [...] However, he was critical stating: [...] "not even Busta Rhymes' cameo appearance can prevent Don't Cha from seeming <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a promo for some generic product aimed at young males." [...] Chuck Arnold and Ralph Novak of People magazine wrote that the group is [...] "responsible for [...] guiltiest pleasure." [...] Billboard named the song #30 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.|$|E

In the episode [...] "The Prodigal Returns", when Siegfried mistakenly thinks [...] "little brother" [...] is impersonating a client {{on the other end of}} the telephone line, a few home truths come out: [...] "Mr Biggins, if you've got it into your head that young Mr Farnon is a veterinary surgeon of any quality whatsoever, let me disabuse you of that idea immediately.

30|$|Secondly, Vavilov {{would have}} <b>liked</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than {{to stave off}} famine and {{starvation}} by improving essential food crops. This urgency was internal, fueling his desire to immediately begin the fight to end famine and poor crop yields. But, as any plant breeder can attest, such improvements are better measured in years rather than months. However, with the political rise of Trofin Lysenko, {{the son of a}} peasant, came a person promising immediate improvements based on accelerating the growth of plants by treating seeds with low temperatures and moisture. Following his work on plants in 1928, he called this process “vernalization.” Thus began the politicization of science, with Lysenko the peasant scientist on one extreme rejecting Mendelian science, and Vavilov, the progressive higly educated scientist on the other extreme, bringing modern science to his home country.|$|R

This was bad news for Mayor Muggins and the townsfolk, who are stuck living under a cloud all of the time, in this most unappealing of places. But it's good news for the crocodile, who <b>likes</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than to wallow in the muddy pools around town, slurping on jars of peanut butter and custard.

He betrays his original business partner, the Raccoon, in favor of a partnership with the shadowy Narn K corporation, but ends up dead when the Raccoon comes to confront Tony. When pistols were drawn, Tony found his weapon empty; the other underbosses rejected Tony's abandonment of the traditional family ways and distrusted the Narn K, so they let the Raccoon take his revenge and take the rackets that were initially promised to him.Unbeknownst to Tony, however, he was in fact being subtly controlled by the Narn K corporation by use of a Crim creature attached to his body. The Crim was able to influence him towards their favor, and apparently even Tony was unaware that he was being manipulated. When he was exhumed by Doc Horror, the bite of the Crim beast actually brought Tony back into a form of temporary half-life that allowed him to have one last conversation with his old rival. Before he dies again for good, Tony simply asks Horror to make sure nobody hurts his father.|$|R
