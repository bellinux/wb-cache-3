Continuing in [...] "Exit Wounds", Captain John is revealed to have rescued Jack's brother Gray from a group of sadistic captors, only to learn too late that Gray had been driven insane through being tortured over the years. Molecularly bonding a bomb to John's wrist to force him to obey his orders, Gray had John set off multiple bombs throughout Cardiff before taking Jack back in time to 27AD, where Jack is buried alive at the site that would become Cardiff in the future. However, John betrays Gray by leaving a tracking device on Jack in the shape of a ring, thus allowing Jack to be recovered by the Torchwood Institute and frozen in the morgue, escaping at the right moment to stop his brother. Having frozen Gray in cryopreservation, unwilling to witness any more death that day, Jack offers to help pinpoint another Rift event to allow John to leave, but John instead states his desire to travel Earth, commenting that he'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> what Jack finds so fascinating about the planet.|$|E

[...] He spoke quietly, {{although he was}} a little provoked at the tone of his companion.|$|R
5000|$|Nicias warns about Socrates' {{philosophical}} {{methods of}} getting the interlocuter to examine their own conscience. Laches states that he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> hear discussions that are [...] "musical", when a person's discourse is in tune with their actions.

40|$|Reading the {{proceedings}} of a successful conference which one did not attend is inevitable a somewhat tantalizing experience.

In addition there is, of course, the wider interest engendered by topics of which one knew little, but would certainly have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more by discussing them at first hand with the relevant specialists. The present volume is no exception...|$|R

Where there are neither telegraphs, railways, nor roads, any effective form of communication must--can only be purely personal.

I should have dearly <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> their new code and their manner of using it, but as I want to be a helpful friend to them--and as this implies not only trust, but the appearance of it--I had to school myself to patience.|$|R
