30|$|The soils used in road {{construction}} in “Sub-Saharan Africa” are mostly lateritic soils including <b>lateritic</b> <b>gravels,</b> <b>lateritic</b> clays and lateritic shales. Lateritic soils {{contribute to the}} general economy of the region where they are found (Lemougna et al. 2011). Their scope is very wide and include civil engineering, agronomic, mining research (iron, aluminum and manganese) deposits. In a tropical area such as Cameroon that is in a phase of infrastructural development, lateritic soils has been, and still a topic of interest and discussion. Due to the natural relative abundance of these soils, availability, favorable engineering properties, they have been very useful for construction of foundation, roads, airfields, low-cost housing and compacted fill in earth embankments (Gidigasu 1983; Autret 1983; Ekodeck 1984; Sikali and Mir-Emarati 1986; Bagarre 1990; Tardy 1992 Tockol et al. 1994; Ojo and Adeyemi 2003).|$|R
40|$|The geomorphological {{materials}} {{and forms of}} the Maraca area of Roraima, Brazil are described, an their sgnificance for land development examined. Significant contrasts are noted in areas presently under rainforest and savanna vegetation. <b>Lateritic</b> <b>gravels</b> and extensive shetwash accumulations in savanna areas constrast with incipient or absent plinthite development, few gravels and limited evidence of colluvium under rainforest. Terrain is in general relatively highly-dissected. Slope profiles are characterised, particularly within the savanna zone, by a relatively steep lower concavity. These contrasts are sharply-demarcated by the present savanna/rainforest bondary, unexpectedly {{in view of the}} generally accepted hypothesis of repeated contraction an expansion of Amazonian rainforest throughout the Pleistocene.

40|$|In many {{tropical}} {{countries the}} temperate zone specification {{has been adopted}} for the selection of highway materials. However, in some tropical countries, many <b>lateritic</b> <b>gravels</b> have been successfully used in road pavements {{despite the fact that}} they do not comply with the temperate zone specification requirements for particle size distribution, plasticity characteristics, and sometimes CBR. A specification for the use of tropical soils in road pavements needs to be developed, based on the genesis of the soils and the climatic environment. The laboratory characteristics and performance as a paving material, of a lateritic soil developed on sandstone in south-east Queensland, Australia, has been investigated. Based on the important features of the lateritic soil and its good performance as a road pavement, a criterion suitable for the selection of lateritic soil developed on sandstone as a paving material, under similar climatic conditions to those prevailing in south-east Queensland, has been proposed...|$|R
50|$|Soil types {{within the}} garden include neutral grey brigalow soil, light loams over clays, red <b>lateritic</b> acid <b>gravel,</b> and {{a layer of}} blue/grey clay. Some plantings, {{including}} some of the oldest in the eucalypt divisions, may not initially appear their age because of the growing conditions and the particular characteristics of the plants. Plants are often marked with a timber stake with identification tags that include their species and planting date.|$|R
40|$|<b>Gravel</b> <b>lateritic</b> {{soils are}} intensively used in road {{geotechnical}} engineering. This material is largely representative of engineering soil {{all around the}} tropical African Countries [1, 2]. <b>Gravel</b> <b>lateritic</b> soils from parts of Burkina Faso and Senegal (West Africa) are {{used to determine the}} evolution of the geotechnical parameters from one to ten cycles of modified Proctor compaction. This test procedure is non-common for geotechnical purposes and it was found suitable and finally adopted to describe how these problematic soils behave when submitted to a multi-cyclic set of Modified Proctor compactions (OPM) [3, 4]. On another hand, we propose a correlation between the traffic and the cycles of compaction considered as the repeated load. From that, this work shows the generation of active fine particles, the decrease of the CBR index and also the mechanical characteristics (mainly the Young Modulus, E) that contribute at least to the main deformation of the road structure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} geological {{aspects of}} the southwestern Brazilian Amazon and analyzes the geotechnical characteristics and mechanical behavior of <b>lateritic</b> <b>gravel</b> soils of this region in the country. The soils in this paper {{were divided into two}} groups: soils selected for the BR- 429 /RO project and a laterite deposit located in the Porto Velho city. Resilient modulus was determined by repeated load triaxial test for determination and evaluation of the total permanent deformation considering various stress states.

40|$|Economic {{feasibility}} of soil moisture conservation in coconut production using coconut husks and coir dust was {{examined in this}} study. The preliminary data for the study were collected from two trials conducted by the CRI along with the several other secondary information. The results of the analysis revealed that calculated benefit-cost rations and Net Present Values are financially and economically acceptable under all the scenaries addressed in this study. Three different interest rates, such as 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 18 per cent, and two effective time periods (viz. six and nine years) {{were used for the}} analysis. Based on the estimated economic parameters, it is concluded that the efforts on moisture conservation using coconut husks and coir dust in <b>lateritic</b> <b>gravel</b> and sandy soils are economically viable propositions. As the initial cost of investment is substantial, other means to overcome the problems of financial constraints in investment may be looked into...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a long term 3 x 3 x 3 NPK field {{experiment}} with coconut from the seedling stage upto initial bearing period on a <b>lateritic</b> <b>gravel</b> soil in Sri Lanka, where the rates of fertilizers were progressively increased upto the 16 th year, are discussed. The data from the sulphate of ammonia, 1. 136 kg saphos phosphate and 2. 043 kg muriate of potash/palm/yr from the 16 th year. Application of 1. 362 kg each of sulphate of ammonia, saphos phosphate and muriate of potash between the 9 th and the 16 th years produced an yield of 20. 7 kg copra/palm/yr from the 13 th to the 16 th years, which is about 150 perc. higher than the plots which received no fertilizer from the seedling stage. The data suggest that in the current fertilizer recommendations, for both young and adult palms, the rate of N could be reduced and that of K increased...|$|E
40|$|Motor {{vehicles}} dominate Australia's transport system, {{for both}} travel and freight; consequently the road network in Australia is {{of critical importance}} to {{the social and economic}} welfare of our nation and to national and regional growth. About 90 % of this network is constructed of compacted unbound granular materials with thin bituminous seals. Many of these granular pavements were not designed to carry the current traffic volumes or increased axle mass loadings; and are therefore highly likely to require some form of remedial works in the near future. Stabilisation with cement is becoming increasingly important as a means to upgrade or recycle existing materials in deteriorated pavements due to the economic, social and environmental benefits. With limited road maintenance funding and increasing heavy vehicle axle loads reducing pavement life; cementitious stabilisation is an ideal low-cost pavement rehabilitation technique that can improve the strength and durability of the overlying pavement materials and thereby enhance traffic carrying capacity {{over a longer period of}} time. It is advantageous to know the cement content of the improved material to ensure an appropriate design and to predict the future performance of the pavement. Being able to determine the cement content of stabilised basecourse is also an important diagnostic tool which can be used to help ascertain the cause of failures. Various methods for determination of the cement content of basecourse material are currently specified in road construction projects to verify that the requisite levels of stabilisation are achieved. These methods however are limited by the variability of the pavement materials and the costs and delays associated with test procedures. An investigation into the determination of the cement content of stabilised road base was undertaken utilising a test method trialled in 2009 in order to develop and validate the method. A range of typical Western Australian basecourse materials were assessed when stabilised with General Purpose cement. They included limestone and crushed rock base from the Perth Metropolitan area; scree gravel from the Pilbara region; high plasticity index (PI) gravel from the Wheatbelt region; and <b>lateritic</b> <b>gravel</b> from the Midwest region. The main focus areas were to confirm the suitability of the method for testing of cement content in more extreme road base materials; and to establish the long term veracity of the test method by testing samples at increasing hydration periods. Following the laboratory testing of the limestone samples it was concluded that the test method is not considered suitable for testing on granular pavement material with either; a high calcium carbonate content or granular pavement material whereby the material reacts strongly with hydrochloric acid to the extent that more than 10 % of the original mass is consumed. Testing based on the results obtained for the Mid-West <b>Lateritic</b> <b>Gravel</b> and the Wheatbelt North High PI Gravel samples indicate that the test method is reliable for these materials at one month hydration. However the predicted cement content values achieved for the Pilbara Scree Gravel samples and the Crushed Rock Base samples at one month hydration and were not consistent with the actual cement addition. The predicted cement content values achieved for all tested basecourse types then showed a marked decrease over the 3, 6 and 12 month hydration periods and it was therefore concluded that the test method is not suitable for cement content determination where the hydration period is three months or longer. Further testing utilising the test method is recommended as continued research into stabilisation processes should be promoted as they can potentially improve the performance and the cost of maintaining and upgrading the road network, which is vital for the continued growth, prosperity and well-being of the Australian nation...|$|E
40|$|A {{visit to}} The Gambia {{was carried out}} by the British Geological Survey in December 2011 as part of the {{assistance}} offered to the Gambian Geological Department to establish a geological laboratory (referred to as the ‘GeoLab’). In order to establish the test work requirements for the GeoLab, a number of mineral deposits and operations were visited in the Greater Banjul Area. These included a building sand deposit in Batu Kunku, a heavy mineral sand deposit in Tujereng, heavy mineral processing operation in Sanyang North, brick clay operation in Bafuloto, the Marisa Brickworks and its clay deposit in Faraba Bant and the <b>lateritic</b> <b>gravel</b> quarrying area in Faraba Bant. In addition, companies and organisations with a stake in the establishment of a GeoLab at the Geological Department were consulted including Moukhtara Holdings Company Ltd, the Gambian Roads Authority, the Gambian Technical Training Institute and the National Environment Agency. It is recommended that a fully costed laboratory development plan is drawn up to encompass the equipment procurement, installation and commissioning; staff training; development of a test work programme; and maintenance of the test work capability. The mineral resources of The Gambia are limited and restricted to Upper Tertiary and Quaternary sedimentary sequences. The most significant are silica sand, heavy mineral sand, kaolin, brick clay, laterite and cockle shells. The top priority of the Geological Department is the identification and provision of information on construction materials especially for the Greater Banjul Area. It is recommended that the Geological Department establish a capability for the testing of brick and ceramic clay, building sand, cockle shells, construction aggregate, heavy mineral sand and imported mineral products. The proposed GeoLab will consist of four rooms including sample reception, sample preparation, mineral evaluation and storage. The recommended laboratory equipment includes balances (weighing equipment), a binocular microscope, clay testing equipment, a drying oven and furnace, general laboratory equipment and particle-size analysis equipment...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} {{the results of}} detailed mapping and analysis of structures encountered in Seguelen pit of Siguiri gold mine, Guinea, where the Siguiri mine is geo-tectonically located in the Baoulé-Mossi domain of Man Shield in West African craton. The gold deposit is hosted in low-grade metamorphic sediments of turbidites sequences which form part of the Lower Proterozoic of Birimian Super group. Three rock formations of Balato, Fatoya and Kintinian underlay the overall pits. The Siguiri gold mine {{is characterized by the}} deep weathering profile, developed over the rocks reaching 200 m below the surface in some areas and often capped by the <b>lateritic</b> <b>gravel</b> or duricrust. The rock formations at Seguelen area are characterised by strong bedding monotonously dipping towards SW and trending NW-SE. The lithology of the host rocks has strong control on the disseminated mineralisation throughout the deposit. Two domains of rock formations are clearly distinguished at Seguelen:  Fatoya Formation(Ffm) domain; and  Kintinian Formation (Kfm) domain. The two domains are separated by a contact zone of 1. 7 m wide parallel to bedding and characterised by the presence of quartz fragments as well as thinly sheeted shale and black shale. This contact zone is identified as disconformity. The major tectonic deformation which has affected the region is known as D 2 corresponding to the Eburnean orogeny. The major D 2 related structures is the regional thrust striking N-S over an area of 12 km long and 3 km wide and within which corridors all Siguiri gold Mine open pits are located. In the N-S trending structures, there is east-northeast shortening and north-northwest extension. There is pervasive hydrothermal alteration (carbonatization and sideritization) and supergene alteration in the all pits. The hydrothermal alteration attests the intensity of hydrothermal fluid-flow over the host rocks. The hydrothermal fluids flowed along the fractures and within the wall rocks through bedding plans to form numerous auriferous quartz veins bearing disseminated sulphides through chemical reaction between fluids and wall rocks, which are remarkable at Seguelen pit. Three quartz vein sets are distinguished at Seguelen:  NNE-SSW quartz vein set  NE-SW quartz vein set  NW-SE quartz vein set The NE-SW and NNE-SSW quartz veins are often lenticular and associated with the bulk mineralisation...|$|E
