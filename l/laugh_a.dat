500|$|While {{he is in}} the [...] "Island", Homer is {{repeatedly}} gassed by unexpected objects, {{a reference}} to the way Number Six would often be gassed in The Prisoner. [...] "George [...] and I used to <b>laugh</b> <b>a</b> lot about how often [...] would be gassed by unexpected devices in the show", Scully said in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] "And we wanted to cram as many in as we could." [...] While escaping the [...] "Island", Homer is chased by a [...] "big balloon". The balloon is a reference to Rover, a floating white ball in The Prisoner that was created to keep inhabitants in the [...] "Village", which was also featured in the season 9 episode The Joy of Sect. The music heard in the scene is based on The Prisoners theme music.|$|E

Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{described the}} criticism of the save-the-whales conservationists as a [...] "delightfully savage ridicule". Brian Jacks of MTV complimented the show's focus on whale conservation, writing, [...] "Leave it to the hard-hitting folks at South Park to do more for conservationism than fifteen cable reality shows put together." [...] Josh Modell of The A.V. Club said the episode was unfunny and mocked a television series that was [...] "culturally insignificant" [...] and not particularly well-known. Modell wrote, [...] "The show's star, Paul Watson, seems to have really pissed off South Park's creators Parker and Stone [...] Fine, but could you make me <b>laugh</b> <b>a</b> few times while you beat me {{over the head with}} information about a guy that I couldn't care less about?" ...|$|E
500|$|For a comic subject Verdi {{considered}} Cervantes's Don Quixote {{and plays}} by Goldoni, Molière and Labiche, but found {{none of them}} wholly suitable. The singer Victor Maurel sent him a French libretto based on Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Verdi liked it, but replied that [...] "to deal with it properly you need a Rossini or a Donizetti". Following the success of Otello in 1887 he commented, [...] "After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to <b>laugh</b> <b>a</b> little." [...] He confided his ambition to the librettist of Otello, Arrigo Boito. Boito said nothing at the time, but he secretly began work on a libretto based on The Merry Wives of Windsor with additional material taken from Henry IV, parts 1 and 2. Many composers had set the play to music, with little success, among them Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf (1796), Antonio Salieri (1799), Michael William Balfe (1835) and Adolphe Adam (1856). The first version to secure {{a place in the}} operatic repertoire was Otto Nicolai's The Merry Wives of Windsor in 1849, but its success was largely confined to German opera houses.|$|E

500|$|... "Christmas Wishes" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Hollywood.com writer Hannah Lawrence enjoyed the episode, writing, [...] "as an episode, [...] had that certain… 'spirit' that I enjoy from Office episodes." [...] She also complimented the Erin-Andy relationship arc. IGN writer Cindy White, although {{noting that the}} episode [...] "had some big obstacles to overcome" [...] with the absences of both Michael Scott and Pam Halpert," [...] concluded that the episode had a [...] "high rewatch factor." [...] She wrote, [...] "If my Christmas wish was to watch an episode of The Office that made me <b>laugh</b> <b>a</b> lot, consider that wish granted." [...] She ultimately gave the episode 8.0/10. M. Giant of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+". Margaret Lyons from New York wrote a mostly positively review, saying Christmas Wishes' filled me with holiday cheer, proving that there's still some juice left in this show," [...] before noting that [...] "There are still some issues left, too, though." [...] What Culture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer praised Mindy Kaling and Ed Helms' writing and directing work, and said, [...] "If {{this is what happens}} when cast members ... take the reins then the writing and directing duties should be kept in house much more often." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Otello Verdi commented, [...] "After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to <b>laugh</b> <b>a</b> little." [...] He had {{considered}} a variety of comic subjects but had found none of them wholly suitable and confided his ambition to Boito. The librettist said nothing at the time but secretly began work on a libretto based on The Merry Wives of Windsor with additional material taken from Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2. Verdi received the draft libretto probably in early July 1889 after he had just read Shakespeare's play: [...] "Benissimo! Benissimo!... No one could have done better than you", he wrote back to Boito. But he still had doubts: his age, his health (which he admits to being good) {{and his ability to}} complete the project: [...] "If I were not to finish the music?". If the project failed, {{it would have been a}} waste of Boito's time, and have distracted him from completing his own new opera. Finally on 10 July 1889 he wrote again: [...] "So be it! So let's do Falstaff! For now, let's not think of obstacles, of age, of illnesses!" [...] Verdi emphasised the need for secrecy, but continued [...] "If you are in the mood, then start to write." [...] Later he wrote to Boito (capitals and exclamation marks are Verdi's own): [...] "What joy to be able to say to the public: HERE WE ARE AGAIN!!! COME AND SEE US!" ...|$|E

2500|$|A third {{sequel to}} Gamesmanship, was {{published}} in 1958 under the title of Supermanship. Its publisher, Rupert Hart-Davis, privately wrote of the book, [...] "Gamesmanship made me <b>laugh</b> <b>a</b> lot, and its two successors were just good enough (all three still sell prodigiously), but the world has moved (deathwards, you may say) {{in the last ten}} years, and Potter hasn't budged an inch. In truth the joke is played out, but he won't face the fact. This manuscript consists of a bunch of marginal articles, written during the past six years and slung together with the minimum of care." [...] Some critics agreed. The New Yorker commented, [...] "his methods and the point of view behind them don't seem as funny or as sharp as they once did, possibly because they are no longer surprising, or possibly because he is getting a little tired of his own joke." [...] But Edmund Wilson remained a fan of Potter, praising [...] "the brevity and compactness of the presentation. As in any practical manual, the principles are stated and concisely illustrated. Nothing goes on too long." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{show has}} been criticized for being too {{derivative}} of The Simpsons, with both exemplifying a working-class family with three children. Several episodes of The Simpsons, including [...] "," [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIII," [...] and [...] "The Italian Bob", have poked fun at Family Guy, with the latter two implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of plagiarism. However, both MacFarlane and Simpsons creator Matt Groening have said that there is no serious feud {{between the two of them}} and their shows. At the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International on July 24, 2010, The Simpsons writer Matt Selman jokingly referred to MacFarlane, stating, [...] "Come on, Seth MacFarlane does one show three times." [...] Selman later backed away from the comment, adding, [...] "Those shows are all really funny – they deserve to exist." [...] The animated film , based on Groening's show Futurama, featured a Family Guy <b>Laugh</b> <b>a</b> Month calendar. In a comic book crossover between Groening's two shows, The Simpsons / Futurama Crossover Crisis, Family Guy character Brian Griffin is depicted on a television in Hell.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Bianca Jackson has received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike. EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer has described Bianca as [...] "one {{of the most}} popular characters EastEnders has ever had", while James Rampton, journalist for The Independent, has commented that she is [...] "adored". Palmer has suggested that viewers [...] "rooted" [...] for Bianca because [...] "people love a stroppy girl". In 2000, she commented, [...] " [...] makes them <b>laugh.</b> <b>A</b> character like that is about living out your fantasies. Everybody would love to be like Bianca and really say what they think." [...] Following her exit from the serial in September 1999, Palmer said that members of the public would approach her to plead with her to return to EastEnders, as they missed her character and relationship with Ricky. She commented in 2000, [...] "It makes me feel bad. I sometimes think I should go back [...] for everyone else's sake." [...] When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the Birmingham Evening Post said [...] "Good riddance!"
