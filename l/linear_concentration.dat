40|$|ABSTRACT: X-ray radiographs of box cores {{of shelf}} sand {{off the coast}} of California and Oregon show <b>linear</b> <b>concentrations</b> of grains opaque to X-rays. A number of the lines cross one another, {{suggesting}} that they are of biogenic origin. Experimental studies how that infaunal polychaetes such as Nephtys produce similar concentrations of heavy minerals as they move through sand. A similar origin is postulated for the observed concentrations in the shelf-sand box cores. Howard and Reineck, in their analysis of the depositional facies off the Southern Cal-ifornia coast, found one sedimentary struc-ture particularly difficult to explain (1981, p. 818). Well expressed in X-ray radiographs of sandy cores taken in water depths between 15 and 33 m, the structure appears as <b>linear</b> <b>concentrations</b> of grains, presumably heavy minerals, that are opaque to X-rays. Howard and Reineck state that the most plausible x-planation of the structure, based on an ex-periment hat I conducted, is that it repre-sents the traces of a burrowing polychaete that concentrates heavy minerals along the bottom of its burrow. This note describes the experiment. The structure in question appears on pos-itive radiograph prints as primarily subhor-izontal, slightly sinuous lines a fraction of a millimeter thick and up to 8 cm long. The structure somewhat resembles ripple lami-nation; the lines intersect in places, however, and therefore cannot be bedding structures. Details of the structure suggest hat it is biogenic. Some lines occur in pairs, forming roughly parallel lines about a millimeter apart that locally converge to a single line. Above the lines are subtle, lighter-toned halos about 3 mm thick that indicate greater penetration of the X-rays. The radiographs also show dark, concave-up, aired arcuate lines about 3 mm long and about 2 mrn apart. Above the pair of arcs is an elliptical lighter-colored hal...|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} for a spontaneous spin polarization in a quantum wire positioned in a zero magnetic field are analyzed under weak population of one-dimensional subbands that {{gives rise to the}} efficient quenching of the kinetic energy by the exchange energy of carriers. The critical <b>linear</b> <b>concentration</b> of carriers above which the quasi one-dimensional gas undergoes a complete spin depolarization is determined by the Hartree-Fock approximation. The dependence of the critical <b>linear</b> <b>concentration</b> on the concentration of carriers is defined to reveal the interplay of the spin depolarization with the evolution of the 0. 7 (2 e 2 /h) feature in the quantum conductance staircase from the e 2 /h to 3 / 2 (e 2 /h) values. This dependence is used to study the effect of the hole concentration on the 0. 7 (2 e 2 /h) feature in the quantum conductance staircase of the quantum wire prepared inside the p-type silicon quantum well using the split-gate technique. The 1 D channel is demonstrated to be spin-polarized at the <b>linear</b> <b>concentration</b> of holes lower than the critical <b>linear</b> <b>concentration,</b> because the 0. 7 (2 e 2 /h) feature is close to the value of 0. 5 (2 e 2 /h) that indicates the spin degeneracy lifting for the first step of the quantum conductance staircase.
