40|$|Safety of <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> {{transport}} {{is directly}} related to the operation safety of <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> transport enterprise. Aiming at the problem of the high accident rate and large harm in <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> logistics transportation, this paper took the group decision making problem based on integration and coordination thought into a multiagent multiobjective group decision making problem; a secondary decision model was established and applied to the safety assessment of <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> transport enterprise. First of all, we used dynamic multivalue background and entropy theory building the first level multiobjective decision model. Secondly, experts were to empower according to the principle of clustering analysis, and combining with the relative entropy theory to establish a secondary rally optimization model based on relative entropy in group decision making, and discuss the solution of the model. Then, after investigation and analysis, we establish the <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> transport enterprise safety evaluation index system. Finally, case analysis to five <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> transport enterprises in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region validates the feasibility and effectiveness of this model <b>for</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> transport enterprise recognition, which provides vital decision making basis <b>for</b> recognizing the <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> transport enterprises...|$|R
40|$|Objectives of {{this work}} are: the {{assessment}} of a proposed methodology for design of safe transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> through road tunnels in Greece, {{the development of an}} integrated training system <b>for</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles drivers and their trainers that will include effective response to incidents with involvement of <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> {{and the development of a}} relevant Emergency Response plan. To implement these objectives the methodology used was: (a) Started with extended bibliographic review of <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> road transport design principles and guidelines, review of response systems for road incidents where / when <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> are involved and review of available technologies that support incident management systems. From this review concluded to basic principles and guidelines that are included in the proposed Emergency Response Plan. (b) Modern technologies that contribute to safe operation and successful handling of emergency incidents on road or in tunnels were analyzed. Specifically were analyzed technologies that support drivers of <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles and help them to exhibit safe behaviors and to prevent accidents. Analyzed available technology included systems that help tracking of vehicle and monitoring of <b>dangerous</b> <b>good</b> conditions as well vehicle drivers’ conditions. (c) The proposed risk assessment methodology was applied on large number of different types of Greek road tunnels; there was research to determine the required field or bibliography data. Results were analyzed in order to prove that this method is applicable to Greek conditions, helping effective and transparent decision making. The proposed methodology will support decisions on the use or not of tunnels for road transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods,</b> will support with quantitative estimates proposals for improving safety conditions of road tunnels and effective measures or actions for successful handling of incidents with <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> on road or in tunnels. (d) Available training systems and courses <b>for</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> drivers in Greece, Europe, US and Canada were reviewed. The main elements of these programs were examined: content, duration, supporting material, praxis, on job testing, assessment, certification aiming to identify best practices, gaps and opportunities. The proposed new training program is closing gaps while using the most effective practices. Results conclusions {{of this work}} are: (ι) The assessed and proposed methodology to estimate and assess risks <b>for</b> transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>good</b> through road tunnels is applicable in Greece. (ιι) The proposed integrated training program <b>for</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> vehicle drivers and their trainers will cover the everlasting need for up to date comprehensive effective training programs. (ιιι) The proposed emergency Response plan for incident with involvement of vehicles transporting <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> on highways or through road tunnels meets special requirements as set by contemporary experience and recent European regulations. (ιν) The work includes proposals for systemic measures that will improve safety of <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> road transportation in Greece. Research relating with this work can continue on the subject of emergency incidents management and specifically on processes relating with people evacuation from tunnels. ...|$|R
