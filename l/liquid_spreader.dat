40|$|The {{impact of}} {{livestock}} farming on {{the incidence of}} human Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection was assessed by using several livestock density indicators (LDI) that were generated in a systematic approach. A total of 80 LDI were considered suitable proxy measures for livestock density. Multivariate Poisson regression identified several LDI as having a significant spatial association with the incidence of human STEC infection. The strongest associations with human STEC infection were the ratio of beef cattle number to human population {{and the application of}} manure to the surface of agricultural land by a solid spreader and by a <b>liquid</b> <b>spreader</b> showed. This study demonstrates the value of using a systematic approach in identifying LDI and other spatial predictors of disease...|$|E

40|$|For {{the farming}} {{industry}} {{it is essential}} to use liquid manure as natural fertilizer. Through new agricultural regulation 2015 in Germany the industry must develop new <b>liquid</b> manure <b>spreader</b> systems because the ammonia and methane emission are limited. In a research project the University of Applied Sciences Zwickau and some other industry partners will develop such a new innovative <b>liquid</b> manure <b>spreader.</b> The new <b>liquid</b> manure <b>spreader</b> should use pulsating air to distribute the liquid manure exactly. The pulsating air, which flows through the pipelines, should be analysed at a test station. For examinations at this test station it is important to find another substitute fluid because liquid manure smells strong, is not transparent and is also not homogeneous enough for scientific investigations. Furthermore it is important to ensure that the substitute fluid is, like liquid manure, a non-Newtonian fluid. The substitute fluid must be a shear-thinning substance - this means the viscosity decrease at higher shear rate. Many different samples like soap-water-farragoes, jelly-water-farragoes, agar-water-farragoes, soap-ethanol-farragoes and more are, for the project, examined in regard of their physical properties to find the best substitute fluid. The samples are examined at the rotational viscometer for viscosity at various shear rates and then compared with the viscosity values of liquid manure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a new thermal management approach for cooling of power semiconductor devices. This new approach {{is based on}} a liquid metal fluid flow in order to spread the heat and evacuate it to the ambient. The work presented in this paper is considered as a first step to design and realize a <b>liquid</b> metal heat <b>spreader</b> (LMHS) for power electronics devices. In {{the first part of the}} paper, the geometry of a LMHS is described. In the second part, a fully multiphysics numerical study is presented. In order to demonstrate the advantage of the <b>liquid</b> metal heat <b>spreader,</b> a thermal performances comparison with a copper spreader (having the same external dimensions) is presented in the last part of this paper. First results show that the thermal resistance of the system could by reduced by about 40 % using this new cooling solution...|$|R
40|$|Performance of {{wheel and}} track running gear on <b>liquid</b> manure <b>spreaders.</b> Can. Agric. Eng. 42 : 019 - 025. A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} characterize soil-vehicle interactions and to measure tractor power/fuel requirements when hauling a fully loaded tank spreader (18 m 3) fitted with rubber tracks (2721 x 635), high flotation tires (28 L 26) or conventional truck tires (445 / 65 R 22. 5). A second objective was to apply an existing soil compaction model to the data from this field trial and to determine if its estimates of wheel rut depth were reasonable. The experiment {{was carried out in}} late autumn on a harvested soybean field (silt loam soil) located in southwestern Ontario. Fuel consumption and drawbar draft were measured during the traffic treatments with an instrumented tractor, and selected soil properties were measured afterwards. An analytical-type soil compaction model was used to estimate the wheel rut depth for the two pneumatic tire treatments. The type of running gear had a highl...|$|R
40|$|This Corrective Action Investigation Plan (CAIP) {{contains}} the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Operations Offices's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate corrective action alternatives appropriate for the closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 127 under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Action Unit 127 {{is located on the}} Nevada Test Site approximately 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. This CAU is comprised of 12 Corrective Action Sites (CASs) located at Test Cell C; the Engine Maintenance, Assembly, and Disassembly (E-MAD) Facility; the X-Tunnel in Area 25; the Pluto Disassembly Facility; the Pluto Check Station; and the Port Gaston Training Facility in Area 26. These CASs include: CAS 25 - 01 - 05, Aboveground Storage Tank (AST); CAS 25 - 02 - 02, Underground Storage Tank (UST); CAS 25 - 23 - 11, Contaminated Materials; CAS 25 - 12 - 01, Boiler; CAS 25 - 01 - 06, AST; CAS 25 - 01 - 07, AST; CAS 25 - 02 - 13, UST; CAS 26 - 01 - 01, Filter Tank (Rad) and Piping; CAS 26 - 01 - 02, Filter Tank (Rad); CAS 26 - 99 - 01, Radioactively Contaminated Filters; CAS 26 - 02 - 01, UST; CAS 26 - 23 - 01, Contaminated <b>Liquids</b> <b>Spreader.</b> Based on site history, process knowledge, and previous field efforts, contaminants of potential concern for CAU 127 include radionuclides, metals, total petroleum hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Additionally, beryllium may be present at some locations. The sources of potential releases are varied, but releases of contaminated liquids may have occurred and may have migrated into and impacted soil below and surrounding storage vessels at some of the CASs. Also, at several CASs, asbestos-containing materials may be present on the aboveground structures and may be friable. Exposure pathways are limited to ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact (adsorption) of soils/sediments or liquids, or inhalation of contaminants by site workers due to disturbance of contaminated materials. Future land-use scenarios limit subsequent uses of the CASs to various nonresidential (i. e., industrial) activities. Field activities will consist of radiological walkover and screening surveys, and field-screening and collecting of both tank content and soil samples, and further sample testing as appropriate. A two-step data quality objective strategy will be followed: (1) Phase I will be to collect environmental samples for laboratory analysis to confirm {{the presence or absence of}} contaminants at concentrations exceeding preliminary action levels; and (2) Phase II will be to collect additional environmental samples for laboratory analysis to determine the extent of contamination identified in Phase I. The results of this field investigation will support a defensible evaluation of corrective action alternatives in the corrective action decision document...|$|R
