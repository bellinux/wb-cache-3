40|$|Sn whisker {{growth on}} {{electronics}} {{continues to be}} a widespread industrial concern. In this study, detailed metallurgical analyses were done on whiskers growing from solder joints formed on leaded components. The whiskers appeared after life testing for 10 days at 60 °C and 20 - 30 % RH with voltage cycling. Optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with EDX following by cross-sections through whiskers were performed. The analyses revealed that Sn whiskers originated not from the component <b>lead</b> <b>plating</b> as was expected, but from bulk SAC 405 or SAC 305 solder. A high precision metallographic technique using progressive polishing was developed to examine the details of whisker formation. This paper discusses the microstructural relationship between the whiskers, hillocks, and shell-like protrusions and the following factors: solder microstructure and its modification during oxidation and corrosion, Alloy 42 lead frame material, <b>lead</b> <b>plating</b> quality, component contamination and flux on solder...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{moisture}} resistance tests of various multilayer top brazed ceramic flat packs and leaded and unleaded chip carriers has revealed a serious design defect. These packages, which utilize a tungsten interconnect system, {{in the presence}} of high humidity, suffer a galvanic corrosion which anodically consumes the tungsten.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are three-fold; firstly to improve the bond ability of high reliability gold wire with 99 % purity of gold on fine pitch lead frame, secondly to improve second bond quality and reliability using optimal bonding tools and material selection and thirdly, to improve machine stability and efficiency during production mode. All the efforts will be done on the granular type capillary and comparing them with the conventional polished surface capillary. The bonding tool morphology on wire bond quality and production yield using 20 µm ultra fine pitch wire bonded on Argentums plating lead frame were characterized. Quantitative wedge pull test with statistical analysis and internal physical inspection using Scanning Electron Microscopy were carried out for both samples at 0 h after production, 96 and 192 h after high temperature storage and after 500 and 1000 cycle of thermal cycle test. Cross section analysis was also performed to study the alloy formation between wire and <b>lead</b> <b>plating.</b> Results show that significant improvement of wedge strength using granular type capillary as compared to conventional polished capillary with p-value of 0. 000, 0. 000 and 0. 042 for samples at 0 and 96 h of high temperature storage and 1000 times of thermal cycle test.

40|$|Many of the {{cultural}} heritages {{in the world have}} been totally or partly destroyed by natural events and human activities such as earthquake, flood and fire until the present day. Cultural heritages are legacy for us as well; it is also a fiduciary for next generation. To deliver this fiduciary to the future generations, cultural heritages have to be protected and registered. There are different methods for applying this registry but Photogrammetry is the most accurate and rapid method. Photogrammetry enables us to registry cultural heritages and generating 3 D photo-realistic models. Nowadays, 3 D models are being used in various fields such as education and tourism. In registration of complex and high construction by Photogrammetry, there are some problems in data acquisition and processing. Especially for high construction's photographs, some additional equipment is required such as balloon and lifter. In recent years The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are commonly started to be used in different fields for different goals. In Photogrammetry, The UAVs are being used for particularly data acquisition. It is not always easy to capture data due to the situation of historical places and their neighbourhood. The use of UAVs for documentation of cultural heritage will make an important contribution. The main goals of this study are to survey cultural heritages by Photogrammetry and to investigate the potential of UAVs in 3 D modelling. In this purpose we surveyed Gedik Ahmet Pasha Mosque photogrammetricly by UAV and will produce photorealistic 3 D model. Gedik Ahmet Pasha, The Grand Vizier of Fatih Sultan Mehmet, has been in Afyonkarahisar during the campaign to Karaman between the years of 1472 – 1473. He wanted Architect Ayaz Agha to build a complex of Bathhouse, Mosque and a Madrasah here, Afyon, due to admiration of this city. Gedik Ahmet Pasha Mosque is in the centre of this complex. Gedik Ahmet Pasha Mosque is popularly known as Imaret Mosque among the people of Afyon. Gedik Ahmet Pasha Complex is a foundation. For this reason all its expenses are recorded. Furthermore renovations of all buildings in this complex are placed on them with a inscription. According to records and inscriptions The Imaret Mosque has been restored several times. The two significant of these restorations were made after the earthquakes in 1668 and 1792. Lastly, after the renewing <b>lead</b> <b>plating</b> of domes in 1969, the Mosque has gotten its current final situation. The dimensions of Mosque are 29. 20 x 35. 40 in meter and it has built by a plan of inverse capital (T). There are two domes covering the main worship and {{it is one of the}} most important examples of Ottoman architecture with three of dome both side in direction of east to west. At the north side of the Mosque, there is a place for last congregations with five domes. Minaret is at the north-east side of the mosque. It has got one balcony (surrounding the minaret) and has been structured by cut stone with a shape of fluting. It has been covered by dark blue tile between these flutings. The main gate of mosque is made of pen inlaid marble. It is aimed to survey Gedik Ahmet Pasha Mosque photogrammetricly and to model it in 3 D photo-realistic. In this study, South NTS- 352 Total Station is used to constitute a closed polygon with 8 point. We used 350 ground control point in the field study. It is made levelling to measure elevation of polygon points. For photographs, we used Canon A 180 camera and UAV. Photomodeler software is used to process both camera's and UAV's photographs independently. The facades of mosque are derived and all 3 D models of Mosque were merged. This merged model is covered with high resolution photographs for obtaining 3 D photo-realistic models of Gedik Ahmet Pasha Mosque...|$|E

40|$|For {{the first}} time, this paper {{discloses}} {{the use of}} flowing water for capturing atmospheric ions into a DC electricity. The proposed methodology can be employed to neutralize the positively charged pollutants in air, which {{are believed to be}} harmful to our health. Methodology: Atmospheric ions can be collected by a negatively charged antenna which comprises a dielectric layer sandwiched between a top aluminium layer and a bottom <b>lead</b> <b>plate.</b> The top aluminium layer is used to collect the ambient protons, whilst the bottom <b>lead</b> <b>plate</b> is negatively charged by a negative static electricity extracted from flowing water. The voltage has been measured between the top aluminium layer and the bottom <b>lead</b> <b>plate</b> with and without any sunlight. Results: Without any UV light or other electromagnetic disturbance, the generated voltage has rapidly increased from 200 mV to 480 mV within 5 seconds if the bottom <b>lead</b> <b>plate</b> is connected to the negative ion source. Without the negative ion source, however, the output voltage fell to around 10 mV and any significant voltage rise can be observed even in the presence of an UV light. Conclusions: Capturing atmospheric ions is technically feasible. Measured results suggest that, when used in conjunction with a negative ion source, the proposed device can harvest atmospheric ions without any UV light. </p...|$|R
