But the lock bandwidth has to reach 10 MHz or higher. The current-to-frequency transfer function of DFB lasers is complex: thermal effects at low frequency, carrier physics at high frequency, and a [1 MHz- 20 MHz] transition zone in which the phase and amplitude show variations that prevent from <b>locking</b> <b>in</b> the MHz <b>range.</b> Adding a phase modulator in feed-forward (FF) configuration allows convenient control of the laser frequency, in excess of 15 MHz, and convenient+efficient line narrowing with commercial, off the shelf components of the telecom industry...|$|R
40|$|Phase <b>locking</b> <b>in</b> the gamma-band <b>range</b> {{has been}} shown to be diminished in {{patients}} with schizophrenia. Moreover, there have been reports of positive correlations between phase <b>locking</b> <b>in</b> the gamma-band <b>range</b> and positive symptoms, especially hallucinations. The aim of the present study was to use a new methodological approach in order to investigate gamma-band phase synchronization between the left and right auditory cortex in patients with schizophrenia and its relationship to auditory hallucinations. Subjects were 18 patients with chronic schizophrenia (SZ) and 16 healthy control (HC) subjects. Auditory hallucination symptom scores were obtained using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms. Stimuli were 40 -Hz binaural click trains. The generators of the 40 Hz-ASSR were localized using eLORETA and based on the computed intracranial signals lagged interhemispheric phase locking between primary and secondary auditory cortices was analyzed. Current source density of the 40 ASSR response was significantly diminished in SZ in comparison to HC in the right superior and middle temporal gyrus (p< 0. 05). Interhemispheric phase <b>locking</b> was reduced <b>in</b> SZ in comparison to HC for the primary auditory cortices (p< 0. 05) but not in the secondary auditory cortices. A significant positive correlation was found between auditory hallucination symptom scores and phase synchronization between the primary auditory cortices (p< 0. 05, corrected for multiple testing) but not for the secondary auditory cortices. These results suggest that long-range synchrony of gamma oscillations is disturbed in schizophrenia and that this deficit is related to clinical symptoms such as auditory hallucinations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe design, characterize, and couple Boolean phase {{oscillators}} {{that include}} state-dependent feedback delay. The state-dependent delay {{allows us to}} realize an adjustable coupling strength, even though only Boolean signals are exchanged. Specifically, increasing the coupling strength via the range of state-dependent delay leads to larger <b>locking</b> <b>ranges</b> <b>in</b> uni- and bidirectional coupling of oscillators in both experiment and numerical simulation with a piecewise switching model. In the unidirectional coupling scheme, we unveil asymmetric triangular-shaped locking regions (Arnold tongues) that appear at multiples of the natural frequency of the oscillators. This extends observations of a single <b>locking</b> region reported <b>in</b> previous studies. In the bidirectional coupling scheme, we map out a symmetric <b>locking</b> region <b>in</b> the parameter space of frequency detuning and coupling strength. Because of the large scalability of our setup, our observations constitute a first step towards realizing large-scale networks of coupled oscillators to address fundamental questions on the dynamical properties of networks in a new experimental setting...|$|R
40|$|A {{frequency}} divider {{is an essential}} building block {{and one of the}} major sources of power dissipation in widely-used frequency synthesizers. As the output frequency of the synthesizer increases, the trade-off between the speed and power dissipation of dividers becomes more critical. Narrow-band injection-locked {{frequency divider}}s (ILFD) dissipate a fraction of the energy stored in the tank, which is determined by the quality factor, Q, of the resonator, in every cycle. Therefore, they have fundamentally lower power dissipation than wide-band dividers. Due to their narrow-band nature, ILFDs work in a limited frequency <b>range</b> (<b>locking</b> <b>range).</b> <b>In</b> this paper, shunt-peaking is used as an approach to increase the locking range and lower the power dissipation at higher frequencies...|$|R

As a result we show that satellite steps around the main flux-flow resonance are spaced by both odd and even harmonics of the rf frequency. An analytical expression for the <b>locking</b> <b>range</b> <b>in</b> current of the phase-lock steps is also derived. These results are found to be in good agreement with numerical results...|$|R

40|$|Both {{amplitude}} and {{phase of}} rhythmic slow-wave electroencephalographic activity are physiological correlates {{of learning and}} memory in rodents. In humans, oscillatory amplitude {{has been shown to}} correlate with memory; however, the role of oscillatory phase in human memory is unknown. We recorded intracranial electroencephalogram from human cortical and hippocampal areas while subjects performed a short-term recognition memory task. On each trial, a series of four list items was presented followed by a memory probe. We found agreement across trials of the phase of oscillations in the 7 - to 16 -Hz range after randomly timed stimulus events, evidence that these events either caused a phase shift in the underlying oscillation or initiated a new oscillation. Phase <b>locking</b> <b>in</b> this frequency <b>range</b> was not generally associated with increased poststimulus power, suggesting that stimulus events reset the phase of ongoing oscillations. Different stimulus classes selectively modulated this phase reset effect, with topographically distinct sets of recording sites exhibiting preferential reset to either probe items or to list items. These findings implicate the reset of brain oscillations in human working memory...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} various implementations of {{wide range}} frequency tuning for LC-VCOs in CMOS processes.

The discussion focuses on highlighting the key tradeoffs of power, phase noise, tuning range and area, with the illustration of different tuning techniques for RF/wireless and CDR type applications. Specifically it is shown that for RF/wireless applications, due to the stringent demands on minimal phase noise and power, a varactor based tuning scheme is necessary. For CDR applications it is shown that a relaxed constraint on power and phase noise allows the use of lossy-switched capacitor tuning to achieve very wide tuning ranges. Active inductor emulation is introduced {{as a means to}} maintain low power and wide tuning range with low area at the cost of increased phase noise.
