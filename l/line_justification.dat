The {{conjunctive normal form}} is used to represent sets of states and tran-sition relation. A logical operation on state sets is implemented as an operation on conjunctive normal form formulas. A satisfy-all procedure is proposed to compute the existential quantification re-quired in obtaining the preimage and fix point. The proposed sat-isfy-all procedure is implemented by modifying a SAT procedure to generate all the satisfying assignments of the input formula, {{which is based on}} new efficient techniques such as <b>line</b> <b>justification</b> to make an assignment covering more search space, excluding clause management, and two-level logic minimization to compress the set of found assignments. In addition, a cache table is introduced into the satisfy-all procedure. It is a difficult problem for a satisfy-all procedure to detect the case that a previous result can be reused. This paper shows that the case can be detected by comparing sets of undetermined variables and clauses. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can check more circuits than binary decision diagram-based and previous SAT-based model-checking algorithms.

40|$|This {{creative}} project investigates {{a method}} for translating a run-length encoded data file of letterforms into bit mapped images. Each letterform is broken (cracked) into primitive strokes. Each primitive stroke is represented by equally spaced runlength spline points within a 72 unit counting system. The strokes are ordered from left to right, allowing a direct scan-line conversion using an on-off character fill. Most commercial letterforms are stored in an outline format. Outline letterfomrs must be converted to vector edges, and then quick sorted into two dimensional arrays of edges for scan-line conversion (no overlapping outlines are allowed). The author's method stores primitives in a left to right ordered format that eliminates the sorting routine. In order to display the letterforms as a body of text, an interpreted description language was developed. The language command structure {{is embedded in the}} text file and interpreted at run time. The language controlls the sizing and placement of letterforms at five levels. The page attributes controlls the placement of page margins, column margins, windows, headers, footers, etc. The Paragraph attributes controlles first word indents, paragraph indents, widow lines, etc. The line attributes controlles the text line length, inter word and character spacing, line leading, additional line indents, type of <b>line</b> <b>justification</b> and hyphenation, etc. No attributes were established at the word level.

40|$|Typical ASIC {{designs are}} highly {{unbalanced}} {{with respect to}} the timing criticality of their combinational logic paths. This is mainly due to the ad-hoc manual design specification of the register transfer level (RTL), which does not use any information regarding the sequential timing criticality. Traditional logic synthesis does not support “borrowing ” of timing slack across registers, and the optimization is restricted by fixed positions of the registers. This may result in a suboptimal solution, in a loss of performance, and unnecessary area and power consumption. This paper explains the concept of clock scheduling and retiming used by Encounter RTL Compiler (RC) to optimize across register boundaries. Retiming is a structural transformation which changes the positions of the registers without modifying the input-output behavior of the circuit. The reader will understand how the area, the number of registers, or the delay of the design is minimized. Computational results show the tradeoff between these two objectives. Practical applications are discussed: Registers may have different control signals, enable signals, or reset signals. This leads to the multiclass retiming problem and the reset <b>line</b> <b>justification</b> problem. Retiming used to be a difficult challenge for equivalence checking. However, together with Encounter Conformal Logic Equivalence Checker (LEC) the verification is now simple: RC writes out checkpoint netlist files and one script, which LEC can then process to automatically verify the golden RTL against the final netlist. We present a case study showing how retiming was used by Focus Semiconductor, a division of Focus Enhancements, on a 1. 5 M instance UWB baseband chip. Retiming substantially improved the Quality of Results (QoR) and helped to meet the design objectives. CDNLive! Silicon Valley 2006 1...|$|E

First, I show that we can generalize some familiar epistemological concepts and distinctions to emotional experiences. Second, I use these concepts and distinctions to display the limits of the ‘simple view’ {{of emotional}} justification. On this approach, the justification of emotions stems only from the contents of the mental states they are based on, also known as their cognitive bases. The simple view faces the ‘gap problem’: If cognitive bases and emotions (re) present their objects and properties in different ways, then cognitive bases are not sufficient to justify emotions. Third, I offer a novel solution to the gap problem based on emotional dispositions. This solution (1) draws a <b>line</b> between the <b>justification</b> of basic and non-basic emotions, (2) preserves a broadly cognitivist view of emotions, (3) avoids a form of value skepticism that threatens inferentialist views of emotional justification, and (4) sheds new light on the structure of our epistemic access to evaluative properties...|$|R

40|$|Public {{involvement}} in healthcare is a prominent policy in countries across the economically developed world. A {{growing body of}} academic literature has focused on public participation, often presenting dichotomies between good and bad practice: between initiatives that offer empowerment and those constrained by consumerism, or between those which rely for recruitment on self-selecting members of the public, and those including a more broad-based, statistically representative group.

In toroidal geometry, field-aligned interpolation consists of a 1 D interpolation along the field line, combined with 2 D interpolations on the poloidal planes (at the intersections with the field <b>line).</b> A theoretical <b>justification</b> of the method is provided in the simplified context of constant advection on a 2 D periodic domain: unconditional stability is proven, and error estimates are given which highlight the advantages of field-aligned interpolation. The same methodology is successfully applied to the solution of the gyrokinetic Vlasov equation, for which we present the ion temperature gradient (ITG) instability as a classical test-case: first we solve this in cylindrical geometry (screw-pinch), and next in toroidal geometry (circular Tokamak). In the first case, the algorithm is implemented in Selalib (semi-Lagrangian library), and the numerical simulations provide linear growth rates that are in accordance with the linear dispersion analysis. In the second case, the algorithm is implemented in the Gysela code, and the numerical simulations are benchmarked with those employing the standard (not aligned) scheme. Numerical experiments show that field-aligned interpolation leads to considerable memory savings for the same level of accuracy; substantial savings are also expected in reactor-scale simulations...|$|R
40|$|Dr. Lenore Walker {{developed}} battered woman syndrome {{to address}} the issue of domestic violence and to give battered women a defense in situations in which they kill their abusive partners when they are not overtly threatening them. Self-defense law is based on male on male combat. Women are less able to protect themselves in an attack by a man, and so they may preemptively attack their sleeping partners to avoid a situation in which they cannot adequately protect themselves. Battered woman syndrome explains why these battered women act in a way that is irrational to a non-battered person. Walker 2 ̆ 7 s theory of learned helplessness explains why the woman does not leave the abusive relationship, and the cycle of violence theory explains why she perceives an imminent threat. Battered woman syndrome is problematic in its legal application because of problems with its scientific validity and reliability. It also furthers gender stereotypes and blurs the <b>line</b> between a <b>justification</b> and an excuse defense.

This framework takes into account social circumstances that would explain a woman 2 ̆ 7 s actions rather than including pathology. This would explain why the woman did not leave an abusive relationship. To avoid the pathology of BWS while explaining why the woman felt an imminent threat, the defense can turn to a pattern of abuse that helps her reasonably recognize when violence is likely...|$|R
40|$|When Pope Alexander VI in 1494 {{divided the}} world between Portuguese and Spanish spheres of {{influence}} he can never have imagined that he was creating Western Australia. By placing the dividing line of longitude at a point which would give Brazil to Portugal he inadvertently ensured that the western third of the then unknown Australian continent would lie in the Portuguese zone while the rest went to Spain. Three centuries later when the British asserted sovereignty over Australia they at first laid claim only to the former Spanish sphere of influence, at first east of longitude 135 and subsequently {{as far as the}} ‘Pope’s line’ at longitude 129 degrees. It has been suggested that the failure to annex Western Australia was due to respect for the British East India Company, who could be seen as inheriting the shadowy Portuguese entitlement in the Indian Ocean region. When in 1826 Governor Darling eventually sent a garrison to show the flag at King Georges Sound, now the site of Albany, the East India Company’s authority had waned and it seemed necessary to discourage foreign powers from laying claim to Western Australia. Soon afterwards Captain James Stirling established the Swan River Colony and Western Australia was defined as all that part of the continent lying west of longitude 129 east.

As interesting issues about the task emerged in the first experiment, the second study explored the range and appropriateness of a variety of tasks for research about reading web pages. The results of the experiment indicated the use of skimming reading as an appropriate task in the further experiments. The third study investigated the effect of font type and size on skim reading web pages. The experiment found that UK web users preferred Arial font type in comparison to Times New Roman, however Thai web users preferred a Thai conservative font type, which is closely related to serif. On font size, 14 point or larger was preferred by both the UK and Thai younger adults. For both the UK and Thai older adults, 16 point was preferred. The fourth study investigated the effect of text and background colour on skim reading web pages. Black text on white background and sepia text on off-white were preferred by all participants. Based on results of the experiment in this programme of research, an evidence-based set of web design guidelines for the presentation of text for older people in both Thailand and the UK was developed. ...|$|R
