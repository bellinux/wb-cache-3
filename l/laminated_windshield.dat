2500|$|The 1970 AMC Javelins also {{introduced}} Corning's new safety glass, which was thinner and lighter than standard <b>laminated</b> <b>windshields.</b> This special glass featured a chemically hardened outer layer. It {{was produced in}} Blacksburg, Virginia, in a refitted plant that included tempering, ion exchange, and [...] "fusion process" [...] in new furnaces that Corning had developed {{in order to be}} able to supply to the big automakers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Laminated</b> <b>windshields</b> {{remain in}} one piece when impacted, {{preventing}} penetration of unbelted occupants' heads and maintaining a minimal but adequate transparency {{for control of the}} car immediately following a collision. It is also a bonded structural part of the safety cell. Tempered glass side and rear windows break into granules with minimally sharp edges, rather than splintering into jagged fragments as ordinary glass does.|$|R
50|$|At {{this time}} {{many of the}} {{original}} jigs had been lost, and, where necessary, they made new sand castings for the hardware. While retaining most of the traditional craftsmanship, Morgan made several significant improvements over the old plans, as concessions {{to the advancement of}} technology: dual exhausts, rather than the original single exhaust, for enhanced engine performance; the use of stainless steel fittings and hardware throughout so that pitting was no longer a problem; state-of-the-art epoxy encapsulation and bonding techniques; triple planked bottoms completely encased in epoxy; double planked sides and deck saturated in epoxy; 25% more frames; double the number of floor timbers; up to 18 coats of varnish; the use of renewable-resourced Honduras mahogany; new improved steering for more maneuverability; and <b>laminated</b> <b>windshields</b> with either blue or green tints.|$|R
50|$|Like {{most other}} Proton cars of its time, the Proton Wira {{did not offer}} any safety {{features}} other than the standard three-point safety belts with pretensioners and <b>laminated</b> <b>windshield.</b> Export models however saw a much better build quality with safety features such as a driver airbag, door intrusion bars and ABS, which were also available as options in the later Malaysian models.|$|E
5000|$|In 1959 Devin {{took the}} body of the D model and revised the chassis to accept the newly {{introduced}} Chevrolet six-cylinder, horizontally-opposed, air-cooled engine known as the [...] "Turbo-Air 6" [...] and 4-speed transaxle as used in the Chevrolet Corvair. Rear suspension and brakes from the Corvair were also part of the package. The resulting car was called the Devin C. Like the Devin D, it was offered as a component car in kit form with a painted body already bonded to the frame, <b>laminated</b> <b>windshield,</b> and doors and deck lids already attached or as a completed car built by Devin Enterprises. In kit form the Devin C sold for US$2500.00 and US$4500.00. for the complete assembled car.|$|E
5000|$|Tucker's {{specifications}} for his revolutionary car {{called for a}} rear engine, a low-RPM 589 cubic inch engine with hydraulic valves instead of a camshaft, fuel injection, direct-drive torque converters on each rear wheel (instead of a transmission), disc brakes, the location of all instruments within the diameter and reach of the steering wheel, a padded dashboard, self-sealing tubeless tires, independent springless suspension, a chassis which protected occupants in a side impact, a roll bar within the roof, a <b>laminated</b> <b>windshield</b> designed to pop out during an accident, and a center [...] "cyclops" [...] headlight which would turn when steering at angles greater than 10 degrees {{in order to improve}} visibility around corners during night driving.|$|E
50|$|Early {{windshields}} {{were made}} of ordinary window glass, but {{that could lead to}} serious injuries {{in the event of a}} crash. A series of crashes led up to the development of stronger windshields. The most notable example of this is the Pane vs. Ford case of 1917 that decided against Pane in that he was only injured through reckless driving. They were replaced with windshields made of toughened glass and were fitted in the frame using a rubber or neoprene seal. The hardened glass shattered into many mostly harmless fragments when the windshield broke. These windshields, hovever, could shatter from a simple stone chip. In 1919, Henry Ford solved the problem of flying debris by using the new French technology of glass <b>laminating.</b> <b>Windshields</b> made using this process were two layers of glass with a cellulose inner layer. This inner layer held the glass together when it fractured. Between 1919 and 1929, Ford ordered the use of laminated glass on all of his vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1930s cadavers {{have been}} {{essential}} in making vehicles safer. Cadavers have helped set guidelines {{on the safety}} features of vehicles ranging from <b>laminated</b> <b>windshields</b> to seat belt airbags. After the crash tests, the cadavers are taken in to get x-rayed and autopsied to examine the damage. Cadavers have helped Ford promote inflatable rear seat belts in the 2011 Explorer. Cadavers can indicate how seat belts will create soft tissue damage, which is something a crash test dummy cannot do. An example that occurred in an experiment in Europe was that scientists were testing a new seat belt {{and thought it was}} unflawed.Then, after testing it on a dummy, they brought in a cadaver. They later found out that the seat belt protected the sternum, but not the pelvis. They were unable to find this out in the dummy because it did not have working parts located in the pelvic area, like the human cadaver. See Crash test dummy for more information.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the modelling of spatial variations using random {{fields and the}} implementation within existing finite element models. In addition, {{the application of the}} line-sampling technique to estimate the distribution and statistics of eigenfrequencies is presented, which can drastically reduce numerical costs. In particular, the vibration analysis of an automotive windshield with uncertain parameters is considered. The analysis is based on a finite element model of the baseline system and information about the related parameter uncertainties. The variation in the frequency response of the windshield is investigated for the cases of a free and constrained configuration of the windshield. Spatial variations are considered for the thicknesses of the five layers of the <b>laminate</b> <b>windshield</b> and for the properties of the glue-joint by which the windshield is mounted on the car. First, the theoretical background of random fields is reviewed and the implementation within a standard finite element code is discussed. A Monte Carlo simulation approach is used to estimate the response statistics. Next, a case study is performed to investigate the influence of the random field parameters. Finally, the application of the line-sampling technique to estimate the distribution and statistics of eigenfrequencies is presented...|$|R

In {{order to}} {{research}} {{the influence of the}} parameters of <b>laminated</b> <b>windshield</b> glass to pedestrian head injuries in vehicle-pedestrian accident, the adaptive response surface method (RSM) was utilized to optimize the key parameters of the laminated glass i. e. the elastic modulus, yield strength, density and the glass thickness, in which the pedestrian head injury criteria(HIC) and glass crack radius were setting as the objective function. A set of glass parameters was obtained which was the most beneficial to the pedestrian protection.

40|$|Abstract: The crack {{pattern in}} a PVB <b>laminated</b> <b>windshield</b> upon head impact is of {{considerable}} interest {{because it contains}} important information on energy mit-igation, pedestrian protection, and accident reconstruction. We carry out a sys-tematic numerical study based on the extended finite element method (XFEM), to investigate the effects of various material and system variables, including the im-pact speed, effective head mass, PVB interlayer material thickness and property, windshield curvature, aspect ratio and size, boundary constraint, impact angle and off-center impact, on the parameters characterizing the resulting crack pattern, i. e. the crack length, crack angle and circumferential crack shape. General relations bridging these variables and parameters are established via extensive simulations, and the effect and mechanism of each governing factor are elucidated. The findings will {{shed some light on}} accident investigation, crashworthiness, and vehicle safety design, {{on the basis of a}} systematic understanding of the PVB <b>laminated</b> <b>windshield</b> cracking subject to human head impact...|$|E

5000|$|In 1962 Corning {{developed}} Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield {{designed to}} be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed. This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a [...] "fusion process" [...] in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility. Corning developed it {{as an alternative to}} <b>laminated</b> <b>windshields</b> with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier. After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC). As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products. Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after {{it turned out to be}} one of the company's [...] "biggest and most expensive failures." [...] However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.|$|R
40|$|CFD Simulation of {{windshield}} de-icing {{has gained}} a lot of importance {{over the last few}} years. With stricter regulatory norms, both OEMs and suppliers have to constantly work on improving the defroster design [1], [2]. Experimental testing is extremely time-consuming as well as quite expensive. CFD simulations have been able to shorten the development cycle and reduce cost. Windshield deicing simulations involve both geometrical complexities as well as complex physics. It involves interaction between the airflow and two modes of heat transfer, basically conduction and convection [1]. A variety of factors play a very important role in accurately predicting the deicing process and deicing pattern. These factors include defroster angle with the windshield, mesh size and mesh type near the windshield and defroster outlet, thermal conductivity and specific heat considerations due to composite <b>laminate</b> <b>windshield,</b> effect of the melting of ice due to deicing, turbulence modeling etc. Without considering these effects, the deicing rates cannot be correctly predicted. An attempt is made here to study the effect of the above-mentioned factors on deicing patterns. A general purpose CFD solver, FLUENT 6. 3 is used to simulate the deicing process. The melting of ice is simulated using phase change model which is based on the enthalpy-porosity techniques. Simplified cabin geometry is considered for all the cases. C subroutines are written to model various effects on deicing...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to investigate the mechanical behavior of <b>windshield</b> <b>laminated</b> glass {{in the case of a}} pedestrian's head impact. Windshield FE models were set up using different combinations for the modeling of glass and PVB, with various connection types and two mesh sizes (5 mm and 10 mm). Each windshield model was impacted with a standard adult headform impactor in an LS-DYNA simulation environment, and the results were compared with the experimental data reported in the literature. The results indicated that the behavior of the windshield model with a double-layered shell of glass and PVB and a tied element connection support test results from previous studies. Furthermore, the influence of glass fracture stress on the same windshield model was investigated, and the cracked area and the peak value of the headform's linear acceleration were determined by the critical fracture stress. It was observed that a 50 -MPa fracture stress in the glass best p...|$|R
5000|$|In 1958 Devin {{released}} {{a new model}} named the Devin D. This model came with a new body style and was built on a Devin-designed ladder chassis with a wheelbase of 2083 mm. The front suspension of transverse torsion bars and trailing links was from Volkswagen, while single coil-over-dampers and trailing arms were used at the rear. The buyer had the choice of rear-mounted air-cooled four-cylinder boxer engines from either Volkswagen or Porsche. The VW engine displaced [...] and developed [...] at 3700 rpm, while the Porsche engine displaced [...] and made [...] at 4500 rpm. The Devin D could be bought in kit form, with a basic body-and-frame kit costing US$895.00. A much more complete kit that included a <b>laminated</b> safety glass <b>windshield,</b> folding soft top, side curtains, upholstery and leather-covered bucket seats, chrome bumpers, brake and fuel line, and working head, tail, parking and directional lights was priced at US$1495.00. A turn-key car powered by the VW engine cost US$2950.00, while one with Porsche power was US$3350.00. Production of the Devin D is estimated to have totaled 46 cars.|$|R
40|$|Using {{plastics}} in auto “glass” can lightweight {{a vehicle}} and help prevent passenger injuries plastics autos Using plastics in auto “glass” can lightweight a vehicle and help prevent passenger injuries Generally, windshields today {{are made of}} laminated glass. For reference here, laminated means a multilayer unit consisting of a thin plastic layer (currently polyvinyl butryal or PVB) layered between two sheets of glass. 1 Due to the lightweight embedded plastic, <b>laminated</b> glass <b>windshields</b> can be both thinner and stronger than those made of tempered glass alone. In fact, using laminated glass {{can result in a}} typical weight savings of 11 %. 2, 3 In addition to saving weight, laminated glass can bend slightly under impact and is less likely to shatter than normal safety glass, reducing the risk of passenger injury. 4 If a laminated glass window or windshield does break, the shattered pieces tend to remain bound to the inner tearresistant plastic layer helping prevent injury, and the broken sheet remains transparent, maintaining visibility. 4 Used with permission When damaged, the outer glass of the windshield adheres to the inner layer of plastic to help prevent shattering, protecting passengers from injury and ejection. Laminated glass can also help reduce the incidence of passenger ejection—a possible result of impact that can make the occupant {{three times more likely to}} be killed than if he or she had stayed inside the vehicle. The strength of the plastic can allow windows and windshields to stretch and yield, serving as a “safety net ” to keep passengers inside. 5 Recently, a glazing technology has been developed for a virtually unbreakable polycarbonate plastic resin windshield, eliminating glass and achieving even more of a weight reduction— 40 – 50 % compared to laminated glass. 6 This weight savings was demonstrated in the windshields of nine electric security vehicles featured at the 2005 World Exposition in Aichi, Japan. While these electric vehicles were the first commercial application of glazed polycarbonate windshields, the manufacturer is currently working around the world to drive new application opportunities in similar uses. 7 Glazed polycarbonate windshields were used for their strength and light weight in these electric security vehicles.
