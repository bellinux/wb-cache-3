50|$|Under foreign pressure, the {{government}} has taken steps to liberalize the ISP market. Compulsory state licensing for ISPs was eliminated in 2002, although the MCIT has continued to ignore this provision on isolated occasions. The MCIT continues to hold about a 50 percent share in {{a few of the}} leading ISPs in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan applied for World Trade Organization (WTO) membership in 1997, and even though some progress in <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> was made, the country still remains on the accession agenda. It has been suggested that there is not enough political will to join the WTO, mainly because local businesses fear the loss of their advantageous position in the internal market.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of utilizing the <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> {{for a number}} of Southern Mediterranean countries is great in a large number of sectors. Nevertheless, the importance of this potential has yet to be realized by those countries. The Southern Mediterranean countries have often relatively neglected the liberalization of trade in services in their trade liberalization efforts, whether on unilateral, regional or multilateral levels. For example, liberalization of trade in services in the EU-Med Association agreements was deterred for future negotiations. It {{was not included in the}} PAFTA (Pan Arab Free Trade Area). On the multilateral level, the liberalization commitments of the Southern Mediterranean countries were humble to a large extent. This paper aims to identify the comparative advantage of Egypt, as an example of a Southern Mediterranean country liberalizing its trade in services. This is undertaken by emphasizing two aspects: the comparative advantage that Egypt acquires in a number of services and the reduction in the transaction costs that <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> can bring to many sectors of the economy...|$|E

30|$|Another form of {{cross-border}} mobility {{encouraged by}} the <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> provision emerged in the 1990 s {{under the category of}} ‘posted workers’. These are employees sent by their employers to work temporarily in another country (labour laws of the country of origin apply for such stays). Fears that such arrangements might be abused to evade national labour laws resulted in adoption in 1996 of the EU Posted Workers Directive (PWD), followed by intense debate regarding prevention of ‘social dumping’ (see, e.g., Cremers et al., 2007).|$|E

We decompose productivity growth within distributive trade industries into the contribution from entering, exiting, and continuing firms during 1996 - 2004. The decomposition indicates that productivity {{growth in the}} distributive trade sector of Brazil {{is largely due to}} productivity growth within continuing firms. Reallocation effects are small despite <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> markets. Our findings of the distributive trade sector in Brazil are different from that in several OECD countries (in particular the UK and the US), where reallocation dynamics {{play an important role in}} accounting for growth.

Second, it suggests a policy-based rather than outcome-based measure of the openness <b>of</b> a country's <b>services</b> regime. Such openness measures are constructed for two key service sectors, basic telecommunications and financial services. Finally, it provides some econometric evidence [...] - relatively strong for the financial sector and less strong, but nevertheless statistically significant, for the telecommunications sector [...] -that openness in services influences long run growth performance.

40|$|The {{right of}} access of users to the service(s), the {{equality}} of their treatment, which is synonymous with the refusal of all discrimination, and the continuity of service {{in time and space}} are virtues that we feel the need to rehabilitate. These virtues are consubstantial with the traditional definition of the French concept of 'public service'. Because this concept is suspect, the European Union adopted a new one, of Anglo Saxon origin, that of 'universal service'. Universal service, in Europe as in the US, has no precise meaning. The present article proposes to discuss the concept of universal service and to thus reflect on the meaning of the policy of <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> in Europe and in the US. ...|$|E
40|$|Legal {{services}} {{are an important}} type <b>of</b> trade in <b>services,</b> and opening up the legal services market requires careful consideration. The Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between Mainland China and Hong Kong has {{taken the lead in}} setting the platform for opening up the legal services market. This regional free trade arrangement aims to provide preferential treatment to (and only to) the legal service industry and providers in the region. Because of the ever-developing economic relationship between the two parties, it is necessary to study the possibility of opening the market even further. This article examines the existing framework for <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>services</b> under the CEPA framework and offers some suggestions on further <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>services</b> between Mainland China and Hong Kong...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to quantitatively {{assess the impact of}} {{globalization}} on the economy of Poland in the medium term. Four channels of the impact of globalization are distinguished: (i) trade openness, (ii) productivity improvement, (iii) labour migrations, (iv) liberalization of the services sector. We employ a computable general equilibrium model with multiple industries and households and imperfect competition features. Our results show positive and quite significant effects of globalization on the performance of the Polish economy, stemming mainly from productivity improvements and <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> The sizeable expected migrations result in negative effects of globalization by decreasing growth potential and causing upward pressure on wages. At the sectoral level, globalization is particularly beneficial to some exporting sectors and skilled segments of the labour market. ...|$|E
40|$|Post-production services, such as sales, distribution, and maintenance, {{comprise}} a crucial element of business activity. A foreign firm faces a higher cost to perform such services than its domestic rival {{because of the}} lack of proximity to customers. We explore an international duopoly model in which a foreign firm can reduce its cost for post-production services by foreign direct investment (FDI), or alternatively can outsource such services to its domestic rival. Trade liberalization, if not accompanied by <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> FDI, can hurt domestic consumers and decrease world welfare, but the negative welfare impacts can be mitigated and eventually turned into positive ones as service FDI is also liberalized. This finding yields important policy implications, given the reality that the progress <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> in <b>service</b> sectors is limited compared to the substantial progress already made in trade liberalization. post-production services, trade liberalization, FDI, outsourcing, international oligopoly...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{and compares}} the German and Austrian national response strategies to the <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> {{provision in the}} European Union. This liberalization, brought about by efforts to create a Single Market, has enabled the transnational provision <b>of</b> <b>services</b> without initially clarifying the wage and labor conditions applicable to workers posted to other member states. The national legislative re-regulatory measures or response strategies are crucially colored by the internal configuration and relative power of labor market interest associations, i. e. unions and employers’ associations.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{emphasis}} on free trade in global media governance, which could rock the foundations of media regulation in western democracies. While the US government pushes for the further <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> audiovisual <b>services</b> {{under the umbrella of}} the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), other countries are less enthusiastic. They see the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a threat to their media culture. This article discusses the implications of the GATS for societal regulation of the media and the role of UNESCO's new Convention on Cultural Diversity (CCD). The conclusion is that the <b>liberalization</b> <b>of</b> audiovisual <b>services</b> will prevent several media regulation measures: quota regulations, support programmes for the audiovisual industry and the funding <b>of</b> public <b>service</b> broadcasting are all potentially at risk. Additionally, UNESCO's efforts to promote and protect cultural diversity appear unlikely to stop this development...|$|R
