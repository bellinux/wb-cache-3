40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to empirically analyze {{educational}} outcomes by countries, and to draw policy tasks improving youth and adults’ <b>learning</b> <b>competency.</b> For these objectives, this study comparatively analyzed youth and adults’ <b>learning</b> <b>competency</b> across countries participated in PISA 2012 and PIAAC. As a result, this study identified Korean adults’ learning deficit compared to Korean youth ages, and tried to hypothetically investigate the factors leading to the deficit in the perspective of Korean higher education expansion. Furthermore, this study found that the efficiency level of Korean youth and adult education is relatively low among countries participated in PISA and PIAAC. Those findings provide useful policy implications for improving Korean youth and adults’ <b>learning</b> <b>competency.</b> Firstly, it is necessary to investigate the factors leading to the deficit of adults’ <b>learning</b> <b>competency</b> compared to youths’ outcomes, and to draw useful policy alternatives for those problems. Secondly, it is recommended to maintain Korean youths’ high performance level and reinforce those competencies. Lastly, it is needed to focus the educational efficiency and design new educational system considering not only educational outcome level but efficiency perspective. 본 연구는 중등 단계에서 성인으로의 이행 과정에서 나타나는 학습역량 손실 문제뿐만 아니라, 교육효율성의 관점에서 우리나라 청소년 및 성인들의 학습역량을 비교？분석한 후, 이에 근거하여 향후의 교육정책 수립 및 집행에 있어 필요한 정책적 시사점을 제시하고자 한다.

40|$|AbstractThe aim {{of study}} is to explore the {{relationship}} between the <b>learning</b> to <b>learn</b> <b>competency</b> and cognitive competencies (verbal and mathematical competency) in 1556 university students in four countries in Central Europe (Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Ukraine). The theoretical framework for this study is the concept of eight key <b>competencies</b> for lifelong <b>learning</b> (European Commission, 2009). Tests of verbal, mathematical competency (Kollárik et al., 1993) and <b>learning</b> to <b>learn</b> <b>competency</b> questionnaire (Mesárošová and Mesároš, 2011) were administered to assess variables in this study. The authors present research results which suggest that the <b>learning</b> to <b>learn</b> <b>competency</b> is strongly correlated with mathematical competency, but {{the relationship between the}} <b>learning</b> to <b>learn</b> <b>competency</b> and the verbal competency is weak.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} nature of {{relationships}} between internal communication modes, new service development (NSD) competencies (specifically learning and development competencies) and NSD performance. To do so, it draws on and advances communication theory by comparing and contrasting the contingent approach, favoured by media richness theory and media synchronicity theory, with the multiplicative manner of dual coding theory. Antecedent roles of rich and asynchronous communication modes for two NSD competencies are investigated, and their function as critical contingency variables affecting the competencies–performance link is unravelled. An empirical quantitative study of senior managers of leading service firms was conducted, with a survey-based methodology. Results show that a <b>learning</b> <b>competency</b> drives development competency which in turn drives NSD performance. Asynchronous communication is essential for <b>learning</b> <b>competency</b> but not for development competency. In contrast, rich communication underpins development but has no direct effect on <b>learning</b> <b>competency.</b> Rich communication is essential for NSD performance when a firm has a low development competency. The interaction between asynchronous and rich communication is shown to be positive for learning, whereas surprisingly it is negative for development competency...|$|E

This study was initiated {{to identify and}} illustrate with a visual model the key student <b>learning</b> <b>competencies</b> that most fundamentally contribute to a student's ability to achieve desired learning outcomes in a synchronous, dispersed virtual learning environment. We answered the following research questions: (1) which <b>learning</b> <b>competencies</b> can best be leveraged to support learning in a synchronous virtual-learning environment? (2) how can relevant <b>learning</b> <b>competencies</b> be transmitted to students during learning events? (3) which, if any, individual-level cognitive factors can be extracted during the pre-training phase that positively influence students' learning processes? and (4) which <b>learning</b> <b>competencies</b> {{can be added to}} existing models on learning in virtual environments? By surveying students participating in the U. S. Navy's Virtual Schoolhouse, we were able to attain and analyze quantitative data. We discovered that virtual world efficacy is a meta-competency composed of autonomous learning, multiple level operation, and collaborative adaptability. Our research findings suggest that a student's capability to understand and learn in the virtual world is a broad competency and is a significant predictor of his/her success in the virtual environment. Based on our findings, we recommend a familiarity period to allow students to develop these competencies prior to their participation in virtual learning.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the {{perceptions}} of Mathematics teachers using Information and Communications Technology (ICT) as educational tool in their classrooms. This study focuses on the Mathematics teachers’ 21 st century-oriented pedagogical practices that propagate learning outcomes that are considered essential for all learners to prosper in this ever-changing and demanding information society. The <b>learning</b> <b>competencies</b> considered are termed lifelong competencies as they transcend the classroom and school environment and can thus be used to solve authentic problems in day-to-day life. The development of these <b>learning</b> <b>competencies,</b> especially by using ICT, has become vital in equipping learners with the necessary skills to become confident citizens in this globalised world. The role the teacher plays is increasingly acknowledged as having a major impact on this process. An essential assumption of this study is that learning activities facilitated by teachers utilising ICT efficiently and effectively as an educational tool have the potential of enhancing the quality of <b>learning</b> <b>competencies.</b> Moreover, as the role of the teacher in these activities is highly important, the teacher’s characteristics and background have the potential to determine the overall success of the learners. Using the underlying principles of Activity Theory and the conceptual framework of SITES 2006 this study investigates the relationship between these three components, i. e. ICT integration, <b>learning</b> <b>competencies,</b> and teacher background and characteristics. The intricate relationships that exist among these three components are investigated in this study in the context of Mathematics education. This is a secondary data analysis study that utilises data from the SITES 2006 South African Mathematics teachers’ questionnaire. Only Mathematics teachers who indicated using ICT as an educational tool in the discovery of Mathematics principles and concepts were considered. Using Spearman’s correlation coefficient, the data was analysed to determine the strength of the relationships among the variables. Findings of the study suggest that certain teacher characteristics do indeed influence the probability of teachers developing certain <b>learning</b> <b>competencies</b> in learners. Moreover, the findings indicate that a number of the <b>learning</b> <b>competencies</b> investigated in this study are not as readily attained as others.

These {{range from the}} use of portfolio in admissions to higher education, during the higher education course, on entry into the profession and for ongoing professional development.
