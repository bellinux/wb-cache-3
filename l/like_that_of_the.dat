5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it clear that she could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E
5|$|Bomar, of Vanderbilt, is only shaded {{a little}} by two other ends, largely through the {{experienced}} gained by his rivals against stronger opposition. He weighs 200 pounds, is tremendously fast, and a hardy, defensive player. On attack {{he is able}} to pick the forward pass out of the air on the full run, and, running with a high-knee action quite <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> redoubtable Ted Coy, if he cannot get by his man, runs him down and goes on over him, still on his feet.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} this {{principle}} is exactly <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centrifugal {{governor of the}} steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} {{of carbon dioxide}} on the surface suggests that Titania may have a tenuous seasonal atmosphere of CO2, much <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jovian moon Callisto. Other gases, like nitrogen or methane, {{are unlikely to be}} present, because Titania's weak gravity could not prevent them from escaping into space. At the maximum temperature attainable during Titania's summer solstice (89 K), the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide is about 300 μPa (3 nbar).|$|E
5|$|The {{upper house}} was briefly {{abolished}} during the English Civil War, as Puritan governors attempted to consolidate control {{and prevent the}} return of any proprietary influence. It was again abolished by Governor Josias Fendall in 1660, who sought to create a colonial government based on an elected unicameral legislature <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virginia colony. The position of Governor {{was removed from the}} legislature in 1675, but for the following century, its function and powers largely remained the same.|$|E
5|$|In a status-conscious society <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romans, {{clothing}} and personal adornment gave immediate visual {{clues about the}} etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing was supposed to reflect a society in good order. The toga was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites, and for going to court. The clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colourful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions trousers. The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated {{by a lack of}} direct evidence, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.|$|E

5|$|In the Roman empire's {{hierarchical}} system, a vassal king {{usage of}} the King of Kings title did not indicate {{that he is a}} peer of the emperor or that the vassalage ties were cut. The title was probably a challenge not to the Roman emperor but to Shapur I; Odaenathus was declaring that he, not the Persian monarch, was the legitimate King of Kings in the East. A lead token depicting Hairan I shows him wearing a crown shaped <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Parthian monarchs, so it must have been Odaenathus' crown; this combination of title and imagery indicate that Odaenathus considered himself the rival of the Sassanians and the protector of the region against them.|$|E
5|$|Martin pairs often nest alone, {{although}} where suitable {{sites are}} available small loose colonies may form. These {{are more common}} south of the Sahara, where up to 40 rock martin pairs together have been recorded. Crag martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. The nest, built by both adults over several weeks, is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry grass or sometimes feathers. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Usually two broods are raised, and the rock martin may nest {{for a third time}} in a season.|$|E
5|$|Mayflies are {{involved}} in both primary production and bioturbation. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the Centroptilum genus of the mayfly increased the export of periphyton, thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats {{through the process of}} bioturbation. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing {{to the bottom of the}} lake, mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus Isonychia. The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the filter by which the insect traps food particles. The action of filter feeding has a small impact on water purification but an even larger impact on the convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more complex form that goes on to benefit consumers later in the food chain.|$|E
50|$|Further {{research}} with double layers on ruthenium dioxide films in 1971 by Sergio Trasatti and Giovanni Buzzanca demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> electrochemical behavior <b>of</b> these electrodes at low voltages with specific adsorbed ions was <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> capacitors. <b>The</b> specific adsorption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ions {{in this region}} of potential could also involve a partial charge transfer between the ion and the electrode. It {{was the first step}} towards understanding pseudocapacitance.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> climate <b>of</b> Portadown is <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK and Ireland, being a {{temperate}} oceanic climate. It has mild temperatures {{throughout the}} year, with summer temperatures not reaching levels {{to be deemed}} very hot and winter not very cold. Summer temperatures can reach more than 20°C though it is rare {{for them to go}} higher than 30°C (86°F). The consistently humid climate that prevails over Ireland can make these temperatures feel uncomfortable when they stray into the high 20's °C (80–85°F), more so than similar temperatures in hotter climates in <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> Europe. It also receives a steady amount <b>of</b> rainfall throughout <b>the</b> year.|$|R

5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} {{only from the}} cave of Andrahomana. Its past {{presence}} there, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extinct rodent Hypogeomys australis, suggests formerly more mesic (wet) conditions around the cave, which is currently in a dry area. In addition to M.macpheei, three other tenrecs have been described from subfossil material, but none are currently recognized as valid species; thus, M.macpheei is at present the only known Recently extinct tenrec species. However, there is a remnant patch of mesic forest near Andrahomana, where a population of M.macpheei may survive. Although no radiocarbon dating {{has been carried out}} on M.macpheei remains, bones of the rodent Macrotarsomys petteri from layers in the same cave deposit bracketing those where M.macpheei was found yield dates of around 2480 and 1760 Before Present.|$|E
5|$|President George Washington {{appointed}} Hamilton as {{the first}} United States Secretary of the Treasury on September 11, 1789. He left office {{on the last day}} of January 1795. Much of the structure of the government of the United States was worked out in those five years, beginning with the structure and function of the cabinet itself. Biographer Forrest McDonald argues that Hamilton saw his office, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British First Lord of the Treasury, as the equivalent of a Prime Minister. Hamilton oversaw his colleagues under the elective reign of George Washington. Washington requested Hamilton's advice and assistance on matters outside the purview of the Treasury Department. In 1791, while Secretary, Hamilton was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Hamilton submitted various financial reports to Congress. Among these are the First Report on the Public Credit, Operations of the Act Laying Duties on Imports, Report on a National Bank, On the Establishment of a Mint, Report on Manufactures, and the Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit. So, the great enterprise in Hamilton's project of an administrative republic is the establishment of stability.|$|E
5|$|The clock has its {{original}} medieval face. As well as showing {{the time on}} a 24-hour dial, it reflects {{the motion of the}} Sun and Moon, the phases of the Moon, and the time since the last new Moon. The astronomical dial represents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clock at Ottery St Mary. The quarters are chimed by a quarter jack {{in the form of a}} small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels. At the striking of the clock, jousting knights appear above the clock face.|$|E

5|$|The {{embryonic}} individual of Dinocephalosaurus preserved inside LPV 30280 from Luoping can {{be identified}} as such for several reasons. First, it is enclosed entirely within the body cavity of the adult. Its cervical ribs - which are long, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adult - face {{the same direction as}} the dorsal vertebrae of the adult, which is in contradiction to the typical head-first method of swallowing prey among amniotes. It is also preserved with its neck curling towards its forelimbs, a posture which is seen among vertebrate embryos but not adult Dinocephalosaurus specimens, which generally have the neck bent upwards. The absence of hands associated with the forelimbs in the embryo may be an artifact of preservation, but it may also be due to the sequence in which the limb bones of tetrapods ossify.|$|E
5|$|The female {{is similar}} in some ways to the male, but paler and duller. It is sandy grey or brown, with a back {{patterned}} <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male, and white or whitish underparts. The head of the females of the subspecies ammodendri and nigricans is dingy grey with darker smudges on the forehead, behind its eyes, and on its throat. The female of the subspecies stoliczkae is buff-brown with a white throat, a conspicuous pale supercilium, darker forehead, and lighter cheeks. The juvenile is similar to the female, differing in its lack of dark tinges on its throat and crown. In adults, moulting begins in July and ends in late August or early September. The post-juvenile moult is complete, and occurs variously from June to August.|$|E
5|$|The {{governmental}} {{structure of}} the newly formed Confederate States of America was very much <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parent United States. The executive branch was partitioned into several departments, each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president. The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department, and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. He was chosen for two principal reasons: first, he had extensive experience with nautical affairs, both in his boyhood home of Key West and later in Washington; and second, he was from Florida. In a bow {{to the principle of}} States' Rights, Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states. Although the requirement of geographical representation sometimes meant that the occupant would not be the best person available, the selection process worked well in Mallory's case.|$|E

5|$|The nave of six bays, and the large, aisled south {{transept}} were {{begun in}} about 1323, probably {{to the design}} of Nicholas deDerneford. There are a number of windows containing fine Flowing Decorated tracery of this period. The work ceased in 1375, in which year there was a severe outbreak of plague in England. The building of the nave was recommenced in 1485, more than 150years after it was begun. The architect was probably William Rediche. Remarkably, for an English medieval architect, he maintained the original form, changing only the details. The nave was roofed with a stellar vault rather <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady Chapel at Ely and the choir at York Minster, both of which date from the 1370s. Like that at York, the vault is of wood, imitating stone.|$|E
5|$|The two-colored bolete is an edible mushroom, {{although}} some {{may have an}} allergic reaction after ingestion that results in stomach upset. The mushroom has a very mild to no taste although {{it is said to}} have a very distinctive taste <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king bolete. It can be cooked several ways, and the varying color of the cap can be used to determine if the mushroom is ready to be eaten. If the cap is a lighter red, then it is less mature and is in a stage where it is often larva infested or it can be soft fleshed, in some cases both. The cap should have a dark brick red color when safe to eat. Drying the two-colored bolete is a good method for storage. It is important to note the time it takes for the two-colored bolete to bruise when identifying it for consumption; the mushroom should take several minutes to bruise compared to the instant bruising of Boletus sensibilis, which is poisonous and has many of the same visual characteristics of the two-colored bolete.|$|E
5|$|The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} styling of the {{original}} aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display. The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option {{is available in the}} 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed. The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button. The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iPhone and iPad.

2500|$|We must {{be careful}} not to overemphasize <b>the</b> affective aspects <b>of</b> later medieval piety. [...] Even in writers, like Marguerite of Oingt, who give the images very {{concrete}} development, <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> Christ as mother, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Christ <b>the</b> bridegroom, remains allegorical. [...] Moreover, <b>the</b> humanity <b>of</b> Christ is not as absent in early medieval devotion as many twelfth-century scholars have suggested, following Southern. [...] Piety from the later Middle Ages is not as literal in its use of images or a filled with weeping and ecstasy as scholars since Huizinga have thought.|$|R
