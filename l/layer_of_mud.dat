5|$|Before Eline struck Mozambique, storm {{warnings}} and later hurricane warnings were issued on February21. Flooding had affected the nation since January, with some areas receiving a year's worth of rainfall in two weeks. Widespread areas were inundated, with about 220,000people displaced, and about 150people killed. Eline moved ashore with very powerful winds, {{although there were}} no direct observations of the strongest winds. In Beira, the closest major city to the landfall point, winds reached storm force. However, the rainfall from Eline was the most impacting following the preexisting flooding, which were the worst since 1951. The floods were beginning to recede by the time Eline arrived, {{and by the end}} of February 2000, the situation was considered the country's worst natural disaster in a century. Flooding continued for days after Eline moved through southern Africa due to waters flowing downstream from neighboring countries. By early March the floods were beginning to recede again, leaving behind a deep <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud,</b> ponds of contaminated water, and piles of rotten corpses.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} this {{location}} for burials {{of members of the}} Jewish community is uncertain. One theory is that the more visible and accessible cemetery utilised by Christians, near the border with Spain, was more subject to the laws regarding expulsion of Jews, which had been mandated by the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. The best-preserved gravestones at Jews' Gate Cemetery are those that, until recently, were protected by a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> and peat. The inscriptions on the limestone tombstones that have been exposed to the elements have become difficult to decipher. During half of the year, the winter and spring, plants are allowed to grow freely in the cemetery, in deference to the Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society. The area is a favoured mating and nesting ground of the Barbary partridge; after their nesting season, the cemetery is cleared and the impression of neglect is removed.|$|E
500|$|Burial 195 was a corbel-vaulted chamber {{cut into}} the bedrock under Temple 32. It was {{the tomb of the}} ruler nicknamed [...] "Animal Skull" [...] by archaeologists, who ruled {{from the end of the}} 6th century AD through to at least 628. The remains of the king had been wrapped in cloth that had been dyed red. The tomb was flooded soon after it was sealed, leaving a thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> that dried to {{preserve}} the hollow forms of the king's burial offerings long after the wooden artefacts had rotted away. Archaeologists filled these hollows with plaster of Paris and were thus able to reconstruct many of the perishable items from the tomb, including four large carved panels depicting the king, a small throne decorated with hieroglyphs, a ballgame yoke and four stucco figurines of the deity K'awiil.|$|E

50|$|The major walls at Cahuachi {{were very}} {{carefully}} constructed and well made. The <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> adobe {{used to build}} them are carefully regular, and had two final <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> plaster, {{as well as a}} white wash finish.|$|R
60|$|It is a {{necessary}} result of {{the operation of the}} law of gravitation that the uppermost layer shall be the youngest and the lowest the oldest, and that the different beds shall be older at any particular point or spot in exactly the ratio of their depth from the surface. So that if they were upheaved afterwards, and you had a series <b>of</b> these different <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud,</b> converted into sandstone, or limestone, as the case might be, you might be sure that the bottom layer was deposited first, and that the upper layers were formed afterwards. Here, you see, {{is the first step in}} the history--these <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> give us an idea of time.|$|R
500|$|Breeding {{typically}} commences in mid-March in {{the south}} and west of Europe (late February in Britain), but not till early May in Finland. The nest is usually built in a tree in the fork of a branch or against the trunk, although hedges, ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used. The nest site may be up to [...] above the ground, although [...] is more typical. The common chaffinch often nests close to a mistle thrush, the vigilance of the finch and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species. The thrush's nest is a large cup of sticks, dry grass, roots and moss, coated on the inside with a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> and lined with fine grass and leaves. The nest is built by the female, although the male may help. Nests built early in the breeding season may be destroyed by bad weather.|$|E
500|$|High winds {{caused a}} power outage, downed trees across the region, and {{destroyed}} {{the roofs of}} many buildings. Governor Colin Thornley estimated that over 70%of the buildings in the territory were damaged, and more than 10,000people were left homeless. Some shelters set up before the storm were destroyed in the hurricane. The hurricane destroyed the wall at an insane asylum, which allowed the residents to escape. High waves damaged a prison, prompting officials to institute a [...] "daily parole" [...] program for the inmates. Hattie also flooded the Government House, washing away all records. All of Belize City was coated in a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> and debris, and majority {{of the city was}} destroyed or severely damaged, as was nearby Stann Creek. The hurricane left significant crop damage across the region, including $2million in citrus fruits and similar losses to timber, cocoa, and bananas. The year's production of sugar cane was also heavily damaged. About 70%of the territory's mahogany trees were downed, as were most citrus and grapefruit trees. The hurricane damaged several factories and oil rigs in the region. Damage throughout the territory totaled $60million (1961USD), and a total of 307deaths were reported; more than 100of the fatalities were in Belize City, including 36 who evacuated to a British administration building that was later destroyed in the storm. The government of British Honduras considered Hurricane Hattie more damaging than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000people; the lower death toll of Hattie was due to advance warning.|$|E

5000|$|Dinosaurs {{lived on}} the continents before grasses evolved (the [...] "Age of the Grasses" [...] evolved with the [...] "Age of the Mammals"); the dinosaurs lived in the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous and left many trackways, both from plant-eaters and the meat-eaters, in various <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> and sand.|$|R
50|$|A small, 2 m2 {{excavation}} {{was made}} on the tell by Henri de Contenson in 1974. The excavations revealed about 7.5 m of deposit on the site consisting <b>of</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud,</b> ashes and burned earth. The deposit at the site was phased into two levels owing to typological differences in the artifacts, but the site shows a continuous occupation through both phases.|$|R
60|$|It may be here {{remarked that}} after very heavy rain shallow pools {{may be seen}} on level or nearly level fields, where the soil is not very porous, and the water in them is often {{slightly}} muddy; when such little pools have dried, the leaves and blades of grass at their bottoms are generally coated with a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud.</b> This mud I believe is derived in large part from recently ejected castings.|$|E
60|$|When {{this had}} been done, a hole was cut for the smoke, {{directly}} through {{the side of the}} house. The danger of setting the building on fire was great; but we strove to guard against it so much as possible by plastering a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> over the wood, and by keeping careful watch when we had a roaring fire. Oftentimes were we forced to stop in the task of cooking, take all the vessels from the coals, and throw water upon the blazing logs.|$|E
60|$|Let C y (Fig. 4) be the sea-bottom, y D the shore, x y the sea-level, {{then the}} coarser deposit will subside {{over the region}} B, the finer over A, while beyond A {{there will be no}} deposit at all; and, consequently, no record will be kept, simply because no deposit is going on. Now, suppose that the whole land, C, D, which we have {{regarded}} as stationary, goes down, as it does so, both A and B go further out from the shore, which will be at y1; x1, y1, being the new sea-level. The consequence will be that the <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> (A), being now, for the most part, further than the force of the current is strong enough to convey even the finest 'debris', will, of course, receive no more deposits, and having attained a certain thickness will now grow no thicker.|$|E
50|$|There was no free {{oxygen in}} earthâ€™s {{atmosphere}} till about 2000 million years ago, {{but there were}} photosynthesizing cyanobacteria. The oxygen these microorganisms produced rapidly reacted with, amongst others, any dissolved iron compounds in the water, producing insoluble red iron oxide (rust), which precipitated out during the daylight hours. At night these reactions stopped. The result was alternating red and gray <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> which, when consolidated, became banded ironstones.|$|R
5000|$|Shibam {{is often}} called [...] "the oldest {{skyscraper}} city in the world" [...] It {{is one of the}} oldest and best examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction. The city has some <b>of</b> the tallest <b>mud</b> buildings in the world, with some of them over 30 meters (100 ft) high, thus being early high-rise apartment buildings. In order to protect the buildings from rain and erosion, the walls must be routinely maintained by applying fresh <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud.</b>|$|R
50|$|Erosion of sand on {{the beach}} at Formby is {{revealing}} <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> and sediment, laid down in the late Mesolithic to the late Neolithic, approximately 8,000 - 5,000 years ago, and covered in the early Bronze Age. These sediments often contain the footprints of humans and animals (red deer, roe deer, wild boar, wolf, aurochs) and birds (oystercatcher, crane and other waders) from that period. In June 2016, over 50 human footprints from 7000 years ago were uncovered {{on the beach}}.|$|R
6000|$|Suppose then (to argue {{from the}} {{known to the}} unknown) that you were {{watching}} men cleaning out a pond. Atop, perhaps, they would come to a layer of soft mud, and under that to a layer of sand. Would not common sense {{tell you that the}} sand was there first, and that the water had laid down the mud on the top of it? Then, perhaps, they might come to a layer of dead leaves. Would not common sense tell you that the leaves were there before the sand above them? Then, perhaps, to a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> again. Would not common sense tell you that the mud was there before the leaves? And so on {{down to the bottom of}} the pond, where, lastly, I think common sense would tell you that the bottom of the pond was there already, before all the layers which were laid down on it. Is not that simple common sense? ...|$|E
60|$|For {{you find}} in the beds, from the top to the bottom (at least in Cheshire), {{particles}} of mica. Now this mica {{could not have been}} formed in the sand. It is a definite crystalline mineral, whose composition is well known. It is only found in rocks which have been subjected to immense pressure, and probably to heat. The granites and mica-slates of Anglesey are full of it; and from Anglesey--as likely as from anywhere else--these thin scales of mica came. And that is about all that I can say on the matter. But it is certain that most of these sands were deposited in a very shallow water, and very near to land. Sand and pebbles, as I said in my first paper, could not be carried far out to sea; and some of the beds of the Bunter are full of rounded pebbles. Nay, it is certain that their surface was often out of water. Of that you may see very pretty proofs. You find these sands ripple-marked, as you do shore-sands now. You find cracks where the marl mud has dried in the sun: and, more, you find the little pits made by rain. Of that I have no doubt. I have seen specimens, in which you could not only see at a glance that the marks had been made by the large drops of a shower, but see also from what direction the shower had come. These delicate markings must have been covered up immediately with a fresh <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> or sand. How long since? How long since that flag had seen the light of the sun, when it saw it once again, restored to the upper air by the pick of the quarryman? Who can answer that? Not I.|$|E
6000|$|If {{you wish}} to learn the first {{elements}} of geology by direct experiment, do this: The next rainy day--the harder it rains the better--instead of sitting at home over the fire, and reading a book about geology, put on a macintosh and thick boots, and get away, I care not whither, provided you can find there running water. If you have not time to get away to a hilly country, {{then go to the}} nearest bit of turnpike road, or the nearest sloping field, and see in little how whole continents are made, and unmade again. Watch the rain raking and sifting with its million delicate fingers, separating the finer particles from the coarser, dropping the latter as soon as it can, and carrying the former downward with it toward the sea. Follow the nearest roadside drain where it runs into a pond, and see how it drops the pebbles the moment it enters the pond, and then the sand in a fan-shaped heap at the nearest end; but carries the fine mud on, and holds it suspended, to be gradually deposited at the bottom in the still water; and say to yourself: Perhaps the sands which cover so many inland tracts were dropped by water, very near the shore of a lake or sea, and by rapid currents. Perhaps, again, the brick clays, which are often mingled with these sands, were dropped, like the mud in the pond, in deeper water farther from the shore, and certainly in stilt water. But more. Suppose once more, then, that looking and watching a pond being cleared out, under the lowest <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud,</b> you found--as you would find in any of those magnificent reservoirs so common in the Lancashire hills--a layer of vegetable soil, with grass and brushwood rooted in it. What would you say but: The pond has not been always full. It has at some time or other been dry enough to let a whole copse grow up inside it? ...|$|E

50|$|Lenticular bedding is a {{sedimentary}} bedding pattern displaying alternating <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> and sand. Formed {{during periods}} <b>of</b> slack water, <b>mud</b> {{suspended in the}} water is deposited on top of small formations of sand once the water's velocity has reached zero. Lenticular bedding is classified by its large quantities <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> relative to sand, whereas a flaser bed consists mostly of sand. The sand formations within the bedding display a 'lens-like' shape, giving the pattern its respected name. They are commonly found in high-energy environments such as the intertidal and supratidal zones. Geologists use lenticular bedding to show evidence of tidal rhythm, tidal currents and tidal slack, in a particular environment.|$|R
50|$|Without {{the use of}} the {{inexpensive}} and skilled labor force under the state and federal assistance programs, it would have been impossible to build the miles of carefully hewn coral stone walls and native stone buildings. The quality of the CCC's work was verified in 1945 when a hurricane resulted in 12-foot waves rolling over Matheson Hammock, causing immense damage to equipment and furnishings, and depositing <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> and trash in the park, but the basic CCC structures stood firm and the park recovered.|$|R

50|$|Petroleum is a {{naturally}} occurring liquid found in rock formations. It {{consists of a}} complex mixture of hydrocarbons of various molecular weights, plus other organic compounds. It is generally accepted that oil is formed mostly from the carbon rich remains of ancient plankton after exposure to heat and pressure in Earth's crust over {{hundreds of millions of}} years.

5000|$|Peloid indeed can't be {{used when}} it dries and hardens, but the spa, {{organized}} as the Special hospital for rehabilitation [...] "Rusanda", always has stored quantities of it, in cases the complete drying up happens. To change the properties <b>of</b> the <b>mud,</b> the drought would have to last much longer, at least a 1,000 years, and one dry season is not nearly enough.

50|$|The chotts of the Sahara are fed {{intermittently}} {{during periods}} of infrequent rainfall.

This salt accumulation can lead chotts to have particularly high albedo, albeit with comparable variability as well. While evaporite deposition predominates on chotts, in more humid climatic periods, <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> can be deposited on the chott surface.

500|$|A {{seamount}} such as Davidson is {{an underwater}} volcano; this one rises over [...] above the surrounding ocean floor. Although {{there are over}} 30,000 seamounts in the Pacific Ocean alone, only about 0.1% {{of them have been}} explored.
