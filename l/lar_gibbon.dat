Broberg thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition. Linnaeus tried to debunk some of these creatures, as he had with the hydra; regarding the purported remains of dragons, Linnaeus wrote that they were either derived from lizards or rays. For Homo troglodytes he asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, {{but they did not}} find any signs of its existence.

5000|$|<b>Lar</b> <b>gibbons</b> {{have the}} {{greatest}} north-south range {{of any of the}} gibbon species. [...] They are found in Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand. Their range historically extended from southwest China to Thailand and Burma south to the whole Malay Peninsula in primary and secondary tropical rain forests. It is also present in the northwest portion of the island of Sumatra. In recent decades, especially, the continental range has been reduced and fragmented. <b>Lar</b> <b>gibbons</b> are likely extinct in China, but if they still exist, they would only be found in southwest Yunnan, their former range.|$|R

50|$|<b>Lar</b> <b>gibbons</b> are diurnal and arboreal, inhabiting rain forests. <b>Lar</b> <b>gibbons</b> {{are usually}} active {{for an average}} of 8.7 hours per day, leaving their {{sleeping}} sites right around sunrise and entering sleeping trees an average of 3.4 hours before sunset. On average, <b>lar</b> <b>gibbons</b> spend their days feeding (32.6%), resting (26.2%), traveling (24.2%), in social activities (11.3%), vocalizing (4.0%) and in intergroup encounters (1.9%), although actual proportions of activities can change significantly {{over the course of the}} year. They rarely come to the ground, instead using their long arms to brachiate through the trees. With their hooked hands, they can move swiftly with great momentum, swinging from the branches. Although they rarely come to the ground naturally, while there, they walk bipedally with arms raised above their heads for balance. Their social organization is dominated by monogamous family pairs, with one breeding male and one female along with their offspring. When a juvenile reaches sexual maturity, it is expelled from the family unit. However, this traditional conception has come under scrutiny. Long-term studies conducted in Khao Yai National Park in Thailand suggest their mating system is somewhat flexible, incorporating extra-pair copulations, partner changes and polyandrous groupings.|$|R

40|$|The Author(s) 2009. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The Nangunhe Nature Reserve in Southwest Yunnan (PRC) {{has long been}} presumed {{to be the last}} stronghold of <b>lar</b> (or white-handed) <b>gibbons</b> (Hylobates <b>lar)</b> in China and the likely last place of occurrence of Hylobates lar yunnanensis. We conducted a comprehensive survey to assess the status of <b>lar</b> <b>gibbons</b> at Nangunhe. We found no visual or auditory evidence of them still residing at the reserve and therefore tentatively conclude that <b>lar</b> <b>gibbons</b> have become extinct in China. It appears that large-scale destruction of primary forests in the 1960 s and 1970 s brought about an initial decline in their numbers, and subsequent uncontrolled hunting has resulted in their extirpation. The situation for the six Chinese ape taxa is nothing less than disastrous, with 1 taxon assumed to have become extinct during the last few years, 1 taxon not having been confirmed since the 1980 s, and 2 species a...|$|R

Originally opened in 1942 to house the big cats, the Monkey Pavilion exhibits a variety of the zoo's smaller primate and mammal species.

50|$|Sexually, {{they are}} similar to other gibbons. Mating occurs in every month of the year, but most conceptions occur {{during the dry season}} in March, with a peak in births during the late rainy season, in October. On average, females {{reproduce}} {{for the first time at}} about 11 years of age in the wild, much later than in captivity. Gestation is six months long on average, and pregnancies are usually of a single young. Young are nursed for approximately two years, and full maturity comes at about eight years. The life expectancy of the <b>lar</b> <b>gibbons</b> in the wild is about 25 years.|$|R

In this study, we investigated the most common close range vocalisation of <b>lar</b> <b>gibbons</b> (Hylobates <b>lar),</b> the ‘hoo’ call. Gibbons and siamangs (family Hylobatidae) {{are known for their}} conspicuous and elaborate songs, while quieter, close range vocalisations have received almost no empirical attention, perhaps due to the difficult observation conditions in their natural forest habitats. Results We found that ‘hoo’ calls were emitted by both sexes in a variety of contexts, including feeding, separation from group members, encountering predators, interacting with neighbours, or as part of duet songs by the mated pair. Acoustic analyses revealed that ‘hoo’ calls varied in a number of spectral parameters {{as a function of the}} different contexts. Males’ and females’ ‘hoo’ calls showed similar variation in these context-specific parameter differences, although there were also consistent sex differences in frequency across contexts. Conclusions Our study provides evidence that <b>lar</b> <b>gibbons</b> are able to generate significant, context-dependent acoustic variation within their main social call, which potentially allows recipients to make inferences about the external events experienced by the caller. Communicating about different events by producing subtle acoustic variation within some call types appears to be a general feature of primate communication, which can increase the expressive power of vocal signals within the constraints of limited vocal tract flexibility that is typical for all non-human primates. In this sense, this study is of direct relevance for the on-going debate about the nature and origins of vocally-based referential communication and the evolution of human speech...|$|R
