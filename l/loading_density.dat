40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{results of}} a fire <b>load</b> <b>density</b> survey carried out in Ouro Preto {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil are presented. The {{inventory}} method is used and details of the survey methodology and processing are given. Forty-three buildings are surveyed and the determination of fire <b>load</b> <b>density</b> is made for 39 occupancies, each occupancy comprising one or more rooms, or even an entire building. The average fire <b>load</b> <b>density</b> is 2989 MJ/m 2 and the standard deviation is 2833 MJ/m 2. Commercial stores are found to be the most heavily loaded but a single maximum fire <b>load</b> <b>density</b> of 14, 560 MJ/m 2 is found in a drugstore. Because of new extensions of old buildings, some rooms have relatively low fire loads. It is observed that wood contributes a substantial portion of fire load, being 35 % of movable fire load and 37 % of fixed fire load. Comparison of the results, with those established by Brazilian standard NBR 14432, indicate that measured values could exceed standard values by up to a factor of 10.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to determine electrical network cost and cost structure depending on <b>load</b> <b>density.</b> <b>Load</b> <b>density</b> together with a defined customer mix directly determines the supply task, i. e., the number of connection points and their density in a geographical area {{as well as their}} <b>load</b> profiles. <b>Load</b> <b>density</b> indirectly determines the construction conditions since higher <b>load</b> <b>density</b> means a higher building efficiency which in turn leads to restrictions in land use and more strict structural requirements. The applied methodology adopts features from several engineering-economic approaches with the three basic steps: (1) Description of the supply task including relevant characteristics of the service area. (2) Network generation. Linear approximations of cost functions for lines and substations are used together with geometrical models of symmetrical and homogeneous load dispersion to determine optimal substation spacings. (3) Monetary assessment of the generated asset structure including operational and maintenance costs. The cost-effects of different external cost-drivers are incorporated into the applied cost functions. All network levels from low voltage connections up to EHV substations are included. Additionally, reliability indices are determined for the model network sample feeders with different mitigation strategies. Actual substation service areas are used as references to the calculated results. Additionally, based on the connection point data of these reference substation areas, another reference medium voltage network is created using an optimization algorithm developed at Helsinki University of Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering. Using the model network approach, cost is determined for networks in rural, suburban, urban and urban core zones. The cost structure and level varies from zone to zone depending on the allowed equipment, share of open space and customer mix. When moving towards the highest <b>load</b> <b>densities</b> in urban and urban core areas, the cost lowering caused by higher connection point density is attenuated due to the higher unit cost of equipment. The created analytic and geometric network model, even with massive simplifications, is proven suitable for estimating the network volume and cost for different zones and <b>load</b> <b>densities.</b> The applied methodology forms a qualified framework for further development of the model network approach...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringRonaldo G. MaghirangThere {{are several}} {{stressful}} events throughout an animal’s lifetime, but transportation {{is considered one}} of the most detrimental events to animal welfare by many professionals, regardless of species. Transportation consists of several different interacting and compounding factors that can affect animal welfare and meat product quality. The purpose of this report is to review current industry practices of land transport of different livestock types to slaughter facilities, primarily within the United States and Canada. This review evaluated species-specific transport practices and subsequent effects on animal welfare and carcass quality for both animal welfare and economic outlooks. Regulations are placed on the driver and time limits that the animals are allowed to be in transit. Trailer style use partially depends on the age and species of animal that is being hauled. Cattle are more likely to be hauled in pot belly trailers, while pigs are often transported in either pot belly or straight deck trailers. Poultry trailer type directly depends on the age of the birds being transported. Enclosed trailers are more often used in the European Union but are slowly making an impression on United States and Canadian markets. Cattle are transported several times in their lives with each trip varying in duration, <b>loading</b> <b>density,</b> and other environment altering factors. Each time the animals are transported there is the risk of low air flow, heat, or cold stress that can reduce animal welfare. <b>Loading</b> <b>density</b> has been broken down to equations, duration is limited by hours in trailer and location, and changes in physiology and behavior further exacerbate cattle transport stress. Pigs are transported fewer times than cattle, but thousands of pigs die during this process each year. Market weight pig mortality predictability increases with increasing temperature-humidity index and also increasing loading densities, with a specific equation to quantify this correlation. Shrink is another factor that can be linearly derived as transport time increases in swine. Fatigued Pig Syndrome is welfare issues that can impact the meat product resulting in pale, soft, and exudative pork. Poultry are usually only shipped once or twice and require special trailers and equipment. Shipping crates or modular drawers are used for grown birds where the birds are loaded into these containers, and then placed on a poultry trailer. Poultry have a very narrow comfort window of 21 °C to 24 °C, making transport difficult and detrimental to their welfare. <b>Loading</b> <b>density</b> is based on type and size of shipping container; however, regardless of <b>loading</b> <b>density,</b> the likelihood of bird death increases drastically as duration increases...|$|E

40|$|Methods {{to control}} the {{development}} of toxic by-products in the water were evaluated for various pet-fish species enclosed in polyethylene bags overlayed with oxygen. A formula of three components was developed that decreased the concentration of ammonia and carbon dioxide, controlled bacterial growth, and maintained a higher pH compared with untreated controls held under similar conditions. Clinoptilolite at 14 g/liter controlled the ammonia accumulation, tris buffer (0. 017 M) at pH 8. 0 controlled the accumulation of free CO 2, and neomycin sulfate at 20 mg/liter prevented bacterial blooms. Fish were held up to 48 hours and at <b>loading</b> <b>densities</b> up to 180 g/liter with favorable results. Field tests of the formulation were conducted by air-transporting several species of pet fish from either Florida or east Asia to Seattle, Washington at <b>loading</b> <b>densities</b> that averaged 102 and 87 g/liter, respectively. The average transit time from Asia was longer than shipments from Florida, 36 hours compared to 22 hours. In all test groups, the ammonia and CO 2 concentrations were reduced and the pH remained higher compared with controls. However, better control occurred in the Florida tests when the transit time was shorter. In addition, mortality was reduced. The data indicated that fish can be transported at higher <b>loading</b> <b>densities</b> {{for longer periods of}} time, and can be received in better condition, when the formula is used than by current shipping practices...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are basic}} {{advantages}} inherent to the Short Magnum concept. The {{idea is that}} the short, fat powder column gives a more uniform <b>load</b> <b>density</b> and ignition rate and therefore a more consistent burn. This in turn should translate into improved accuracy and potentially moderate recoil due to more efficient use of propellants.|$|R
