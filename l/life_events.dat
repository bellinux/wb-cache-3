5|$|As {{the game}} proceeds, flashbacks occur showing events in Harris and Klebold's lives {{which may have}} caused them to commit murder; real <b>life</b> <b>events</b> are {{compressed}} into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes. Much of the plot is constructed around the events precisely as they {{are believed to have}} occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos of each other. In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang music {{generally}} {{could be}} found as the social entertainment at a host of different occasions. It is used during large feasts, festive/harvest gatherings, for entertainment of visiting friends and relatives, and at parades. Kulintang music also accompanies ceremonies marking significant <b>life</b> <b>events,</b> such as weddings and returnees from the Hajj. Kulintang music also {{plays a significant role}} during state functions, used during official celebrations, entertaining of foreign dignitaries and important visitors of distant lands, court ceremonies of either the sultanate or village chieftains, enthroning/coronations of a new leader and the transferral of a sultanate from one family to another.|$|E
5|$|L.A. Noires open {{world is}} a {{recreation}} of 1947 Los Angeles. The development team conducted field research in Los Angeles throughout the game's development, and compiled multiple aerial photographs to gather traffic and building information. Various plot points and investigations in the game are based on real <b>life</b> <b>events,</b> such as the Black Dahlia case. Like other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire uses licensed music provided by an in-game radio. Over 30 licensed tracks continuously loop on one radio station. The game also features an original score composed {{by a group of}} musicians and inspired by 1940s films.|$|E
30|$|All {{coefficients}} for both <b>life</b> <b>event</b> load {{and number of}} admissions are positive and significant.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to examine relationships between cognitive emotion regu-lation strategies and depressive symptomatology across different types of <b>life</b> <b>event.</b> A sample of 138 secondary school students filled out a questionnaire. They were asked to indicate their most nega-tive <b>life</b> <b>event</b> ever. On the basis of their answers, 3 types of negative <b>life</b> <b>event</b> were distinguished: loss, health threat, and relational stress experience. No relationship was found between type of negative <b>life</b> <b>event</b> and depressive symptomatology. Significant relationships were found between type of negative <b>life</b> <b>event</b> and the cognitive strategies self-blame and other-blame. Adolescents with a health threat experience scored higher on self-blame, while adolescents with a relational stress event scored higher on other-blame than the other groups. Significant relationships were also found between depressive symptomatology and the cognitive strategies self-blame, rumination, positive reappraisal, putting into perspective, and catastrophizing. No interaction effects were found between type of negative <b>life</b> <b>event</b> and cognitive strategies, suggesting that relationships between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptomatology are consistent across different types of <b>life</b> <b>event.</b> KEY WORDS: cognitive-coping; emotion-regulation; adolescents; depression...|$|R
5|$|Like regular {{characters}} in Fortress mode, characters have thirst, hunger and exhaustion levels. To survive, they must eat, drink and sleep. They {{need to take}} shelter at night when evil creatures like bogeymen come out. In addition to the regular combat mechanism, in this mode, the player can also choose which body parts to strike. A player can visit their retired or ruined fortresses made in Fortress mode. Instead of quitting, the character can be retired, and depending on the player's achievements, their <b>life</b> <b>events</b> will be documented in the Legends mode among the historical figures.|$|E

5|$|TransGeneration {{introduces}} {{viewers to}} four transgender college students—two trans women and two trans men—who are each studying {{at a different}} college in the United States during the 2004–2005 academic year. The series begins {{in the autumn of}} 2004, and concludes with an epilogue in the summer of 2005. Each episode revisits the students at an eventful time in their lives, and concentrates on <b>life</b> <b>events</b> that pertain directly to transgender experience.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} sought to prospectively explore the {{potential}} main effects and interactive relations among drive for thinness, <b>life</b> <b>event</b> stress, and harm avoidance in the prediction of disordered eating in an ethnically diverse sample of women (N = 58). During the initial and follow-up assessments, standardized questionnaires were utilized to assess drive for thinness, <b>life</b> <b>event</b> stress, and a harm avoidant temperament. Additionally, semi-structured diagnostic interviews were administered to assess disordered eating. Results revealed a significant interaction between drive for thinness and <b>life</b> <b>event</b> stress in the prediction of eating pathology. Neither the two-way <b>life</b> <b>event</b> stress x harm avoidance interaction nor the three-way drive for thinness x <b>life</b> <b>event</b> stress x harm avoidance interaction were significant predictors of eating pathology. These {{findings suggest that the}} previously suggested relation between drive for thinness and pathological eating is dependent upon the degree of <b>life</b> <b>event</b> stress experienced...|$|R
30|$|Independent of {{the model}} {{employed}} (cumulative, 25 %, 50 % or 75 % decay), the <b>life</b> <b>event</b> load {{was significantly associated with}} an increased risk of hospitalization per unit <b>life</b> <b>event</b> load. Adjustment for age and gender did not change the <b>life</b> <b>event</b> risk ratios. According to the log-likelihood, indicating the quality of fit, the decay model in which the <b>life</b> <b>event</b> load accumulates {{and at the same time}} decreases with a function of 25 % with every subsequent year (model II) was most in agreement with the observed data. Therefore, all further analyses will be done under model II.|$|R
30|$|We {{calculated}} {{three different}} <b>life</b> <b>event</b> load measures: (1) cumulative load (CL), i.e. the <b>life</b> <b>event</b> load {{at a particular}} point in time (year Y) calculated as {{the sum of the}} <b>life</b> <b>event</b> load in year Y and all preceding years; (2) cumulative load excluding events possibly or clearly related to the bipolar disorder (CL-NoBP); and (3) cumulative load including only independent events, thus excluding events possibly or clearly dependent on the respondents’ own behaviour (CL-I).|$|R
5|$|Rice is the {{foundation}} of every meal, and is often eaten with fish broth, greens, beans or squash. Manioc and green bananas are staples most commonly eaten when other more preferable foods are too expensive or out of season. The Antankarana were historically herders and although they are now generally agriculturalists, cattle are kept for milk. They are also viewed as a form of wealth; the number of cattle one gives away indicates generosity, and the number sacrificed to the ancestors is a measure of loyalty. The sacrifice of zebu is a typical element of many major rituals and celebrations ranging from Muslim holidays to <b>life</b> <b>events</b> like marriage, death and birth.|$|E
25|$|Studies suggest gender {{differences}} in the reminiscence bump. Researchers found that men have more positive <b>life</b> <b>events</b> in their thirties and that women have more positive <b>life</b> <b>events</b> in their twenties. This finding suggests that the timing of important positive <b>life</b> <b>events,</b> such as marriage or employment, differ for men and women. Most of the major <b>life</b> <b>events</b> start between the age of 15 and 30 but there is a small gender difference shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found that women have a slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of the bump in women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare the nature, severity and frequency of preceding life event; and the impact of stress between psychiatric and medical patients. A total of 256 patients, which were equally divided into 4 subgroups were recruited for this study. The psychiatric patients were comprised of neurotic and psychotic subgroup; while coronary heart disease (CHD) and other medical illness subgroup formed the medical group. The preceding <b>life</b> <b>event</b> and the objective negative impact were assessed with Interview for Recent <b>Life</b> <b>Event</b> (IRLE). At least one preceding <b>life</b> <b>event</b> was reported in 206 patients. Of these, 179 (87 %) reported independent event. Neurotic patients reported the highest number of independent <b>life</b> <b>event,</b> whereas psychotic subgroup had the most frequent dependent event. Family and social problem were the most common problem encountered by patients in both groups. Although neurotic patients suffered the most severe impact of stress, there was no significant difference in the severity as compared with other subgroups...|$|R

25|$|A life {{script is}} a schema that {{outlines}} cultural appropriate events that individuals should experience during {{a specific time}} period. (Berntsen & Rubin, 2004). The life script account argues that the reminiscence bump occurs because individuals use life script memories to provide a basis of recalling important memories. The life script events often contain more memories during early adulthood, or the reminiscence bump, than any other age period (Berntsen & Rubin, 2004).The life script account emphasizes norms and expectations typical of a given culture {{with regard to the}} timing of major <b>life</b> <b>events.</b> The order and timing of the major events may differ depending on the culture. The life script is a representation of the sequence of normative and major <b>life</b> <b>events.</b> Individuals know the culturally shared expectations of the order and timing of <b>life</b> <b>events</b> in a prototypical life, and are also aware of their own timing in relations to those norms. It assumes that people have an internalized culturally-aware script of the events that make up an expected, skeletal life course; this script acts as a template for the recall of <b>life</b> <b>events</b> in association with each life phase.|$|E
