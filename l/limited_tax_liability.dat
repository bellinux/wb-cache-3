In this volume, outstanding authors cover various aspects of the national and international tax order when European law meets domestic taxation. This includes testing traditional pillars of income taxation – ability-to-pay, source and residence, abuse of law, arm’s length standard – with respect to their place in the emerging European tax order as well as substantial matters of co-existence between different tax systems that are not covered by the non-discrimination approach such as mutual recognition, cross-border loss compensation or avoidance of double taxation.

40|$|Dual {{residence}} in the taxation of individuals Each country {{has the right to}} determine on which grounds and to what extent it exercises its tax authority. In the case of individuals a country usually bases its right to levy taxes on the connection between the country and the individual, or the country and the income or wealth in question. This thesis deals with the connection that exists between the country and the individual. Under domestic tax law systems a separation is usually made into full and <b>limited</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> Full tax liability arises when there are strong ties between the individual and the state. Residence is usually considered a strong tie that results in full tax liability. A person who is resident in a country, and therefore subject to full tax liability, is usually taxed on his world wide income. However, if the person is not resident, the state does not claim the right to tax the individual as such, but taxes income that arises within the territory of the country. When determining {{residence in}} one country, no consideration is given to whether the person is also resident in other countries. Consequently, individuals can as a result of cross border movement be considered resident both in the country of arrival and the country of departure. When two countries both consider an individual resident, dual residence arises. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse three aspects of dual residence. First and foremost, national rules on residence will be analysed, as well as how dual residence occurs in practice. Secondly, the rules on how to determine tax residence for tax treaty purposes are discussed. Thirdly, the tax consequences of dual residence will be investigated. The emphasis will be on the first two aspects of dual residence mentioned. The thesis is based on a dogmatic approach to legal research. Some elements of comparative methods of research are also present. A person who is resident in Finland is subject to full tax liability in Finland. Residence for income tax purposes is determined in the income tax act (ITA) § 11. According to ITA § 11 a person is resident in Finland if he has his main abode and home in Finland, stays over six months in Finland or falls under the three-year rule. Finnish nationals who leave Finland are {{as a result of the}} three-year rule considered resident the year of departure and the three following years. <b>Limited</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> can arise before the three- year period ends if the individual can produce evidence that he lacks substantial ties to Finland. The Finnish rules on residence are partly problematic. The rules on when a visit to Finland has fulfilled the six months requirement are unclear. Also, the three-year rule does not specify what a substantial tie is. The three-year rule furthermore distinguishes between Finnish nationals and foreign nationals. Different tax consequences depending on nationality can be problematic from an EU perspective. A short analysis of the current ECJ cases, however, indicates that the three-year rule is probably in conformity with EU law. Residence is also used to determine tax liability for the purpose of other taxes, such as the gift and inheritance tax, car tax, municipal tax and social security contributions. Each above-mentioned tax has its own notion of residence. The different concepts of residence are compared with the residence concept that is used for income tax purposes. The comparison led to the observation that the residence concept for income tax purposes can impact on the other residence concepts. Usually residence for other tax purposes does not impact on the residence status for income tax purposes. However, the tax authorities claim that belonging to the Finnish social security system is a substantial tie according to the three-year rule. The Finnish rules on residence for income tax purposes are in many ways interesting in comparison to other countries rules on residence. A comparison has been made with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom and the USA. Most of the above-mentioned countries have fairly recently amended and modernized their rules on residence. The comparison demonstrates that the Finnish rules on residence are outdated and in need of reformation. For instance, nationality does not carry any weight when determining tax liability in most other countries (except for the USA). When a Finnish national moves abroad, he is usually subject to full tax liability in the country of arrival, and at the same time subject to full tax liability in Finland due to the three-year rule. The resulting dual residence is solved by tax treaty, provided that the countries have concluded a treaty. For tax treaty purposes a person can only have one tax treaty residence at a time. Residence for tax treaty purposes is determined through the tie breaker in article 4 (2). The state of residence has the primary right to tax the individual. The tie breaker is, however, problematic, since the criteria on which residence is decided are partly ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways. Therefore the general rules on tax treaty interpretation have to be considered. Rules on tax treaty interpretation can be found in domestic legislation, international law, the Vienna convention, article 3 (2) of tax treaties, and in the commentaries to the model tax convention. Some of the rules on interpretation can lead to different outcomes. The parties can also have diverging information about the individual s personal circumstances. Therefore it is possible that two countries cannot reach an agreement on which country should be the individual s state of residence according to article 4. When both countries claim to be the state of residence, the conflict shall be settled by the mutual agreement procedure in article 25 of the tax treaty. The mutual agreement procedure is time consuming and results cannot be guaranteed. In Finland there are no publications by the tax authorities on the mutual agreement procedure, and the procedure is hence not very well known. Therefore, I have tried to describe how the mutual agreement procedure is executed in practice. In 2008 the OECD added an arbitration clause to its model convention as a final means to solve tax treaty disputes that have not been solved by the mutual agreement procedure. Finland has not, however, included the clause in its treaties. Dual residence can result in several different consequences for the taxation of individuals, and the possible consequences are analysed in this thesis. The taxation of dual resident individuals can vary greatly from one situation to another depending on domestic legislation in both countries of residence, the type of income, the source of income, the tax treaties articles and the interpretation of the tax treaty. The taxation of dual resident persons can be divided into situations where no tax treaty has been concluded, a tax treaty exists and Finland is not the state of residence, and situations where both countries claim residence status according to the tax treaty. Some Finnish tax treaties include the three-year rule in article 23. According to the clause the source country is granted a more comprehensive, but secondary, right to tax persons who are resident according to domestic tax law, although the residence state for tax treaty purposes is in the other country. To demonstrate the impact of dual residence on the taxation of individuals, the taxation in Finland of interest, dividend, capital gains, salary and pensions is described through practical examples. Situations of dual residence can also have other tax implications, e. g. is there a progressive impact on other income, and how are deductions and losses taken into account when Finland is not the state of residence according to article 4 ? Dual residence does not necessarily cause double taxation as a result of national rules on credit and exemption and the elimination of double taxation. The concluding chapter sheds light on some of the most urgent problems in the current legislation on residence and presents some suggestions for improvements. The rules on {{residence in the}} domestic income tax act are scrutinized in detail. It is suggested that the nationality criterion in the three-year rule is abolished, and that substantial ties are defined in the income tax act. Furthermore, it is also suggested that the national rules on the elimination of double taxation are elucidated and that the scale of application is extended. On the international level it is recommended that article 3 (2) in the OECD model tax convention is amended to primarily recommend an interpretation according to the context. Some minor adjustments are also presented to the articles on residence and mutual agreement. Varje stat får självständigt reglera utsträckningen av och kriterierna för sin beskattningsbehörighet. I fråga om fysiska personer baserar sig statens beskattningsbehörighet vanligen på antingen anknytningar mellan staten och den skattskyldige eller anknytningar mellan staten och skatteobjektet. Denna forskning tar sin utgångspunkt i förhållandet mellan den skattskyldige och en stat. I Finland gör man en uppdelning i allmänt och begränsat skattskyldiga personer. En person som enligt inkomstskattelagen är bosatt i Finland anses vara allmänt skattskyldig, och beskattas således för sina globala inkomster. Alla andra är begränsat skattskyldiga, och beskattas bara för inkomst med sin källa i Finland. Andra länder har vanligen motsvarande regler. Således kan det vid gränsöverskridande rörlighet hända att avfärdslandet anser att den skattskyldige fortsättningsvis är skatterättsligt bosatt där, medan allmän skattskyldighet aktualiseras i det nya vistelselandet. Om två länder samtidigt anser att en och samma person är bosatt och allmänt skattskyldig i landet i fråga uppstår dubbelboende. I denna forskning granskas tre skeden av dubbelboende. Först behandlas hur boende enligt nationell rätt och dubbelboende uppstår. För det andra analyseras hur dubbelboendekonflikter löses genom bestämmandet av hemvist i de fall då skatteavtal ingåtts. För det tredje redogörs för de skattekonsekvenser dubbelboendesituationer får. Boken avslutas med förslag för hur nationell och internationell rätt kunde utvecklas...|$|E
40|$|Topic: The {{study is}} linked to the concept of a group of companies. A group {{is at the same time}} a legal and {{economical}} phenomenon. An international group of companies consists of companies and permanent establishments located in different states. The study covers not only subsidiaries to be consolidated to the group financial statement, but also associated enterprises where the group’s ownership can be below 50 % and which will not, therefore, be consolidated. Such associated enterprises which do not belong to the group under accounting and company laws can have a firm connection to the group. Regarding taxation, attention will be paid to the conditions and terms concluded inside the group. Adjustments can also become a factor in relation associated enterprises which are not consolidated if the conditions and terms concluded deviate from what would have been agreed on at the open market. The main goal of the thesis is to find out how international regulation created within the OECD and EU harmonises the taxation of interest payments between associated enterprises. The study consists of the levels of tax treaty law, European Community law and domestic tax law. From these three levels, the focus is on European Community law or in a wider context on the European Union. The main research methods are legal dogmatic and comparative law. The comparative part of the study focuses on the tax systems of the United States of America, Germany, Estonia and Finland. The macro level comparison covers not only domestic international laws, tax treaties, case law and other official documents, but also customary methods of interpretation, ways of transposing international agreements into the national legal order and carrying out international law obligations in the respective countries. These countries have been chosen from the Finnish point-of-view. The United States was a significant capital exporting country before the current economical recession. The U. S. tax treaty policy and domestic international tax laws have had a great impact on other countries’ tax systems. Economically, Germany is the most powerful country in the EU. Relatively speaking, most of the preliminary references referred to the European Court of Justice dealing with direct income tax law are made by German courts. Estonia is interesting from the Finnish perspective due to geographical reasons and tax competition. The study also covers the Swedish tax system quite deeply. Sweden was not included in the macro level comparison because group taxation systems are similar in Finland and Sweden. The two countries also joined the EU at the same time. Micro level comparison, which examines specific legal institutions, was carried out with Belgium, Denmark, France, India, Mexico and the Netherlands as examples. Structure The study has ten chapters. Chapter 1 describes the goals, methodology, limitations and sources of the thesis. Chapter 2 presents principles and goals which affect interpretation of tax law. The principles of legality and equality may be legally enforced, whereas ability to pay, neutrality and fairness are goals for the improvement of the society’s social feature. Chapter 2 first discusses the sources of international taxation from international law and treaties before and moving on to international tax law and its interpretation. European tax law is studied from a critical perspective. The impact of acquis communautaire on national tax systems has been compared to a jack-in-the-box which lowers the predictability of tax assessment. Chapter 3 deals with the history of direct tax harmonisation and the current possibilities to cross-border loss-relief. The European Commission’s initiatives for group taxation - Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base and Home State Taxation - are discussed. Thin capitalisation and transfer pricing problems would be eliminated if these initiatives were adopted. Companies taking part into unitary taxation would be fiscally consolidated at a group level. Corporate tax harmonisation could go further than this in theory. An EU tax would eliminate the current constitutional problems. The EU tax would create a direct tax link between the EU and its citizens. The EU’s political accountability would be improved if the European Parliament’s involvement in the adoption of tax laws was increased. Chapter 4 presents group financing from a taxation point-of-view. Debt financing may provide tax benefits in cross-border situations. Interest payments are usually deductible expenses, whereas dividend paid to a foreign parent company may usually not be deducted out of company profits. The differential tax treatment of debt and equity may imply tax-planning opportunities for group financing. Groups of companies may strive to allocate group financing companies into low-tax jurisdictions where the general tax rate is low, and extend intercompany loans into high-tax jurisdictions where the benefit of a tax deduction is high. Equity investments also provide tax-planning opportunities. The international tax treaty network and the Parent-Subsidiary Directive eliminate taxation at source from intra-group dividends as well. Chapter 5 examines the concept of an associated enterprise. The concept of an associated enterprise is defined differently in the OECD Model Tax Convention and the Interest and Royalties Directive. International accounting standards and domestic accounting and tax laws also define the concept using their own criteria. A company belonging to a group of companies may, in practice, be an associated company under accounting laws but fall outside the scope of the Interest and Royalties Directive. Chapters 6 - 9 deal with the concept of interest, taxation principles, interest deductions and transfer pricing issues dealing with interest and financing. Interest is commonly considered to be return on debt capital. The concept of interest has not been defined in the Finnish Income Tax Act or Business Income Tax Act. The Act on Taxation of Income of a Person Subject to <b>Limited</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>Liability</b> contains a definition of interest which is applied between associated companies located in different EU member states. Interest, according to the Act, means any income from debt-claims whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits. The legal concept of interest is generally equal to the economic concept of interest. Return on zero-coupon bonds and perpetual loans are considered to be interest. The amount of interest is determined by percentage of interest, time and debt. Debt is characterized by the debtor-creditor relationship and the absence of participation rights. Finnish tax law does not explicitly rule how to draw a line between debt and equity. The classification of hybrid instruments under civil law is generally a starting-point. The classification is also based on case law. The economic substance of an instrument can be considered. There are no published cases where hybrid equity would have been reclassified as debt for tax purposes. Debt has been reclassified as equity only in a few cases. According to the Commentary to the OECD Model Tax Convention, interest generally means remuneration on money lent, being remuneration coming within the category of “income form movable capital”. Article 11 OECD states that interest means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits and income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, in particular. There is an interconnection between interest and dividends in the Articles of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Interest on participating bonds should normally not be considered as a dividend; also, interest on convertible bonds should not be considered as a dividend before the bonds are actually converted as shares. It may be difficult to make a distinction between interest and dividend in situations of thin capitalisation. If the repayment of loan largely depends on the success of an enterprise, interest paid on such loans may be taxed as a dividend. The Contracting States may widen Article 11 OECD as to include any income which is taxed as interest under their domestic laws. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines require that the arm’s principle shall be followed in group financing. The arm’s length principle requires that associated enterprises shall apply market based interest rate and other financing terms to their internal debts and receivables. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines do not, however, indicate how an arm’s length interest rate should be determined. The comparable uncontrolled price method is usually the preferred method for determining an arm’s length interest rate. It can be challenging to find loan agreements which would be sufficiently close comparables as to type, quality and quantity with an intercompany loan. The cost plus method has also been suggested as a suitable method for evaluating a current interest rate. With regard to comparables, an internal uncontrolled comparable would be preferred. External comparables will nevertheless be used in many cases. Group interest rates can be compared with market interest rates or a simulated credit rating can be carried out. Chapter 10 concludes the thesis and discusses future scenarios on interest deductions in Finland. Finland does not have statutory thin capitalisation rules. The Finnish approach is liberal toward thin capitalisation. The tax authorities evaluate a company’s financing structure as a whole. Attention will be paid to the company’s debt to equity ratio and whether interest is paid in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Debt push-down structures have been widely used. Highly-leveraged financing structures have been subject to tax audits. It is fairly common to declare that debt to equity ratio 15 : 1 is accepted in Finland. This debt to equity ratio was accepted by the Supreme Administrative Court in KHO 1999 : 19. A clear rule should not be drawn only from one judgment. Published case-law of the Supreme Administrative Court dealing with thin capitalisation is limited. Many of the cases have been decided on the basis of a double taxation treaty. A qualified non-discrimination article following Article 24 (4) of OECD Model Tax Convention has prevented a denial of deductibility of interest. The EC Treaty Freedoms also require equal treatment of domestic and cross-border situations. Landmark cases dealing with thin capitalisation are cases C- 324 / 00 Lankhorst-Hohorst, C- 524 / 04 Thin Cap Group Litigation and C- 105 / 07 N. V. Lammers. The ECJ has found that the discriminatory application of thin capitalisation provisions involving a fixed debt to equity ratio constitutes a disproportionate restriction of the freedom of establishment. Domestic anti-abuse measures which categorically prevent taxpayers from exercising their right to free movement are not allowed unless domestic legislation has a “specific purpose of preventing wholly artificial arrangements”. Interest deductions in Finland de lege ferenda The Finnish Ministry of Finance published a study in April 2009 dealing with interest deductions in corporate income taxation. The study covers the current legal status in Finland, development in various European countries and the impact of European Community law and double taxation treaties on interest deductions. The aim is to discover whether deductibility of interest payments should be limited in Finland and, if so, what kind of measures should be taken. Organisations representing Finnish industry and Trade, the Tax Administration, the Finnish Bank and tax law professors were requested to answer whether limitations on interest deductions should be introduced in Finland and, if so, what the limitations should be. The deadline was in June 2009. Due to the economic recession, it is likely that restrictions on interest deductions, if they are considered necessary, will not be introduced in the near future. The Finnish corporate tax system should be reviewed as a whole before deciding whether limitations on interest deductions should be introduced. The liberal approach toward interest deductions and thin capitalisation provide companies with a competitive advantage. If the companies’ right to make interest deductions is limited, it should also be considered whether the general corporate tax rate of 26 % should be lowered. The future of the Finnish group contribution system, where a profit-making group company may transfer taxable profit to a loss-making group company, should be reviewed in the same context. The Ministry of Finance has already indicated that Finland may transfer to a fiscal consolidation system. Taking into account the current economic situation, there is a risk that tighter interest deduction rules may create unnecessary obstacles for corporate financing. On the other hand, the protection of the Finnish corporate tax base may call for limitations on interest deductions. Statutory interest deduction rules would provide legal certainty for both the taxpayer and the tax administration. The U. S. interest-stripping rules, the German Zinsschranke and Swedish limitations on related parties’ interest deductions serve as examples for possible limitations on interest deductions. In addition, the Belgian notional interest deduction and the Dutch initiatives on defiscalisation of interest income and deductions in group taxation and a mandatory interest-box should also be considered as well. Introducing a tax incentive would stimulate investments, whereas limitations on interest deductions would probably diminish Finland’s attractiveness from an investor point-of-view.

Avhandlingen är en rättsdogmatisk studie med komparativt inslag från USA, Tyskland, Estland och Finland. Även Sverige har behandlats relativt ingående. Andra länder har behandlats i anslutning till särskilda rättsfrågor. Rättsfall från cirka 10 länder har behandlats. Avhandlingen redogör för skillnaden mellan hard law och soft law. Flera metoder, såsom skattepolitik och planering, har tillämpats vid sidan av den rättsdogmatiska och komparativa metoden. Avhandlingen har lånat inslag från andra vetenskapsområden, som t. ex. bokföringen, IFRS, bolagsrätten, finansieringen, nationalekonomin och historia forskningen. Se Kristiina Äimä: Sisäiset korot lähiyhtiöiden kansainvälisessä verotuksessa. WSOY. Helsingfors 2009. Avhandlingen innehåller en engelsk resumé om 17 sidor. Temat behandlas ur ett internationellt skatterättsligt perspektiv. Begreppet närstående bolag är centralt för temat. Närstående bolag definieras på ett annorlunda sätt inom bokföring, bolagsrätt och skatterätt. Likaså är definitionerna av ränta olika i skatterätten och andra vetenskaper. Räntebegreppet undersöks ur skatteavtalsrättens, EG-skatterättens och nationella rättens perspektiv. Särskild vikt läggs vid avdragsrätten för räntebetalningar och fastställandet av en marknadsmässig ränta. Inom multinationella företagsgrupper förekommer det lån och förskott på betalningar på samma sätt som mellan oberoende bolag. Ett skuldförhållande kan utgöras av en kortfristig skuld, såsom kundfordring eller leverantörsskuld. Därtill kan kapital lånas ut långfristigt i kapitalplaceringssyfte. Likaså kan kapital lånas ut för att ställa arbetande kapital till ett närstående bolags förfogande. Beviljandet av ett närståendelån kan vara i strid med aktieägarnas likställighetsprincip. Detta har beaktats i bolagsrätten. I verksamhetsberättelsen till bokslutet skall separat uppges penninglån, säkerheter och ansvarsförbindelser till personer som står bolaget nära samt de huvudsakliga villkoren för dessa. Avhandlingen tangerar finansieringen av multinationella företagsgrupper ur beskattningens synvinkel. Det påstås allmänt att företagsfinansieringen påverkas av det faktum att investeringar som har finansierats med främmande kapital beskattas i de flesta stater lindigare än kapitalplaceringar. Enligt huvudregeln får en investerare göra avdrag för räntebetalningar medan utdelningar på kapitalplaceringar vanligtvis inte är avdragsgilla i beskattningen. De belgiska reglerna gällande fiktivt ränteavdrag på eget kapital avviker däremot från huvudregeln. OECD-medlemsländernas dubbelskattningsavtal och nationella lagstiftning befriar vanligtvis ränteinkomster från beskattning i betalarens källstat. Källskattefriheten leder till skatteeffektiva kapitalöverföringar inom multinationella företagsgrupper. Internationell skatteplanering drar nytta även av ränteavdragen. Skatteeffektiviteten kan vara icke önskvärd från en statsfiskal synpunkt. Inom EU finns det ytterligare reglering gällande interna räntebetalningar. Enligt EG:s ränte- och royaltydirektiv beskattas interna räntebetalningarna endast i mottagarens hemviststat. För övrigt har EG-domstolen tolkat EU:s grundfriheter i sin rättspraxis så att en medlemsstat skall bevilja avdragsrätten under samma förutsättningar i gränsöverskridande situationer som i inhemska situationer. En nationell bestämmelse som inskränker etableringsfriheten kan ändå vara motiverad när den särskilt avser fiktiva upplägg som iscensätts för att kringgå lagstiftningen. Kravet på lika skattebehandling har lett till att många medlemsstater har övergått från traditionell underkapitaliseringsreglering till ränteavdragsbegränsningar. De nya avdragsbegränsningarna kan vara bundna till en procentenhet av EBIT (eng. Earnings before Interest and Taxes) eller motsvarande siffra eller låntagarens nominella finansiering av affärsförmögenhet. Ett koncernbolag som hör till en europeisk företagsgrupp beskattas som om bolaget vore fristående. Detta förorsakar mångfaldig beskattning. Europeiska kommissionens initiativ att harmonisera koncernbeskattningen skulle eliminera förlustutjämnings-, underkapitaliserings- och interprissättningsproblemen inom europeiska företagsgrupper. Den senaste utvecklingen i Sverige har följts noggrant i Finland. Bland annat förekomsten av räntesnurror i företagsskatteplaneringen och Regeringsrättens dom i Industrivärlden-målet har diskuterats. Dessutom har de nya svenska ränteavdragsbegränsningarna som skall förhindra skatteplanering inom företagsgrupper väckt intresse. För tillfället utreder finansministeriet om avdragsrätten för räntebetalningar borde begränsas inom finsk näringsbeskattning. Ifall avdragsrätten begränsas används sannolikt de svenska begränsningarna som förebild för den finska nya regleringen. Avhandlingen behandlar fördelar och nackdelar som kunde uppkomma om begränsningar introducerades...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} Accounting {{is to provide}} {{financial}} information to facilitate decisionmaking relating to the management of, and investment in, public or private sector entities. The major role of an accountant is to report, interpret and communicate information relevant to these decisions. The study of Accounting at Victoria is designed to foster critical thinking and develop attitudes for life-long learning. Employment prospects for graduates in Accounting are wide-ranging. All organisations of moderate and larger size require the services of an accountant. The major divisions of Accounting are financial accounting, auditing, management accounting and taxation. Financial accountants provide information for assessing return and risk from investments, and/or monitor management performance. External auditors provide an independent opinion on the credibility of financial statements, summarising the financial position and results of an organisation, while internal auditors review compliance with policy decisions. Management accountants concentrate on providing information to management for costing, planning and control, and decision-making. Accountants specialising in taxation assist {{a wide range of}} taxpayers to comply with tax laws and provide advice on how to <b>limit</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> to the legal minimum. For information on the academic requirements for senior professional accounting, see page 108. Accounting for the BCA The study of Accounting begins at 100 level with the introductory course ACCY 111, which should be taken in your first year, along with the other core BCA courses, ECON 130 and FCOM 110 (see page 67).

40|$|M. Comm. Around April to June each year, many South Africans have to {{deal with}} their {{personal}} income <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities,</b> for that year. These are times of uncertainty to many of these people due to their lack of knowledge relating to personal income tax. This leads to people running around seeking assistance from friends, or in some cases paying consultants a small fortune, to have their income tax returns handed in before the deadline. If a taxpayer does not have adequate knowledge about taxes, then that person will most probably not know what his <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> are and how to legally <b>limit</b> these <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities.</b> The main {{purpose of this study is}} to make the uninformed taxpayer aware of his <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> and to assist such a person so that he does not pay more tax than he has to. The literature study deals with a brief overview of the history of taxation, the impact of the national budget on a person's <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> and the role of the South African Revenue Service (SARS). This portion of the literature study is aimed at giving the uninformed taxpayer a background regarding income tax. The final part of the literature study deals with the calculation of a South African's personal income <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> Although many of the points have been simplified, it is still quite possible that they can be confusing to the uninformed taxpayer. The theory was then used to develop a framework. The purpose of this framework is to assist the uninformed taxpayer to determine the different components of his personal <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities.</b> It will also help the taxpayer to understand how complex it would be to complete his own tax return. This would, in turn, assist the taxpayer in deciding whether he should complete is own tax return or whether he should seek advice from someone who has a better understanding of the <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> of a natural person. To test the framework, the <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> of actual individuals were determined. The results obtained were checked and confirmed as correct. Based on this it was concluded that the framework could be used for the purpose for which it is intended. The fact that the framework is graphic and a step-by-step guide, it can be used by the uninformed taxpayer to determine his own personal income <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> The framework is basic and would therefore not be adequate to use in very complex situations. Therefore, further development would be required to deal with such cases...|$|R
40|$|As {{a policy}} tool, state tax {{incentives}} can be structured to help states meet clean energy goals. Policymakers often use state tax incentives {{in concert with}} state and federal policies to support renewable energy deployment or reduce market barriers. This analysis used case studies of four states to assess the contributions of state tax incentives {{to the development of}} renewable energy markets. State tax incentives that are appropriately paired with complementary state and federal policies generally provide viable mechanisms to support renewable energy deployment. However, challenges to successful implementation of state tax incentives include serving project owners with <b>limited</b> state <b>tax</b> <b>liability,</b> assessing appropriate incentive levels, and differentiating levels of incentives for technologies with different costs. Additionally, state tax incentives may result in moderately higher federal tax burdens. These challenges notwithstanding, state tax incentives that consider certain policy design characteristics can support renewable energy markets and state clean energy goals. The scale of their impact though {{is directly related to the}} degree to which they support the renewable energy markets for targeted sectors and technologies. This report highlights important policy design considerations for policymakers using state tax incentives to meet clean energy goals...|$|R

It is accomplished by legally structuring the lease to minimise <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> Accounting profits and <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> arising from the lease are determined in different ways: different lease structures could result in similar accounting profits, but different <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> A lease's accounting profits may be preestimated with relative certainty, but it's difficult to pre-estimate its <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> It's especially difficult with long-term leases that stretch {{over a number of}} accounting periods and tax years.

This study focuses on determining and minimising income <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> {{within the context of the}} leasing of immovable property in South Africa. The workings of the factors that give rise to the <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> are distinguished. Different types oflease agreements, reflecting the commercial objectives, are identified. A framework is then constructed from these factors to simplizy determination of the <b>tax</b> <b>liability,</b> and to structure the lease so that <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> may be reduced. The different types of lease agreements are imposed on the framework to subordinate the reduction of <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> to the parties' commercial objectives...|$|R

The thesis consists of an introduction, five chapters and a conclusion. Chapter One is rather theoretical and deals with general terms of the tax theory. The term "dependent activity" is defined in chapter two. Chapter Three compares and contrasts the components of individual income tax in both countries. Chapter Four offers a brief and simplified {{comparison of}} the tax burden of an individual in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

However, it appears that relatively little time and effort are spent actually understanding the data {{and how best to}} present results to the public of analyses of using tax data. This is evident in the overuse of averages and the simplistic classification of taxpayers into income ranges and quintiles by tax distribution tables that are often highly publicized. This study shows that the link between income and <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> is much more tenuous that that often presumed and that a variety of other factors can greatly affect <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> Specifically, this report finds that, among other things: • Over 22 percent of all 1995 tax returns claimed zero <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> – For calendar year 2000, the JCT estimates that 48. 7 million out of 140. 2 million taxpayers overall will have zero or negative federal income <b>tax</b> <b>liability.</b> •In four out of the five income groups examined, a majority of taxpayers had <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> that were either 25 percent greater than the average or 25 percent less than the average <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> for each income group. • In comparing federal income <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities,</b> distribution tables often misclassify and group millions of taxpayers into quintiles in which they have little <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> in common. •Approximately 2. 2 million taxpayers in the third quintile pay more in federal income taxes than 5. 4 million taxpayers classified in the fourth quintile. •Over 3 million taxpayers in the fourth quintile pay more in federal income taxes than 4. 1 million taxpayers classified in the fifth quintile...|$|R
