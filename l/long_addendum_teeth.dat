The method is {{used to analyze the}} effects of modified <b>addendum,</b> <b>tooth</b> thickness, and gear center distance in addition to the parameters previously considered which included gear diameter, pitch, pressure angle, face width, oil viscosity, speed, and torque.

Power losses were calculated from temperature measurements of lubricating oil, gears, gear box, and oil flow rate. Furthermore, power loss was divided into windage loss, friction loss and churning loss.

In addition, lubricating conditions had some influences on gear noise especially under low oil temperature or high viscosity...|$|R
5000|$|In Albert's view, {{the impossibility}} to prove any certain truth {{is not in}} itself a certain truth. After all, one needs to assume some basic rules of logical {{inference}} to derive his result, {{and in doing so}} must either abandon the pursuit of [...] "certain" [...] justification, as above, or attempt to justify these rules, etc. He suggests {{that it has to be}} taken as true as long as nobody has come forward with a truth which is scrupulously justified as a certain truth. Several philosophers defied Albert's challenge; his responses to such criticisms can be found in his <b>long</b> <b>addendum</b> to his Treatise on Critical Reason and later articles.|$|R

For the gear tooth with 36 circular pits, 18 pits center on the tooth pitch line and another 18 pits on the <b>tooth</b> <b>addendum.</b> For other <b>teeth,</b> circular pits all center on the tooth pitch line. The pitting areas of the 7 teeth are 4.87 %, 14.6 %, 29.2 %, 58.4 %, 29.2 %, 14.6 % and 4.87 %, respectively. We define this level of damage as the severe pitting damage corresponding to the level 4 pitting damage defined in ASM handbook [3].|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation is presented which {{shows how the}} gear contact ratio affects the dynamic load on a spur gear transmission. The contact ratio can {{be affected by the}} <b>tooth</b> <b>addendum,</b> the pressure angle, the tooth size (diametral pitch), and the center distance. The analysis presented was performed using the NASA gear dynamics code, DANST. In the analysis, the contact ratio was varied over the range 1. 20 to 2. 40 by changing the length of the <b>tooth</b> <b>addendum.</b> In order to simplify the analysis, other parameters related to contact ratio were held constant. The contact ratio was found to have a significant influence on gear dynamics. Over a wide range of operating speeds, a contact ratio close to 2. 0 minimized dynamic load. For low contact ratio gears (contact ratio less than 2. 0), increasing the contact ratio reduced the gear dynamic load. For high contact ratio gears (contact ratio = or greater than 2. 0), the selection of contact ratio should take into consideration the intended operating speeds. In general, high contact ratio gears minimized dynamic load better than low contact ratio gears...|$|R

In this paper, only low-contact-ratio gears with true involute profile are studied.

40|$|Shortened {{version of}} {{abstract}} in article itself) This article describes an algorithm for producing, for any desired resolution and any desired numbers of wheel and pinion teeth, polygonal approximations to {{the shapes of}} a pair of cycloidal gears that mesh correctly. An Octave implementation of the algorithm, mostly written in 2014, is included. The Octave implementation contains a (crude, but evidently adequate, at least for reasonable numbers of wheel and pinion teeth) solution of the problem of iteratively finding the generating wheel angle corresponding to the tips of the <b>tooth</b> <b>addenda.</b> However, this Octave implementation does not contain a good {{solution to the problem of}} automatically determining the generating wheel angles required to produce a polygon which approximates the curved addenda to a resolution specified by the user.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} a spur gear system was performed through a numerical analysis approach. This study used the gear dynamic program DANST, a computer simulator, to determine the dynamic behavior of a spur gear system. The analytical results have taken the deflection of shafts and bearings into consideration for static analysis, {{and the influence of}} these deflections on gear dynamics was investigated. Damping in the gear system usually is an unknown quantity, but it has an important effect in resonance vibration. Typical values as reported in the literature were used in the present analysis. The dynamic response due to different damping factors was evaluated and compared. The effect of the contact ratio on spur gear dynamic load and dynamic stress was investigated through a parameter study. The contact ratio was varied over the range of 1. 26 to 2. 46 by adjusting the <b>tooth</b> <b>addendum.</b> Gears with contact ratio near 2. 0 were found to have the most favorable dynamic performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Planetary {{gear drive}} with minor teeth {{difference}} (zdâ‰¤ 8) {{is one of}} the advanced transmitting styles and could meet the requirement of larger ratio in a smaller size of dimension. Generally the gears with addenda modifications play a principal role in planetary gear drive of minor teeth difference to avoid teeth interference during the mesh, and this transmission implies cumbersome parameters calculations and brings up higher angle of engagement to affect the load capacity because of life weakening on carrier bearings involved. In fact, provided some certain promise, zero addenda modification (viz. X-zero) drive with minor teeth difference could also qualify for gearing conditions so as to reduce the complicacy of calculations and angle of engagement mentioned above. From investigating the relationships amongst the total teeth number of internal gear, difference of tooth number between internal and external gear, <b>addendum</b> coefficient and <b>teeth</b> profile interference criterion, the unique design characteristic about Xâ€“zero gear drive with minor teeth difference are outlined...|$|R
40|$|A novel cosine {{gear drive}} is {{presented}} in this paper. The pinion of the drive utilizes a cosine curve as the tooth profile. It takes the zero line of the cosine curve as the pitch circle, a period of the curve as a tooth space, and the amplitude of the curve as the <b>tooth</b> <b>addendum.</b> The generation principle of the cosine gear is described. The mathematical models, including the equation of the cosine tooth profile, the equation of the conjugate tooth profile and the equation {{of the line of}} action, are established based on the meshing theory. An example drive in solid model is presented and its computerized simulation is carried out. A few characteristics, such as the contact and bending stresses, the sliding coefficient and the contact ratio, of this new drive are analyzed. A comparison study of these characteristics with the involute gear drive was also carried out in this work. The results confirm that the cosine gear drive has lower sliding coefficients and the contact and bending stresses of the cosine gear are reduced in comparison with the involute gear...|$|R

The objective of the present work is to optimize the parameters {{in order to maximize}} the material removal rate and minimize the kerf in a gear cutting process to get the optimum value. The MRR and kerf {{play a major role in}} optimizing the parameters in WEDM process. The experiment is carried out in the wire EDM machine using brass wire as the electrode, Inconel 718 as the work-piece material and distilled water as the dielectric. The design array is created by using Design of Experiment in a Taguchi L 16 orthogonal array repeated once. The gear has a base diameter of 20 mm, addendum diameter of 22. 5 mm and a pressure angle of 20 Âº with 16 numbers of teeth. The machining operation is carried out by taking 3 input parameters at 4 different levels each. The output parameters such as Material Removal rate and Kerf width were obtained and optimized using TOPSIS method to know the optimum setting. Microstructural analysis of both material and wire were studied to know the various defects during the machining operation. Various plots were obtained to know the effects of the process parameters in WEDM. A regression model was also obtained to validate the statistical model values with the experimental.
