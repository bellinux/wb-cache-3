25|$|APL {{has been}} both criticized and praised for its choice of a unique, {{non-standard}} character set. Some who learn it become ardent adherents, suggesting {{that there is some}} weight behind Iverson's idea that the notation used does make a difference. In the beginning, there were few terminal devices and even display monitors that could reproduce the APL character set—the most popular ones employing the IBM Selectric print mechanism used with a special APL type element. One of the early APL <b>line</b> <b>terminals</b> (line-mode operation only, not full screen) was the Texas Instruments TI Model 745 (circa 1977) with the full APL character set which featured half and full duplex telecommunications modes, for interacting with an APL time-sharing service or remote mainframe to run a remote computer job, called an RJE.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these efforts, {{during the}} morning rush hour, {{conductors}} at <b>line</b> <b>terminals</b> and other busy stations must routinely restrict the number of passengers who can board each train to prevent the train from becoming too crowded for passengers waiting at other stations down the line. As of August 31, 2011, 25 stations mainly on Lines 1, 5, 13, and Batong have imposed such restrictions. [...] Some of these stations have built queuing lines outside the stations to manage the flow of waiting passengers. [...] By January 7, 2013, 41 stations on Lines 1, 2, 5, 13, Batong, and Changping had instituted passenger flow restrictions {{during the morning}} rush hour. The number of stations with passenger flow restrictions reached 75 in April 2016, mostly affecting Lines 1, 5, 6, 10, 13, Batong, and Changping.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "First Operating Section" [...] of the Frankford Elevated {{was planned}} to extend from Arch Street (connection with PTC Market Street line) to Bridge Street, 6.4 miles (10.3km). Construction, {{financed by the}} City of Philadelphia and managed by the Department of City Transit, was started in September 1915. At that time, {{construction}} was anticipated to require about three years. However, construction was slowed because of World War I. By February 1920, 65 percent of the construction work had been completed and 15 percent was under contract. Of the remainder, plans had been completed for ten percent, leaving approximately ten percent of construction [...] "yet to be arranged for". [...] The superstructure had been completed between Dyre Street (south of Pratt Street) to a point just north of Arch Street. However, only two stations had been completed, and six had not been started. Signals, substations and cars had [...] "yet to be arranged for". In 1919, the Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania approved {{a connection between the}} Frankford and Market Street lines in 1919, with signals and signal tower to be built by PRT. [...] But the Philadelphia City Solicitor determined that the connection could not be built until a contract for operation had been signed and approved by the PSC. This did not take place until 1922. The line was dedicated on November 4, 1922 and opened for service on November 5. Trains from 69th Street alternated between the Frankford and Ferry <b>Line</b> <b>terminals.</b>|$|E

The airport is near cruise <b>line</b> <b>terminals</b> at Port Everglades and is popular among tourists {{bound for the}} Caribbean. Since the late 1990s, FLL has become an intercontinental gateway, although Miami International Airport still handles most long-haul flights.|$|E
50|$|For {{transmission}} lines, {{the space}} between overhead line and ground forms a capacitor parallel to transmission line, which causes an increase in voltage as the distance increases. When a network becomes larger, sometimes the short-circuit current on transmission line exceeds the short-circuit rating of the equipment. To offset the capacitive effect of the transmission line and to regulate the voltage and reactive power of the power system, reactors are connected either at <b>line</b> <b>terminals</b> or at the middle, thereby improving the voltage profile of transmission line.|$|E

50|$|A {{plan was}} {{finalized}} in 1971 {{to build a}} Narita Shinkansen high-speed line connecting Tokyo Station to Narita International Airport. The line was envisioned as extending underground from Tokyo to Shinjuku Station, {{and in order to}} avoid having the line run under the Imperial Palace, the platforms were planned to be built underneath Kajibashi-dori to the south of Tokyo Station. Construction of the Narita Shinkansen was halted in 1983 after issues in acquiring the necessary land to build the line, but the area set aside for its platforms was eventually used for the Keiyo Line and Musashino <b>Line</b> <b>terminals,</b> which opened in 1990.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{split-phase}} watthour meter {{the voltage}} coil is connected {{between the two}} [...] "hot" [...] (<b>line)</b> <b>terminals</b> (240V in North America) and two separate current coils are connected between the corresponding line and load terminals. No connection to the system neutral is needed to correctly handle combined line-to-neutral and line-to-line loads. Line-to-line loads draw the same current through both current coils and spin the meter {{twice as fast as}} a line-to-neutral load drawing the same current through only a single current coil, correctly registering the power drawn by the line-to-line load as twice that of the line-to-neutral load.|$|E

50|$|The PRR's {{original}} 1915 electrification {{made use}} of four substations, at Arsenal Bridge, West Philadelphia, Bryn Mawr, and Paoli. The Arsenal Bridge substation stepped-up 13.2 kV, 25 Hz power supplied from PECO's Schuylkill power station on Christian Street to 44 kV for distribution. The remaining three substations reduced the 44 kV distribution voltage to 11 kV catenary voltage. The substations were operated from adjacent signal towers. They used typical period concrete buildings to house the transformers and switchgear while the <b>line</b> <b>terminals</b> were on the roof. From 1918 onward, outdoor stations were used and when the main line electrification began in 1928 the stations became large open air structures using lattice steel frameworks to mount the 132 kV terminations and switchgear. By 1935 new stations were connected to remote supervision systems allowing power directors to open and close switches and breakers from central offices {{without having to go}} through the tower operators.|$|E
5000|$|Lines 13 and Batong have {{converted}} 4-car to 6-car trains. [...] Lines 6 and 7 have longer platforms {{that can}} accommodate 8-car B size trains, while line 14 uses high capacity wide-body A size trains in 6 car sets. New lines that cross {{the city center}} such as Lines 3, 11, 12, 16, 17 and 19, now under construction, will adopt high capacity 8-car A size trains with a 70 percent increase in capacity over older lines. When completed these lines are expected to greatly relieve overcrowding in the existing network. Despite these efforts, during the morning rush hour, conductors at <b>line</b> <b>terminals</b> and other busy stations must routinely restrict the number of passengers who can board each train to prevent the train from becoming too crowded for passengers waiting at other stations down the line.
