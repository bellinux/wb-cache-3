50|$|Apart {{from the}} TV <b>lift</b> <b>systems,</b> {{there are also}} the related {{projector}} <b>lift</b> <b>systems.</b> These projector <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> may be distinguished into two equipment groups. On the one hand there is the projector ceiling light, which vertically lowers the projector downwards from a suspended ceiling, and there are projector lifts for integration into tables or furniture. The latter moves the projector vertically upwards, out of the furniture or table. Both systems are mostly made from ultra light aluminium. Stable equipment guiding is achieved in most cases using scissors or special guides. A projector <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> is often driven by a tubular motor, or another electromotor, which moves a shaft accordingly. Then the lower platform which the projector stands on, can be lowered via special belts or chains. Projector ceiling <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> are available as ultra flat versions right up to stage projector lift devices with a lift of 5m and more, and a load bearing capacity of several 100 kg.|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{advanced}} high <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> on aircraft size, performance, {{direct operating cost}} and noise were evaluated for short-to-medium and medium-to-long range aircraft with high bypass ratio and very high bypass ratio engines. The benefit of advanced high <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> in reducing noise {{was found to be}} less than 1 effective-perceived-noise decibel level (EPNdB) when the aircraft were sized to minimize takeoff gross weight. These aircraft did, however, have smaller wings and lower engine thrusts for the same mission than aircraft with conventional high <b>lift</b> <b>systems.</b> When the advanced high <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> was implemented without reducing wing size and simultaneously using lower flap angles that provide higher L/D at approach a cumulative noise reduction of as much as 4 EPNdB was obtained. Comparison of aircraft configurations that have similar approach speeds showed cumulative noise reduction of 2. 6 EPNdB that is purely the result of incorporating advanced high <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> in the aircraft design...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} a high <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> for the NASA {{advanced}} LFC airfoil designed by Pfenninger is described. The high <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> consists of both leading and trailing edge flaps. A 3 meter semispan, 1 meter chord wing model using the above airfoil and high <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> is under construction and will be tested in the NASA Langley 4 by 7 meter tunnel. This model will have two separate full span leading edge flaps (0. 10 c and 0. 12 c) and one full span trailing edge flap (0. 25 c). The performance of this high <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> was predicted by the NASA two dimensional viscous multicomponent airfoil program.

50|$|At {{the outer}} end, {{to support these}} <b>lifting</b> <b>systems,</b> it is {{necessary}} to construct civil works of sufficient capacity to take the vertical loads transferred to it through the support systems described above. These works also provide the support for stop fenders that prevent the berthing vessel from impacting the linkspan. As soon as the vessel is moored it may lower its ramp onto the outer end of the linkspan to bridge the gap. This ramp hinged at the ship’s threshold then accommodates any movement due to waves, swell and the passage of traffic.|$|E
50|$|Since {{concrete}} {{is quite}} resistant to corrosion from salt water and keeps maintenance costs low, floating concrete structures {{have become increasingly}} attractive to {{the oil and gas}} industry in the last two decades. Temporary floating structures such as the Condeep platforms float during construction but are towed out and finally ballasted until they sit on the sea floor. Permanent floating concrete structures have various uses including the discovery of oil and gas deposits, in oil and gas production, as storage and offloading units and in heavy <b>lifting</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E

These range in duration from a one-day Climbing Aptitude Safety Assessment at the Stenigot Tower (which must be successfully completed for TG4 CIT s and Royal Signallers to WaH), to the 21-week Further Training Course for CIT personnel eligible for promotion, or needing to hold acting rank of Corporal, so they may supervise WaH activities.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} a monitor <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> is {{for the most part}} {{similar to that of the}} {{vertical}} pop-up TV <b>lift</b> <b>system,</b> with the only real difference being that the movement radius of the motor and the electrics are enclosed inside a sheet metal module. The system is conceived for smaller PC monitor sizes. They are predominantly installed in conference room tables in order to save space. The monitor <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> are inserted from above into the section which has been cut out of the table by a carpenter or joiner and they are then secured to the table once again from below with screws. The upper part of the monitor <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> is often a cover plate made of brushed steel. With the push of a button, the cover section folds inward into the monitor lift and makes way for the monitor to move into position. The monitor moves up automatically and can still be tilted electronically when in the end position. A number of manufacturers manufacture the monitor lift with a fixed display. Monitor <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> are available in various sizes ranging from 15 inches up to 42 inches.|$|R
