40|$|In {{the current}} {{generation}} of radiative-convective models a constant value for the critical atmospheric <b>lapse</b> rate, generally 6. 5 K/km, is used. However, the moist adiabatic <b>lapse</b> rates are a better approximation for use in simple climate models. Thus, a comparison of temperature profiles with critical constant and moist adiabatic <b>lapse</b> rates has been made for a one-dimensional radiative-convective model. The commonly used <b>lapse</b> rate of 6. 5 K/km yields surface temperatures some 1 to 3 K higher than with the use of moist adiabatic <b>lapse</b> rates for both clear sky conditions and a single effective cloud. When multiple clouds are included the constant <b>lapse</b> rate of 6. 5 K/km yields the lower surface temperatures. More importantly, the surface temperature generated from the constant <b>lapse</b> rate formulation is more sensitive to changes in carbon dioxide, relative humidity, cloud cover, and surface albedo.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{investigated}} the possibility of rerecruiting <b>lapsed</b> blood donors. Reasons for donation cessation, motivation to restart donation, and modifiable components of donation motivation were examined. We distinguished between <b>lapsed</b> donors who had passively withdrawn by merely not responding to donation invitations and donors who had contacted the blood bank to actively withdraw. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was sent to 400 actively <b>lapsed</b> donors and to 400 passively <b>lapsed</b> donors, measuring intention to restart donation and psychological correlates of restart intention. The {{data were analyzed using}} multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: The response rate among actively <b>lapsed</b> donors was higher than among passively <b>lapsed</b> donors (37 % vs. 25 %). Actively <b>lapsed</b> donors typically ceased donating because of physical reactions, while passively <b>lapsed</b> donors quit because of a busy lifestyle. Nonetheless, 51 % of actively <b>lapsed</b> responders and 80 % of passively <b>lapsed</b> responders were willing to restart donations. Multiple regression analysis showed that, for passively <b>lapsed</b> donors, cognitive attitude was the strongest correlate of intention to donate in the future (beta= 0. 605, p< 0. 001), with affective attitude (beta= 0. 239, p< 0. 05) and self-efficacy (beta= 0. 266, p< 0. 001) explaining useful proportions of the variance as well. For actively <b>lapsed</b> donors, cognitive attitude was also the strongest correlate of intention (beta= 0. 601, p< 0. 001), with affective attitude (beta= 0. 345, p< 0. 001) and moral norm (beta=- 0. 118, p< 0. 05) explaining smaller proportions of the variance. CONCLUSION: The majority of <b>lapsed</b> donors indicated a moderate to high intention to restart donations. Interventions focusing on boosting cognitive and affective attitudes and self-efficacy could further raise such intentions...|$|R

25|$|Upon {{finding that}} a {{decision}} or {{order of a}} public authority is unconstitutional, the High Court may grant a mandatory order (formerly known as mandamus) to compel the authority to perform its duties {{in a manner that}} is consistent with the Constitution. Although there has yet to be any constitutional case where a mandatory order has been granted, it is likely that the Singapore courts will adopt the same legal principles that apply in administrative law. In the latter, the Court has held that it cannot use a mandatory order to direct how and in what manner a public body should perform its duty. Hence, the Court cannot direct the public body to adopt a particular decision but can only order the body to re-consider its prior decision without <b>lapsing</b> into the unlawfulness that affected it. This is based on the well-settled principle that a reviewing court is limited to determining the legality, and must not deal with the substantive merits, of a decision.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analysed}} mechanisms {{through which}} stress-coping and temptation-coping strategies {{were associated with}} <b>lapses.</b> Furthermore, we explored whether distinct coping strategies differentially predicted reduced <b>lapse</b> risk, lower urge levels, or a weaker association between urge levels and <b>lapses</b> {{during the first week}} of an unassisted smoking cessation attempt. Participants were recruited via the internet and mass media in Switzerland. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with mobile devices was used to assess urge levels and <b>lapses.</b> Online questionnaires were used to measure smoking behaviours and coping variables at baseline, as well as smoking behaviour at the three-month follow-up. The sample consisted of 243 individuals, aged 20 to 40, who reported 4199 observations. Findings of multilevel regression analyses show that coping was mainly associated with a reduced <b>lapse</b> risk and not with lower urge levels or a weaker association between urge levels and <b>lapses.</b> 'Calming down' and 'commitment to change' predicted a lower <b>lapse</b> risk and also a weaker relation between urge levels and <b>lapses.</b> 'Stimulus control' predicted a lower <b>lapse</b> risk and lower urge levels. Conversely, 'task-orientation' and 'risk assessment' were related to higher <b>lapse</b> risk and 'risk assessment' also to higher urge levels. Disengagement coping i. e. 'eating or shopping', 'distraction', and 'mobilising social support' did not affect <b>lapse</b> risk. Promising coping strategies during the initial stage of smoking cessation attempt are targeted directly at reducing the <b>lapse</b> risk and are characterised by engagement with the stressor or one's reactions towards the stressor and a focus on positive consequences instead of health risks...|$|R
