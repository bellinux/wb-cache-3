25|$|Work on {{building}} the Great mill {{was started by}} the millwright Humphrey of Cranbrook in 1813. Owing {{to the nature of}} the ground the mill was built on it was necessary to <b>lay</b> <b>deep</b> <b>foundations.</b> Lack of funds meant that the mill was left as an unfinished base for a couple of years before Thomas Webb, who owned the Little Mill, bought the unfinished mill and financed its completion in 1816. A steam engine was added in 1889 as auxiliary power. The mill was worked by wind until 1905, when the sails and stage were removed. It worked by steam engine until 1918, and was demolished in 1924. The mill's brick base was left, serving as a corn store in the 1930s.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} endeavours to {{shed light}} on the paradox of the persistence of informal finance in urban African markets despite the emergence of a vibrant microfinance sector. To do so, it analyses the rationale of the financial choices of the micro-entrepreneurs operating in the markets of Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). In particular, a careful examination of the motives driving the combinative use of informal and formal microfinance is carried. In order to <b>lay</b> <b>deep</b> theoretical <b>foundations</b> to this analysis, this thesis develops a model describing the financial behaviour of the micro-entrepreneurs in the presence of hyperbolic preferences and social influences. The solution of this model shows, inter alia, that the financial choices are not solely driven by economic motivations but also by social motivations. This result is confirmed by empirical observations which show, among other things, that social relations {{play an important role in}} explaining the persistence of informal finance. Besides, it appeared also that the combinative use of informal finance and microfinance can be explained, on the one side, by the fact that the motives driving the demand for informal and for formal finance are not always the same and, on the other side, by the fact that these two types of financial mechanisms are more likely to be used as complements than as substitutes. Ultimately, this thesis unfolds a new perspective for apprehending the coexistence of informal and formal microfinance. Informal finance is no longer considered as a makeshift, but as an integral part of the financial landscape of the Sub-Saharan urban financial markets. Therefore, microfinance institutions and policy makers ought to adopt a more positive and pro-active attitude vis-à-vis informal finance. (ECON 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R

50|$|Peter Schunck {{compared}} {{the structure of}} the building with a ship, floating on uncertain ground. The foundation is basically a concrete trough, that can 'give a little' if any mining shafts were to be dug under it. This 'ship' would then never be able to capsize. During construction, the moat of the old Roman settlement Coriovallum was uncovered, which was the reason to <b>lay</b> the <b>foundation</b> <b>deeper</b> than originally planned. Inside the old walls the subsoil was firm, but outside them it was very bad. Building such a structure on such ground in a mining area was deemed too risky and the ground was cleared until a single layer of equal overall weakness was encountered, a 12 m thick sand layer. This sand is generally considered a bad foundation soil, but in a mining area it is a good choice because it flows and 'gives' evenly in case of a cave-in in a mine below it. Still, Peutz decided that the soil pressure should not exceed 1 kgf/cm² (100 kPa). So for the foundation he used a reinforced concrete slab extending under the whole building. This 50 cm thick beamless foundation slab is mushroom-shaped.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper takes {{example of}} a {{foundation}} pit in Haikou, analyzing the influence on the surrounding buildings {{in the course of}} the excavation depth, daily rainfall, foundation form of the building and other factors. The results show that the excavation depth and strong rainfall may lead large deformation of the surrounding buildings, and the <b>deep</b> <b>foundation</b> pit has obvious effect on surrounding building with shallow foundation. Therefore, those factors should be considered adequately in the design and construction of <b>deep</b> <b>foundation</b> pit. Overview of Influence of Foundation Pit Excavation on Surrounding Buildings The excavation of <b>deep</b> <b>foundation</b> pit is equal to the surrounding soil uploading, which will cause the soil around the foundation pit extending gravity deformation in the direction of pit, and produce additional internal forces and deformation, and even heavy deformation and damages of buildings.
