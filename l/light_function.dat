25|$|Lights: Each cave diver {{should have}} at least three {{independent}} sources of light. One is considered the primary and is intended for general use during the dive. The others are considered backup lights and may be lower powered as they are not intended for exploration. Each light must have an expected burn time of at least the planned duration of the dive. If any diver loses <b>light</b> <b>function</b> so that they have fewer than three working lights, protocol requires that the dive is turned for all members of the dive team and exit started immediately.|$|E
25|$|These are {{required}} to produce white light by U.S. and international UN Regulations. However, some countries have at various times permitted amber reversing lights. In Australia and New Zealand, for example, vehicle manufacturers were faced {{with the task of}} localising American cars originally equipped with combination red brake/turn signal lamps and white reversing lights. Those countries' regulations permitted the amber rear turn signals to burn steadily as reversing lights, so automakers and importers were able to combine the (mandatorily amber) rear turn signal and (optionally amber) reversing <b>light</b> <b>function,</b> and so comply with the regulations without the need for additional lighting devices. Both countries presently require white reversing lights, so the combination amber turn/reverse light is no longer permitted on new vehicles. The U.S. state of Washington presently permits reversing lamps to emit white or amber light.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} the notion of weak <b>lighting</b> <b>function</b> in order to replicate the “continuous perception” associated with strong 26 -surfaces. As a consequence, the continuous analogue defined ad hoc by Malgouyres and Bertrand only for these surfaces is extended for arbitrary objects, and the local characterization of finite strong 26 -surfaces given in (Malgouyres and Bertrand, Int. J. Pattern Recognition Art. Intell. 13 (4) (1999) 465 – 484) is generalized to possibly infinite surfaces. Moreover, weak <b>lighting</b> <b>functions</b> also replicate the “continuous perception” associated with (α,β) -surfaces, (α,β) ≠(6, 6), since they are generalizing the <b>lighting</b> <b>functions</b> previously defined by the authors...|$|R
