5|$|Given Cerion's {{extensive}} geographic diversity, Gould later <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> if Christopher Columbus {{had only}} cataloged a single Cerion {{it would have}} ended the scholarly debate about which island Columbus had first set foot on in America.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} appointed Galen Clark as the grant's first guardian, {{but neither}} Clark nor the commissioners {{had the authority}} to evict homesteaders. Josiah Whitney, the first director of the California Geological Survey, <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> Yosemite Valley would meet the same fate as Niagara Falls, which at that time was a tourist trap with tolls on every bridge, path, trail, and viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers and}} {{prestige}} {{of the prime minister}} have varied through the years. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's second prime minister, often <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> in practice he had little power. Since the death of Pham Hung in 1988, the prime minister has been ranked 3rd in the order of precedence of the Communist Party's Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|His {{performance}} at the Olympic trials was in vain as Mr. Justice Mackay upheld the BOA ban in the High Court of Justice and stated that a right to work was not sufficient reason to remove it. The BOA chairman, Lord Moynihan, was satisfied with the outcome, stating that those abusing drugs did not deserve to represent Great Britain at the Olympics. However, he <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> a sprinter of Chambers' calibre had in effect excluded himself from the competition.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{revision}} of the Stanford–Binet scales (S-B IV) was developed by Thorndike, Hagen, and Sattler and published by Riverside Publishing in 1986. It retained the deviation scoring of the third revision with each standard deviation from the median being defined as a 16 IQ point difference. The S-B IV adopted new classification terminology. After this test was published, psychologist Nathan Brody <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> IQ tests had still not caught up with advances in research on human intelligence during the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 2007, Schmid had rebuilt the roster, keeping only three players he had {{inherited}} and acquiring Argentine attacker Guillermo Barros Schelotto. Schmid cut the Crew's goalkeeper, Jon Busch, {{who had been with}} the team for five years. Schmid had concerns over Busch's playing style and fitness. Busch later criticized Schmid's management skills, and said he would never work for the coach again, but gave credit to Schmid's tactical approach. Scheletto's contributions were crucial to Columbus's improvement that season, but the team failed to make the playoffs. A writer for ESPN speculated that the Crew suffered because the team management would not spend more money, while Schmid <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> he could not attract a foreign star to the little-known city of Columbus.|$|E

5|$|In another story, {{based on}} an old folktale-motif, and echoing a similar theme, Demeter was searching for her daughter, Persephone, having taken {{the form of an}} old woman called Doso, and {{received}} a hospitable welcome from Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{gameplay}} received mixed reviews. Some critics {{believed that}} the gameplay was enjoyable, serviceable and acceptable by modern standards, but most others agreed {{that some of the}} gameplay mechanics, such as the cover system, lacked polish and were flawed. Some critics considered the gameplay generic due to its inclusion of typical shooter elements such as on-rail and turret segments, and stated that such mechanics are unable to help the game differentiate itself from other shooters such as Gears of War, and give the game an identity crisis. Some critics <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> gameplay occasionally disconnects players from the story, creating tonal dissonance. Many criticized the game for not having a roll mechanic. The artificial intelligence system was criticized for not being strong enough to make the game more gratifying, though some critics thought that the AI system for Adams and Lugo was well-crafted and did not suffer from severe or frequent technical problems, although {{they may not be able}} to carry out player's commands. Some critics criticized the game's low replay value, unbalanced difficulty level, and sudden difficulty spike.|$|E
5|$|The root of {{the trouble}} was an {{economic}} crisis—initiated by the Panic of 1837—which was entering its sixth year in 1842. A speculative bubble had burst in 1836–39, causing a collapse of the financial sector and a subsequent depression. The country became deeply divided over the best response to the crisis. Conditions got even worse in early 1842 because a deadline was looming. A decade earlier, when the economy was strong, Congress had promised Southern states {{that there would be}} a reduction in hated federal tariffs. Northern states welcomed tariffs, which protected their infant industries. But the South had no industrial base and depended on open access to British markets for their cotton. In a recommendation to Congress, Tyler <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> it would be necessary to override the Compromise Tariff of 1833 and raise rates beyond the 20 percent limit. Under the previous deal, this would suspend the distribution program, with all revenues going to the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1830s, Réunion was deforested for plantations. Former slaves joined white peasants in {{cultivating}} pristine areas after {{slavery was}} abolished in 1848, and the hoopoe starling was {{pushed to the}} edges of its former habitat. According to Hume, over-hunting was the final blow to the species; with forests more accessible, hunting by the rapidly growing human population may have driven the remaining birds to extinction. In 1821, a law mandating the extermination of grain-damaging birds was implemented, and the hoopoe starling had a reputation for damaging crops. During the 1860s, various writers noted that the bird had almost disappeared, but it was probably already extinct by this time; in 1877, Vinson <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> the last individuals might have been killed by recent forest fires. No attempts to preserve the species in captivity seem to have been made. The hoopoe starling survived longer than many other extinct Mascarene species, and was the last of the Mascarene starling species to become extinct. The Rodrigues and Mauritius species probably disappeared with the arrival of rats; at least five species of Aplonis starlings have disappeared from the Pacific Islands, with rats contributing to their extinction. The hoopoe starling may have survived longer due to Réunion's rugged topography and highlands, where it spent much of the year.|$|E
5|$|James {{asserted}} {{his authority}} not only over the nobility but also upon the Church and <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> King David I's benevolence towards the Church proved costly to his successors {{and that he}} was 'a sair sanct to the croun'. James also considered that the monastic institutions in particular needed improvement and that they should return to being strictly ordered communities. Part of James's solution was to create an assembly of overseeing abbots and followed this up by establishing a Carthusian priory at Perth to provide other religious houses with an example of internal conduct. He also sought to influence Church attitudes to his policies by having his own clerics appointed to the bishoprics of Dunblane, Dunkeld, Glasgow and Moray. In March 1425, James's parliament directed that all bishops must instruct their clerics to offer up prayers for the king and his family; a year later, parliament toughened up this edict insisting that the prayers be given at every mass under sanction of a fine and severe rebuke. This same parliament legislated that every person in Scotland should 'be governed under the king's laws and statutes of this realm only'. From this, laws were enacted in 1426 to restrict the actions of prelates whether it was to regulate their need to travel to the Roman Curia or their ability to purchase additional ecclesiastical positions while there. In James's parliament of July 1427, it is evident that statute being enacted had the purpose of reducing the powers of the church jurisdiction.|$|E

25|$|After EC's {{collapse}} {{in the wake of}} the United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency hearings, Craig worked briefly for Atlas Comics, the 1950s predecessor of Marvel Comics, then spent several successful years at an advertising agency in Pennsylvania, though he <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> his responsibilities there prevented him from drawing much.

25|$|The staff's {{indifference}} {{to many of}} the park's own rules led to a similarly lawless culture among visitors, who generally liked the high level of control they had over their experience. Accidents were usually deemed by park employees to be the fault of the riders. A state official <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> many water-slide accidents were due to guests who, in blatant violation of an explicitly posted rule, would often discard their mats midway down the slide and wait at a turn for their friends so they could go down together.|$|E
25|$|Gustavus Adolphus shared Maria Eleonora's {{interest}} in architecture and {{her love of}} music, while she was sentimentally devoted to her husband. Often, she <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> she never had her hero for herself. Foreign ambassadors found her gracious and beautiful and she had good taste, although her character showed some extravagant traits. Maria Eleonora had a definite liking for entertainment and sweetmeats, and she soon succumbed to the current fashionable craze for buffoons and dwarfs. She spoke French, the court language of the age, but never bothered to learn to write German or Swedish correctly.|$|E
25|$|As of 2001, {{the scholar}} of {{religion}} Olav Hammer could still note that books presenting the Theosophical doctrines were mostly apologetic in nature. Examples of such works include William Q. Judge's 1893 book Ocean of Theosophy and Robert Ellwood's 1986 book Theosophy. He noted {{that most of}} these works treated Theosophical doctrine {{as if it were a}} fixed entity and provided little or no discussion of how they have changed over the decades. Hammer also <b>lamented</b> <b>that</b> while scholarship on Theosophy was developing, it had not focused on the reformulation of Theosophy by Leadbeater and Besant or with the developing ideas of post-Theosophical writers like Steiner or Bailey.|$|E
