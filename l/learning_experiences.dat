40|$|Abstract:- The {{purpose of}} this study is to test the effect of <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> on {{attitude}} of using statistical software. Under a context of natural experimental setting, there are experimental and control groups. The experimental group is learning to use the statistical software in a course of software application. The control group is learning to apply the statistical software for analyzing data in a course of research method. The participants are 63 university students, 42 in experimental group and 21 in control group. The results show that <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> has effect on attitude of using statistical software. It is concluded that <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> is important for the attitude of statistical software usage.

25|$|The 8 LMQs {{have two}} key purposes. Firstly, {{they act as}} a ‘professional {{knowledge}} organiser’. This means the 8 LMQs enable the teacher to identify and then organise the fundamental consideration, or elements, required for the successful development and execution of <b>learning</b> <b>experiences,</b> units of work or individual lessons. For the student-teacher the 8LMQs act as a ‘knowledge organiser’ whereby essential professional knowledge, learnt {{as part of their}} preparation program, is organised such they have a bank of ‘considerations’ that they can call upon as they engage with each question. By this is meant the teacher education program should be presented so as to inform each LMQ. This has the effect of providing the student-teacher with a ‘ready-reference’ arrangement of knowledge that they can draw upon and unpack when designing and then executing successful <b>learning</b> <b>experiences.</b>|$|E

Students’ perceptions of their <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> were obtained with a final open-ended question. Twenty-nine responses received were then categorized based on their similarity. Three types of responses were identified, commenting on: (a) the usefulness of the <b>learning</b> <b>experience,</b> (b) finding the experience as very interesting, and (c) enjoyment of the <b>learning</b> <b>experience.</b> Two types of improvement-oriented responses were identified: (a) suggesting improvements in existing simulations, and (b) other comments such as the need of higher fidelity of the visualization component, or finding issues in the way the device works.|$|R

40|$|Using the Revised Achievement Goal Questionnaire (AGQ-R) (Elliot & Murayama, 2008), we {{explored}} first-year university students’ achievement goal orientations {{on the premise}} of the 2 × 2 model. Similar to recent studies (Elliot & Murayama, 2008; Elliot & Thrash, 2010), we conceptualized a model that included both antecedent (i. e., enactive <b>learning</b> <b>experience)</b> and consequence (i. e., intrinsic motivation and academic achievement) of achievement goals. Two hundred seventy-seven university students (151 women, 126 men) participated in the study. Structural equation modeling procedures yielded evidence that showed the predictive effects of enactive <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> and mastery goals on intrinsic motivation. Academic achievement was influenced intrinsic motivation, performance-approach goals, and enactive <b>learning</b> <b>experience.</b> Enactive <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> also served as an antecedent of the four achievement goal types.
