40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, banks {{throughout}} the world have found {{it increasingly difficult to}} obtain outright guarantees from companies to cover loan or other financial facilities to subsidiaries. Consequently, various third party credit support devices or comfort instruments, generally known as <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> comfort, have developed to provide an alternative to traditional forms of security. It is necessary for a proper understanding of these instruments to investigate their origin, to delineate them, and to consider their use in corporate group and banking practice. The typical comfort letter transaction involves the parent&# 8208;subsidiary&# 8208;lender trinity and at least three different, but inter&# 8208;related relationships which may be regulated by different legal regimes &# 150; first, between a lender and the subsidiary; secondly, between a lender and the parent company; and thirdly, between the parent company and the subsidiary. When the relationship between a lender and the subsidiary breaks down or the latter becomes insolvent, the courts are usually asked to determine the contractual effect <b>of</b> the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> comfort as between the lender and the parent company. <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> comfort are predominantly used in international business transactions. The issue <b>of</b> comfort <b>letter</b> enforceability is considerably more complex within an international context than in one&# 146;s own legal system. Courts in different jurisdictions and in disparate legal systems have adopted distinct approaches to determine the contractual enforceability <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> comfort. Accordingly, a trans&# 8208;systemic view of the contractual effect <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> comfort is necessary {{to be aware of the}} way in which such letters are treated in other legal systems, and to facilitate a consistent treatment of an instrument of international use in one&# 146;s domestic law. Over the years, <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> comfort have become more detailed in content. The result is more litigation about the enforceability <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> comfort and, because <b>of</b> courts <b>undertaking</b> more contractual analysis <b>of</b> such <b>letters,</b> a doctrinal foundation for the assessment of liability against a parent company has started to be developed by courts in some jurisdictions. Legal liability based on a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> comfort is a real possibility. Like a boomerang, a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> comfort is potentially a dangerous instrument when it returns to its unsuspecting originator...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> credit as {{a method}} of {{smoothing}} international payment is a conditional security and obligation to pay the customer bank (issuing bank) to seller (applicant). For this purpose, the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit may be considered as the most usual method of payment of goods price in international trade. The classic form <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit is the commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit whose financial obligation is rooted in the documents that demonstrates the making of transaction by the beneficiary and it is used as a mechanism of payment and financial security in international transaction of goods. Contrary to commercial <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit which is a payment document, standby <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit has been taken into account for protection of beneficiary in case of default of payment to perform obligation or payment. Standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit are equal to bank guarantee and issued as performance and obligation security and in the form <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit. This article with cmparison <b>of</b> commercial <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit and standby <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit is to review the similarities and differences of these two documents and the most important legal aspects of both are compared in order to answer this question that when and in which form each of these means are used in international trade by the parties...|$|R
