25|$|All {{other local}} bus {{services}} are now operated by modern low-floor buses, {{which may be}} single-deck or double-deck. Most buses operating in London have two sets of doors, and passengers board the bus using {{the front door and}} alight using the rear door, whilst some buses on <b>less</b> <b>busy</b> <b>routes</b> have only one door. All these buses conform to the Disability discrimination act, and can accept passengers in wheelchairs and other mobility impaired passengers.|$|R
50|$|Minibuses {{and short}} {{wheelbase}} midibuses {{have not been}} used in large numbers by Lothian, although some midibuses had previously been used on <b>less</b> <b>busy</b> <b>routes.</b> Ten Seddon Pennine IV-236 were acquired in 1973. These were replaced by 18 Leyland Cubs with Duple Dominant Bus bodies in 1981, which in turn gave way to 12 9m Dennis Darts with Alexander Dash bodies in 1992. When the Darts were delivered {{they were the only}} non-Leyland vehicles in the fleet. In 2001 five of these Darts were sold to Yorkshire Traction. The ones that remained were gradually cascaded to the Mac Tours subsidiary until their replacement by six Optare Solo SRs in 2008.|$|R
40|$|It is now {{becoming}} {{recognized that the}} traffic signals alone cannot solve congestion oriented transportation problems in principle while enhancements {{are added to the}} system. A new way recently being studied is providing drivers with real-time traffic information on trip time, congestion, accidents, restrictions and regulations, construction, parking lots and so forth. This makes drivers themselves select and use <b>less</b> <b>busy</b> <b>routes</b> with priority. Consequently, it reduces travel time, energy consumption, air pollution and increases safety, mobility, economic productivity, and efficiency of road networks. This combination of information, communication and transportation is called an intelligent transport system (ITS). Recently, the Korean government has initiated a comprehensive ITS development programme. This paper describes the programme briefly...|$|R
50|$|The {{owners of}} public {{transport}} buses {{may be the}} municipal authority or transit authority that operates them, {{or they may be}} owned by individuals or private companies who operate them on behalf of the authorities on a franchise or contract basis. Other buses may be run entirely as private concerns, either on an owner-driver basis, or as multi-national transport groups. Some countries have specifically deregulated their bus services, allowing private operators to provide public bus services. In this case, an authority may make up the shortfall in levels of private service provision by funding or operating ‘socially necessary’ services, such as early or late services, on the weekends, or <b>less</b> <b>busy</b> <b>routes.</b> Ownership/operation of public transport buses can also {{take the form of a}} charitable operation or not for profit social enterprises.|$|R
40|$|As {{rail freight}} reform {{develops}} further, parcels transport {{by the high}} speed rail network is expanding in China. We explore the optimal operational method through case studies. Both France and Germany have operated parcels trains on their high speed networks, at a speed of 270 km/h and 160 km/h respectively; following the literature we consider both as high speed freight trains. The business model, transportation organization and performance are compared between Germany, France and China. The findings of our analysis suggest dedicated high speed freight trains are better than mixed trains at exploiting advantages of high speed railways and achieving economies of scale. However, the sensitivity analysis tells us the dedicated high speed freight train in China will require at least 5 % mode share on the <b>busiest</b> <b>routes</b> like Beijing-Shanghai and Guangzhou-Shanghai and over 30 % on <b>less</b> <b>busy</b> <b>routes</b> like Chengdu-Changsha. From German and French experience, volume guarantees seem crucial for the operation of high speed freight trains. Competitive price {{is also important to}} attract enough volume. The construction of a limited high speed rail freight network on key routes will permit exploitation of economies of scale. Also night trains are a better choice for parcels and mail delivery companies...|$|R
25|$|Toronto's {{streetcar}} {{system is}} one of the few in North America still operating along street-running tracks. It has been operating since the mid-19th century. Horsecar service started in 1861, and 600 V DC overhead electric service began in 1892. New TTC routes since the 1940s have generally been operated by other modes, and the <b>less</b> <b>busy</b> streetcar <b>routes</b> have also been converted.
