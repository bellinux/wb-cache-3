25|$|In {{the graph}} {{to the right}} the value above the <b>line</b> <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> out-of-pocket cost per trip, per person for each mode of transportation; the value below the line shows subsidies, {{environmental}} impact, social and indirect costs. When cities charge market rates for on-street parking and municipal parking garages for motor vehicles, and when bridges and tunnels are tolled for these modes, driving becomes less competitive in terms of out-of-pocket costs compared to other modes of transportation. When municipal motor vehicle parking is underpriced and roads are not tolled, the shortfall in tax expenditures by drivers, through fuel tax and other taxes, might {{be regarded as a}} very large subsidy for automobile use: much greater than common subsidies for the maintenance of infrastructure and discounted fares for public transportation.|$|E

[...] The red <b>line</b> <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> heater, green is the regenerator, and blue is the cooler.

2500|$|Graphically, {{this can}} be {{represented}} on a space-time diagram {{by the fact that}} a plot of the set of points regarded as simultaneous generates a line which depends on the observer.

[...] The dotted horizontal <b>line</b> <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> set of points regarded as simultaneous with the origin by a stationary observer. [...] This diagram is drawn using the (x, t) coordinates of the stationary observer, and is scaled so that the speed of light is one, i.e., so that a ray of light would be represented by a line with a 45° angle from the x axis. [...] From our previous analysis, given that v = 0.25 and c = 1, the equation of the dashed line of simultaneity is t – 0.25x = 0 and with v = 0, the equation of the dotted line of simultaneity is t = 0.|$|E
