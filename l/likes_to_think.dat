25|$|Kanade is {{the younger}} sister of Tomoki's male friend. A first-year at school, she is {{extremely}} timid and cries often, {{which may be}} the main reason she is teased. One of her hobbies is drawing memories from her past. Whilst Kanade already has a brother, she <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the protagonist as a brother, as he would often play games with her when she was a young child.|$|E
25|$|Frank is a wheeler-dealer who <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of himself}} as a 'big player' in the {{business}} world, but in reality he {{is little more than a}} wily conman. He is a smooth-talker and full of charm, but his actions are often thoughtless and he tends to run instead of facing up to his responsibilities, leaving his loved ones to pick up the pieces. His love affair with Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) stems back to his teens, and he can never quite let her go, always breaking her heart, disappearing, and returning to break it all over again.|$|E
500|$|Hilary Kingsley, {{author of}} The EastEnders Handbook (1991), has {{described}} Peggy as tough, with a [...] "knack for getting her own way". She adds, [...] "Peggy <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> she looks much younger [...] She's flash, fast-talking and nobody's fool. She has always done things her own way, and heaven help anyone who crosses her, though her bark's usually worse than her bite." ...|$|E

500|$|Smith {{became a}} father {{for the first}} time during the 1982 season with the birth of his son O.J., today known as Nikko, on April 28. Smith also {{developed}} a lasting friendship with teammate Willie McGee during the season, and Smith said he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he [...] "helped Willie get over some of the rough spots of adjusting to the major leagues". Smith later participated in the postseason {{for the first time}} when the Cardinals faced the Atlanta Braves in the best-of-five 1982 National League Championship Series (NLCS). Smith drove in the series' first run by hitting a sacrifice fly that scored McGee in Game 1, ultimately going five for nine in St. Louis' three-game series sweep.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{it was not}} planned, Zsa Zsa {{was given}} a {{personality}} {{similar to that of}} her on-screen aunt, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), an established character in EastEnders. During the development of the character, she changed a lot and was fluid until filming started, when Kenny had a full day on set with Henry. She explained: [...] "The words were there and I knew what she was like but when I saw Linda [...] speak and when I engaged with her, I realised that it was like looking in a mirror." [...] When the character was announced, she was described as beautiful, funky, an outspoken tomboy, very bright, but <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> she does not need anybody's help. Kenny said of the character in an interview with Soaplife magazine: [...] "Zsa Zsa doesn't like authority or anyone who messes with her. She's a lone wolf and doesn't care about anyone." [...] She told entertainment website Digital Spy that Zsa Zsa is [...] "a real bitch" [...] and [...] "very mean and cold", while a profile for the character on the official EastEnders website says she is sarcastic, a rebel and [...] "desperately wants the security that comes with a family but is terrified of being dependent on anyone. Her experience has taught her that adults let you down." ...|$|E
2500|$|In common parlance, law means a {{rule that}} (unlike a rule of ethics) is {{enforceable}} through institutions. The study of law crosses the boundaries between {{the social sciences and}} humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a [...] "system of rules", as an [...] "interpretive concept" [...] to achieve justice, as an [...] "authority" [...] to mediate people's interests, and even as [...] "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction". However one <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social science and discipline of the humanities. Laws are politics, because politicians create them. Law is philosophy, because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of history's stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about contract, tort, property law, labour law, company law and many more can have long-lasting effects on how productivity is organised and the distribution of wealth. The noun law derives from the late Old English lagu, meaning something laid down or fixed and the adjective legal comes from the Latin word LEX.|$|E

60|$|So {{for these}} few days every year this woman left her furs and jewels, her fine clothes and dainty foods, behind her, and {{lived for a}} little space with what was clean and wholesome. It was the one anchor holding her to womanhood; and one <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that it was, perhaps, in the end strong enough to save her from the {{drifting}} waters. All which arguments in favour of Christmas and of Christmas customs are, I admit, purely sentimental ones, but I have {{lived long enough to}} doubt whether sentiment has not its legitimate place in the economy of life.|$|E

But yet there's {{something}} in it. One <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the old place, though one is so far away. How do you feel now? Does the jolting hurt you much?

"People {{say we are}} decadent {{and getting}} slack with luxury, but one <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{the spirit of the}} race survives all changed {{conditions}} and can't be destroyed. There is a colliery not very far off where the water broke in some years ago. The men in the deep workings were cut off, but the few who escaped went back into the pit--and never came up. They knew the thing was impossible, their leaders frankly told them so, but they would not be denied. Well, the colliery was not reopened, the shaft-head towers are falling down, but there's a granite fountain on the moor that will stand for ages to record the splendid sacrifice." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{affair was}} {{in the nature of}} a typical [...] "crush," [...] for Diana's list of eligibles {{included}} most of the prominent society folk then in town, and she was too important a personage to have her invitations disregarded. Beth and Patsy were fairly bewildered by the numerous introductions, until names became meaningless in their ears; but Louise, perfectly composed and in no wise distracted by her surroundings or the music of the orchestra and the perpetual buzz of conversation in the crowded rooms, impressed each individual upon her memory clearly, and was not likely to blunder in regard to names or individuality in the future. This is a rare talent, indeed, and scores, largely in one's favor; for no one <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> himself so unimportant as to be forgotten, under any circumstances.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should say}} {{you do not want}} it, Giulia," [...] Maria said, laughing. [...] "I like it, I own, even from Francisco. It may not mean anything, but it is {{pleasant}} nevertheless; besides, one <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that there is just a little truth in it, not much, perhaps, but just a little in what Francisco said, for instance. Of course we are not all Venice to him. Still, just as we are pleased to see him, he is pleased to see us; and why shouldn't he say so in a pretty way? It's all very well for you to set up as being above flattery, Giulia, but you are young yet. I have no doubt you will like it when you get as old as I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} you have," [...] she answered, [...] "but {{in the same way}} that I have always cared for you. You do not care for me as you do for Emily de Reuss, nor do you want me so much as the woman whom you cannot have. I want to be honest, dear. Perhaps if I loved you and felt that there was no one else in this world whom I could care for, this might be enough. I might be content with the chance that the rest would come, {{although}} no woman, Douglas, <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> herself a makeshift--to be offered anything less than the whole. You see it is for life, isn't it? When you asked me, I never dreamed but that so long as you wanted me at all, you wanted me more than any one else in the world. Now I know that this was not so. I am only an insignificant little thing, Douglas, and not fit to be your companion in many ways. But I could not marry you to think that there would be moments when you and I would stand apart, that there would be another woman living, whose coming might quicken your heart, and make the world a more beautiful place for you. Can you understand that, I wonder?" ...|$|E
