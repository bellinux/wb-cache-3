The formulated requirements include e. g. requirements for many-to-many migration in preservation and requirements for homogenous navigation and social networking in dissemination. Many of the described observations and results have parallels to other types of material.

Eventual consistency is the weakest consistency level that guarantees convergence. Informally, it requires that all replicas of an object will eventually reach the same, correct, final value, assuming that no new updates are submitted to the object. Eventual consistency is an important correctness criteria in systems with a lazy, update-anywhere strategy, also referred to as optimistic replication (q. v.). Update operations can be submitted and executed on any node, and the propagation of updates occurs lazily after commit. Conflict resolution and reconciliation must ensure that all replicas (copies) of a <b>logical</b> <b>object</b> eventually converge to the same value. Different objects are considered independent. In a system where updates are continuously submitted, eventual consistency can be defined by a weak form of schedule equivalence [1].

40|$|UnrestrictedThe World Wide Web {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} information resources today. Web pages are designed for visual browsing by human users. However, information on the web is also accessed by computer applications and specialized browsing devices. These computer applications and devices need to retrieve, filter, process, index, and present information on the web in sophisticated ways, not just simply rendering web pages like a conventional browser.; In order to facilitate the information filtering and processing of these computer applications and devices, it is desirable to include semantic knowledge into the processing of web pages. Thus it is necessary to determine the logical structure of web pages, i. e. information regions on the web pages and their inter-relationships.; This thesis develops a formal model for representing the logical structure of web pages and presents algorithms for automatically generating the logical structure tree. Instead of using rule based classification approaches, it identifies <b>logical</b> <b>objects</b> by analyzing the structural and semantic features, by checking the lifetime of objects on the web page, and determines the functionality of <b>logical</b> <b>objects</b> using neural networks.; To evaluate the logical structure model, this thesis uses it to categorize search engine results. By classifying the search results into categories, such as articles, product lists, portal pages, homepages of commercial and non-commercial websites, etc., application programs can have a better understanding of the search results.; This thesis also evaluates the logical structure model and algorithms by applying them to ranking the search engine results. By analyzing a web page's logical structure, we can have a more comprehensive understanding about the structure of the web page, and also the importance of each information region. Instead of taking the entire web page as the atomic information unit and giving all hyperlinks and occurrences of keywords on the web page the same weight of importance, we can use individual <b>logical</b> <b>objects</b> as atomic information units and give each information unit different weight according to its functionality and importance. Therefore we can achieve better indexing and more precise ranking of web pages...|$|R

40|$|I {{argue in}} this paper that agreeing past participles are merged {{externally}} in the derivation in V endorsed with a feature [+resultative], whereas non-agreeing past participles are bound to value a feature [+perfective] against the have-auxiliary. Phi-agreement on the former kind of participle occurs since the meaning [+resultative] denotes a property of the <b>logical</b> <b>object,</b> which happens to merge {{in the position of}} sister to V-en. As postulated in standard frameworks, phi-agreement consists in that the V-en form values uninterpretable phi-features against the DP object. In contrast with agreeing past participles, non-agreeing past participles are merged externally in the form of V and they get their –en suffix in v valued against the have-auxiliary once the latter enters the derivation. The meaning or interpretation of this –en suffix is [+perfective] or [+anterior]. No phi-agreement occurs between these V-en forms marked [+perfective] and their <b>logical</b> <b>object</b> (whenever they select for one) since [+perfective] is a property of the event or situation as a whole, and not of the object. It is further suggested that the specific Agree relation that is phi-agreement appears not to be subject to configurations of asymmetric c-command, but to just occur on external Merge of the DP that bears the corresponding valued, interpretable phi-features...|$|E

We raise doubt on this “categorial particularism” position by drawing on underlying similarities of passive constructions of three South Asian languages - Oriya (Indo-Aryan), Malayalam (Dravidian) and Kharia (Austro-Asiatic).
