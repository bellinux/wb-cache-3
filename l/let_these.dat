25|$|Mistakes were made. On 1 August 1940. {{a message}} was {{recorded}} by Ambrose Sherwill {{to the people}} in the United Kingdom and especially the children of islanders who had evacuated. With all normal communications shut down, he wanted to <b>let</b> <b>these</b> people know that those left behind were not being mistreated and that the Germans were behaving like gentlemen. Accepted as such by most islanders, when broadcast from Germany it was viewed differently in Britain, coming as it did in the midst of the Battle of Britain. The BBC did not repeat the broadcast as requested.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{a girl of}} twenty-one {{lay dying}} on a stretcher. The father, a big, gentle Boer {{kneeling}} beside her; while, next tent, his wife was watching a child of six, also dying, and one of about five drooping. Already this couple had lost three children {{in the hospital and}} so would not <b>let</b> <b>these</b> go, though I begged hard to take them out of the hot tent. I can't describe what it is to see these children lying about in a state of collapse. It’s just exactly like faded flowers thrown away. And one has to stand and look on at such misery, {{and be able to do}} almost nothing.|$|E
25|$|The {{bones in}} the stomach region had not been etched by the stomach acid, {{indicating}} this meal {{was less than a}} day old. It is possible that the stomach exit was too narrow to <b>let</b> <b>these</b> remains pass and that the acid was used to extract calcium from the bones, a much-needed nutrient for a young growing animal. The subsequent digestive tract with most extant vertebrates is incapable of further digesting bones. Afterwards the remains would then have been regurgitated. However, the presence of vertebrae in the intestines suggests that the exit was wide and that non-avian theropods in this respect were more like present Lepidosauromorpha than extant Archosauria who regurgitate. This is also confirmed by a high bone content in the coprolites of large theropods. Fish contains much calcium and {{it is possible that the}} hatchling instinctively sought it out; alternatively, it could have been preferentially fed fish by its parents. The presence of skin in the faeces was to be expected as this is not easily digested.|$|E

25|$|However, {{despite some}} calls from leading politicians, {{the issue was}} {{divisive}} within Hughes' Labor Party, and he hoped conscription could be avoided through sufficient volunteerism. A mass campaign to mobilise new recruits was started in November 1915 and proved to be successful {{over the next six}} months at sustaining a steady flow of new troops to the front. Hughes had left for Great Britain (where conscription had just been introduced) in January 1916 to take part in the planning of the Allied war effort. Whilst abroad he went on extended tours on the front lines, and formed a strong personal bond with the soldiers that he visited, particularly those recovering in English and French hospitals. It became unthinkable to him that Australia should <b>let</b> <b>these</b> men down, and the strategic situation convinced him that conscription would be necessary to maintain Australia's war effort. Upon his return to Australia, he found that the domestic situation had shifted significantly, and the state of recruitment was dire. Hughes received word from Deputy Prime Minister George Pearce that troop replacements would be insufficient by December 1916 even at the most generous estimates.|$|E

500|$|After {{less than}} five years as a judge, Denning was {{appointed}} a Lord Justice of Appeal on 14 October 1948. He was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor on 25 October 1948. As a Lord Justice of Appeal he continued to make reforming judgments in a variety of areas, particularly in family law and the rights of deserted wives. In 1952 the Court of Appeal heard Bendall v McWhirter [...] 2 QB 466 and ruled that a deserted wife occupying the marital home had a personal licence to stay there. The decision provoked disapproval among the judiciary and from the public; a correspondent wrote: Dear Sir: You are a disgrace to all mankind to <b>let</b> <b>these</b> women break up homes and expect us chaps to keep them while they rob us of what we have worked for and put us out on the street. I only hope you have the same trouble as us. So do us all a favour and take a Rolls and run off Beachy Head and don't come back.|$|E
500|$|Rothbard's The Libertarian Forum {{blamed the}} Middle East {{conflict}} on Israeli aggression [...] "fueled by American arms and money." [...] Rothbard {{warned that the}} mid-East conflict would draw the U.S. into a world war. He was anti-Zionist and [...] opposed U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Rothbard criticized the Camp David Accords for having betrayed Palestinian aspirations and opposed Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. In his essay, [...] "War Guilt in the Middle East," [...] Rothbard states that Israel refused [...] "to <b>let</b> <b>these</b> refugees return and reclaim the property taken from them." [...] He took negative views of the two state solution for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, saying: On the one hand there are the Palestinian Arabs, who have tilled the soil or otherwise used the land of Palestine for centuries; and on the other, there are a group of external fanatics, who {{come from all over}} the world, and who claim the entire land area as [...] "given" [...] to them as a collective religion or tribe at some remote or legendary time in the past. There is no way the two claims can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. There can be no genuine settlement, no [...] "peace" [...] in the face of this irrepressible conflict; there can only be either a war to the death, or an uneasy practical compromise which can satisfy no one. That is the harsh reality of the Middle East.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{cancellation}} of the Anarky series, Grant has disassociated himself {{from the direction of}} the character. In a 2004 interview he recalled that he had been asked by James Peatty for a critique of an Anarky/Green Arrow script the latter had written.
