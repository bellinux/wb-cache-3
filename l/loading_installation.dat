This includes transportation and assembly of large space vehicles in the Vehicle Assembly Building, rollout to Launch Pad 39, test, checkout, and the launch countdown. Under these broad categories, the risks of fuel and oxidizer <b>loading,</b> <b>installation</b> of pyrotechnics, and similar hazardous operations are discussed. The many aspects for fire and rescue requirements are examined. These encompass the water deluge systems on the Mobile Service Structure and the Mobile Launcher, the insulated fire and rescue tractor, slide wire escape system, fire proximity suits, self-contained breathing apparatus and emergency cutting tools. In addition, written procedures for tests, emergencies, rescue and backout, as well as certification of personnel and TV monitoring of the launch system are detailed. ...|$|E

The Open Platform Protection Profile (OP 3) recasts the Open Platform (OP) security requirements into {{the language of the}} Common Criteria (CC) to facilitate the formal evaluation of OP smart cards. In doing so, OP 3 stretches the CC to new limits. There are four areas of innovation: The use of “packages ” to deal with the optional components within the OP Card Specification. The use of the CC to evaluate Java Card ™ byte code verification algorithms. The integration of the Target of Evaluation (TOE) with the “Card/Chip Operating Environment (COE) ” on which the OP software sits. The definition of an Application Programming Interface (API), so that applications may use a variety of OP security services without the need to re-evaluate OP each time an application is evaluated. The paper also discusses other practical aspects of the application of the CC to the OP Program. It is the authors ’ intention that this paper will help people to apply the CC, particularly those who face similar challenges, and to create awareness of the security needs of smart card technology...|$|E
40|$|The Open Platform Specification sets a new {{standard}} for smart cards, governing the <b>loading,</b> <b>installation</b> and deletion of applications at any time that the card is on-line during the card lifecycle prior to card termination. The Open Platform Protection Profile (OP 3) recasts the Open Platform (OP) security requirements into {{the language of the}} Common Criteria (CC) to facilitate the formal evaluation of OP smart cards. In doing so, OP 3 stretches the CC to new limits. In particular solutions have had to be found to deal with the optional components within the OP Specification, and how to specify the requirements for the "Card/Chip Operating Environment (COE) " on which the OP software sits. In addition to providing the functionality to securely load, manage and delete applications, the OP software offers a variety of security services to applications on a "take it or leave it" basis. A third challenge has therefore been to determine how application protection profiles and security targets may be written to take advantage of these services, which are ostensibly provided via a "security API". The paper also explains how other protection profiles can be used to evaluate the result of integrating the COE together with the OP software. Moreover, the subject of platform independence is addressed, as it is of paramount importance not to have to evaluate every application in every combination with every other application on every platform. The paper also discusses other practical aspects of the application of the CC. It is the authors' intention that this paper will help people to apply the CC, particularly those who face similar challenges, and to create awareness of the security needs of smart card technology.

For instance, capacity constraints in the rail network - especially the availability of daytime slots - should be mentioned. Although small in comparison to a dedicated terminal, sufficient availability of rail sidings for cargo handling purposes had to be provided by the railway infrastructure operating companies. Without these, the infrastructure investment - even if very limited in comparison to conventional intermodal terminals or single wagon <b>loading</b> <b>installations</b> - would still be substantial. It had to be guaranteed that trucks could carry out their handling on the paved surface alongside the rails.

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration has {{sponsored}} a project at its Airworthiness Assurance NDI Validation Center (AANC) {{to validate the}} use of bonded composite doublers on commercial aircraft. A specific application was chosen {{in order to provide}} a proof-of-concept driving force behind this test and analysis project. However, the data stemming from this study serves as a comprehensive evaluation of bonded composite doublers for general use. The associated documentation package provides guidance regarding the design, analysis, installation, damage tolerance, and nondestructive inspection of these doublers. This report describes a series of fatigue and strength tests which were conducted to study the damage tolerance of Boron-Epoxy composite doublers. Tension-tension fatigue and ultimate strength tests attempted to grow engineered flaws in coupons with composite doublers bonded to aluminum skin. An array of design parameters, including various flaw scenarios, the effects of surface impact, and other off-design conditions, were studied. The structural tests were used to: (1) assess the potential for interply delaminations and disbonds between the aluminum and the laminate, and (2) determine the load transfer and crack mitigation capabilities of composite doublers in the presence of severe defects. A series of specimens were subjected to ultimate tension tests in order to determine strength values and failure modes. It was demonstrated that even in the presence of extensive damage in the original structure (cracks, material loss) and in spite of non-optimum installations (adhesive disbonds), the composite doubler allowed the structure to survive more than 144, 000 cycles of fatigue <b>loading.</b> <b>Installation</b> flaws in the composite laminate did not propagate over 216, 000 fatigue cycles. Furthermore, the added impediments of impact [...] severe enough to deform the parent aluminum skin [...] and hot-wet exposure did not effect the doubler`s performance. Since the tests were conducting using extreme combinations of flaw scenarios (sizes and collocation) and excessive fatigue load spectrums, the performance parameters were arrived at in a conservative manner...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{ships are}} means of {{transport}} which, during their entire operational lifespan, need to convey cargo and/or passengers in a safe and reliable way, without jeopardising their safety, and with least possible adverse impacts on the marine environment. The ship’s safety and functionality directly depend on the reliability of her propulsion system, the shafting being the essential unit of the system. The functionality of the ship’s shafting considerably depends on its correct installation. Installation of the ship propulsion shafting {{is an integral part}} of the overall positioning (alignment) procedure. Shafting alignment is performed in several stages, starting with the shaft line design, and includes calculating the elastic line and bearing <b>loads,</b> <b>installation</b> of shafting parts onboard ship in compliance with the calculation results, and verifying the alignment results. Procedures are different for ships in service and newly built ships. This paper deals with specific features of the propulsion shafting alignment that is carried out while a ship in service is being converted for a general reason. Unlike a newly built ship, an existing ship imposes additional constraints that should be dealt with in the calculation stage of the process as well as during shafting installation and alignment verification. A calculation approach for ships in service is always different, having specific features from case to case, depending on what is changed and what remains unchanged during the conversion of the ship. The same goes for the implementation and verification of the achieved results. The purpose of this paper is to underline the difference, its contribution being in suggesting the procedure to be followed in case of conversion of an existing vessel.

40|$|High and {{increasing}} voltage Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and 5 th harmonic voltage levels have been measured {{in recent years}} on Orion NZ Ltd's rural 11 kV distribution network in Canterbury, New Zealand. On occasion, at Points of Common Coupling (PCC), the THD has exceeded the 5 % limit and the 5 th harmonic has exceeded the 4 % limit. It has been suspected that these summer season high harmonic levels are due to the large existing {{and increasing}} density of farm irrigation deep well pump loads. It is likely that adverse effects on the network and neighbouring loads would become apparent if the increasing harmonic levels are left unchecked. A practical and theoretical investigation was conducted by the Electric Power Engineering Centre (EPECentre), University of Canterbury, on behalf of Orion to determine what are the primary causes of the high harmonic levels and provide mitigation options. Several farms with installed irrigation pumps were visited and the harmonic current and voltage levels were measured when the pumps were operating. Substation measurements were also simultaneously taken. A computer harmonic model of the local 11 kV network and loads was created that provided an accurate description of actual network conditions. An examination of Orion's system from the view of harmonic management was performed. The investigation revealed that the most significant cause of high harmonics levels is the comparatively large harmonic current injections by local irrigation pumps using Variable Speed Drives. A secondary cause is resonances in the network, often dynamically created by Power Factor (PF) capacitors switching online at various farms. To keep the rural network infrastructure in an effective and sustainable operating condition, mitigation measures are needed. Options researched included simulations of harmonic filters placed at various network points, {{and the use of}} alternate vector group transformers. Suggestions are made regarding objectives for harmonic limits at different network voltage levels, so as to determine harmonic limits for <b>load</b> <b>installations...</b>|$|R
