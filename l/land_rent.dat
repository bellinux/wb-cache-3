5|$|Jaffna kingdom {{was less}} feudalized than other kingdoms in Sri Lanka, such as Kotte and Kandy. Its economy {{was based on}} more money {{transactions}} than transactions on land or its produce. The Jaffna defense forces were not feudal levies; soldiers in the kings service were paid in cash. The king’s officials, namely Mudaliayars, were also paid in cash and the numerous Hindu temples seem not to have owned extensive properties, unlike the Buddhist establishments in the South. Temples and the administrators depended on the king and the worshippers for their upkeep. Royal and Army officials were thus a salaried class and these three institutions consumed over 60% of the revenues of the kingdom and 85% of the government expenditures. Much of the kingdom's revenues also came from cash except the Elephants from the Vanni feudatories. At {{the time of the}} conquest by the Portuguese in 1620, the kingdom which was truncated in size and restricted to the Jaffna peninsula had revenues of 11,700 pardaos of which 97% came from land or sources connected to the land. One was called <b>land</b> <b>rent</b> and another called paddy tax called arretane.|$|E

This paper examines the factors that determine the participation of farm households in <b>land</b> <b>renting</b> and migration, and investigates whether participation in <b>land</b> <b>renting</b> and migration influence each other, using a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit regression. Data from a household survey held in 2000 in three villages in the north-east of the Jiangxi Province were used to estimate the <b>land</b> <b>renting</b> and migration equations. Household characteristics, fixed factors, household land and labour endowments, institutional factors, and land and labour prices were used as explanatory variables in both equations.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between aggregate <b>land</b> <b>rents</b> and aggregate transport costs for land markets in which locations differ solely in terms of accessibility. That there exists a relationship between <b>land</b> <b>rents</b> and transport costs has been recognized {{at least since the}} time of von Thunen. The precise relationship between the two is, however, not generally well-understood. For instance, until quite recently it was considered correct to estimate the benefits from a transport improvement by the induced change in aggregate <b>land</b> <b>rents</b> at those locations where travel costs are reduced. This procedure can be shown to be correct only in very special circumstances. This paper presents a very general characterization of {{the relationship between}} aggregate <b>land</b> <b>rents</b> and aggregate transport costs. In some special cases, the relationship turns out to be remarkably simple: for a circular city with linear transport costs, aggregate transport costs are precisely twice aggregate <b>land</b> <b>rents,</b> independent of the distribution of tastes or income; for a linear city with linear transport costs, aggregate transport costs are equal to aggregate <b>land</b> <b>rents.</b> One corollary of our general analysis is that aggregate <b>land</b> <b>rents</b> may stay the same or actually fall in response to a transport improvement which makes everyone better off. In the first section we consider a simple example. The second derives the basic theorems of the paper, while the third examines their implications for the relationship between the benefits from a transport improvement and the change in aggregate <b>land</b> <b>rents</b> induced by the improvement. And in the fourth section, we examine {{the extent to which the}} theorems of section II generalize. ...|$|R

The new resident at Rajkot, Claude Hill, was concerned by Ranjitsinhji's actions early in 1909 and met him April 1909 to discuss his role and responsibilities. Meanwhile, in England Lord Edward Winterton, to whom Ranjitsinhji owed money from his lease of the Shillinglee Park property, asked questions in the House of Commons regarding Ranjitsinhji's debts, visits to England and his actions as ruler of Nawanagar. As his state required his presence, the British advised him to leave at least four years between his visits to England. He did so at the earliest opportunity in 1912.|$|E

Using the FADN farm level panel data with 20, 930 {{observations}} from 2004 and 2005 we are able to control for unobserved heterogeneity, simultaneity, and omitted variable bias, which often distort the incidence measures. According to our results, the SAPS has a positive and statistically significant impact on <b>land</b> <b>rents</b> in the NMS. However, the effect is smaller than theoretically predicted. <b>Land</b> <b>rents</b> capture only 0. 19 of the marginal Euro of the SAPS. Taking into account the level of <b>land</b> <b>renting</b> in the NMS, around 10 percent of the total value of SAPS payments benefit non-farming land owners through higher farmland rental prices. Because the share of <b>rented</b> <b>land</b> is higher for corporate than for individual farms, family farms will likely benefit more from the SAPS than corporate farms.

In its simplest version, the attraction-repulsion problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A1, A2 and R {{in such a way}} that the attractive forces exerted by points A1 and A2, and the repulsive force exerted by point R cancel each other out. In the same book, Tellier solved that problem for the first time in the triangle case, and he reinterpreted spatial economics theory, especially, the theory of <b>land</b> <b>rent,</b> in the light of the concepts of attractive and repulsive forces stemming from the attraction-repulsion problem. That problem was later further analyzed by mathematicians like Chen, Hansen, Jaumard and Tuy (1992), and Jalal and Krarup (2003).

Dasmariñas was a highly advanced town where not only textiles from Batangas and Bulacan looms, but also imported European cloth from Manila reached the town elites. Fish and other staple food however still came from nearby towns. Surprisingly until 1880, there was no public market in the town.
