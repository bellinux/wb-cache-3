40|$|The {{misalignment}} between {{corporate bond}} and {{credit default swap}} (CDS) spreads (i. e., CDSbond basis) during the 2007 - 09 financial crisis is often attributed to corporate bond dealers shedding off their inventory, right when liquidity was scarce. This paper documents evidence against this widespread perception. In the months following Lehman's collapse, dealers, including proprietary trading desks in investment banks, provided liquidity {{in response to the}} large selling by clients. Corporate bond inventory of dealers rose sharply as a result. Although providing <b>liquidity,</b> <b>limits</b> to arbitrage, possibly in the form of limited capital, obstructed the convergence of the basis. We further show that the unwinding of precrisis 'basis trades' by hedge funds is the main driver of the large negative basis.

A deteriora??o dessas estruturas, com o passar dos anos, pode representar um problema real para a economia e para o meio ambiente. Diversos m?todos t?m sido propostos para estudar e monitorar processos de corros?o, tais como: ensaios de perda de massa, an?lise de solu??o, an?lises eletroqu?micas e microbiol?gicas. Nesta pesquisa utilizou-se o a?o AISI 1020, devido a sua composi??o qu?mica ser similar aos a?os da maioria dos oleodutos e gasodutos caso do gasoduto Urucu-Coari-Manaus. Neste contexto, determinou-se a corrosividade de um solo caracter?stico da regi?o amaz?nica por t?cnicas anal?ticas e biol?gicas. A caracteriza??o geot?cnica do solo amaz?nico realizou-se por meio da determina??o da massa espec?fica, limites de liquidez e plasticidade, e granulometria, de acordo com as normas da Associa??o Brasileira de Normas T?cnicas (ABNT). Para as an?lises de perda de massas trabalhou-se com amostras in natura e com esteriliza??o em autoclave. Para as amostras in natura fizeram-se tr?s tipos de an?lises: uma colocada em um frasco contendo o a?o 1020 e enterrada no solo in natura; e as outras duas amostras com o a?o enterrado em extrato aquoso do solo (sem e com limpeza do a?o com isopropanol). Outra an?lise com duas amostras esterilizadas. Para os c?lculos da taxa de corros?o (normas NACE-RP- 07 - 75 e ASTMG 1 - 90) realizaram-se medidas di?rias em um per?odo de 30 dias. Analisou-se a presen?a de micro e macronutrientes por espectrofotometria de absor??o at?mica no solo, a concentra??o dos elementos qu?micos no extrato aquoso do solo por fluoresc?ncia de raios-x por reflex?o total e an?lise microbiol?gica para identifica??o do g?nero e esp?cie de bact?rias corrosivas. Os resultados geot?cnicos foram: a) a massa espec?fica igual a 2, 571 g/cm?; b) curva granulom?trica indicando matriz argilosa da ordem de 76, 08 %; e c) limite de liquidez de 83 % e LP igual a 41 %, portanto um IP = 42 %. O conjunto desses valores enquadrou o {{material}} natural, conforme a classifica??o do Transportation Research Board (TRB), no grupo A- 7, relativo aos solos argilosos. Referente ? an?lise de perda de massa, esta indicou que se trata de amostras severas segundo a resolu??o da norma comparativa da NACE-RP- 07 - 75, tanto para as amostras in natura como para as amostras esterilizadas, havendo um ressalvo de que as amostras esterilizadas apresentaram obviamente taxas mais baixa do que as in natura. As an?lises de micro e macronutrientes do solo identificaram elementos que conferem valores m?dios em capacidade de troca cati?nica apresentando part?culas coloidais que conferem ao solo argiloso maior agressividade. J? a t?cnica de fluoresc?ncia de raios-x identificaram elementos fundamentais para este estudo como S e Cl, elementos agentes de corrosividade. A an?lise microbiol?gica identificou o g?nero de bact?rias Thiobacillus Thiooxidans, capazes de oxidar S (enxofre) ou compostos de S a sulfato, com simult?nea produ??o de ?cido sulf?rico, que age como agente corrosivo. Nesta perspectiva verifica-se o bom desempenho do estudo da corros?o do a?o AISI 1020 no solo natural argiloso da regi?o amaz?nica. The {{study of}} soil as a corrosive medium is considered of great importance, {{due to the}} large number of pipes and tanks fitted inside. The deterioration of these structures over the years, can pose a real problem for the economy and for the environment. Several methods have been proposed to study and monitor corrosion processes, such as mass loss tests, solution analysis, electrochemical and microbiological analyzes. In this research we used the AISI 1020 steel due to its chemical composition {{is similar to that of}} most steel pipelines - Case Urucu- Coari - Manaus. In this context, it was determined the corrosivity of a characteristic soil in the Amazon region for analytical and biological techniques. The geotechnical characterization of Amazonian soil held by determining the density, <b>liquidity</b> <b>limits</b> and plasticity, and grain size, according to the rules of the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (ABNT). For the analysis of mass loss worked with fresh samples and autoclaving. For fresh samples were made three kinds of tests: one placed in a jar containing steel 1020 and buried in soil in nature, and the other two samples with steel buried in soil aqueous extract (with and without cleaning steel isopropanol). Another analysis with two sterile samples. For the calculation of the rate of corrosion (NACE standards -RP - 07 - 75 and ASTMG 1 - 90) were performed daily measurements over a period of 30 days. We analyzed the presence of micro-and macronutrients by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the soil, the concentration of the chemical elements in the soil aqueous extract fluorescence x-rays by total reflection and microbiological analysis to identify the genus and species of corrosive bacteria. The geotechnical results were : a) the density equal to 2. 571 g / cm ? b) grading curve indicating clay matrix of the order of 76. 08 %, and c) liquid limit of 83 % and equal to 41 % LP, so an IP = 42 %. This set of values framed the natural material, according to the classification of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) in group A- 7 on the clay soils. Referring to the analysis of weight loss, it is indicated that severe resolution of the samples according to comparative standard NACE -RP - 07 - 75, both for fresh samples and for sterilized samples, with one must underline that the samples sterilized obviously had lower rates than in nature. Analyses of soil micro and macronutrients identified elements which give average values for cation exchange capacity presenting colloidal particles that give the clay soil more aggressivel. Since the technique of fluorescence x- rays identified in this study key elements such as S and Cl, elements corrosive agents. Microbiological analysis identified the genus of bacteria Thiobacillus Thiooxidans, which oxidize S (sulfur) or S compounds to sulfate, with simultaneous production of sulfuric acid, which acts as a corrosive agent. In this perspective it appears the good performance of the study of corrosion of AISI 1020 steel in natural clayey soil in the Amazon region...|$|E

Using our model, we analyze some implications of the optimal execution strategy with comparative statics and simulations.

The vertical distribution of porosity throughout a clay-rich marsh soil profile was studied in a grassland field with samples taken from the soil surface characterized by water contents near their shrinkage limit down to 2. 00 m deep saturated sediments over their <b>liquidity</b> <b>limit.</b> The depth of the plasticity limit isolates a soil in a solid state characterized by a vertical prism-like structure from a plastic to pseudo-liquid state in depth. The porosity was calculated from the measurements of the density of intact samples by double weighing and image analysis of 100 cm 2 polished sections. The initial structure of clay soil was maintained by impregnation based on water–acetone–resin exchange. An ultraviolet photo luminescent pigment added to the resin allowed the capture of images from which shrinkage cracks and microporosity of the clay matrix were easily separated. The distribution of porosity between the shrinkage crack mesoporosity and the clay matrix microporosity was evaluated after the mathematical decomposition of the grey level curves characteristic of each level. Vertical {{evolution of}} the porosity distribution from the soil surface in a solid state to the plastic and pseudo-liquid sediment in depth was presented on the shrinkage curve of the clay material. The measurements point out how the clay matrix microporosity and mesoporosity of shrinkage cracks are complementary and the role of the scale effect on the shrinkage curve. The analysis of images captured on an optical microscope under polarized and analyzed light and the SEM observation of freeze-dried samples demonstrated the isotropic arrangement of the clay particles in typical “honey-comb” architecture in the in situ plastic-to-liquid saturated domain.
