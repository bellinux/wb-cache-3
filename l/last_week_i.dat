500|$|Friday {{was arrested}} after the evening match away at Newport County on 20 October, {{accused of using}} obscene {{language}} outside a Newport nightclub. At his appearance before magistrates in Newport on 17 November, he pleaded not guilty, representing himself, and was acquitted. Performing strongly for Reading and scoring regularly, he began to attract serious interest from other clubs. [...] "Friday is, of course, much more than Reading's top scorer and best striker", wrote the Evening Post on 3 November 1975. [...] "He is the most vital cog in the team, and <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>I</b> understand Reading turned down a £60,000 bid from Cardiff City involving Welsh international Derek Showers". By the new year, Reading were third in the table, on course for promotion and two points behind league leaders Lincoln City.|$|E
500|$|Den of Geek {{viewed the}} episode positively, observing that in {{contrast}} to the previous installment, [...] "Ability" [...] "progresses the main plot arc in a substantial way... I’m now really interested to see what happens next, whereas <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>I</b> wasn’t that bothered." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler was a little more critical and rated the episode 7.8/10. He noted that though the ending with Walter [...] "was as good as you could ask for" [...] and enjoyed David Robert Jones as a villain, the episode had a [...] "number of rough patches," [...] as the middle was [...] "paced slowly" [...] and lacking in suspense, Peter's [...] "handiness was again reduced to ...'that guy with connections'", and the audience was [...] "once again subjected to the torture that is Sanford Harris". After describing the Olivia-Peter scene near the end as [...] "tense and cleverly written," [...] Isler concluded his review by noting references to The X-Files and hoping Jones would appear again soon.|$|E
500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read your letter I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you know, he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E

5000|$|... "Unseen <b>last</b> <b>week</b> when <b>I</b> {{listed the}} five best films thus far of 1973 but which I most emphatically {{want to add}} to the list are: 'THE HIRELING'." ...|$|R
500|$|In the United States, {{the first}} three films in the Die Hard series were rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. Live Free or Die Hard, however, was edited to obtain a PG-13 rating. In some cases, {{alternate}} profanity-free dialogue was shot and used or swearing was cut out in post-production to reduce profanity. Director Len Wiseman commented on the rating, saying [...] "It was about three months into it , and I hadn't even heard that it was PG-13... But in the end, it {{was just trying to}} make the best Die Hard movie, not really thinking so much about what the rating would be." [...] Bruce Willis was upset with the studio's decision, stating, [...] "I really wanted this one {{to live up to the}} promise of the first one, which I always thought was the only really good one. That's a studio decision that is becoming more and more common, because they’re trying to reach a broader audience. It seems almost a courageous move to give a picture an R rating these days. But we still made a pretty hardcore, smashmouth film." [...] Willis said he thought that viewers unaware that it was not an R-rated film would not suspect so due to the level and intensity of the action as well as the usage of some profanity, although he admitted these elements were less intense than in the previous films. He also said that this film was the best of the four: [...] "It's unbelievable. I just saw it <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> <b>I</b> personally think, it's better than the first one." ...|$|E
2500|$|As usual, Ali was {{confident}} and colorful before the fight. He told interviewer David Frost, [...] "If {{you think the}} world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait 'til I whup Foreman's behind!" [...] He told the press, [...] "I've done something new for this fight. I done wrestled with an alligator, I done tussled with a whale; handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail; only <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>I</b> murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick; I'm so mean I make medicine sick." [...] Ali was wildly popular in Zaire, with crowds chanting [...] "Ali, bomaye" [...] ("Ali, kill him") wherever he went.|$|E
2500|$|... "With {{the winds}} that started blowing <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>I</b> {{figured it would}} just be a matter of time," [...] said Ken Thrasher, {{speaking}} for the South Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which opposes the flag's removal. [...] "Whatever the Legislature decides to do, we will accept it graciously." [...] A number of prominent Republicans who had previously appeared to struggle with the issue immediately endorsed Haley's call to remove the flag, including Kentucky Senator and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, and governors and presidential hopefuls Scott Walker and Rick Perry.|$|E

2500|$|Whitman {{appeared}} {{twice in}} New York City after the September 11 attacks to inform New Yorkers that the toxins {{released by the}} attacks posed no threat to their health. On September 18, the EPA released a report in which Whitman said, [...] "Given {{the scope of the}} tragedy from <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>I</b> am glad to reassure the people of New York and Washington, D.C. that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink." [...] She also said, [...] "The concentrations are such that they don't pose a health hazard...We're going to make sure everybody is safe." [...] A 2003 report by the EPA's Inspector General determined that the assurance was misleading, because the EPA [...] "did not have sufficient data and analyses" [...] to justify it.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 September 2014, it was {{announced}} that Jason Orange had left the band. He said: 'At a band meeting <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>I</b> confirmed to Mark, Gary and Howard that I do not wish to commit to recording and promoting a new album. 'At the end of The Progress Tour I began to question whether it might be the right time for me to not continue on with Take That,' he continued. 'There have been no fallings out, only a decision on my part that I no longer wish to do this,' he added. Barlow, Donald and Owen issued a joint statement about Orange's decision which said: [...] "This is a sad day for us. Jason leaving is a huge loss both professionally and even more so personally... Jason's energy and belief in what this band could achieve has made it what it is today, and we'll forever be grateful for his enthusiasm, dedication and inspiration over the years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Walter Phillips, who {{was present}} at two of the {{meetings}} in Jinzhou, wrote: [...] "It was at Chinchow that I first {{came into contact with}} the Revival. Meetings had been going on there for a week, hence, I was ushered into the heart of things unprepared, and in candour, I must add, with a strong temperamental prejudice against 'revival hysterics' in every form, so that mine is at least an unbiased witness. At once, on entering the church, one was conscious of something unusual. The place was crowded to the door, and tense, reverent attention sat on every face. The very singing was vibrant with new joy and vigour [...] [...] [...] The people knelt for prayer, silent at first, but soon one here and another there began to pray aloud. The voices grew and gathered volume and blended into a great wave of united supplication that swelled till it was almost a roar, and died down again into an undertone of weeping. Now I understood why the floor was so wet - [...] it was wet with pools of tears! The very air seemed electric -- I speak in all seriousness [...] - and strange thrills coursed up and down one's body. Then above the sobbing, in strained, choking tones, a man began to make public confession. Words of mine will fail to describe the awe and terror and pity of these confessions. It was not so much the enormity of the sins disclosed, or the depths of iniquity sounded, that shocked one[...] [...] [...] It was the agony of the penitent, his groans and cries, and voice shaken with sobs; it was the sight of men forced to their feet, and, in spite of their struggles, impelled, as it seemed, to lay bare their hearts that moved one and brought the smarting tears to one's own eyes. Never have I experienced anything more heart breaking, more nerve racking than the spectacle of those souls stripped naked before their fellows. So for hour after hour it went on, till the strain was almost more than the onlooker could bear. Now it was a big, strong farmer groveling on the floor, smiting his head on the bare boards as he wailed unceasingly, 'Lord! Lord!' Now a shrinking woman in a voice scarce above a whisper, now a wee laddie from the school, with the tears streaking his piteous grimy little face, as he sobbed out: 'I cannot love my enemies. <b>Last</b> <b>week</b> <b>I</b> stole a farthing from my teacher. I am always fighting and cursing. I beseech the pastor, elders and deacons to pray for me.' And then again would swell that wonderful deep organ tone of united prayer. And ever as the prayer sank again the ear caught a dull undertone of quiet sobbing, of desperate entreaty from men and women, who, lost to their surroundings, were wrestling for peace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{whose wife}} {{will she be}} then?" [...] said Miss Ruey; [...] "'cause that ar Mr. Adams is married. I {{saw it in the}} paper <b>last</b> <b>week</b> when <b>I</b> was up to Mis' Badger's." ...|$|R

5000|$|Leigh Paatsch, {{writing in}} the Herald Sun, called it a [...] "true {{cinematic}} lemon" [...] in a withering review. [...] "Having paid $18 to see Mental <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> all <b>I</b> can say is this: I want my $100 back." ...|$|R
