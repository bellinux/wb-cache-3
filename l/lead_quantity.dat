40|$|A {{study was}} carried out {{to find out the}} effects of calcium carbonate, {{potassium}} iodide and zinc sulphate in lead induced toxicities in rat with the observation of toxic signs, postmortem changes and determination of <b>lead</b> <b>quantity</b> in different organs of the body. Twenty-five long Evans rats weighing between 202 - 305 g were randomly divided into five groups keeping group A as untreated control. Rest four groups (B, C, D & E) were treated with lead acetate @ 20 mg/kg body weight in addition, rats of groups C, D & E were given Calcium carbonate (50 mg/kg body weight), potassium iodide (20 mg/kg bwt) and zinc sulphate (10 mg/kg bwt.) respectively. Treatments were continued for 42 consecutive days. Rats of group B showed reduction in fecal consumption, anxiety, indigestion, fatigue, muscle tremor, paralysis and ruffled hair coat. However, rats of group C were apparently normal but rats of group D and E showed mild toxic signs of similar nature. On postmortem examination, severe congestion and blackish discoloration with enlargement of the liver, kidney, spleen and inflammation of the gastric mucosa were observed in rats of group B. However, these changes were less severe in other groups. The significant reduction of lead in blood, liver, kidney and brain was observed in rats of group C, D and E in comparison to group B. In addition, significant reduction of lead content was observed in femur of group C only. The present findings revealed that during lead exposure administration of calcium carbonate may be effective in modifying and preventing lead deposition in tissues followed by zinc sulphate and potassium iodide in rat...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{study the}} {{potential}} impact of environmental exposure to petrol lead, residential area, age, sex, and lead exposing hobby, on blood lead concentrations (BPb) in children. METHODS [...] In the south of Sweden, yearly from 1978 - 94, BPb was measured in 1230 boys and 1211 girls, aged between 3 and 19 (median 10; quartiles 9 and 12) years. RESULTS [...] For the samples of 1978, the geometric mean (GM) was 67 (range 30 - 250) micrograms/l in boys and 53 (18 - 161) micrograms/l in girls, whereas the corresponding GMs for 1994 were 27 (12 - 122) and 23 (12 - 97) micrograms/l. The sex difference was present only in children over eight. Moreover, residential area affected BPb; in particular, children living near a smelter area had raised BPbs. There was a clear ecological relation between BPb (adjusted GM) and annual <b>lead</b> <b>quantity</b> in petrol sold in Sweden, which was estimated to be 1637 tonnes in 1976 and 133 tonnes in 1993 (P < 0. 001, ecological linear regression analysis, where a two year lag of petrol lead was applied). In the 171 boys and 165 girls who were sampled twice with an interval of one to four years, the decreases in BPb were estimated to be 6 % (95 % confidence interval 4 %- 8 %) and 10 % (8 %- 13 %) /year, respectively. CONCLUSIONS [...] The present report points out the considerable beneficial effect of the gradual banning of petrol lead on the lead exposure affecting the population and differential sex specific BPb patterns due to a pronounced age effect in girls, which may be caused by older girls' lower food intake per kg of body weight, lower lung ventilation, cleaner life style, and loss of blood lead through menstrual bleedings...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of elucidation the effects of MEA on the {{prevention}} and therapy of lead poisoning, the present experiment was conducted. The author first induced lead poisoning in rats and guinea pigs by administering them lead and measured quantitatively the changes occurring in the lead contents of blood, liver, kidneys, and femur in the rats and also the <b>lead</b> <b>quantity</b> excreted in urine of the guinea pigs, after administering to these animals. In addition, by administering Ca-EDTA to similar groups of animals treated in the same manner, the author compared the changes brought about by these two drugs and thus evaluated the effects of MEA. 1. At {{the end of the}} first week after repeated administration of MEA the changes in the lead contents in blood did not differ greatly from those observed in the control group, whereas those in the group repeatedly administered with Ca-EDTA showed extensively higher value. Those in the organs mentioned above did not differ greatly from each others among these three groups. 2. The lead contents in the organs 4 weeks after repeated administration of MEA did not differ from those in the control, but the contents showed the greater value of 2 - 3 times than the contents in the groups of repeated administration of Ca-EDTA. 3. It has been observed that the quantity of lead excreted in urine by MEA administration increases slightly as compared with that in the control group, but this increase is far lesser than that brought about by the Ca-EDTA administration. 4. From these it has been clarified that hardly any effect of dissolution and excretion of lead outside the body can be expected by the repeated administration of MEA, and that in this respect the effect of MEA is far inferior to that of Ca-EDTA...|$|E

Geological and folklore diversity in different ethnic groups around the country may impact the heavy metals poisoning or trace elements deficiency. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the blood concentrations of 5 trace elements between dialysis patients and their matched normal control volunteers. Materials and Methods: This study was performed on 33 dialysis patients (selected from a university hospital in Ahwaz) and 33 normal volunteers. All trace elements were assayed in serum samples except Lead (whole blood) using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Data were analyzed and compared. Results: the mean age of subjects (35 male and 31 female) were not significantly different (matched populations). Trace element concentrations in the case and control groups for Zinc was 86. 35 Ã‚Â± 12. 9 and 80. 8 Ã‚Â± 11. 7 (P= 0. 075), Copper 75. 038 Ã‚Â± 16. 47 and 69. 84 Ã‚Â± 12. 99 (P= 0. 020), Selenium 10. 71 Ã‚Â± 1. 49 and 10. 15 Ã‚Â± 1. 17 (P= 0. 098), Aluminium 0. 58 Ã‚Â± 0. 25 and 0. 34 Ã‚Â± 0. 24 (P= 0. 000), Magnesium 0. 328 Ã‚Â± 0. 06 and 0. 207 Ã‚Â± 0. 03 (P= 0. 000) and for Lead 2. 714 Ã‚Â± 0. 64 and 1. 67 Ã‚Â± 0. 68 (P= 0. 000) (Ã‚Âµg/dl for all), respectively. <b>Lead</b> <b>quantities</b> were higher than the allowable range in the dialysis patients.
