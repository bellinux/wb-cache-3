6000|$|From the {{preceding}} considerations {{we shall be}} better able to appreciate the calculations as to the thickness of stratified deposits made by geologists. Professor Ramsay has calculated that the sedimentary rocks of Britain alone have a total maximum thickness of 72,600 feet; while Professor Haughton, from a survey of the whole world, estimates the maximum thickness of the known stratified rocks at 177,200 feet. Now these maximum thicknesses of each deposit will have been produced only where the conditions were exceptionally favourable, either in deep water near the mouths of great rivers, or in inland seas, or in places to which the drainage of extensive countries was conveyed by ocean currents; and this great thickness will necessarily be accompanied by a corresponding thinness, or complete absence of deposit, elsewhere. How far the series of rocks found in any extensive area, as Europe or North America, represents the whole series of deposits which have been made there we cannot tell; but {{there is no reason to}} think that it is a very inadequate representation of their maximum thickness, though it undoubtedly is of their extent and bulk. When we see in how many distinct localities patches of the same formation occur, it seems improbable that the whole of the deposits formed during any one period should have been destroyed, even in such an area as Europe, while it is still more improbable that they should be so destroyed over the whole world; and {109} if any considerable portion of them is left, that portion may give a fair idea of their average, or even of their maximum, thickness. In his admirable paper on [...] "The Mean Thickness of the Sedimentary Rocks,"[38] Dr. James Croll has dwelt on the extent of denudation in diminishing the mean thickness of the rocks that have been formed, remarking, [...] "Whatever the present mean thickness of all the sedimentary rocks of our globe may be, it must be small in comparison to the mean thickness of all the sedimentary rocks which have been formed. This is obvious from the fact that the sedimentary rocks of one age are partly formed from the destruction of the sedimentary rocks of former ages. From the Laurentian age down to the present day the stratified rocks have been undergoing constant denudation." [...] This is perfectly true, and yet the mean thickness of that portion of the sedimentary rocks which remains may not be very different from that of the entire mass, because denudation acts only on those rocks which are exposed on the surface of a country, and most largely on those that are upheaved; while, except in the rare case of an extensive formation being quite horizontal, and wholly exposed to the sea or to the atmosphere, denudation can have no tendency to diminish the thickness of any entire deposit.[39] Unless, therefore, a formation is completely destroyed by denudation in every part of the world (a thing very improbable), we may have in existing rocks a not very inadequate representation of the mean thickness of all that have been formed, and even of the maximum thickness of the larger portion. This will be the more likely because it is almost certain that many rocks contemporaneously formed are counted by geologists as distinct formations, whenever they differ in <b>lithological</b> <b>character</b> or in organic remains. But we know that limestones, sandstones, and shales, are always forming at the same time; {110} while a great difference in organic remains may arise from comparatively slight changes of geographical features, or from difference in the depth or purity of the water in which the animals lived.[40] ...|$|E
6000|$|Up to 1839 it was inferred, {{from their}} {{crystalline}} character, that the metamorphic rocks of Anglesea were more ancient than any rocks of the adjacent main land; {{but it has}} since been shown that they are {{of the same age}} with the slates and grits of Carnarvon and Merioneth. Again, slaty cleavage having been first found only in the lowest rocks, was taken as an indication of the highest antiquity: whence resulted serious mistakes; for this mineral characteristic is now known to occur in the Carboniferous system. Once more, certain red conglomerates and grits on the north-west coast of Scotland, long supposed from their lithological aspect to belong to the Old Red Sandstone, are now identified with the Lower Silurians. These are a few instances of the small trust to be placed in mineral qualities, as evidence of the ages or relative positions of strata. From the recently-published third edition of Siluria, may be culled numerous facts of like implication. Sir R. Murchison considers it ascertained, that the siliceous Stiper stones of Shropshire are the equivalents of the Tremadock slates of North Wales. Judged by their fossils, Bala slate and limestone are of the same age as the Caradoc sandstone, lying forty miles off. In Radnorshire, the formation classed as upper Llandovery rock, is described at different spots, as [...] "sandstone or conglomerate," [...] "impure limestone," [...] "hard coarse grits," [...] "siliceous grit"--a considerable variation for so small an area as that of a county. Certain sandy beds on the left bank of the Towy, which Sir R. Murchison had, in his Silurian System, classed as Caradoc sandstone (evidently from their mineral characters), he now finds, from their fossils, belong to the Llandeilo formation. Nevertheless, inferences from mineral characters are still habitually drawn and received. Though Siluria, in common with other geological works, supplies numerous proofs that rocks of the same age are often of widely-different composition a few miles off, while rocks of widely-different ages are often of similar composition; and though Sir R. Murchison shows us, as in the case just cited, that he has himself in past times been misled by trusting to lithological evidence; yet his reasoning all through Siluria, shows that he still thinks it natural to expect formations of the same age to be chemically similar, even in remote regions. For example, in treating of the Silurian rocks of South Scotland, he says:--"When traversing the tract between Dumfries and Moffat, in 1850, it occurred to me, that the dull reddish or purple sandstone and schist {{to the north of the}} former town, which so resembled the bottom rocks of Longmynd, Llanberis, and St. David's, would prove to be of the same age;" [...] and further on, he again insists upon the fact that these strata [...] "are absolutely of the same composition as the bottom rocks of the Silurian region." [...] On this unity of mineral character it is, that this Scottish formation is concluded to be contemporaneous with the lowest formations in Wales; for the scanty paleontological evidence suffices for neither proof nor disproof. Now, had there been a continuity of like strata in like order between Wales and Scotland, there might have been little to criticize in this conclusion. But since Sir R. Murchison himself admits, that in Westmoreland and Cumberland, some members of the system [...] "assume a lithological aspect different from what they maintain in the Silurian and Welsh region," [...] there seems no reason to expect mineralogical continuity in Scotland. Obviously, therefore, the assumption that these Scottish formations are of the same age with the Longmynd of Shropshire, implies the latent belief that certain mineral characters indicate certain eras. Far more striking instances, however, of the influence of this latent belief remain to be given. Not in such comparatively near districts as the Scottish lowlands only, does Sir R. Murchison expect a repetition of the Longmynd strata; but in the Rhenish provinces, certain [...] "quartzose flagstones and grits, like those of the Longmynd," [...] are seemingly concluded to be of contemporaneous origin, because of their likeness. [...] "Quartzites in roofing-slates with a greenish tinge that reminded us of the lower slates of Cumberland and Westmoreland," [...] are evidently suspected to be of the same age. In Russia, he remarks that the carboniferous limestones [...] "are overlaid along the western edge of the Ural chain by sandstones and grits, which occupy much the same place in the general series as the millstone grit of England;" [...] and in calling this group, as he does, the [...] "representative of the millstone grit," [...] Sir R. Murchison clearly shows that he thinks likeness of mineral composition some evidence of equivalence in time, even at that great distance. Nay, on the flanks of the Andes and in the United States, such similarities are looked for, and considered as significant of certain ages. Not that Sir R. Murchison contends theoretically for this relation between <b>lithological</b> <b>character</b> and date. For on the page from which we have just quoted (Siluria, p. 387), he says, that [...] "whilst the soft Lower Silurian clays and sands of St. Petersburg have their equivalents in the hard schists and quartz rocks with gold veins in the heart of the Ural mountains, the equally soft red and green Devonian marls of the Valdai Hills are represented on the western flank of that chain by hard, contorted, and fractured limestones." [...] But these, and other such admissions, seem to go for little. While himself asserting that the Potsdam-sandstone of North America, the Lingula-flags of England, and the alum-slates of Scandinavia are of the same period--while fully aware that among the Silurian formations of Wales, there are oolitic strata like those of secondary age; yet his reasoning is more or less coloured by the assumption, that formations of like qualities probably belong to the same era. Is it not manifest, then, that the exploded hypothesis of Werner continues to influence geological speculation? ...|$|E

In this paper, the stratigraphy is described in some detail, with remarks on correlation, and {{the features of the}} bivalve faunas are made clear. The Mukujima Formation, about 65 m thick, is characterized by the predominance of feldspathic quartzsandstone. Several shallow marine bivalves which were conspecific with the bivalves from the Torinosu Group in Sakawa, Sakamoto, Yatsushiro and Tanoura areas, and Soma Group (Nakanosawa Formation) in Soma area, and the fragmental plant fossils occur from this formation.

40|$|The {{deliberate}} anthropogenic {{movement of}} reworked natural and novel manufactured materials represents a novel sedimentary environment associated with mining, waste disposal, construction and urbanization. Anthropogenic deposits display distinctive engineering and environmental properties, {{and can be}} of archaeological importance. This paper shows that temporal changes in the scale and <b>lithological</b> <b>character</b> of anthropogenic deposits may be indicative of the Anthropocene. However, the stratigraphy of such deposits is not readily described by existing classification schemes, which do not differentiate separate phases or lithologically distinct deposits beyond a local scale. Lithostratigraphy is a scalable, hierarchical classification used to distinguish successive and lithologically distinct natural deposits. Many natural and anthropogenic deposits exhibit common characteristics; they typically conform to the Law (or Principle) of Superposition and exhibit lithological distinction. The lithostratigraphical classification of surficial anthropogenic deposits may be effective, although defined units may be significantly thinner and far less continuous than those defined for natural deposits. Further challenges include the designation of stratotypes, accommodating the highly diachronous nature of anthropogenic deposits and the common presence of disconformities. International lithostratigraphical guidelines would require significant modification before being effective for the classification of anthropogenic deposits. A practical alternative may be to establish an ‘anthrostratigraphical’ approach, or ‘anthrostratigraphy’. ...|$|E

The Pakhuis Formation is of special interest because it includes features like the extensive penecontemporaneous folding, an erosional unconformity and the uniform <b>lithological</b> <b>character</b> of the sandy diamictites.

Subglacial, grounding zone and iceberg facies associations with their lateral variations are developed. The temperate, glaciation of relative short duration, comprised one major and a second minor advance. During the first advance the grounded ice sheet with slow-moving sheet-flow reached ice-stream characteristics along at least part of a trough. The occurrence of an ice-stream within a slow-moving, low-profile ice sheet provides the glaciological environment for ice-stream draw-down, flanking infill of ice, resulting in compressional ice-flow from the sides. The fundamental requirement for buckling (i. e. the development of the Fold Zone) is layer parallel shortening achieved by the compressional ice-flow. Ice-bed interface features like deforming-bed structures are developed, as well as outsize flutes for which an alternative bulk strain model is proposed. The glacial retreat was rapid, interrupted only by the second, minor advance. A marine environment is attested by the postglacial fauna of a black shale. © 2010 September Geological Society of South Africa. Articl...|$|E
40|$|The Rekunian Series is {{proposed}} {{for part of}} the Late Palaeozoic (Stephanian- Kazanian Stages) of Tasmania. It is divided into four stages which are, in ascending order, the Hellyerian, the Tamarian, the Bernacchian and the Lymingtonian. The Epoch embraces the well-developed Tasmanian expression of the climax and retreat of the Gondwanan Late Palaeozoic glaciation, and witnesses the appearance and most prolonged development of the characteristic marine cold-water Eurydesma fauna anywhere in the world. The Hellyerian Stage, which is represented wholly by thick tillite, glaciolacustrine rhythmite clay and other glacigene rocks, is sparsely fossiliferous, but the available evidence indicates that it pre-dates the appearance of both Eurydesma and Glossopteris. The Tamarian, Bernacchian and Lymingtonian Stages are mostly represented by shallow-water marine deposits in which glacially derived dropstones are frequently abundant, but subordinate glacigene strata, coal measures and other freshwater rocks are also present. The basis for stage recognition rests essentially with the nature of successive marine macro-invertebrate assemblages which constitute the Eurydesma fauna, and partly, but much less importantly, with broad lithological considerations. Subsidiary microfloral data are used to supplement and complement the macrofaunal information. General <b>lithological</b> <b>characters,</b> the low to very low taxonomic diversity of faunas and floras, and palaeomagnetic data (Irving 1966). which indicate a position close to the south magnetic pole for Tasmania during Permo-Carboniferous times all consistently point to cool or cold conditions throughout the Rekunian Epoch...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} focused on {{investigating}} the impact of geological setting on the groundwater occurrences of the Lower Cretaceous sandstone aquifer (Malha). The Lower Cretaceous sandstone aquifer is subdivided into 3 units according to their <b>lithological</b> <b>characters</b> {{for the first time}} in this present work. The study area is dissected by normal faults with their downthrown sides due north direction. The groundwater flows from southeast recharge area (outcrop) to the northwest direction with an average hydraulic gradient of 0. 0035. The hydraulic parameters of the Lower Cretaceous sandstone aquifer were determined and evaluated through 7 pumping tests carried out on productive wells. The Lower Cretaceous aquifer in the study area is characterized by moderate to high potential. The calculated groundwater volume of the Lower Cretaceous aquifer (6300 km 2) in the study area attains about 300 bcm, while the estimated recharge to the same aquifer reaches about 44, 500 m 3 /day with an annual recharge of 16 mcm/year. Expended Durov diagram plot revealed that the groundwater has been evolved from Mg-SO 4 and Mg-Cl dissolution area types that eventually reached a final stage of evolution represented by a Na-Cl water type. This diagram helps also in identifying groundwater flow direction. The groundwater salinity ranges from 1082 ppm (Shaira) to 1719 ppm (Nakhl), in the direction of groundwater movement towards north...|$|R

40|$|Terrestrial analog {{studies are}} a {{critical}} component for furthering our understanding of geologic processes on the Moon, near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), and the moons of Mars. Carefully chosen analog sites provide a unique natural laboratory with high relevance to the associated science on these solar system target bodies. Volcanism and impact cratering are fundamental processes on the Moon, NEAs, and Phobos and Deimos. The terrestrial volcanic and impact records remain invaluable for our understanding of these processes throughout our solar system, since these are our primary source of firsthand knowledge on volcanic landform formation and modification {{as well as the}} three-dimensional structural and <b>lithological</b> <b>character</b> of impact craters. Regarding impact cratering, terrestrial fieldwork can help us to understand the origin and emplacement of impactites, the history of impact bombardment in the inner Solar System, the formation of complex impact craters, and the effects of shock on planetary materials. Volcanism is another dominant geologic process that has significantly shaped the surface of planetary bodies and many asteroids. Through terrestrial field investigations we can study the processes, geomorphic features and rock types related to fissure eruptions, volcanic constructs, lava tubes, flows and pyroclastic deposits. Also, terrestrial analog studies have the advantage of enabling simultaneous robotic and/or human exploration testing in a low cost, low risk, high fidelity environment to test technologies and concepts of operations for future missions to the target bodies. Of particular interest is the importance and role of robotic precursor missions prior to human operations for which there is little to no actual mission experience to draw upon. Also critical to understanding new worlds is sample return, and analog studies enable us to develop the appropriate procedures for collecting samples in a manner that will best achieve the science objectives...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} factor in understanding the development of active continental margins is knowledge of the crustal basement on which magmatic arcs are built. This study reports results from a whole-rock geochemical and zircon U-Pb geochronological study of a suite of crustal xenoliths from the Bolivian Altiplano, Central Andes, that provide new insight into the evolution and composition of the continental basement beneath the region. The xenoliths are hosted in Pliocene–Pleistocene trachyandesitic to dacitic lavas that erupted from monogenetic volcanic centers in the Andean backarc region and comprise both igneous and metamorphic lithologies, including diorites, microgranites, gneisses, garnet–mica schists, granulites, quartzites, and dacites. The xenolith suite exhibits significant Sr-isotopic heterogeneity, with values extending from 0. 7105 to 0. 7368. Pb isotopic signatures reflect the crustal domains previously constrained from scattered exposures of basement rocks throughout the region. Ion microprobe U-Pb dating of cores and rims from zircon separates from two of the sampled xenoliths reveals predominant early Phanerozoic age peaks (ca. 500 Ma; population 1), late Mesoproterozoic age peaks (1. 0 – 1. 2 Ga; population 2), and Paleoproterozoic age peaks (1. 7 – 1. 9 Ga; population 3). Populations 1 and 2 are well documented throughout the Andes and correspond to periods of supercontinent formation (e. g., Rodinia at ca. 1. 0 Ga) and breakup. Population 3, which is poorly represented in the zircon record of the Andes as a whole, may record geological events during {{the construction of the}} Paleoproterozoic Amazonian Craton. The presence of the three age peaks in the detrital zircon population record of a single crustal xenolith demonstrates the important role of crustal recycling {{in the construction of the}} modern-day Andean margin. The <b>lithological</b> <b>character</b> of the xenoliths and their detrital zircon ages are inconsistent with current understanding of the eastern extent of the Arequipa-Antofalla basement block beneath the Bolivian Altiplano and instead indicate that it terminates further to the west than previously assumed...|$|E
40|$|Faunal {{samples were}} {{collected}} from nine localities throughout the area (see map, fig. 38). The exposures examined mainly comprise variable, yet broadly similar mudstones and siltstones in which small pebbles sometimes occur. The pebbles are usually rare, but occasionally they are sufficiently numerous to form bhin, discontinuous bands. The faunas are essentially indigenous with beds of strophalosiids and both fenestillid and trepostome bryozoa, often in growth positions. Gastropods and more or less complete spiriferids are scattered throughout. more especially at localities 2. 5 and 6. Numerous lamellibranchs, often with the two valves still in articulation. together with abundant ostracods SUggest very quiet. perhaps restricted lagoonal sedimentation. Rare thin bands of detrital siltstone and sandstone which are markedly pebbly and gritty in places also occur, notably a. t localities 3, 4. 7 and 8. In these, broken and rolled bryozoan colonies and other shelly debris are clear evidence of reworking. The broad similarity of <b>lithological</b> <b>character</b> and faunal phase reflects a persistent environment of sedimentation. The persistence of a given sedimentary environment tends to mask what elsewhere are stated to be palaeontological differences. In the more varied HthololJlical sequences of some other parts of southern Tasmania where calcareous intercalations occur (the Darlington and Berriedale Limestones). faunal differences are more readily apparent: but they are in all probability the effect of phasal and not chronological criteria. Thus it 1 s necessary to consider {{the character of a}} group (or groups) of fossils at various intervals throughout the succession. rather chan attempt a comparison of the total assemblages with t hose of a different phase elsewhere. In this respect. the strophalosiids. and to a lesser extent. the spiriferids. are the most important. On this basis the localities can be divided into two groups:-(1) A lower horizon at locality I which yields a Strophalosia similar to, but not identical with. Strophalosia preovalis Maxwell. (2) The remaining localities which yield forms offering comparison with Strophalosia jukesi (Etheridge) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The present {{paper is}} {{the first of a series}} of three, focused on the results of the {{integrated}} magnetic susceptibility and lithological studies carried out in several lacustrine areas of the Danube Delta, the Razim (Razelm) - Sinoie lagoonal Complex and the Black Sea Littoral Zone. Enviromagnetic fingerprints are recovered from the bottom sediments sampled in dynamic and confined aquatic environments and their intensities are evaluated and compared. Distinguishing features identified between different lakes are clearly reflected by the investigated enviromagnetic parameter (MS). The connection between the MS regime recorded within the lake sediments and the ternary diagrams showing their lithological classification (i. e. mineral-siliciclastic fraction, carbonate fraction and organic matter) is discussed, as well. Besides, several composite models illustrate the correlations between the k values and the main lithological components (i. e. organic/TOC, carbonate/CAR and mineral- iliciclastic/SIL, respectively). On the basis of the magneto-lithological data base obtained for the lake sediments sampled in the 2006 cruises, several correlation coefficients (r) were calculated, e. g. related to k vs TOC, k vs CAR, k vs (TOC+CAR) and k vs SIL. The graphical correlation is also taken into consideration to show and interpret the connection between the enviromagnetic parameter and the <b>lithological</b> <b>characters.</b> Generally, positive (direct) correlations characterise the magnetic susceptibility (MS) vs mineral component (SIL), whereas negative (reverse) correlations define MS vs TOC, as well as MS vs (TOC+CAR). The modern sediments sampled in various deltaic environments stand for high fidelity enviromagnetic archives, which are deciphered within the presented case studies...|$|R
30|$|The area {{chosen for}} the present study is Dhule {{district}}, which belongs to the drought prone area of Maharashtra State, India. Dhule district suffers from water problem, and therefore, there is no extra water available to supply for the agricultural and industrial growth. To understand the <b>lithological</b> <b>characters</b> in terms of its hydro-geological conditions, it is necessary to understand the geology of the area. It is now established fact that the geophysical method gives a better information of subsurface geology. Geophysical electrical surveys with four electrodes configuration, i.e., Wenner and Schlumberger method, were carried out at the same selected sites to observe the similarity and compared both the applications in terms of its use and handling in the field. A total 54 VES soundings were carried out spread over the Dhule district and representing different lithological units. The VES curves are drawn using inverse slope method for Wenner configuration, IPI 2 win Software, and curve matching techniques were used for Schlumberger configuration. Regionwise lithologs are prepared based on the obtained resistivity and thickness for Wenner method. Regionwise curves were prepared based on resistivity layers for Schlumberger method. Comparing the two methods, it is observed that Wenner and Schlumberger methods have merits or demerits. Considering merits and demerits from the field point of view, it is suggested that Wenner inverse slope method is more handy for calculation and interpretation, but requires lateral length which is a constrain. Similarly, Schlumberger method is easy in application but unwieldy for their interpretation. The work amply proves the applicability of geophysical techniques in the water resource evaluation procedure. This technique is found to be suitable for the areas with similar geological setup elsewhere.|$|R
60|$|Along each shore {{which is}} being worn away by the waves, there are being formed mud, sand, and pebbles. This {{detritus}} has, in each locality, {{a more or less}} special character; determined {{by the nature of the}} strata destroyed. In the English Channel it is not the same as in the Irish Channel; on the east coast of Ireland it is not the same as on the west coast; and so throughout. At the mouth of each great river, there is being deposited sediment differing more or less from that deposited at the mouths of other rivers in colour and quality; forming strata which are here red, there yellow, and elsewhere brown, grey, or dirty white. Besides which various formations, going on in deltas and along shores, there are some much wider, and still more strongly contrasted, formations. At the bottom of the Ægean Sea, there is accumulating a bed of Pteropod shells, which will eventually, no doubt, become a calcareous rock. For some hundreds of thousands of square miles, the ocean-bed between Great Britain and North America, is being covered with a stratum of chalk; and over large areas in the Pacific, there are going on deposits of coralline limestone. Thus, there are at this moment being produced in different places multitudinous strata differing from one another in <b>lithological</b> <b>characters.</b> Name at random any part of the sea-bottom, and ask whether the deposit there taking place is like the deposit taking place at some distant part of the sea-bottom, and the almost-certainly correct answer will be--No. The chances are not in favour of similarity, but against it--many to one against it.|$|R
