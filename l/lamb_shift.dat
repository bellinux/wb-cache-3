5|$|A major talking {{point at}} the conference was the {{discovery}} by Willis Lamb and his graduate student Robert Retherford shortly before the conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift.</b> Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED) gave absurd, infinite values for this; but the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift</b> showed that it was both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} theory {{increased}} {{through the end of}} the 1940s. Improvements in microwave technology made it possible to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a hydrogen atom, now known as the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift</b> and magnetic moment of the electron. These experiments exposed discrepancies which the theory was unable to explain.|$|E
25|$|This model {{leads to}} {{essentially}} {{the same type of}} Bethe logarithm {{an essential part of the}} <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift</b> calculation vindicating Jaynes' claim that two different physical models can be mathematically isomorphic to each other and therefore yield the same results, a point also apparently made by Scott and Moore on the issue of causality.|$|E

40|$|The wave {{behavior}} of the hydrogen atom, as the paired proton-electron system, shows itself in vibrations {{of the center of}} mass and an atomic spherical shell. These vibrations superimpose on electron’s motion resulted in the magnetic moment anomaly of the electron and in an appearance of the background spectrum which defines, as turned out, Lamb “shifts ” of optical spectral lines. The anomalous magnetic moment of the electron is relatively simple calculated {{on the basis of the}} approach, which takes into account an influence of the inherent vibrations. The value obtained coincides quite precisely with the experimental data, like in the case of <b>Lamb</b> <b>shifts.</b> Thus, with allowance for the wave {{behavior of}} a proton and an electron, we arrive not only at the simple description of the anomalous magnetic moment, but also at the discoveries of the background spectrum of the hydrogen atom and the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shifts</b> nature...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{protection}} of subradiant states by the symmetry of the atomic distributions in the Dicke limit, in which collective <b>Lamb</b> <b>shifts</b> cannot be neglected. We find that anti-symmetric states are subradiant states for distributions with reflection symmetry. Continuous symmetry {{can also be used}} to achieve subradiance. This study is relevant to the problem of robust quantum memory with long storage time and fast readout. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{prediction}} of quantum electrodynamics which has been verified experimentally is the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift.</b> This refers to an effect whereby the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field causes the energy levels in an atom or ion to deviate slightly from what they would otherwise be. As a result, spectral lines may shift or split.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the main}} {{drawback}} {{of the theory}} {{turned out to be the}} result that particles are not self-interacting. Indeed, as demonstrated by Hans Bethe, the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift</b> necessitated a self-energy term to be explained. Feynman and Bethe had an intense discussion over that issue, and eventually Feynman himself stated that self-interaction is needed to correctly account for this effect.|$|E
25|$|Atoms of {{different}} elements have distinct spectra and therefore atomic spectroscopy {{allows for the}} identification and quantitation of a sample's elemental composition. Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered new elements by observing their emission spectra. Atomic absorption lines are observed in the solar spectrum and referred to as Fraunhofer lines after their discoverer. A comprehensive explanation of the hydrogen spectrum was an early success of quantum mechanics and explained the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift</b> observed in the hydrogen spectrum, which further {{led to the development}} of quantum electrodynamics.|$|E

25|$|Weisskopf and French (FW) {{were the}} first to obtain the correct result for the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift</b> and the {{anomalous}} magnetic moment of the electron. At first FW results did not agree with the incorrect but independent results of Feynman and Schwinger. The 1963–1964 lectures Dirac gave on quantum field theory at Yeshiva University were published in 1966 as the Belfer Graduate School of Science, Monograph Series Number, 3. After having relocated to Florida to be near his elder daughter, Mary, Dirac spent his last fourteen years (of both life and physics research) at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, and Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida.|$|E
25|$|This {{leads to}} the second question. Divergent or not, finite or infinite, is the zero-point energy of any {{physical}} significance? The ignoring of the whole zero-point energy is often encouraged for all practical calculations. The {{reason for this is}} that energies are not typically defined by an arbitrary data point, but rather changes in data points, so adding or subtracting a constant (even if infinite) should to be allowed. However this is not the whole story, in reality energy is not so arbitrarily defined: in general relativity the seat of the curvature of spacetime is the energy content and there the absolute amount of energy has real physical meaning. There is no such thing as an arbitrary additive constant with density of field energy. Energy density curves space, and an increase in energy density produces an increase of curvature. Furthermore, the zero-point energy density has other physical consequences e.g. the Casimir effect, contribution to the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift,</b> or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, it is clear it is not just a mathematical constant or artifact that can be cancelled out.|$|E
500|$|In {{technical}} terms, QED can {{be described}} as a perturbation theory of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum. [...] Richard Feynman called it [...] "the jewel of physics" [...] for its extremely accurate predictions of quantities like the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift</b> of the energy levels of hydrogen.|$|E
40|$|We use an {{improved}} {{version of the}} standard effective mass approximation model to describe quantum effects in nanometric semiconductor Quantum Dots (QDs). This allows analytic computation of relevant quantities to a very large extent. We obtain, {{as a function of}} the QD radius, in precise domains of validity, the QD excitonic ground state energy and its Stark and <b>Lamb</b> <b>shifts.</b> Finally, the Purcell effect in QDs is shown to lead to potential QD-LASER emitting in the range of visible light...|$|R
40|$|There are {{considered}} some corollaries of certain hypotheses on the observation process of microphenomena. We show that an {{enlargement of the}} phase space and of its motion group and an account for the diffusion motions of microsystems in the enlarged space, the motions which act by small random translations along the enlarged group, lead to observable quantum effects. This approach enables one to recover probability distributions in the phase space for wave functions.

40|$|We {{solve for}} the exact atom-field eigenstates {{of a single}} atom in a three {{dimensional}} spherical cavity, by mapping the problem onto the anisotropic Kondo model. The spectrum has a rich bound state structure in comparison with models where the rotating wave approximation is made. It is shown how to obtain the Jaynes-Cummings model states {{in the limit of}} weak coupling. Non-perturbative <b>Lamb</b> <b>shifts</b> and decay rates are computed.

500|$|This {{concept is}} applied in key {{predictions}} of quantum electrodynamics (QED, see above). In that theory, {{the mass of}} electrons (or, more generally, leptons) is modified by including the mass contributions of virtual photons, in a technique known as renormalization. Such [...] "radiative corrections" [...] contribute {{to a number of}} predictions of QED, such as the magnetic dipole moment of leptons, the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift,</b> and the hyperfine structure of bound lepton pairs, such as muonium and positronium.|$|E
500|$|The {{apparent}} paradox (mentioned {{above in}} the properties subsection) {{of a point}} particle electron having intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic moment {{can be explained by}} the formation of virtual photons in the electric field generated by the electron. These photons cause the electron to shift about in a jittery fashion (known as zitterbewegung), which results in a net circular motion with precession. This motion produces both the spin and the magnetic moment of the electron. [...] In atoms, this creation of virtual photons explains the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift</b> observed in spectral lines.|$|E
500|$|In 1947 Willis Lamb, {{working in}} {{collaboration}} with graduate student Robert Retherford, found that certain quantum states of the hydrogen atom, which {{should have the same}} energy, were shifted in relation to each other, the difference came to be called the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift.</b> About the same time, Polykarp Kusch, working with Henry M. Foley, discovered the magnetic moment of the electron is slightly larger than predicted by Dirac's theory. This small difference was later called anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron.

We show that the calculated Green function has a characteristic cross-like shape, spatially modulated due to structure discreteness.

500|$|Oppenheimer {{also made}} {{important}} {{contributions to the}} theory of cosmic ray showers and started work that eventually led to descriptions of quantum tunneling. In 1931 he co-wrote a paper on the [...] "Relativistic Theory of the Photoelectric Effect" [...] with his student Harvey Hall, in which, based on empirical evidence, he correctly disputed Dirac's assertion that two of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom have the same energy. Subsequently, one of his doctoral students, Willis Lamb, determined that this was a consequence of {{what became known as the}} <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift,</b> for which Lamb was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1955.|$|E
500|$|Feynman was not {{the only}} {{frustrated}} theoretical physicist in the early post-war years. Quantum electrodynamics suffered from infinite integrals in perturbation theory. These were clear mathematical flaws in the theory, which Feynman and Wheeler had unsuccessfully attempted to work around. [...] "Theoreticians", noted Murray Gell-Mann, [...] "were in disgrace." [...] In June 1947, leading American physicists met at the Shelter Island Conference. For Feynman, it was his [...] "first big conference with big men... I had never gone to one like this one in peacetime." [...] The problems plaguing quantum electrodynamics were discussed, but the theoreticians were completely overshadowed by the achievements of the experimentalists, who reported the discovery of the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift,</b> the measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron, and Robert Marshak's two-meson hypothesis.|$|E
500|$|Bethe {{took the}} lead {{from the work of}} Hans Kramers, and derived a renormalized non-relativistic quantum {{equation}} for the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift.</b> The next step was to create a relativistic version. Feynman thought that he could do this, but when he went back to Bethe with his solution, it did not converge. Feynman carefully worked through the problem again, applying the path integral formulation that he had used in his thesis. Like Bethe, he made the integral finite by applying a cut-off term. The result corresponded to Bethe's version. Feynman presented his work to his peers at the Pocono Conference in 1948. It did not go well. Julian Schwinger gave a long presentation of his work in quantum electrodynamics, and Feynman then offered his version, titled [...] "Alternative Formulation of Quantum Electrodynamics". The unfamiliar Feynman diagrams, used for the first time, puzzled the audience. Feynman failed to get his point across, and Paul Dirac, Edward Teller and Niels Bohr all raised objections.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the quantization of the vector potential amplitude {{of the electromagnetic}} field to a single photon state starting from the fundamental link equations between the classical electromagnetic theory and the quantum mechanical expressions. The resulting wave-particle formalism ensures a coherent transition between the classical electromagnetic wave theory and the quantum representation. A quantization constant of the photon vector potential is defined. A new quantum vacuum description results directly in having very low energy density. The calculated spontaneous emission rate and <b>Lambs</b> <b>shift</b> for the nS states of the hydrogen atom are in agreement with quantum electrodynamics. This low energy quantum vacuum state might be compatible with recent astrophysical observations...|$|R
40|$|Atoms {{coupled to}} optical fields {{strongly}} confined in two spatial dimensions, as in solid-state microstructures, can experience large <b>Lamb</b> <b>shifts</b> {{due to a}} spectrally strongly asymmetric mode density. We use the generic example of a quasi-one-dimensional waveguide structure driven close to cutoff frequency of a new transverse branch of propagating modes. We analytically find strong shifts of the atomic resonance frequency due to the modified vacuum, which can be {{an order of magnitude}} larger than the atomic linewidth. At the same time one gets significantly enhanced scattering of the guided light by the atom, which {{could be used as a}} tool to investigate these effects or to build non-destructive single-atom detectors...|$|R
40|$|The divergences {{problem in}} QFT should be overcame presumably {{due to the}} {{unification}} of the fundamental interactions [1]. We evidently cannot {{to achieve this goal}} now. Together with this there are divergences in problems where the highenergy processes simply cannot be involved (say electron self-energy, <b>Lamb’s</b> <b>shift,</b> etc.). Last ones reflect the formal character of perturbation theory applied to interacting secondly quantized amplitudes of the pointwise particles. These difficulties are borrowed partly from the classical theory. I would like to establish some general framework for the future unified theory avoiding to use the method of classical analogy.

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, {{a serious}} criticism against the absorber {{theory is that}} its Machian assumption that point particles do not act on themselves does not allow (infinite) self-energies and consequently {{an explanation for the}} <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift</b> according to quantum electrodynamics (QED). Ed Jaynes proposed an alternate model where the Lamb-like shift is due instead to the interaction with other particles very much along the same notions of the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory itself. One simple model is to calculate the motion of an oscillator coupled directly with many other oscillators. Jaynes has shown that it is easy to get both spontaneous emission and <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift</b> behavior in classical mechanics. [...] Furthermore, Jayne's alternatives provides a solution to the process of [...] "addition and subtraction of infinities" [...] associated with renormalization.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1940s {{improvements}} in microwave technology {{made it possible}} to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a hydrogen atom, now known as the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift,</b> and measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron. Discrepancies between these experiments and Dirac's theory led to the idea of incorporating renormalisation into QED to deal with zero-point infinities. Renormalization was originally developed by Hans Kramers and also Victor Weisskopf(1936), and first successfully applied to calculate a finite value for the <b>Lamb</b> <b>shift</b> by Hans Bethe (1947). As per spontaneous emission, these effects can in part be understood with interactions with the zero-point field. But in light of renormalisation being able to remove some zero-point infinities from calculations, not all physicists were comfortable attributing zero-point energy any physical meaning, viewing it instead as a mathematical artifact that might one day be fully eliminated. In Wolfgang Pauli's 1945 Nobel lecture he made clear his opposition to the idea of zero-point energy stating [...] "It is clear that this zero-point energy has no physical reality".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{from his}} once {{rejected}} notes {{he managed to}} work on putting quantum electrodynamics on [...] "logical foundations" [...] based on Hamiltonian formalism that he formulated.

We prove the existence of collective Lamb-shifts that affect the qubit-qubit interactions and the dependency of coherent and incoherent interactions on the qubit separation.
