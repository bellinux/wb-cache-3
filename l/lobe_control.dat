30|$|Exploration of hemispheric {{control of}} {{sympathetic}} response, particularly {{as it relates}} to blood pressure and overall heart rate regulation, indicates general control of sympathetic response by the right hemisphere, with parasympathetic control lateralized to the left hemisphere [13]. Taking into account, right hemispheric dominance for sympathetic response is an important component when looking at the potential for differing anger expression styles. If, as theorized, taxation of right frontal lobe resources allows for an unbridling of posteriorly located neural regions, it is presumed that tasks which are directed toward the right hemisphere would result in greater activation of the sympathetic response. Similarly, if anger suppression via right frontal <b>lobe</b> <b>control</b> exhausts right frontal lobe resources, consequent release of sympathetic control is expected to result in increased variability within heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe frontal <b>lobe</b> <b>control</b> of {{movement}} in mammals has been {{thought to be a}} specific function primarily related to the layered neocortex with its efferent connections. In contrast, we now show that the same basic organization is present even in one of the phylogenetically oldest vertebrates, the lamprey. ResultsStimulation of specific sites in the pallium/cortex evokes eye, trunk, locomotor, or oral movements. The pallial projection neurons target brainstem motor centers and basal ganglia subnuclei and have prominent dendrites extending into the outer molecular layer. They exhibit the characteristic features of pyramidal neurons and elicit monosynaptic glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials in output neurons of the optic tectum, reticulospinal neurons, and, as shown earlier, basal ganglia neurons. ConclusionsOur results demonstrate marked similarities in the efferent functional connectivity and control of motor behavior between the lamprey pallium and mammalian neocortex. Thus, the lamprey motor pallium/cortex represents an evolutionary blueprint of the corresponding mammalian system...|$|E
40|$|Background: Left {{posterior}} {{middle temporal gyrus}} (pMTG) is reliably activated in functional neuroimaging {{studies of}} semantic processing and is frequently damaged in patients with comprehension impairments following stroke (e. g., Wernicke's aphasia). Its precise function remains elusive, however. Some researchers take the view that pMTG is a multimodal semantic area, involved in verbal and non-verbal semantic cognition. Others ascribe a lexical-semantic function to the region, positing that it is involved in mapping between phonology and conceptual knowledge. Aims: We investigated whether pMTG was involved in non-verbal as well as verbal semantic cognition by using rTMS to induce temporary, focal “virtual lesions” to this region in healthy participants. Methods & Procedures: Participants completed picture and word versions of a semantic association test before and after receiving 10 minutes of 1 -Hz offline rTMS to left pMTG. They also completed a difficulty-matched visual decision task on scrambled pictures. An occipital <b>lobe</b> <b>control</b> site was stimulated in a separate session. Outcomes & Results: TMS slowed responses to word and picture versions of the test to an equal degree. There was no slowing on a non-semantic visual-matching task, or following TMS to the control site. Conclusions: These results indicate that pMTG is involved in both verbal and non-verbal semantic cognition. This region could be key to understanding the multimodal semantic deficits often observed following stroke...|$|E

The current experiment examined frontal lobe regulatory control of glucose in high and low hostile men with concurrent left frontal <b>lobe</b> (<b>Control</b> Oral Word Association Test [verbal]) or right frontal lobe (Ruff Figural Fluency Test [nonverbal]) stress. A significant interaction was found for Group × Condition, F (1, 22) =  4.16, p ≤ . 05 with glucose levels (mg/dl) of high hostile men significantly elevated {{as a function of}} the right frontal stressor (M =  101.37, SD =  13.75) when compared to the verbal stressor (M =  95.79, SD =  11.20). Glucose levels in the low hostile group remained stable for both types of stress. High hostile men made significantly more errors on the right frontal but not the left frontal stressor (M =  17.18, SD =  19.88) when compared to the low hostile men (M =  5.81, SD =  4.33).

However, relatively few studies have directly measured brain glutamate in ASD adults, or related variation in glutamate to clinical phenotype. We therefore set out to investigate brain glutamate levels in adults with an ASD, comparing these to healthy controls and also comparing results between individuals at different points on the spectrum of symptom severity. We recruited 28 adults with ASD and 14 matched healthy controls. Of those with ASD, 15 fulfilled the 'narrowly' defined criteria for typical autism, whereas 13 met the 'broader phenotype'. We measured the concentration of the combined glutamate and glutamine signal (Glx), and other important metabolites, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in two brain regions implicated in ASD [...] the basal ganglia (including the head of caudate and the anterior putamen) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [...] {{as well as in}} a parietal cortex 'control' region. Individuals with ASD had a significant decrease (P< 0. 001) in concentration of Glx in the basal ganglia, and this was true in both the 'narrow' and 'broader' phenotype. Also, within the ASD sample, reduced basal ganglia Glx was significantly correlated with increased impairment in social communication (P= 0. 013). In addition, there was a significant reduction in the concentration of other metabolites such as choline, creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the basal ganglia. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Cr and NAA were reduced (P< 0. 05), although Glx was not. There were no detectable differences in Glx, or any other metabolite, in the parietal <b>lobe</b> <b>control</b> region. There were no significant between-group differences in age, gender, IQ, voxel composition or data quality. In conclusion, individuals across the spectrum of ASD have regionally specific abnormalities in subcortical glutamatergic neurotransmission that are associated with variation in social development...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe frontal <b>lobes</b> <b>control</b> wide-ranging {{cognitive}} functions; however, functional subdivisions {{of human}} frontal cortex are only coarsely mapped. Here, functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} reveals two distinct visual-biased attention regions in lateral frontal cortex, superior precentral sulcus (sPCS) and inferior precentral sulcus (iPCS), anatomically interdigitated with two auditory-biased attention regions, transverse gyrus intersecting precentral sulcus (tgPCS) and caudal inferior frontal sulcus (cIFS). Intrinsic functional connectivity analysis demonstrates that sPCS and iPCS fall within a broad visual-attention network, while tgPCS and cIFS fall within a broad auditory-attention network. Interestingly, we observe that spatial and temporal short-term memory (STM), respectively, recruit visual and auditory attention networks in the frontal lobe, independent of sensory modality. These findings not only demonstrate that both sensory modality and information domain influence frontal lobe functional organization, they also demonstrate that spatial processing co-localizes with visual processing and that temporal processing co-localizes with auditory processing in lateral frontal cortex...|$|R

5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal <b>lobe</b> are to <b>control</b> attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>controls</b> auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|R
40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between action and emotion? People tend to perform approach actions with their dominant hand and avoidance actions with their nondominant hand. In righthanders, the left frontal <b>lobe</b> (which <b>controls</b> the dominant hand) is specialized for approach-motivational states, and the right frontal <b>lobe</b> (which <b>controls</b> the nondominant hand) for avoidance-motivational states. Are brain areas that support affective motivation functionally related to areas that support approach- and avoidance-related motor actions? If so, hemispheric specialization for motivation should covary with hemispheric specialization for motor control. Here we tested this prediction, using electroencephalography (EEG) to compare resting alpha-band power in right- and left-handers. Hemispheric asymmetries in alpha-power, which indexes neural activation, were related to Behavioral Activation System (BAS) scores, which index approach-motivational tendencies. Results show that the pattern observed in righthanders reverses in left-handers, whose right hemisphere is specialized for both approach motivation and for control of dominant-hand actions. This anatomical covariation suggests a functional link between affective motivation and motor control, and also provides information crucial for developing neural therapies for affective disorders...|$|R

40|$|Within {{systemic}} {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) patients {{can be divided into}} groups with and without central nervous system involvement, the latter being subcategorized as neuropsychiatric {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (NPSLE). While a number of research groups have investigated NPSLE, there remains a lack of consistent application of this diagnostic criteria within neuroimaging studies. Previous neuroimaging research suggests that SLE patients have reduced subcortical and regional gray matter volumes when compared to controls, and that these group differences may be driven by SLE patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms. The current study sought to compare measures of cortical thickness and subcortical structure volume between NPSLE, SLE, and healthy controls. We hypothesized that patients with NPSLE (N = 21) would have thinner cortex and reduced subcortical gray matter volumes when compared to SLE (N = 16) and control subjects (N = 21). All subjects underwent MRI examinations on a 1. 5 Tesla Siemens Sonata scanner. Anatomical reconstruction and segmentation were performed using the FreeSurfer image analysis suite. Cortical and subcortical volumes were extracted from FreeSurfer and analyzed for group differences, controlling for age. The NPSLE group exhibited decreased cortical thickness in clusters of the left frontal and parietal lobes {{as well as in the}} right parietal and occipital <b>lobes</b> compared to <b>control</b> subjects. Compared to the SLE group, the NPSLE group exhibited comparable thinning in clusters of the frontal and temporal <b>lobes.</b> <b>Controlling</b> for age, we found that between group effects for subcortical gray matter structures were significant for the thalamus (F = 3. 06, p =. 04), caudate nucleus (F = 3. 19, p =. 03), and putamen (F = 4. 82, p =. 005).
