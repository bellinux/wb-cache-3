2500|$|The 1977 models had {{numerous}} changes. Most noticeable {{was a new}} front end that AMC intended to make exclusive for the Gremlin line, consisting of independent squared headlight bezels with rounded corners and an egg-crate smile-shaped grille carrying over the rectangular parking lights of {{the previous two years}} and a new front bumper. A second [...] "American" [...] emblem was applied over the front edge of the hood on the right corner. The two-point seatbelts were replaced by fixed three-point units on both sedan models. Wagons included three-point retractable units as factory issue. The Carter RBS carburetor was discontinued leaving only the YF model on the 258 six. Two-door sedans with the manual transmissions now featured a floor-mounted gearshift with low-back fold-down individual seats, while models with automatic transmissions retained the bench seat with split folding backs and a column-mounted shifter. This also meant manual units incorporated a safety <b>lock</b> <b>lever</b> in their steering column ignition switch shared with American Rally model. The seats and door panels were slightly modified from the last year. A new [...] "American" [...] emblem with different typography was applied to glove box door.

5000|$|A magnetic-coded lock is a lock {{device that}} uses pins in {{combination}} with magnets to prevent entry by either non-matching keys by teething or magnetic polarity. Magnetic-coded locks encompass knob <b>locks,</b> cylinder <b>locks,</b> <b>lever</b> <b>locks,</b> and deadbolt locks as well as applications in other security devices.|$|R
50|$|The MAG uses ignited powder gases vented {{through a}} port in the barrel to propel a gas piston rod {{connected}} to the locking assembly (it uses a long-stroke piston system). The barrel breech is locked with a vertically tilting, downward <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> mechanism that is {{connected to the}} bolt carrier through an articulated joint. The locking shoulder and camming surfaces that guide the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> are located {{at the base of the}} receiver. The MAG uses a series of proven design concepts from other successful firearms, for example the locking mechanism is modeled on that of the Browning M1918 (BAR) automatic rifle, and the feed and trigger mechanisms are from the WWII-era MG42 universal machine gun.|$|R
5000|$|First {{manufactured}} in 1976, the Benelli B76 is a locked-breech, fixed-barrel pistol, that works {{thanks to a}} unique [...] "inertia lock" [...] system, as explained in [...] In this system, the gun has a bolt provided with ribs extending transversely to the bolt axis and adapted to engage in and disengage from corresponding mating grooves in the receiver, and a <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> that links the bolt with the slide which acts as a bolt carrier. Upon firing, while the pistol recoils in {{the hand of the}} shooter, the inertia of the slide makes it maintain its position relative to the receiver, constraining the bolt ribs' motion in the corresponding grooves via the <b>locking</b> <b>lever,</b> and so keeping the breech positively locked. As soon as the recoil movement of the pistol in the hand of the shooter slows down, the slide tends to continue its rearward movement, so retreating relative to the receiver. At that point, the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> does not force the bolt into its locking recesses any more and the bolt is free to recoil as well, pushed by the residual pressure of the gasses in the barrel with enough force to complete the shooting cycle.|$|R
2500|$|The matchlock firing {{mechanism}} {{became a}} common {{term for the}} arquebus after it {{was added to the}} firearm. Prior to the appearance of the matchlock, handguns were fired from the chest, tucked under one arm, while the other arm maneuvered a hot pricker to the touch hole to ignite the gunpowder. The matchlock changed this by adding a firing mechanism consisting of two parts, the match, and the lock. The lock mechanism held within a clamp a two to three feet long length of smoldering rope soaked in saltpeter, which was the match. Connected to the <b>lock</b> <b>lever</b> was a trigger, which lowered the match into a priming pan when pulled, igniting the priming powder, causing a flash to travel through the touch hole, also igniting the gunpowder within the barrel, and propelling the bullet out the muzzle. While matchlocks provided a crucial advantage by allowing the user to aim the firearm using both hands, it was also awkward to utilize. To avoid accidentally igniting the gunpowder the match had to be detached while loading the gun. In some instances the match would also go out, so both ends of the match were kept lit. This proved cumbersome to maneuver as both hands were required to hold the match during removal, one end in each hand. The procedure was so complex that a 1607 drill manual published by Jacob de Gheyn in the Netherlands listed 28 steps just to fire and load the gun. In 1584 the Ming general Qi Jiguang composed an 11 step song to practice the procedure in rhythm: [...] "One, clean the gun. Two pour the powder. Three tamp the powder down. Four drop the pellet. Five drive the pellet down. Six put in paper (stopper). Seven drive the paper down. Eight open the flashpan cover. Nine pour in the flash powder. Ten close the flashpan, and clamp the fuse. Eleven, listen for the signal, then open the flashpan cover. Aiming at the enemy, raise your gun and fire." [...] Reloading a gun during the 16th century took anywhere from between 20 seconds to a minute under the most ideal conditions.|$|E

It debuted in Western Europe at the 1978 Paris Motor Salon, and rapidly captured forty percent of Europe's market for four-wheel drive vehicles, making it Lada's top-selling export. Because of export demand, and higher priority for exports, domestic customers faced long waiting lists.|$|E
50|$|Railway {{interlocking}} is of British origin, where numerous patents were granted. In June 1856, John Saxby {{received the}} first patent for interlocking switches and signals.

The trigger mechanism of the early arquebus most often resembled that of a crossbow: a gently curved lever pointing backward and parallel to the stock (see illustration of Spanish arquebusier below). By the later 16th century, gunsmiths in most countries had begun to introduce the short trigger perpendicular to the stock that is familiar to modern shooters. However, the majority of French matchlock arquebuses retained the crossbow-style trigger throughout the 17th century.|$|E
50|$|The Airphibian {{took the}} {{approach}} of converting from an aircraft to a roadable vehicle by a conversion process that left aircraft sections behind during road use. The process consisted of removing a three-bladed propeller and placing it on a hook {{on the side of}} the fuselage, cranking down support casters, and disengaging <b>lock</b> <b>levers</b> connecting the flight unit to the road unit.

50|$|These little pistols were {{intended}} to be a parlor pistol and not a defensive weapon. They are designed for use with a percussion cap and lead shot, without gunpowder. There are two types of breech-pieces, about equal in frequency in existing production guns; all known prototypes have the one-piece design, which provides no cover to enclose the cap, and its <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> is quite short. The two-piece design has a cone to hold the cap, a cover providing protection from the exploding cap, and a longer lever.|$|R
50|$|The chrome-lined, four-groove, 9.27mm caliber barrel {{is pressed}} and {{pinned to the}} frame through a precision-machined ring. The 7 kg recoil spring wraps around and is guided by the barrel. The {{spring-loaded}} trigger guard is pivoted down and swung to either side on the frame, allowing removal of the slide. The front sight is integrally machined into the slide, and a 3-4 mm wide textured strip is engraved {{on top of the}} slide in order to prevent aim-disturbing glare. The rear sight is dovetailed into the slide and multiple heights are available to adjust the impact point. The extractor is of an external spring-loaded type, and features a prominent flange preventing loss if a case should rupture. The breech face is deeply recessed in order to aid in extraction and ejection reliability. The stamped sheet steel slide-lock lever has a tail serving the purpose of ejector. The one-piece, wraparound bakelite or plastic grip is reinforced with steel inserts and has a detent inside the screw bushing preventing unscrewing during firing. The sheet-metal mainspring housed inside the grip panel powers the hammer in both the main and rebound stroke, the trigger and the disconnector, while its lower end is the heel and spring of the magazine catch. The sear spring also serves another function, powering the slide <b>lock</b> <b>lever.</b> Makarov pistol parts seldom break with normal usage, and are easily serviced using few tools.|$|E

5000|$|The Prescott and Cedar Mill Pentium 4 cores, {{as well as}} the Smithfield and Presler Pentium D cores, {{used the}} LGA 775 socket. In July 2006, Intel {{released}} the desktop processor Core 2 Duo (codenamed Conroe), which also uses this socket, as does the subsequent Core 2 Quad. Intel changed from Socket 478 to LGA 775 because the new pin type offers better power distribution to the processor, allowing the front-side bus to be raised to 1600 MT/s. The 'T' in Socket T was derived from the now cancelled Tejas core, which was to replace the Prescott core. Another advantage for Intel with this newer architecture is that it is now the motherboard which has the pins, rather than the CPU, transferring the risk of pins being bent from the CPU to the motherboard.The CPU is pressed into place by a [...] "load plate", rather than human fingers directly. The installer lifts the hinged [...] "load plate", inserts the processor, closes the load plate {{over the top of the}} processor, and pushes down a <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> The pressure of the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> on the load plate clamps the processor's 775 copper contact points firmly down onto the socket's 775 pins, ensuring a good connection.
