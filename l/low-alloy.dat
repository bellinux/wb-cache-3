5|$|USS Theodore Roosevelt {{and later}} {{carriers}} have slight structural differences {{from the earlier}} Nimitz carriers such as improved protection for ordnance stored in their magazines. Other improvements include upgraded flight deck ballistic protection, first installed on USS George Washington, and the high-strength <b>low-alloy</b> steel (HSLA-100) used for constructing ships starting with USS John C. Stennis. More recently, older ships have had their flight decks upgraded with a new non-slip material fitted on new-build ships, to improve safety for both crew members and aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free <b>low-alloy</b> ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield has an {{international}} reputation for metallurgy and steel-making. Many innovations in these fields {{have been made}} in Sheffield, for example Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique in the 1740s at his workshop in Handsworth. This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter. Thomas Boulsover invented Sheffield Plate (silver-plated copper) in the early 18thcentury. Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in 1912, and the work of F. B. Pickering and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength <b>low-alloy</b> steels. Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the Advanced Manufacturing Park by Sheffield's universities and other independent research organisations. Organisations located on the AMP include the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between the Boeing Company and the University of Sheffield), Castings Technology International (CTI), The Welding Institute (TWI), and William Cook Group.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} {{for construction of}} the pontoon bridge was awarded in August 1991 to a consortium, Arbeidsfellesskapet Salhus Bru, which consisted of Norwegian Contractors, Aker Entreprenør, Veidekke and Kværner Eureka. The components were built in Moss and Fredrikstad and then shipped to Lonevågen, a branch of Osterfjorden which was suitable to connect the parts. There were problems welding the high-strength <b>low-alloy</b> steel, {{which resulted in the}} work being halted for several days before an agreement was reached between the contractor and the Public Roads Administration. On 26 January 1994, the steel frame which would be used to fasten the pontoon bridge to the cable-stayed bridge, came adrift during transport in Skagerrak, and was severely damaged, causing a delay in the project. As the bridge had the longest laterally unsupported span in the world, the construction was watched by many international delegations.|$|E

External brackets built into the bulkheads transfer the support forces to the pontoons. The girder was built in sections of 21, 36, and 42meters (69, 118, and 138ft), which were subsequently welded together into 11 modules with a skew angle of 1.2 to 1.3 degrees. The girder has a constant cross-section throughout the length, except at the anchoring points to the pontoons. The section from the land anchoring to the first pontoon is subject to the most stress, and is made with steel with a higher yield point. The inside of the girder has two dehumidifiers which ensure that it does not rust. The clearance under the girder is [...]|$|E

The newest Bombardier MPM-10 trains allow people to move between cars once on board, so that the passenger load is more evenly distributed.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Low-alloy</b> {{special purpose}} steel is a grade of tool steel {{characterized}} by its proportion of iron to other elements, the kind of elements in its composition, and its treatment during the manufacturing process. The three ASTM established grades of <b>low-alloy</b> {{special purpose steel}} are L2, L3, and L6.

50|$|Carbon steels {{which can}} {{successfully}} undergo heat-treatment have a carbon {{content in the}} range of 0.30-1.70% by weight. Trace impurities of various other elements can {{have a significant effect on}} the quality of the resulting steel. Trace amounts of sulfur in particular make the steel red-short, that is, brittle and crumbly at working temperatures. <b>Low-alloy</b> carbon steel, such as A36 grade, contains about 0.05% sulfur and melts around 1426 - 1538 C. Manganese is often added to improve the hardenability of low-carbon steels.

50|$|Spring {{steel is}} a name given {{to a wide range}} of steels used in the {{manufacture}} of springs, prominently in automotive and industrial suspension applications.

50|$|The {{addition}} of certain alloying elements, such as manganese and nickel, can stabilize the austenitic structure, facilitating heat-treatment of <b>low-alloy</b> steels. In the extreme case of austenitic stainless steel, much higher alloy content makes this structure stable even at room temperature.
