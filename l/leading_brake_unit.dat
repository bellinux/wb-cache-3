50|$|A {{hydraulically}} activated pig {{consists of}} three units (Fig. 3): a <b>brake</b> <b>unit,</b> a seal unit and the cleaning head.|$|R
3000|$|<b>Braking</b> <b>unit</b> It is used {{in order}} to {{decrease}} velocity of trains, enable deceleration, control acceleration and keep them fix when parked.|$|R
50|$|The {{undercarriage}} {{legs were}} made of heavier-gauge metals and the wheels were fitted with the twin <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> of FB Mk VIs.|$|R
50|$|A Vacuum Servo {{also known}} as a power booster or power <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> uses a vacuum to {{multiply}} the drivers pedal effort and apply that effort to the master cylinder.|$|R
2500|$|Braking: Standard finned {{aluminum}} {{drum brakes}} were again offered and were effective. The Bendix 4 piston disk <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> were available. 12" [...] x 1" [...] vented steel rotors were {{coupled with the}} cast iron caliper assemblies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{improved}} design {{incorporated a}} Continental V-12 [...] air-cooled, AVDS-1790-2 diesel engine, extending operational range to over 300 mi while reducing both refueling and servicing. Power was transmitted through a CD-850-6 cross drive transmission, a combined transmission, differential, steering, and <b>braking</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The end of train device (ETD), {{sometimes}} referred to as an EOT, flashing rear-end device (FRED) or sense and <b>braking</b> <b>unit</b> (SBU) is an electronic device mounted on the end of freight trains in lieu of a caboose. They are divided into three categories: [...] "dumb" [...] units, which only provide a visible indication of the rear of the train with a flashing red taillight; [...] "average intelligence" [...] <b>units</b> with a <b>brake</b> pipe pressure gauge; and [...] "smart" [...] units, which send back data to the crew in the locomotive via radio-based telemetry. They originated in North America, and are also used elsewhere in the world, where they may include complete End of Train Air System (ETAS) or Sense and <b>Brake</b> <b>Unit</b> (SBU) devices.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002 {{extensive}} refurbishment {{was carried}} out, involving {{replacement of the}} motor, of the hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>unit,</b> of the electronics safety systems, of the control room and of the two cars of the funicular. The railway now runs daily services, with a capacity of about 400 persons per hour.|$|R
50|$|The impact landers are {{equipped}} with flexible solar panels, located on the upper side of the inflatable <b>braking</b> <b>unit,</b> that will provide approximately 0.6 W during the day. As the provided power output is insufficient to operate all instruments simultaneously, they are activated sequentially according to the different environmental constraints.|$|R
50|$|The {{market was}} largely pioneered by Sturmey-Archer with their Dynohub of the 1930s - 1970s. This competed {{effectively}} with contemporaneous bottle dynamos and bottom-bracket generators, but the Dynohub was heavy with its steel housing and was discontinued in the 1980s. Around 2009, Sturmey-Archer released new hub dynamo/drum <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> with an aluminum housing, designated X-FDD and XL-FDD.|$|R
50|$|The front {{underhood}} compartment {{contains the}} charger, an electric air conditioner, the power steering mechanism, the power <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> (otherwise conventional), a radiator {{for the air}} conditioner, and a vacuum pump and reservoir for the power brakes and a reservoir for the windshield washer. Charger and battery liquid cooling service is performed here but is not an owner-operator service item.|$|R
5000|$|... 1 September 1886. The {{through coach}} to Huddersfield, {{conveyed}} on the 5:30 pm King's Cross to Manchester (London Road) express was detached at Penistone and placed to await collection {{by the local}} train. The MS&LR locomotive and the <b>leading</b> <b>brake</b> backed onto its train, the impact sending the six coaches, dining car and rear brake into the ticket platform. Twenty passengers were slightly injured.|$|R
30|$|OBDCS {{comprises}} a vehicle-on-board controller {{and several}} train borne equipment, such as global system for mobile communications-railway trans-receiver antenna, RFID reader, speedometer, accelerator, <b>braking</b> <b>unit,</b> driver display screen, train integrity monitor, etc. Train borne equipment collects the relevant information, such as train number, speed, location identifier, direction, etc., and periodically {{send it to}} their respective ZC. Location identifier is the location reference read by train borne RFID reader through track side RFID tags.|$|R
50|$|The SSG 2000 {{is derived}} from the Sauer 80/90 target rifle. It has a bolt action with {{rotating}} handle, but non-rotating bolt. When the handle is rotated to close the action, six lugs are driven onwards from the rear part of the bolt body to lock into the receiver. The action also features a loaded chamber indicator. The heavy barrel is hammer-forged and has a flash hider/muzzle <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> installed. The wooden stock is adjustable. The trigger is two-stage.|$|R
5000|$|Braking {{choppers}} {{some times}} {{also referred to}} as <b>braking</b> <b>unit</b> are used in the DC voltage intermediate circuits of frequency converters to control voltage when the load feeds energy back to the intermediate circuit. This arises, for example, when a magnetized motor is being rotated by an overhauling load and so functions as a generator feeding power to the DC voltage intermediate circuit.They are an application of the [...] chopper principle, using on-off control of a switching device.|$|R
40|$|The modular {{drive system}} has an electromechanical/hydromechanical drive (5) for {{generating}} a rotary input motion, and a <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> (6) for <b>braking</b> the generated rotary input motion. A gearbox is arranged in housing (1) for {{conversion of the}} rotary input motion into translational output movement. The housing is equipped with input flange surface (2 - 1) attached to electromechanical/hydromechanical drive, and output flange surface (3 - 1) attached to shaping machine. An independent claim is included for a shaping machine...|$|R
50|$|The <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> {{ensures that}} the travel speed of the pig is much slower than the fluid velocity, thus {{allowing}} it to entirely remove deposits from the pipe wall before it travels across the cleaned surface. The deposits removed are immediately flushed down the pipeline with the main jet of the cleaning head which is directed {{to the middle of}} the pipeline. With all deposits removed from the pipe wall and transported downstream by the fluid flow there remains no risk of the pig getting stuck in debris accumulated in front of it.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Brake</b> Control <b>Unit</b> (computer) detects the inputs, {{and then}} checks the wheel speed sensors to {{determine}} vehicle speed, {{and to determine}} if a wheel lockup requires the ABS algorithm.|$|R
50|$|The term 'power {{hydraulic}} brakes' {{can also}} refer to systems operating on very different principles where an engine-driven pump maintains continual hydraulic pressure {{in a central}} accumulator. The driver's brake pedal simply controls a valve to bleed pressure into the <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> at the wheels, rather than actually creating the pressure in a master cylinder by depressing a piston. This form of brake is analogous to an air brake system but with hydraulic fluid as the working medium rather than air. However, on an air brake air is vented from the system when the brakes are released and the reserve of compressed air must be replenished. On a power hydraulic brake system fluid at low pressure is returned from the <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> at the wheels to the engine-driven pump as the brakes are released, so the central pressure accumulator is almost instantly re-pressurised. This makes the power hydraulic system highly suitable for vehicles that must frequently stop and start (such as buses in cities). The continually circulating fluid also removes problems with freezing parts and collected water vapour that can afflict air systems in cold climates. The AEC Routemaster bus is a well-known application of power hydraulic brakes and the successive generations of Citroen cars with hydropneumatic suspension also used fully powered hydraulic brakes rather than conventional automotive brake systems.|$|R
50|$|All {{units have}} {{openings}} {{that allow the}} entire fluid flow through the pipeline to bypass. The <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> ensures that a hydraulically activated pig is held back against the fluid flow in the pipeline. The fluid pushes against the following seal unit, which channels it into the openings of the cleaning head. The seal unit and cleaning head restrict the flow, resulting in a pressure difference across the pig. Thus, the fluid is accelerated in the cleaning head's nozzles, creating extremely powerful liquid jets. These jets are directed onto the pipe inner wall to remove any kind of deposits.|$|R
50|$|Long {{delays in}} the {{production}} of the prototype meant that the <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> had to be stored for an extended period before being installed. The change from oil to water-glycol mix required the cylinders to be covered internally with an anti-corrosion coating, which broke down during storage. In testing the cylinders repeatedly failed, and the loss of pressure caused the train to take nearly as long to slow from 25 mph to a standstill as it did to slow from 125 mph to 25 mph. During commissioning, because of this and other development issues, every axle on the trains was modified and exchanged.|$|R
5000|$|Braking: Standard finned {{aluminum}} {{drum brakes}} were again offered and were effective. The Bendix 4 piston disk <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> were available. 12" [...] x 1" [...] vented steel rotors were {{coupled with the}} cast iron caliper assemblies.Exhaust: Dual exhaust was available as an option.Rear Axle Ratios: 2.56 Economy as well as 2.73, 3.08, 3.23:1 gear ratios were available. The special PX-Code [...] "AC Delete" [...] 3.91 performance gear option was available.Performance: 1/4 mile road course completed in 15.5 seconds at a terminal velocity of 90 mi/h km/h was achieved with the dual exhaust and 2.73 gear ratio in a 4700 lb Custom Convertible.|$|R
5000|$|The 2010-2012 {{production}} ActiveHybrid 7 {{uses the}} engine from 750i plus {{an electric motor}} rated [...] and 210 Nm torque. The electric motor is integrated into the transmission housing, replacing alternator and starter. The battery is a lithium-ion type and located under the boot floor. Other features include auto start stop and an 8-speed automatic transmission. The hybrid system {{was based on the}} 2-mode hybrid from Daimler AG. The regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>unit</b> includes 12V Absorbent Glass Mat batteries, running in parallel to 120V electrical network for electric motor. BMW claims it improved fuel consumption and reduced emissions by 15% over the non-hybrid model.|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "dumb" [...] ETD can be {{as simple}} as a red flag {{attached}} to the coupler on the last car of the train, whereas [...] "smart" [...] devices monitor functions such as brake line pressure and accidental separation of the train using a motion sensor, functions that were previously monitored by a crew in the caboose. The ETD transmits data via a telemetry link to the Head-of-Train Device (HTD) in the locomotive, known colloquially among railroaders as a [...] "Wilma," [...] a play on the first name of the wife of cartoon character Fred Flintstone. In Canada, this device is known as a sense and <b>braking</b> <b>unit</b> (SBU).|$|R
50|$|The {{most serious}} {{accident}} {{in the history of}} the line occurred on 3 June 1884 when the 4.33pm Salisbury-Weymouth train detached from the engine and derailed about 1 and a quarter miles south of Downton. 41 people were injured and 4 died. Three of these drowned after a carriage overturned into a drainage ditch. The LSWR Locomotive Superintendent, William Adams, claimed that the crash had been caused by a broken coupling between the <b>leading</b> <b>brake</b> van and the first carriage. However the subsequent Board of Trade inquiry, led by Colonel JH Rich, rejected this theory. Colonel Rich stated that the cause was inferior passenger rolling stock travelling too fast over a track not designed for that speed.|$|R

5000|$|Silicone based fluid is more {{compressible}} than glycol based fluid, <b>leading</b> to <b>brakes</b> with a spongy feeling. [...] It {{can potentially}} suffer phase separation/water pooling and freezing/boiling {{in the system}} over time - the main reason single phase hygroscopic fluids are used.|$|R
25|$|The Skeeter {{possessed a}} {{relatively}} conventional configuration for a helicopter, being {{powered by a}} single piston engine which drove a 29-foot (8.84metre) three-bladed main rotor and a three-bladed anti-torque rotor, which was mounted {{at the end of}} a triangular-section tailboom. The main rotor-blades made used of a composite construction, utilising a steel-tube spar that was bonded to wooden veneers, formers, and ribs, as well as brass balance-weights; these reportedly delivered a cost-effective and relatively simplistic rotor blade that also possessed favourable fatigue properties. Saunders-Roe also developed a replacement metal light alloy rotor blade that possessed superior aerodynamic properties and provided increased performance. A fixed tricycle undercarriage arrangement, complete with interchangeable wheels and <b>brake</b> <b>units,</b> was also present.|$|R
50|$|From the {{pressure}} differential valve, brake tubing carries {{the pressure}} to the <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> at the wheels. Since the wheels do not maintain a fixed relation to the automobile, {{it is necessary to}} use hydraulic brake hose {{from the end of the}} steel line at the vehicle frame to the caliper at the wheel. Allowing steel brake tubing to flex invites metal fatigue and, ultimately, brake failure. A common upgrade is to replace the standard rubber hoses with a set which are externally reinforced with braided stainless-steel wires; these have negligible expansion under pressure and can give a firmer feel to the brake pedal with less pedal travel for a given braking effort.|$|R
50|$|Marimón's Maserati {{left the}} Nürburgring race {{course at the}} Breidscheid curve near the Adenauer Bridge after he lost control {{attempting}} to improve his qualifying time. He died {{at the bottom of}} a steep and treacherous incline. He was going fast on a downgrade but failed to negotiate a sharp turn at the bottom. Marimón impacted a ditch, his Maserati shearing off a tree and rolling over a number of times. He was pinned underneath the car as it came to rest on its top with the wheels spinning in the air. Marimón was given the last rites by a Catholic priest before dying a few minutes after rescue workers freed him. It was thought thathis <b>braking</b> <b>unit</b> failed.|$|R
50|$|The {{differential}} is a Salisbury 4HU {{unit with}} a hypoid spiral bevel gear. It provides final drive reduction ratios ranging from 2.88:1 to 3.54:1, {{depending upon the}} Jaguar model. The bolts that attach the differential to the subframe have small holes through their heads {{so that they can}} be safety wired to prevent them coming undone, which would otherwise be difficult to detect since they can only be accessed when the whole suspension assembly is removed from the car. A limited slip differential was standard on some models and optional on others. The first generation IRS always had the disc brakes mounted inboard, the <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> being located immediately adjacent to the differential and braking its output shafts.|$|R

2500|$|Unlike {{the dirt}} tracker, {{it came with}} brakes: a rear disc brake, and in front, a Fontana four <b>leading</b> shoe drum <b>brake,</b> which is two twin <b>leading</b> drum <b>brakes</b> paired {{side by side in}} two drums. The XRTT is the final example of a {{competition}} motorcycle with drum brakes, superseded by disc brakes on all other racing bikes due to the excessive unsprung weight added by the very large drum brake assembly. The official horsepower was never published, but estimates for the early 1972 engines were in the high [...] range, increasing to an estimated [...] or more by 2008.|$|R
