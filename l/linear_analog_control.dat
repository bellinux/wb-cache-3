40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} low-complexity and low-delay joint source-channel coding method for {{bandwidth}} compression using a hybrid digital-analog (HDA) coding/modulation {{system based on}} the recent work in [3]. Analytical optimal distortion expressions (under both matched and mismatched channel conditions) are obtained for the proposed HDA system with a <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> part for a memoryless Gaussian source and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel under the mean squared error distortion measure. We consider two HDA coding schemes, both of which employ a vector quantizer cascaded with binary phaseshift keying (BPSK) modulation in the digital part, but differ in that they use linear (resp. non-linear) coding with pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) in the analog part. We derive an optimal power allocation scheme for the system with <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> coding and present performance comparisons with purely analog and purely digital systems, {{as well as the}} scheme in [3]. Simulation results show that, under <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> coding, the proposed scheme outperforms the scheme of [3] for medium to high channel signal-to-noise ratios (CSNRs). Furthermore, the performance of the HDA scheme with the <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> part is within 1 dB of the optimal distortion bound for the mismatched HDA system for high CSNRs; for the scheme with non-linear analog coding, the performance can be improved at high CSNRs.

This study therefore assessed {{the quality of life}} and perceived health of adults with congenital heart disease and compared these two measures with those reported by healthy control subjects. METHODS: Using a comparative study design, we examined quality of life and perceived health in 404 patients who were matched for age, sex, educational level, and employment status with 404 healthy counterparts. Quality of life was measured using a <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Problems and concerns relevant to patients' quality of life were assessed by the Congenital Heart Disease-TNO-AZL Adult Quality of Life scale. Perceived health was also assessed with a <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> scale. RESULTS: Patients perceived their quality of life (median <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> scale score 80; median Satisfaction with Life Scale score 28) and health status to be good (median <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> scale 80). Quality of life was significantly better in patients with congenital heart disease than in healthy peers, with a mean standardized difference of 0. 22 on the <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> scale and 0. 34 on the Satisfaction with Life Scale. No group difference was found for perceived health. Problems and concerns in adults with congenital heart disease overlapped to a large extent with those identified by control subjects. Patients reported significantly higher distress scores for 16 of 77 items, whereas control subjects perceived more distress for 20 items. CONCLUSION: Adults with congenital heart disease perceived their quality of life to be better than did their healthy counterparts.

40|$|International audienceThe basic {{principle}} of concurrent testing techniques consists in exploiting the mathematical knowledge {{available on the}} monitored system to generate a fault indicating signal (called residual). The residual express {{the difference between the}} signals coming from the actual system and the information provided by the system nominal model in the normal operation. When the mathematical model is an accurate representation of the nominal system behavior, the residual characterizes the system operating mode : close to zero in normal operation, different from zero if there is a mismatch. The goal is to detect the faults of interest and their causes early enough so that a failing of the overall system can be avoided. Residual is generated on-line by means of dedicated additional hardware into the system data flow graph. The design of integrated fault detector for on-line testing of <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> systems is discussed in this paper. The method consists in a concurrent processing of available the node voltage signals to provide a residual on-line, that carries information about the faults. Contrary to the few previous works dealing with the particular case of state variable analog systems, the method proposed here is useable without limitation for a larger class of <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> systems, even when the state variables are not available as measurable voltages. For this purpose, an algorithm providing an extended state space model for any <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> system model from its netlist description is developed and implemented. This requires a mathematical model of the circuit providing not only the classical behavioral relationships between the circuit input and its functional output, but also an appropriated modeling of the signal on any internal node. This paper deals with a symbolic modelling method, deriving an appropriated state space model from the netlist description of any <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> circuit. The proposed algorithm transforms the netlist description (Spice netlist for example) of any <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> circuit into an extendedspace state model usable for residual generation. A dead-beat observer method described uses the extended state model to generate the equations of optimal fault detector circuitry, for a large class of <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> circuit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel methodology for concurrent error detection in <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> circuits. The error-detection circuit monitors the input and some observable internal nodes of the examined circuit and generates {{an estimate of}} its output. The estimate coincides with the output in error-free operation, while {{in the presence of}} errors, it diverges. Thus, concurrent error detection is performed by comparing the two signals through an analog comparator. In essence, the error-detection circuit operates as a duplicate of the examined circuit, yet it is smaller, in general, and never exceeds the size of an actual duplicate. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on three analog filters. Index Terms—Analog test, concurrent error detection, <b>linear</b> <b>analog</b> circuits, state observation. I...|$|R
