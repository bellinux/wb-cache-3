Relying on a fixed-effects regression applied to an unbalanced panel of counties, we find that in pres-idential elections, traditional paper ballots produce the lowest rates of uncounted votes (i. e., “resid-ual votes”), followed by optically scanned ballots, mechanical <b>lever</b> <b>machines,</b> direct register electronic machines (DREs), and punch cards. In gubernatorial and senatorial races, paper, optical scan ballots, and DREs are significantly better in minimizing the residual vote rate than mechanical <b>lever</b> <b>machines</b> and punch cards.

5000|$|Electronic voting {{systems may}} use {{electronic}} ballot to store votes in computer memory. Systems which use them exclusively are called DRE voting systems. When electronic ballots are used {{there is no}} risk of exhausting the supply of ballots. Additionally, these electronic ballots remove the need for printing of paper ballots, a significant cost. When administering elections in which ballots are offered in multiple languages (in {{some areas of the}} United States, public elections are required by the National Voting Rights Act of 1965), electronic ballots can be programmed to provide ballots in multiple languages for a single machine. The advantage with respect to ballots in different languages appears to be unique to electronic voting. For example, King County, Washington's demographics require them under U.S. federal election law to provide ballot access in Chinese. With any type of paper ballot, the county has to decide how many Chinese-language ballots to print, how many to make available at each polling place, etc. Any strategy that can assure that Chinese-language ballots will be available at all polling places is certain, at the very least, to result in a significant number of wasted ballots. (The situation with <b>lever</b> <b>machines</b> would be even worse than with paper: the only apparent way to reliably meet the need would be to set up a Chinese-language <b>lever</b> <b>machine</b> at each polling place, few of which would be used at all.) ...|$|R

For the first time, a <b>lever</b> <b>machine</b> was successfully compared against deadweight machines (from PTB) at {{the high level of}} 2 MN in both tension and compression with an uncertainty in the 1 E- 4 range. Similarly, the same applies to the 55 kN machine with an uncertainty of ± 2 E- 5. For the 55 kN machine, both short-term and long-term uncertainty has been established. The machine had been the subject of an earlier comparison measurement with the PTB in the compression range. In addition, the periodic maintenance results of this 55 kN / 2. 2 MN lever deadweight force standard machine will also be discussed. To monitor the drift and stability of the force realised, a total of 5 SPRING FTS were measured according to fixed protocols over time. The lever amplification ratio was also checked at intervals using a 50 kN FTS. From an earlier maintenance check, it was discovered that there was a significant drift in the lever ratio in March 2003 (12 months after commissioning). However, the deadweight forces continued to be realised within the ± 2 E- 5 uncertainty. The lever ratio has since been adjusted back to producing loads which are magnified exactly 40 times from deadweight forces, demonstrating that it is capable of achieving ± 1 E- 4 short term uncertainty. This was confirmed by the comparison with PTB up to 2 MN in both loading directions. Subsequent measurements demonstrated that the lever ratio has been stable. The same is also true for load reproducibility and repeatability at both the deadweight and <b>lever</b> <b>machine,</b> indicating that the long-term uncertainty is now satisfactory as well. 1...|$|R

40|$|Why Paper Ballot-Optical Scan Eliminates Lines Technical details with {{calculations}} {{available for}} download here. Â New York counties will soon choose computer touchscreen/pushbutton DRE (direct recording electronic) (DRE) voting machines or paper ballot-optical scanner systems (PBOS) to replace <b>lever</b> voting <b>machines.</b> How many new voting machines will be needed? The {{answer to this}} question is critical to ensure that voting will go smoothly and that costs will be within reason. Long lines have occurred during elections using DREs in many states, 1 - 9 causing some voters to give up and go home, effectively disenfranchising them. It is prohibitively expensive to buy a large number of DREs, which makes it likely that a substantial number of voters using DREs will end up in long lines. In contrast, PBOS uses simple marking booths whose numbers can be inexpensively increased to eliminate lines and long waits. I believe that inevitable long voter waitsâ€”and consequent disenfranchisement of those who cannot waitâ€”is a fundamental and disqualifying problem for DREs. Â A New York City Board of Elections report 10 suggested that one DRE could replace each of our present <b>lever</b> <b>machines</b> and serve 277 voters in a day. They posit that each voter using a DRE with voter verified paper trail takes 3. 25 minutes. They then divide a 15 hour election day (900 minutes) by 3. 25 minutes and get 277 voters. ...|$|R

The main concern was given to minimize wasting time and decrease the cycle time. To improve the production, human interaction should be replaced or should need to be speed up. However speed up of the human has a maximum limit and it is impossible to increase more than that. So by replacing the human activity with any other method, the cycle time can be minimized.

Since the placement was not a very important factor for the unloading process (this was the end of the process and only the removal of the complete product was done) not needed image processing technology. On the other hand the longest time was taken for loading. Since the loading process cannot be automated to minimize the loading time the manual input should have to be increased.
