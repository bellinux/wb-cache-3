50|$|A {{reassurance}} marker or confirming marker {{is a type}} {{of traffic}} sign that confirms the identity of the route being traveled without necessarily providing other information such as distances traveled (as is done by highway <b>location</b> <b>markers),</b> distances to other, or upcoming intersections.

5000|$|The {{historical}} term milestone {{is still}} used today, {{even though the}} [...] "stones" [...] are typically metal highway <b>location</b> <b>markers</b> and in most countries are based on metric rather than imperial units of measure.

50|$|In the Netherlands, frequently-positioned hectometer posts {{include the}} route number, the {{distance}} in hectometers, {{and the current}} speed limit.

As well as giving the distance to or {{from one end of}} the route, these posts include the route number.|$|E

5000|$|Since coverbs precede their {{complement}} (object) {{and perform}} essentially a prepositional function, some linguists simply {{refer to them}} as prepositions. In Chinese, they are called 介词 (traditional: 介詞; pinyin: jiè cí), a term which generally corresponds to [...] "preposition" [...] (or more generally, [...] "adposition"). The situation is complicated somewhat by the fact that Chinese has <b>location</b> <b>markers</b> that appear after a noun that are often called postpositions.|$|E

50|$|Items {{of highway}} {{furniture}} are commonly uniquely identified by a code number attached to or stencilled onto them.

50|$|Izon can be {{considered}} distinct from many other related languages in the region, {{in the sense that}} it follows a SOV (subject object verb format, both in simple and complex sentences. Additionally, directional and locative phrases also precede the main verb. Tense marking takes the form of a suffix on the final verb. <b>Location</b> <b>markers</b> and other preposition-like articles are suffixed to the nouns that they relate to. Possessor typically precedes possessed and adjectives precede the nouns they modify.|$|E
5000|$|Because coverbs {{essentially}} {{function as}} prepositions, {{they can also}} be referred to simply as prepositions.

The situation is complicated somewhat {{by the fact that the}} <b>location</b> <b>markers</b> discussed above, which also have meanings similar to those of certain English prepositions (although in grammatical behavior they are more like nouns), are often called [...] "postpositions".|$|E
50|$|The road classes where {{identified}} by colour codes: red for 1st class, blue for 2nd class, green for 3rd class, yellow for municipal roads and brown for municipal paths. These colors were {{applied in the}} bases of the <b>location</b> <b>markers</b> and occasionally {{in the background of}} the road numbers. The numbering distribution for main roads was according to the importance of its route in the network, and for N101 and over were numbered in a North to South growing fashion.|$|E

50|$|California uses a postmile highway <b>location</b> <b>marker</b> {{system on}} all of its state highways, {{including}} U.S. Routes and Interstate Highways. The postmile markers indicate the distance a route travels through individual counties, as opposed to milestones that indicate the distance traveled through a state. The postmile system is the only route reference system used by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).|$|R

50|$|A highway {{location}} marker is {{the modern-day}} US {{equivalent of a}} milestone. Unlike traditional milestones, however, which (as their name suggests) were originally carved from stone and sited at one-mile intervals, modern highway <b>location</b> <b>markers</b> are made {{from a variety of}} materials and are almost invariably spaced at intervals of a kilometre or a fraction thereof (except in the United States, and United Kingdom where miles are still used on roadways). In other countries they may be known as driver location signs, milestones or kilometre stones.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the advent}} of dual carriageways, it was seldom {{necessary}} to identify the actual carriageway. When this was necessary, the carriageway was often identified informally {{in terms of the}} town or city to which the carriageway is heading or by using one of the points of the compass. However, the use of highway <b>location</b> <b>markers</b> to pinpoint accidents made it necessary to identify the correct carriageway in an unambiguous manner so that the emergency services could get {{to the scene of the}} accident with minimal delay.|$|E
50|$|Chinese {{frequently}} uses serial verb constructions, {{which involve}} {{two or more}} verbs or verb phrases in sequence. Chinese prepositions behave similarly to serialized verbs in some respects (several of the common prepositions {{can also be used}} as full verbs), and they are often referred to as coverbs. There are also <b>location</b> <b>markers,</b> placed after a noun, and hence often called postpositions; these are often used in combination with a coverb. Predicate adjectives are normally used without a copular verb ("to be"), and can thus be regarded as a type of verb.|$|E

50|$|All of SR 365 exists within Stokes Township {{in northwestern}} Logan County. The short spur route {{is not a}} part of the National Highway System. Around 230 {{vehicles}} use the route on average each day. SR 365 is one of the shortest state routes in Ohio, and there are no reassurance markers directly on SR 365. There is only one <b>location</b> <b>marker</b> on the route, at the beginning of the road. All of SR 365 is paved in asphalt concrete.|$|R
50|$|Increased use of {{personal}} mobile phones in emergency situations, rather than fixed, location index encoded, roadside telephones, meant that {{another way of}} pinpointing the location of motorists was required. For this purpose, large roadside driver location signs were installed at 500 m intervals on motorways and some trunk roads in England during the period 2007 to 2010. These signs replicate the unit-less location indexes shown on the smaller <b>location</b> <b>marker</b> posts. As of 2012 these have not been installed on Welsh roads.|$|R
