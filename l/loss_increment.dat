40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{filtration}} system with high-frequency flow reversal and minimum requirement of water for cleaning routines. The system was developed in the period from 2011 to 2013 and consists of three screen filters and eleven solenoid valves electronically controlled by a controller that operates based on head loss measurements. The following evaluations were carried out: head loss curve as a function of flow rate; filtrating efficiency as a function of solids concentration, frequency of flow reversal and increment in head loss. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial scheme with three replicates and two treatment levels for each factor. The filtration efficiency was equal to 98. 6 % for particles larger than 50 µm. The minimum volume of water for each cleaning of the filters was 5. 39 L. The head <b>loss</b> <b>increment</b> in the filtration system with flow reversal at frequencies of 11. 11 and 22. 22 mHz was smaller compared with the filtration system without flow reversal. The developed filtration system has potential for filtering low-quality irrigation water, but requires periodic maintenance to clean the filter element...|$|E
30|$|Many {{epidemiological}} {{studies have found}} that tooth loss is associated with susceptibility to oesophageal cancer. However, a definitive answer is yet to be discovered, and the findings are inconclusive. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the relationship between tooth loss and oesophageal cancer risk. We searched PubMed and Embase databases to screen eligible studies up to June 2015. Nine observational studies (eight articles) involving 2604 patients and 113, 995 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The combined odds ratio for tooth loss and oesophageal cancer was 1.53 (95  % CI 1.02 – 2.29) for the high versus lowest teeth loss categories. However, inconsistent results were detected in the stratified and sensitivity analysis. In dose–response analysis, the summary odds ratio for each one tooth <b>loss</b> <b>increment</b> was 1.01 (95  % CI 1.00 – 1.02). The current evidence, based solely on six case–control studies and three cohort studies, suggests that tooth loss is a potential marker of oesophageal cancer. However, no firm conclusion can be drawn at this time that tooth loss may play a causal role in development of oesophageal cancer. Additional large-scale and high-quality prospective studies are required to evaluate the association between tooth loss and risk of oesophageal cancer.|$|E

The Bühlmann-Straub credibility reserving (BSCR) model is a particular case of a CILI model where the risk parameter is only depending on i. We consider CILI models with additive diagonal risk (ADR), where the risk parameter is given by the sum of two components, one depending on the accident year i and the other depending on the calendar year t = i + j. The model {{can be viewed as}} an extension of the BSCR model including random diagonal effects, which are often declared to be important in loss reserving but rarely are specifically modeled. We show that the ADR model is tractable in closed form, providing credibility formulae for the reserve and the mean square error of prediction (MSEP). We also derive unbiased estimators for the variance parameters which extend the classical Bühlmann-Straub estimators. The results are illustrated by a numerical example and the estimators are tested by simulation. We find that the inclusion of random diagonal effects can be significant for the reserve estimates and, especially, for the evaluation of the MSEP. The paper is written with the purpose of illustrating the role of stochastic diagonal effects. To isolate these effects, we assume that the development pattern is given. In particular, our MSEP values do not include the uncertainty due to the estimation of the development patter...|$|R

The combustion of a mixture of methylamine and ethylene has been modelled using the stationary laminar flamelet concept. The flamelet calculations are based on several thousand elementary reaction steps including the chemical kinetics of HCN in combustion. The flamelets for both cold (293 K) and hot (1000 K) combustion product recycling have been calculated. The effect of strain is also included in the flamelet calculations. Scalar dissipation rates from 0. 01 s 1 to extinction values have been varied. Also the effect of radiation is included in the flamelet state relationships. Separate flamelet sets for various levels of radiation, from adiabatic up to 30 % radiation <b>losses,</b> <b>incremented</b> by 1 %, have been made. In the flow field calculation, the flamelet options may be used either as adiabatic, constant radiation or an interpolation between flamelet sets of different radiation. The chemical kinetics model, incorporated into a Reynolds-Averaging Navier–Stoke (RANS) type CFD code, has been used to simulate two laboratory fire tests of the combustion of nylon. Changing the size of the opening in the test room varied the ventilation between the two tests. Flamelet sets for a mixture of methylamine and ethylene with nitrogen content close to that of nylon were used in these simulations. The simulations were made with and without recycling the combustion products back to the fire. The calculations show that recycling of the combustion products to the fire increases the formation of HCN and CO.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the work on the {{interactions}} of electric and magnetic fields with biological materials both living and dead, 'it was noticed that published dielectrophoretic yield curves for biological cells showed unexplained deviations in the region of 2 kHz which is the proton magnetic resonance frequency in a typical laboratory ambient magnetic field. The exact value is 2. 13 kHz for a field of 50 UT. The results of preliminary dielectrophoretic and dielectric measurements show features at frequencies which correspond to the NMR condition for that value of steady magnetic field in which the measurements were made. Very sharp dielectric loss peaks were found corresponding to 1 H, 31 p, 23 Na, 35 C 1 amd 39 K resonances. The electron spin resonance also showed up in the dielectric loss. The onset plus NMR conditions of these resonances commences at the value of the steady magnetic field strength such that one quantum of magnetic flux (2. 07 x 10 - 15 Wb) would link the cross-sectional area of a single biological cell or pair of cells. Approximately 1. 0 gauss or 0. 5 gauss (100 iT or 50 pT) respectively in the case of 5 um diameter yeast cell. Growing cultures of the yeast cells in fields which satisfy the proton NMR conditions as a function of temperature results in a slight reduction in the mean generation time (MGT). Comparison of this with the dielectric constant and <b>loss</b> <b>increments</b> at the corresponding temperatures showed that when the MGT is least, the cells are dividing most rapidly and the dielectric increments are greatest.

The cells prepared for synchronous division were collected by dielectrophoresis into a one micron gap between two point electrodes mounted on a microscope slide.

At each TCP segment loss, congestion loss window and random loss rate variables are used to opportunely reduce the congestion window (Cwnd). It infers segment loss due to congestion and random error (i.e., halving Cwnd value), due to random errors (i.e., Cwnd[*]×[*] 4 / 5), or due to congestion (i.e., halving Cwnd value).

Results indicated that precipitation generally stimulated the BAI in the studied stand, while above average temperature during the growing season depressed it. One of the dominant periods for growing of basal area is the autumn of the penultimate year when precipitation and temperature has positive and negative effect on increment, respectively. In the main growing period (spring-early summer) the previous year’s precipitation has positive, while autumn temperature has negative effect. Current spring to early summer precipitation enhances the beech growth, and in contrary, the mean temperature in June-July has negative effect on the BAI. There is a breakpoint in the trend of meteorological variables at about 1999. A significant decrease was observed in the growth of beech in the summer months in the period of 2000 – 2007 compared to growth between 1985 and 1999 probably caused by the changed meteorological conditions.

Further, HEVC only supports context adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC), which has the disadvantage of being highly sequential and having strong data dependencies, as the entropy coder. So, {{the development of a}} fast rate estimation algorithm for CABAC-based coding has a great practical significance for mode decision in HEVC. There are three elementary steps in CABAC encoding process: binarization, context modeling, and binary arithmetic coding.

To maximize the reduction of computational complexity, we propose a fast entropy-based CABAC rate estimator in this paper. It eliminates not only the modeling and the coding steps, but also the binarization step. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed estimator is able to reduce the computational complexity of the mode decision in HEVC by 9 – 23  % with negligible PSNR <b>loss</b> and BD-rate <b>increment,</b> and therefore exhibits applicability to practical HEVC encoder implementation.|$|R

Counts were made of opaque growth increments and a readability score was assigned to each structure. Comparisons of growth increment counts were made between structures and between readings. All three structures showed some degree of readability and quantifiable growth increments, but this varied within fishes and between structures. Initial results showed that whole otoliths were more suitable to determine age estimates than dorsal spines and scales. Scales were considered unsuitable due to between reading ageing bias, variation in age estimates between structures, low precision and poor readability for this species. Dorsal spines showed evidence of <b>loss</b> of growth <b>increments</b> due to hollowing of the vascular core, which resulted in underestimation of older individuals in comparison to whole otoliths. Further analysis showed that growth increment counts from whole otoliths were lower for older individuals in comparison to sectioned otoliths. It is suggested that this is because of decreased clarity of growth increments towards the outer margin of whole otoliths in older individuals; this problem was not present with sectioned otoliths.

30|$|Red {{needle cast}} has been {{recorded}} {{at a number of}} discrete sites predominantly in damp and/or elevated locations in the North Island of New Zealand and also in the north of the South Island. However, significant areas of the forest estate remain unaffected by the disease. Sites where symptoms have been frequently recorded, and where they are most severe, are typically prone to mist and fog, and hence to prolonged periods of needle wetness. Such sites are commonly at elevations greater than 500  m such as plateaus or ridge tops. Sites at lower elevations have different (lower) moisture conditions that result in reduced incidence and severity of red needle cast symptoms or their complete absence. At many sites, only the lower foliage has been affected and this feature, coupled with the seasonal onset of the disease during late autumn and winter when tree growth is negligible, may mean that tree growth will be largely unaffected. At the rare sites where disease levels have been severe during consecutive years there will be <b>increment</b> <b>loss.</b> The extent of this loss is currently being evaluated at a range of sites around the country. The findings presented here suggest the existence of clonal variation in host susceptibility to Phytophthora pluvialis/red needle cast (Table  1, Figure  9). This has been corroborated by a clonal field trial in New Zealand (Dungey et al., in preparation) which indicates that breeding efforts and careful selection of radiata clones selection can reduce the risk of red needle cast and thus limit economic losses from future pine plantations in New Zealand. This aspect will be further examined and selections of resistant lines employed in those sites where climatic conditions result in consistently high disease levels.|$|R
40|$|Volume {{increment}} and ingrowth {{are important}} aspects of stand development and regeneration dynamics for determining the effectiveness of uneven-aged silvicultural systems. The main objectives of this thesis were to establish the influence of standing volume on volume increment after different kinds of harvest regimes, the influence of overstorey density on height growth of advance regeneration, {{and the influence of}} bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) on spruce regeneration in managed uneven-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies(L.) Karst.) forests in boreal Sweden. Model simulations with 5 -year growth iterations and three harvest regimes of diameter-limit, single-tree selection, and schematic harvests were used to investigate the influence of standing volume on volume increment. Additionally, field experiments at two sites were used. The influence of overstorey density on height growth was established using one of the sites that measured height increments of seedlings, saplings, and small trees in the plots. A field investigation was carried out to establish the influence of bilberry on spruce saplings, which cut bilberry stems in 1 m² circle plots around treated saplings and their height growth compared to the control saplings with uncut bilberry stems. Volume increment increased with increasing standing volume, culminated, and eventually declined. The highest volume increment was found for diameter-limit harvests followed by single-tree selection and schematic harvests. For harvesting a residual stand to 50 m³ha⁻¹, the schematic harvest showed <b>increment</b> <b>losses</b> equalling 25 years of growth. For the field experiments at both sites, standing volume was correlated significantly positively (p< 0. 05) with volume increment. The height increments for all spruce advance regeneration were better correlated with canopy openness than with basal area or standing volume. Treated saplings decreased in height increment compared to the control during the first and second year after cutting bilberry...|$|R
40|$|Poplars (Populus sp.) {{are widely}} used in short {{rotation}} forestry for production of biomass for bioenergy, fibre and environmental services. Swedish short rotation forestry is based on Salix sp., and {{little is known about}} the production potential of poplar plantations and their effects on the environment. This thesis focuses on four aspects of intensive short rotation forestry with poplars: 1) Biomass production and partitioning at several initial densities and a range of latitudes and growing conditions in Sweden, 2) the effects of poplar plantation on floristic diversity in the Swedish agricultural landscape, 3) the pattern of wind damage and its effects on production in poplar plantations in southern Sweden, and 4) ecological characterisation of poplar varieties in short-term experiments with pot-grown plants. Annual biomass production in poplar plots and plantations over a rotation period of 9 - 14 years ranges between 3. 3 and 9. 2 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1. These high production figures are achieved on relatively fertile, non-fertilised and non-irrigated agricultural land. The production assessments for commercial poplar plantations established at lower initial densities (1000 trees ha- 1) in southern Sweden indicate a similar production potential as in closely spaced cultures (5000 trees ha- 1 yr- 1), though at 3 - 5 years longer rotations. Lower initial densities enable higher pulpwood yields along with the production of biomass for bioenergy. A comparison among 21 poplar plots, 0. 1 - 13 ha large and adjacent arable fields, indicates that small poplar plantations may increase floristic diversity on a landscape scale, mainly by providing a different type of habitat that may favour shade-tolerant and draught-sensitive species. This is reflected by a relatively low number of species shared by both types of habitat. Wind damage in two poplar plantations, 15 and 33 ha large, was assessed using wind damage classes based on leaning angle of individual trees on plots established before wind damage occurred. The <b>loss</b> of <b>increment</b> on the strongest damaged plots during the two-year period after the storm was 30 %, whereas there was no difference in growth between damaged and undamaged plots in the third year after the storm. A short-term experiment using pot-grown plants revealed differences in clonal growth response in terms of physiological and morphological variables that determined relative growth rate and nutrient productivity, despite that most of clones were of the same species and geographic origin. The importance of different response variables in determining growth also shifted as an effect of irrigation and fertilisation treatment. Provided that suitable plant material is selected and widely available, commercial SRF with poplars represent a valuable alternative crop for surplus agricultural land with a potential to produce multiple benefits to society through the high production of biomass and fiber and positive effects on the environment...|$|R
40|$|Eligma {{narcissus}} is recognised as {{a serious}} pest of Ailanthus in Southern India and defoliation of Ailanthus by this pest causes apparent <b>loss</b> of growth <b>increment.</b> The common control methods for this pest is mostly insecticides and the concern about the environmental effects of chemical insecticides, has emphasised the use of environmentally more benign microbial agents. Among entomopathogens, Fungi are the most explored and often act as important natural control agents that limit insect populations. On this point of view, Bio efficacy of 25 isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae was assessed to establish their virulence against E. narcissus in the laboratory and effective formulations of two potent isolates were subsequently evaluated in the field. MIS 7 and MIS 13 were more effective among the different isolates evaluated against E. narcissus. The median lethal concentration (LC 50) of all the isolates ranged from 6. 46 × 105 conidia/ml to 628. 92 × 105 conidia/ml. Median lethal concentration of (LT 50) of 4. 9 and 5. 4 days were recorded for MIS 7 and MIS 13 respectively at a concentration of 1 × 107 conidia/ml. Virulence tests of the isolates MIS 7 and MIS 13 and 0. 5 % Pongamia pinnata seed oil, individually and in different combinations, indicated improved efficacy of the isolates when used in combination and also when combined with seed oil. Formulations composed of “MIS 7 +MIS 13 + 0. 5 % Pongamia pinnata seed oil” and “MIS 7 +MIS 13 ” proved to be superior against E. narcissus, causing 76. 30 % and 93. 93 % mortality, respectively. Field evaluation of the formulation MIS 7 +MIS 13 + 0. 5 % Pongamia pinnata seed oil recorded 5. 79 larvae per plant resulting in 60. 53 % reduction of infestation while the formulation, MIS 7 +MIS 13 showed 53. 76 % reduction of infestation with 6. 56 larvae per plant. The observations from this study suggest the prospects of using the entomopathogenic fungus, M. anisopliae for the control of E. narcissus...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the dynamic definition of irregularity; it looks at conditions of sustainability and considers under which conditions irregularity could be promoted efficiently. Irregularity {{is not usually}} innate in natural forest ecosystems, the exception being in certain developmental stages of old or over‐mature stands. Because of these natural tendencies, {{it is necessary to}} differentiate between temporary stand structures and sustainable irregular systems. Therefore, any assessment of irregularity needs to take the rules of demographic regulation into account. Different kinds of irregularity are discussed, as is the reference scale for implementation. This makes it possible to distinguish between genuine irregularity within the crown layer, full (vertical) irregularity on stand level (plenter system) and horizontal irregularity (for greater reference scales), by creating irregular patches (as under the irregular shelterwood system). The paper presents the differences between broadleaved species and conifers in a full irregular plenter system with a developed vertical structure. These differences are due to the degree to which tree species can support shade, without losing the ability to recover qualitative capacity and, for older stages, to use crown space efficiently. Other factors are also important: the reaction of tree species to openings, the production of epicormic branches, topology and crown expansion. Therefore, broadleaved plenter forests need much lower equilibrium standing volumes than classical conifer plenter forests and there are also <b>losses</b> in volume <b>increment</b> and stem quality. The silvicultural results produced by the different models for differentiating stands and promoting irregularity are also discussed. It is assumed that for broadleaved species, the compromise between the necessary educative steps (shaping of the stem form within tree populations) and closure control function are better in small populations (openings) than in stands with a single tree structure. Because the ultimate aim is to create not one, but several, co‐existing forms of heterogeneity, in the sense of creating varied habitats, modern silviculture should make use of all silvicultural tools. This is a significant challenge for silvicultural expertis...|$|R
30|$|While the {{analysis}} of single-tree and periodic volume increment in the three projection periods reveals the immediate impact of changing climatic conditions on forest growth, the evaluation of changes in MAImax aims at the long-term, aggregating climatic effect on forest productivity. Basically, the results on periodic volume increment and MAImax are in accordance. On average the productivity of all pine stands close to rotation age will profit from climate change until 2070, {{with the exception of}} the MAImax-value under maximum climate scenario in Fläming in the third projection period. Consequently, looking at overall productivity climate change does not negatively affect the management of Scots pine stands being harvested in Uelzen and Fläming until 2070. Contrary, persistent dryer climates heavily affect beech management with MAImax losses up to – 3 m 3 ·ha– 1 ·yr– 1 in Uelzen and – 2 m 3 ·ha– 1 ·yr– 1 in Fläming. Especially in stands with beech as the leading species it might be necessary to adapt the management goals, e.g. to reduce the target diameter in order not to unduly extend rotation age. As a summary, the effect of climate change on the growth of Scots pine and European beech is quite similar looking at periodic volume increment and MAImax. However, small distinctions are obvious for oak. The reported <b>losses</b> in volume <b>increment</b> for oak in the second and third period in both regions are not as pronounced looking at MAImax. Especially in comparison to beech MAImax-values for oak indicate only minor losses (Fig. 7) while the negative deviations in periodic volume increment in the third period especially in Uelzen and under maximum climate scenario in Fläming seem considerable (Fig. 6). In the case of Uelzen, we explain this discrepancy with the cultivation effort of oak even on less favourable sites in the beginning of the 1970 s. These oak stands seem to suffer under dryer conditions, thus, the deviations in periodic volume increment are negative. However, these stands are not included in the data used for MAImax assessment because of the age restriction. On the other hand, the older oak stands mainly stock on sites which are not so much affected by dryer conditions, thus, deviations in MAImax are positive.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to analyze the performance of an evaporator for the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system and discuss the influence of the evaporator on the operating characteristics of diesel engine. A simulation model of fin-and-tube evaporator of the ORC system is established by using Fluent software. Then, the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the exhaust at the evaporator shell side are obtained, and then the performance of the fin-and-tube evaporator of the ORC system is analyzed based on the field synergy principle. The field synergy angle (β) is the intersection angle between the velocity vector and the temperature gradient. When the absolute values of velocity and temperature gradient are constant and β 90 °, heat transfer enhancement can be achieved with the increase of the β. Subsequently, the influence of the evaporator of the ORC system on diesel engine performance is studied. A simulation model of the diesel engine is built by using GT–Power software under various operating conditions, and the variation tendency of engine power, torque, and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) are obtained. The variation tendency of the power output and BSFC of diesel engine–ORC combined system are obtained when the evaporation pressure ranges from 1. 0 MPa to 3. 5 MPa. Results show that the field synergy effect for the areas among the tube bundles of the evaporator main body and the field synergy effect for the areas among the fins on the windward side are satisfactory. However, the field synergy effect in the areas among the fins on the leeward side is weak. As a result of the pressure drop caused by the evaporator of the ORC system, the diesel engine power and torque decreases slightly, whereas the BSFC increases slightly with the increase of exhaust back pressure. With the increase of engine speed, power loss, torque <b>loss,</b> and BSFC <b>increment</b> increase gradually, where the most significant change is less than 1 %. Compared with the diesel engine itself, the maximum increase of power output of the diesel engine–ORC combined system is 6. 5 % and the maximum decrease of BSFC is 6. 1 %...|$|R
