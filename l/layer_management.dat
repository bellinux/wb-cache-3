500|$|The {{powerplant}} configuration {{selected for}} Concorde, and its development to a certificated design, {{can be seen}} in light of the above symposium topics (which highlighted airfield noise, boundary <b>layer</b> <b>management</b> and interactions between adjacent engines) and the requirement that the powerplant, at Mach 2, tolerate combinations of pushovers, sideslips, pull-ups and throttle slamming without surging. Extensive development testing with design changes and changes to intake and engine control laws would address most of the issues except airfield noise and the interaction between adjacent powerplants at speeds above Mach 1.6 which meant Concorde [...] "had to be certified aerodynamically as a twin-engined aircraft above Mach 1.6".|$|E
500|$|A {{symposium}} titled [...] "Supersonic-Transport Implications" [...] was {{hosted by}} the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1960. Various views were put forward on the likely type of powerplant for a supersonic transport, such as podded or buried installation and turbojet or ducted-fan engines. Boundary <b>layer</b> <b>management</b> in the podded installation was put forward as simpler with only an inlet cone but Dr. Seddon of the RAE saw [...] "a future in a more sophisticated integration of shapes" [...] in a buried installation. Another concern highlighted the case with two or more engines [...] situated behind a single intake. An intake failure {{could lead to a}} double or triple engine failure. The advantage of the ducted fan over the turbojet was reduced airport noise but with considerable economic penalties with its larger cross-section producing excessive drag. At that time it was considered that the noise from a turbojet optimised for supersonic cruise could be reduced to an acceptable level using noise suppressors as used on subsonic jets.|$|E

We use two different measures to identify the gender composition of the top layer based on direct survey data: the fraction of women among top managers, and the fraction of women among working proprietors. We document the following facts: a) There is a strong negative association between the fraction {{of women in the}} top <b>layer</b> of <b>management</b> and several establishment outcomes, among them business volume, investment, total wage bill per worker, total employment, and turnover; b) Establishments with a high fraction of women in the top <b>layer</b> of <b>management</b> are more likely to implement female-friendly policies, such as providing childcare facilities or promoting and mentoring female junior staff; c) The fraction of women in the top <b>layer</b> of <b>management</b> is also negatively associated with employment and wages, both male and female, full-time and part-time. However, all of these associations vanish when we include establishment fixed effects and establishment-specific time trends. This reveals a substantial sorting of female managers across establishments: small and less productive establishments that invest less, pay their employees lower wages, but are more female-friendly {{are more likely to be}} led by women...|$|R
