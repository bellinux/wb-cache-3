25|$|A {{recent issue}} of Adventure Comics {{explained}} that since his return to life he had been trained {{in the use of}} heightened mental blocks to defend against mind control and influences, such as the brainwashing Luthor used on him. It was with this training {{that he was able to}} briefly pierce the control of the Black <b>Lantern</b> <b>ring,</b> using his heat vision to give Wonder Girl the clue needed to free him from it.|$|E
25|$|In Blackest Night #1, Garth {{returns to}} Atlantis and tells Orin's wife Mera {{that he is}} angry {{at the notion of}} Aquaman's body being buried on land. Mera relays to Tempest that Orin felt safe on land and that it is indeed what he wanted. Sometime later, a black power ring is seen {{entering}} Orin's grave, bidding him to rise. Aquaman's corpse rises, along with those of Tula and Dolphin as revenant members of the Black Lantern Corps, and demands that Mera reunite with him in death, offering her a chance to see her son again. Garth is killed and joins the Black Lanterns himself. Mera rejects the corpse before fleeing. In the climax of the miniseries, Aquaman is among those resurrected by The White Lantern Entity, and is reunited with Mera. Because the Black <b>Lantern</b> <b>Ring</b> helps reconstruct Orin's body, when he is resurrected his hand is restored as well.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] 2, an {{alternate}} version of Alan Scott is featured. This Alan Scott's ring's origin is explained as having originally been a Green <b>Lantern</b> <b>ring</b> that was lost on Earth long ago. In this storyline, {{the first time}} Alan used his ring, he was knocked out from behind by {{a man with a}} wooden club. This caused Alan to believe the ring was weak against wood, thereby causing a mental block that prevented him from truly exerting his power against wooden objects or attacks. (This was confirmed by the Guardians, who explained that this was the reason behind the weakness to yellow of the Green Lantern Corps' rings. They simply told all new Green Lanterns that their rings were powerless against yellow to establish the same mental block.) ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the lost}} year, Cowgirl, Hal [...] "Highball" [...] Jordan, and Shane [...] "Rocket-Man" [...] Sellers were sent on an Air Force mission, on which Jordan, per usual, did not wear his Green <b>Lantern</b> <b>ring.</b> During the mission {{all three of}} their jets were shot down and the pilots taken as prisoners of war. Jordan filed down his chains {{in an attempt to}} escape the camp, finally doing so when his captors {{attempted}} to torture Cowgirl in front of him to get him to reveal secrets, since torturing Jordan himself wasn't working. Cowgirl and Jordan used the surprise to overcome their jailers, located Rocket-Man, fled the camp, and eventually made it to a campsite and a hospital. Upon their return to America they were awarded POW medals in a ceremony interrupted by a ship piloted by Tomar-Tu crashing to Earth. When the three recovered POWs were put back on active Air Force duty, it was done so on the condition that they attend therapy sessions.

Before disappearing into the timestream, he begs the Legion to bring his love to his sister, [...] "the only one who always believed in me." [...] At the Legion's headquarters, Brainiac 5 reveals he had always known of Booster's technology thefts, but having read in historical chronicles how Booster Gold is destined to redeem himself acting {{as one of the greatest}} and most selfless crimefighters of the 21st century, he arranges for Booster to find and easily steal the very items he needs to be an effective crimefighter: a Legion flight ring, LexCorp experimental blaster gauntlets, and power cells employed by the Science Police.
