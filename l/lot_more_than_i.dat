So much, that I transited step by step from drought to autoentography as my research topic. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Mitchell has {{explained}} his pseudonym: [...] "I think Bob Evans is <b>more</b> me <b>than</b> Kevin Mitchell from Jebediah is! In that way it’s like a reverse alter-ego.

Some of our men have got the stun of it a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> have. It gets at the older men more. Everybody says that.

5000|$|My legacy? I {{just want}} to be known as a hardworking guy who overachieved and is a winner. I think there's always been more talented people out there and whatnot.

5000|$|He {{attended}} Nottingham Trent University, {{earning a}} BA (Hons) in photography in 2006.

We were always encouraged to describe why we’ve created something - which I apply to my music all the time.

5000|$|Carter has {{identified}} himself as a libertarian: [...] "I don't vote. I find both parties to be appalling and OK at the same time.

5000|$|Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons {{should have}} been one of the most {{successful}} puppet shows and it wasn't. I think it was too perfect. There was a lack of humour.

I wanted to start to give them human flaws, start to make them more important.

5000|$|It {{definitely}} {{still has}} the same electro-pop feel, {{but there is a}} little more acoustic stuff in there. I feel like it is just more, mature.

5000|$|I {{worked hard}} with Ottis Gibsonin his England role {{to develop an}} inswinger. My stock ball is {{slightly}} back of a length, hitting the seam, but I bowl the inswinger slightly fuller and it's a big wicket-taker, especially against tailenders. I share Ottis's belief {{that you have to}} test the batsman from the very first ball. As a fast bowler, you're going to bowl a limited amount of overs, so I treat every ball as though it's my last. If you take wickets early it gets you on a roll and gets the team going, so I'm a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> focused <b>than</b> <b>I</b> used to be in my preparations Graham Onions ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{believed}} that UEFA would vote to change its membership requirements at the 41st Annual Congress held in Helsinki, Finland so {{that they were more}} in line with those of FIFA which allows non-independent states under certain conditions.

[...] Ard Vijn also wrote in his page that the audience at the IFFR awarded [...] "The Forbidden Door" [...] a very respectable 4.0 out of 5 so maybe people are used to a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> gore <b>than</b> <b>I</b> expected...|$|R
5000|$|Scott Miller {{sought out}} Mitch Easter to produce Real Nighttime after hearing his {{production}} work on R.E.M.'s Chronic Town, and Easter {{went on to}} have a long association with the group, producing not only the rest of Game Theory’s catalog but also the first two albums by Miller's next band, The Loud Family. According to Miller, Easter's main contribution as producer was [...] "competency" [...] and a bigger, more professional sound. In 2003, Miller stated, [...] "I don’t think he and I ever clashed at all.... just suddenly we had someone who knew a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> did and we were all grateful." [...] For his part, when Easter was asked in 1999 about his favorite projects as a producer, Easter named Chronic Town and Game Theory's records, which Easter called [...] "a lot of fun, because of the variety in the way they approached recording." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{was already}} reevaluating the dissonance between making {{all this money}} and being on the set with people, the crew, many of whom couldn't afford the basic needs of their families. It didn't seem fair to me. So I don't think the {{concussion}} did it although {{it was definitely a}} crisis and crisis will often trigger things like this. I didn't give up everything to be happy. In fact, I'm not even sure what happiness is. Happiness comes from the word [...] "happenstance" [...] which relates to things going on outside of you. What was happening to me was definitely on the inside. But after I gave up everything I felt a lot more joy in my life. A lot more contentment. There's nothing wrong, though, with {{making a lot of money}} ... this is not a judgment on anyone at all. I was just taking in a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> needed and this wasn't good for me.|$|E

5000|$|Defending {{accusations that}} {{the album was}} disjointed, McLennan said, [...] "It's an album where we talked {{right from the start}} of Loaded or a White Album, where there would be {{different}} songs on the record, and I stand by that. I deny the allegations of scrappiness." [...] In an interview in 2016 Forster takes a different view, stating [...] "Grant was always perceived as the pop kid in the band, but he didn’t pick the pop songs. At times I would try and sway him on material, because he had a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> me: <b>I</b> would have four or five songs for each album and he would have 15 or 20.

5000|$|Everyone {{talks about}} the wrong people ... the self-publicists. Now who has ever heard of Pat Hughes?

That was a blow. —Bob Doe, quoted in 2000 The top-scoring Australian flying ace of the Battle of Britain and one of {{fourteen}} Australian fighter pilots killed during the battle, Hughes {{has been described as}} [...] "the inspiration and driving force behind No. 234 Squadron RAF". He is generally credited with seventeen confirmed victories—fourteen solo and three shared. This tally puts him among the top ten Allied Battle of Britain aces.

5000|$|Fourstardave {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular horses of his time, racing from age 2 to 10.

Bomze said, [...] "I'll never forget Tom Durkin's calls of Dave's races as he was {{breaking}} his own record year after year. Everyone was rooting for him, and Tom's calls would bring the crowd to a crescendo. I would go to Saratoga and look up in the stands and tell my wife, 'You know something, honey, there are a few thousand people here who have a heck of a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> money <b>than</b> <b>I</b> do, but, boy, they'd give their right arm to have a horse like we've got.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Tim Surette of TV.com commented {{positively}} on the series' {{change in}} environment, saying: [...] "Now The Walking Dead {{can return to}} the enjoyable (for us, anyway) world outside those barbed-wire fences, a world where our survivors can't just garden all day and then safely tuck themselves into bed behind six-foot-thick concrete walls. Now they'll have zombies nipping at their heels {{as they try to}} make it to another sunrise, hoping they'll live long enough to have one more argument over whether or not Rick is a good leader." [...] However, he commented negatively on the episode's pace, saying: [...] "large stretches of [...] "After" [...] were, indeed, boring. I wanted to like the episode a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> did, because I think it was making an effort to both deliver a message and reintroduce us to the danger of this world by showing us how it can break even the sturdiest survivors. Otherwise, it was just characters walking around and killing zombies. And even that's starting to get old." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cine Outsider felt [...] "the {{basics of}} a decent if unadventurous Found Footage horror are {{certainly}} here, and {{as someone who}} still has {{a soft spot for}} the subgenre and a fondness for torch-lit sequences set in dark and crumbling basements, I really wanted to like it a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> did." [...] Stuart Willis of Sex Gore Mutants said [...] "The Inside starts in a fairly unpromising manner but soon picks up thanks to the performances... The scenes where the guys terrorise the lasses is authentically intense, bringing to mind the infamous home invasion sequence from Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. Even the score at this point is reminiscent of John McNaughton's essential chiller..." [...] They added the [...] "film could probably terrify someone with little or no experience of the modern horror genre... the first 40 minutes are its most interesting and that the lack of original ideas in its latter half seriously hampered its clearly passionate attempts to scare audiences witless." [...] Horrorphilia said of the film [...] "you don't have any character development at all... it is above average for a first person horror film... If you are a huge first person point of view type of horror fan lover then it's definitely worth a watch." ...|$|E
5000|$|In October 2012 {{the band}} {{reformed}} to perform two sold out dates at Flairz Retro Bar in Hastings.

[...] Waring {{expressed}} shock at some of the lines the character says and added that she would find it [...] "interesting to see how the audience reacts to that, but I certainly like her". Waring also noted that [...] "Wallis is actually older than Holly, so I'm not happy about having an 18-year-old daughter, because I don't look old enough! But obviously Holly is 14, so she's a lot younger <b>than</b> Wallis. <b>I</b> was 18 when I was playing Cindy as 15, so it's the same sort of scenario.

"What I {{wanted this}} time out was a {{combination}} of the music I've been listening to recently," [...] Raitt said in 1982, [...] "Billy Burnette, the Blasters, Rockpile, and the rock-a-billy New Wave scene. I knew I had {{to get away from the}} slick sound I had with the Peter Asher record...I was a little stung by the lack of response to The Glow. And I was disappointed by not being able to make a record that sounded the way I wanted it to sound. Moving to Shangri-la, I wanted to get back to the roots and to the funkiness I had on earlier records, even though I'm not crazy about how they sound.

We used to answer, 'When Hell freezes over.' We {{thought it was a}} pretty good joke. People have the misconception that we were fighting a lot. It is not true. We had a lot of fun.
