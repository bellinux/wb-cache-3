[...] Folding knife, {{introducing a}} stronger {{variation of the}} Walker linerlock called the Sebenza Integral Lock, also {{commonly known as the}} framelock. [...] The Sebenza is a utility knife with titanium handles and was originally introduced with an ATS-34 stainless steel blade, followed by BG-42 and as of this writing, CPM S35VN steel. [...] The Sebenza comes in two sizes, with blade lengths of 75mm/2.94" [...] (Small Sebenza) and 92mm/3.625" [...] (Large Sebenza). There are currently 3 different models out, in chronological order they are the regular, classic, and current 21 model. The major difference is between the regular and classic/21 model. The regular has scalloping and a smaller lock bar access cut out. The classic is very similar to the 21 (being its predecessor), with the main difference being the classic stamp on the <b>lock</b> <b>side</b> of the knife as well as having a rounded lock bar. They offer inlays ranging from micarta to wood to even ivory on the classic and 21 models. Even though the regular has been discontinued for a few years, they still offer it annually with different inlays every year.|$|E

5000|$|Ballistic {{breaching}} uses a projectile {{weapon to}} breach an opening. Weapons used {{can range from}} small arms to the 120mm cannon of a main battle tank with a HEAT round, which will breach most obstacles easily, though the force involved may violate the rules of engagement. [...] A less damaging ballistic breach needs to destroy either the latch and lock, or the hinges of the door, and the ideal choice {{for this is the}} shotgun. While in theory other firearms can be used, handguns are usually underpowered and rifles are less effective than the shotgun and pose a far higher risk of ricochet and collateral injury. [...] Most shotgun ammunition can be used for breaching, though the risk of injury varies with type. Of the available shotgun ammunition, shotgun slugs pose the highest risk, as they will retain significant energy to cause lethal wounds well after they have penetrated the door. Buckshot is far safer, and birdshot even safer, as the multiple small projectiles disperse quickly after penetration, reducing the chances of causing a lethal wound. The safest option is a frangible round such as the TESAR or Hatton round, which turns to dust upon penetrating the door, and disperses completely upon exit.Breaching a door with the fewest number of shots possible both is faster and reduces the chance of collateral damage. Attacking the latch and lock is easiest, as it requires fewer shots and is easiest to target, whereas attacking the hinges requires more shots, and the hinges may be hidden from the outside. Careful aim is required; shots to the <b>lock</b> <b>side</b> are fired at a point halfway between the lock or handle and the door frame in order to hit the bolt holding the door shut. According to US urban warfare doctrine, the breaching operation is performed with the muzzle in contact with the door, or as close as possible, and angled downwards at a 45 degree angle. This process provides the best chance of hitting the desired point, while minimizing risk to occupants of the room being breached. Muzzle attachments are available on some specialized breaching shotguns to facilitate this operation, by holding the barrel securely in place while providing a slight standoff to allow powder gases to escape.|$|E

30|$|A {{number of}} {{variations}} of basic sliding hip screws {{have been proposed}} because of such complications in elderly patients with AO 31 A 2, 31 A 3 type fractures; in these excessive collapse can lead to shortening and hardware failure [5, 13]. One proposal was to improve implant anchorage in the femoral head {{by the use of}} a helical blade. The shape of the blade leads to improved rotational stability of the femoral head and neck fragment, which is vital for reducing the risk of cut-out, and may contribute to fewer delayed unions or varus angulation in unstable pertrochanteric fractures [14, 15]. The tip of the blade allows for compaction of the bone when it is inserted, which is thought responsible for improving anchorage in femoral head [16, 17]. Another study reported that the DHS with fixed angle <b>locking</b> screws (<b>locking</b> <b>side</b> plate) would reduce the risk of DHS failure and would be particularly useful in patients with osteoporotic bone or for patients with less stable fracture configurations [9]. The dynamic hip helical system (DHHS), designed by AO/ASIF, merges the concept of <b>locking</b> <b>side</b> plate, helical blade and dynamic hip screw. Several biomechanical studies have shown that helical blade has the potential to decrease the cut-out rate [14, 15], but few clinical studies have been reported. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the radiological and functional outcome in elderly patients with unstable pertrochanteric fractures treated with the DHHS. The main outcome measures of the study were union rate, cut-out, the average sliding of the blade and functional outcome.|$|R

25|$|Linerlock {{mechanisms}} are most commonly composed of titanium alloy or steel. The linerlock's <b>locking</b> <b>side</b> liner is split {{from the top}} toward the bottom, similar to an automotive leaf spring (also called a lock bar) that butts up against the tang of the blade to prevent the blade from closing. In an interview with Blade in 1988, Walker stated, “This long leaf-spring effect cuts down on stress on the locking mechanism". As the lock on the original electrician's knife was mostly to hold a screwdriver blade open (the knife blade, itself was secured by a slip joint method), Walker's refinements prevented the knife blade from closing on the user's hand and converted it into a true lock.|$|R

30|$|The {{helical blade}} is {{available}} in lengths of 65 – 145  mm with the outer diameter of 12.5  mm. The barrel angle varies from 130 ° to 150 ° and measures 25 and 38  mm in length. The 135 ° DHHS barrel {{used in this study}} had a 9 -mm long key that engages the blade shaft to prevent rotation and a <b>locking</b> <b>side</b> plate. This is different from the standard DHS, where the screw shaft engages the barrel over its entire length. The procedures were performed by the three senior authors of the study. The implant was fixed as per the recommended technique. The <b>locking</b> <b>side</b> plate in DHHS is a combi-hole design allowing non-locking or locking screws to be used. Initially, one cortical screw was inserted to allow directional compression at fracture site, followed by the insertion of locking screws. In the majority of patients, this practice was followed. For most patients, an indirect reduction was attempted, but no attempt was made to reduce the posteromedial fragment if it required extensive soft tissue dissection for fixation. In all cases, efforts were made to achieve optimum positioning of the tip of the screw in the subchondral bone of the femoral head with a combined tip–apex distance measuring < 25  mm on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. Antibiotic prophylaxis was given as per institutional protocol. Patients were taught and encouraged to do pain-free intermittent quadriceps, hip and knee flexion exercises starting on the second postoperative day. Partial weight bearing was allowed with a walker aid and advanced to as tolerated by the patient with full weight bearing encouraged after 12  weeks.|$|R
