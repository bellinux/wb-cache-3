40|$|Agroforestry is an {{integrated}} approach of combining {{agriculture and forestry}} technologies, preserving the natural environment, producing food in a sustainable way and providing the local residents with stable food supply. It has gathered attention in the tropics recent years. This study focuses on status quo of traditional agroforestry in Baduy community, which is still little known. It further discusses the land use, vegetation composition, distribution of plants, and forest uses. There {{are two types of}} agroforestry in Baduy communty: Kebon and Huma-Jami-Reuma. In a Kebon, without slash and burn, there is an upstorey of fruit trees and woods, and a <b>low</b> <b>storey</b> of useful herbaceous plants for food, medicine and ritual. Useful plants could be continuously harvested. A Huma-Jami-Reuma is a kind of shifting cultivation after slash and burn. Huma, Jami, and Reuma refer to the different stages of shifting cultivation. During the first year of Huma, swidden rice (Oryza sativa L.) is majorly planted. One to three years after rice harvest, vegetables are usually planted when the trees are naturally regenerated. This stage is called Jami (vegetable stage). During the following 3 to 4 years, it is the stage of secondary forest, called Reuma. The fruits and wild plants are produced without maintenance during' Reuma. Thus, the land might be reused as shifting cultivation after 8 years. In Jami, there are numerous useful plants in the understorey. Thus, soil has been preserved with understorey vegetation and the dried straws of harvested rice. Vegetation in Reuma consists of Paraserianthes falcataria and fruit trees in the upstorey, banana plants, Noni in the middle storey and vegetables and wild useful plants in the understorey. Vegetation has been regenerated from the under storey to the up storey; a multilayered structure has been maintained under such a system. Traditional agroforestry in Baduy community consists of various types of land use and the cycling uses of ecosystem of the soil have been accomplished, which result in the soil preservation and the productive agricultural and forestry production. アグロフォレストリーは林業と農業を組み合わせることで、自然環境を保全しながら、多様な食料を持続的に生産し、地域住民の生活の安定に寄与できる手段として、近年、熱帯地域で注目されている。本研究は、これまであまりよく知られていないBaduy共同体の伝統的なアグロフォレストリーの実態について、土地利用形態、植物の空間利用、栽培植物の分布、森林利用などの面から検討したものである。Baduy共同体の土地利用にはKebon型とHuma-Jami-Reuma型の 2 つがある。Kebon型には、焼畑はなく、上層でフルーツや用材林を育成し、下層で有用草本（食用、薬用、祭祀）を栽培する。ここでは持続的に有用植物が収穫できる。Huma-Jami-Reuma型は焼畑移動耕作の各時期の名称である。Humaは焼畑後、主に陸稲を植える 1 年間のこと。Jamiは陸稲収穫後､野菜を栽培すること。Reumaは二次林化した状態のこと。ここではフルーツや野生植物を採取する。そのサイクルは約 8 年である。Jamiでは下層での有用草本の植栽が多い。そこでの土壌は下層植生や前作陸稲の枯れ草で保全されていた。Reumaでは上層はモルッカネムと果樹、中層にバナナとノニ、下層は野菜と野生有用種で構成され、植生は下層から上層へと段階的に更新される仕組みになっていた。このシステムが植生の多層構造を維持している。Baduy共同体の伝統的なアグロフォレストリーは、それぞれの土地利用タイプが組み合わさって、土地の生態的循環利用を完結させており、そのことが土壌保全と持続的な農林業の多様な生産につながっていると考えられる...|$|E
30|$|Honed by {{continuous}} {{trial and}} error and juxtaposing the experiences of past events, vernacular technology has appreciably contributed in terms of resilience and sustainable construction in suburban and rural Nepal. Use of local materials, manpower and technology has brought a unique trend of construction in Nepal in terms of vernacular technology. Each physiographic unit has own tradition of vernacular dwellings. In Terai, people seek some dimensions of construction with regard to flood resilience primarily, so they have been constructing houses with raised platform. Such houses with raised platform are usually of one to two storied and having less weight. Thermal comfort is also ensured through use of locally casted partitioning materials. Relatively durable timber like Shorea robusta (“Agrakh”) is used for such construction. The housing technology also incorporates many aspects of earthquake resistant features like symmetrical construction, high ductility, proper binding of housing units, among others. Such features were developed from continuous {{trial and error}} efforts after several past disaster events. In the case of hills, people have developed a tradition of one to two storied constructions with proper use of symmetrical rounded configuration. Earthquake resilient technology is proven through implementation of elements like struts, timber bands, <b>low</b> <b>storey</b> height and smaller openings, mainstreamed cantilevered load on structural walls, subsequent load reduction in upper stories, proper connection of roof with other structural system, among others. Leveled foundation is also a characteristic practice in hills even if the terrain is not leveled. Nepal, being an underdeveloped country, has weak framework of disaster resilient construction and execution in rural setups and suburbs. Even in the urban areas, the NBC is surpassed by the Indian Standard codes of practice due to high dependence of NBC into IS code. Thus, it is obvious that, there is lack of proper mechanism to govern the local construction technology. People have developed themselves some unique features of construction which are proven to be earthquake resilient against prevalent disasters of small to medium scales. There are still several things lagging in vernacular construction technology, beside this the remarkable features from vernacular practice might be instrumental in governing and assuring disaster resilient construction technology economically and locally in greater extent. People, if devised {{with regard to the}} remarkable features of such construction and provided with some additional low cost features like lateral supports (buttresses), improved local binding materials, configuration, site selection, among others; resilience could be remarkably enhanced. Such construction framework would be surely cost-effective due to use of local materials and also culturally sound through reflection of local customs replicated in households. Many of the global paradigms have shown remarkable performance of vernacular houses during past disaster events, so replication, modification, blending with modern concepts, incorporating in building codes and construction guidelines could be pivotal in assuring disaster resilience in suburbs and rural setups. As most of the people are not able to pay for modern sophisticated engineered constructions, they will continue to construct similar types of structures hence their performance evaluation and strengthening frameworks are needed for assuring safety, patrimony and resilience.|$|E
40|$|In 1968 a {{relatively}} small gas exposition on the 18 th floor of the Ronan Point tower building resulted in the partial collapse of the structure. This event highlighted that progress collapse may occur to structures under an accidental loading event. Other events, including {{the bombing of the}} Murrah federal building in 1993 in Oklahoma, have resulted in the common design requirement that a structure be capable of surviving the removal of a load bearing element. This approach, {{often referred to as the}} sudden column loss scenario, effectively ignores the cause of the damage and focuses on the structure’s response afterwards. The refinement of the analysis varies, with options to include the nonlinear and dynamic behaviours associated with extreme events, or to use simplified linear and static models with factors included to account for the full behaviour. Previous research into progressive collapse has highlighted that providing ductility in the connections, and avoiding brittle failures, is important in ensuring the structure maintains integrity after a column loss event. However, the majority of this work has been focused on the behaviour of steel and Reinforced Concrete (RC) frame structures. As flat slab construction is a popular method for many structures, due to the flexibility it offers for layouts and its <b>low</b> <b>storey</b> heights, it is an important to consider flat slab behaviour in more detail. Furthermore, slab elements behave differently to frame structures due to the Alternative Load Paths (ALPs) that can develop after a column loss via two-dimensional bending mechanisms. Additionally, punching shear failure is a known issue due to the thin section depths. This work addresses the issue of the response of RC flat slab structures after a sudden column loss. As previous case studies have demonstrated that brittle failures may lead to progressive collapse of such structures, a complete understanding of the response is required. The nonlinear behaviour of a slab structure, due to both material and geometric factors, is investigated to determine the additional capacity available beyond the usual design limits. Additionally, the dynamic factors involved, primarily due to inertial effects, are also considered. To achieve this, experimental and numerical studies were conducted. A series of 1 / 3 scale models of slab substructures were constructed to replicate column loss events. Two types of tests were conducted, a static push down test with a support removed and a sudden dynamic column removal case. Displacements, strains and support reactions were recorded throughout, along with cracking patterns. For the dynamic tests a high speed camera was used to obtain the deflection response in the short time period after removal and to observe the formation of cracks. Comparisons between the two cases allowed determination of the dynamic effects on the response of the system. The experimental programme was then replicated using a Finite Element (FE) model. The results taken from the experimental case were used to validate the material and modelling assumptions made during the numerical simulations. This validated model was finally used to investigate a wider range of variables and assess the response of typical structural arrangements, with particular focus on the nonlinear and dynamic factors involved after a sudden column loss. The experimental and numeral investigations demonstrated that after the loss of a column, flat slab structures can maintain integrity due to a change in the load paths away from the removal location. Although in some cases a large amount of flexural damage to the concrete and reinforcement occurred, such effects did not lead to complete failure. However, during the experimental programme some punching shear failures occurred, usually at the corner column locations. From the numerical analysis, shear forces of over twice the fully supported condition occurred as a result of removing a column, which may exceed the designed capacity. Comparisons between a static and dynamic analysis provides information into a suitable Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF) for use with simplified modelling approaches. Based on the range of structures considered, the maximum increase in deflections as a result of a sudden removal was 1. 62 times the static case, this is less than the commonly used factor of 2. 0. Additionally, this factor reduces as the nonlinearity increases due to further damage, with a smallest DAF calculated at 1. 39. This factor can be reduced further if the column is not removed instantaneously. Finally, the material strengthening effect, due to high strain rates, was considered with the conclusion that as such effects only make a limited increase in the capacity of the slab and may be conservatively ignored. In conclusion, RC flat slab structures are capable of resisting progressive collapse after the loss of a column. This is primarily due to their ability to develop ALPs. However, while flexural damage is usually fairly minimal, progressive punching shear failure is a critical design condition as it may result in a complete collapse. Furthermore, the inertial effects involved after a sudden removal can increase the damage sustained, although current design methods may be over conservative...|$|E
