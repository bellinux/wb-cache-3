5|$|Historian Katharine Glover {{argues that}} women had less means of public {{participation}} than men {{and that as}} a result piety and an active religious life may have been more important for women from the social elite. Church going played an important part in the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> women. Women were largely excluded from the administration of the kirk, but when heads of households voted on the appointment of a new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate.|$|E
5|$|The ceasefire of 2004 brought {{relative}} peace, {{but in the}} meantime, {{the sinking}} of the Joola in 2002 claimed the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists for several years. Considering the problems brought on by the conflict along with the threat of coastal erosion on the island, some fear the worst. Thus, after years of development and community outreach, Carabane is experiencing difficulties in a number of ways.|$|E

5|$|Since Manchester United's first {{competitive}} match, 903 {{players have}} made a competitive first-team appearance for the club. Many of these players have spent only {{a short period of}} their career at Manchester United before seeking opportunities in other teams; some players had their careers cut short by injury, while others left for other reasons. Jimmy Davis was {{killed in a car accident}} in 2003 having made one first team appearance, the first Manchester United player to die during his career since the Munich air disaster, which claimed the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> of the Busby Babes, including Geoff Bent. The First and Second World Wars also disrupted the careers of footballers across the United Kingdom. Peter Beardsley only played one match for Manchester United but went on to have a very successful career at Newcastle United, Liverpool and several other clubs; he also won 59 caps for the England national team.|$|E
5|$|Villani's Cronica was {{considered}} an important work at the time, valuable enough for his brother and nephew to continue it. Little is known of Villani's brother, Matteo, save that he was twice married, that he died of the plague in 1363, and that he continued work on the Cronica until his death. Filippo Villani, Matteo's son, flourished {{in the latter half}} of the 14th century and ended the Cronica at 1364; his portion includes details of the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Florentine artists and musicians, including Giotto di Bondone and Francesco Landini. Filippo's chronicles were approved by the Chancellor of Florence, Coluccio Salutati, who made corrections to the work and added commentary. The 15th-century Florentine historian Domenico di Leonardo Buoninsegni also featured in the first two chapters of his Istoria Fiorentina a summary of Villani's Cronica.|$|E
5|$|Waray guerrillas under {{a former}} schoolteacher named Captain Nieves Fernandez fought the Japanese in Tacloban. Nieves {{extensively}} trained her men in combat skills and making of improvised weaponry, {{as well as}} leading her men in the front. With only 110 men, Nieves managed to take out over 200 Japanese soldiers during the occupation. The Imperial Japanese Army posted a 10,000 Pesos reward on {{her head in the}} hopes of capturing her but to no avail. The main commander of the resistance movement in the Island of Leyte was Ruperto Kangleon, a former Filipino soldier turned resistance fighter and leader. After the fall of the country, he successfully escaped capture by the Japanese and established a united guerrilla front in Leyte. He and his men, the Black Army, were successful in pushing the Japanese from the mainland province and further into the coastlands of Southern Leyte. Kangleon's guerrillas provided intelligence for the American guerrilla leaders such as Wendell Fertig, and assisted in the subsequent Leyte Landing and the Battle of Leyte soon after. The guerrillas in Leyte were also very instrumental not only in the opposition against Japanese rule, but also in the safety and aid of the civilians living in the island. In the book The Hidden Battle of Leyte: The Picture Diary of a Girl taken by the Japanese Military by Remedios Felias; a former comfort woman, revealed how the Filipino guerrillas saved the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> young girls raped or to-be raped by the Japanese. In her vivid account of the Battle of Burauen, she recounts how the guerrillas managed to wipe out entire Japanese platoons off the various villages in the municipality, eventually saving the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>many.</b>|$|E

5|$|By that stage, Vann was {{frustrated}} by the Civil Guard soldiers of Task Force B, because {{they appeared to be}} in no hurry to reach Ap Bac, as they searched one house at a time while marching up from the southwest flank of the battlefield. In his final effort to defeat the Viet Cong, Vann flew into Tan Hiep and asked Cao to deploy an airborne battalion {{on the east side of}} Ap Bac, the most logical retreat route for the Viet Cong. Vann hoped to trap the Viet Cong inside the hamlets by blocking their retreat routes on all sides, and annihilate them using an elite battalion of South Vietnamese paratroopers. To Vann's disappointment, Cao strongly opposed the idea and decided to drop one of his airborne battalions behind the M113 formation on the west side instead. Vann accused Cao of wanting to let the Viet Cong escape in order to avoid further South Vietnamese casualties. However, Cao argued that a surrounded and well-entrenched enemy would fight more fiercely than a retreating one, so he wanted the Viet Cong units inside the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi to expose themselves by retreating through the eastern side of the battlefield, where he could destroy them with artillery and air power. Cao had also lost confidence in Vann, because Cao felt Vann had placed the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> South Vietnamese soldiers at risk to save the lives of a handful of Americans. Major-General Tran Thien Khiem, Chief of the ARVN Joint General Staff, was present during the argument. He did not object to Cao's plan because it was consistent with President Diem's objective to save Vietnamese lives through the Rural Revolutionary Development and Chieu Hoi Programs, which encouraged Viet Cong fighters to join the South Vietnamese military.|$|E
25|$|Many {{books have}} been written about EastEnders. Notably, from 1985 to 1988, author and {{television}} writer Hugh Miller wrote 17 novels, detailing the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> of the show's original characters before 1985, when events on screen took place.|$|E

5000|$|A rare eagerness {{was seen}} in the {{assistant}} surgeon Gerson of this 5th line battalion, who not only stayed in the carree during the fiercest of fighting, dressing with fervour and skill the wounded of his battalion, but also caring for those of the neighbouring Hanoverian troops. In this way he saved the <b>live</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> brave men, voluntary exposing his own life, he rightly gained the admiration of every eyewitness, and Colonel von Ompteda, commander of the brigade, shortly before the charge which cost his life, expressed his great appreciation publicly.|$|R

25|$|The {{first major}} {{literary}} work to popularise {{the subject of}} pirates was A General History of the Robberies and Murders {{of the most notorious}} Pyrates (1724) by Captain Charles Johnson, It is the prime source for the biographies of many well known pirates of the Golden Age, providing an extensive account of the period. In giving an almost mythical status to the more colourful characters, such as the notorious English pirates Blackbeard and Calico Jack, the book provided the standard account of the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> pirates in the Golden Age, and influenced pirate literature of Scottish novelists Robert Louis Stevenson and J. M. Barrie. While Johnson's text recounted the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> famous pirates from the era, it is likely that he used considerable licence in his accounts of pirate conversations.|$|E
