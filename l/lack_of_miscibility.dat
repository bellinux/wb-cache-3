The blends were prepared from 5 to 50 vol. % of paraffin wax employing a twin-screw extruder. Thermal behaviour of samples was determined by differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric and dynamic mechanical analyses. A displacement of melting temperature of polyethylene was detected {{as a consequence of}} the plasticization effect of wax. These results revealed that melting temperatures and latent heats of samples are suitable for their application as phase change materials. Blends were processed by injection moulding which is an advantageous method to obtain pieces of this kind of materials.

40|$|The atomic {{structures}} that develop {{as a function}} of coverage during deposition of Bi on Ag(111) have been studied using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and ab initio calculations. The growth process involves two sequential stages. At low coverage, Bi atoms are incorporated into the topmost layer of Ag(111), resulting in the formation of an Ag 2 Bi alloy confined to the surface and ordered (√ 3 ×√ 3) R 30 °Ag 2 Bi islands supported on Ag(111). This mode of accommodation of Bi was found to be energetically favorable based on ab initio total-energy calculations. At coverage above a critical value of 0. 55 monolayers, the Ag 2 Bi alloy phase gradually converts into an ordered Bi (p×√ 3) overlayer structure supported on Ag(111). We postulate that the dealloying transition is likely driven by compressive strain induced by incorporation of large-size Bi atoms into Ag at a high coverage and the subsequent <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>miscibility</b> of Ag and Bi bulk phases.

Compounded blends were evaluated for their mechanical and physical (optical) properties. The impact of photodegradation on the formulated blends was studied, and loss of mechanical integrity was apparent with respect to both the exposure duration to weathering and waste content. The effect of processing conditions, namely, the die head temperature (DHT) of the blown-film assembly used, was investigated in this work. It was witnessed that surpassing the melting point of the blends constituting polymers did not always result in a synergistic behaviour between polymers. This was suspected to be due to the loss of amorphous region that polyolefin polymers get subjected to with UV exposure under weathering conditions and the effect of the plastic waste constituents. The total change in colour (ΔE) did not change with respect to DHT or waste content due to rapid change degradation on the material’s surface.

However, due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>miscibility</b> between PLA and ASF, both being raw materials obtained from crops, resultant green composite presented poor ductility and low thermal stability. To overcome this limitation, maleinized linseed oil (MLO), a multi-functionalized plant-derived additive, was originally incorporated as a reactive compatibilizer during the extrusion process. Both chemical and physical characterizations showed that 1 – 5 parts per hundred resin (phr) of MLO successfully serve to obtain PLA/ASF composites with improved mechanical, thermal, and thermomechanical properties. The enhancement achieved was particularly related to a dual compatibilizing effect of plasticization in combination with melt grafting. The latter process was specifically ascribed {{to the formation of}} new carboxylic ester bonds through the reaction of the multiple maleic anhydride functionalities present in MLO with the hydroxyl groups of both the PLA terminal chains and cellulose on the ASF surface.

40|$|AbstractThe main aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} gas–oil relative permeability curves as the main flow function in different gas injection scenarios, immiscible and near miscible in case of highly fractured reservoirs. In this research, some experiments have been done on the reservoir core sample selected from sandstone formation {{in one of the}} Iranian naturally fractured oil reservoirs. The core is saturated with oil sample and CO 2 is injected into oil saturated core sample. Experiments have been performed on both of the sandstone and artificial fractured sandstone, represented as no fractured and highly fractured reservoirs, based on incremental pressure algorithm approaching into near miscible condition. Inverse modeling method has been used to calculate relative permeability curves. By comparing the relative permeability curves in immiscible and near-miscible conditions, the results show that in sandstone core type this change is considerable, but in highly artificial fractured sandstone with a high ratio of artificial fractured to sandstone absolute permeability (Kef /Ks) is not substantial. Moreover the results show that in the described case of artificial fractured core type so simple conventional relative permeability methods have the same results compared to a sophisticated inverse modeling method. The other main result is the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>miscibility</b> activation in near miscible injection through the highly fractured reservoirs leading to viscose dominant flow rather than capillary. Finally by considering this changing behavior, a better knowledge of gas front movement through highly fractured reservoirs in low IFT regions can be obtained...|$|E

The feature size, shape, composition, orientation, {{and order}} {{all contribute to}} device efficiency and are simultaneously difficult to study due to poor contrast between carbon based materials. This study seeks to increase device efficiency and simplify morphology measurements by replacing the typical fullerene acceptor with endohedral fullerene Lu 3 N@PC 80 BEH. The metal atoms give excellent scattering contrast for electron beam and X-ray experiments. Additionally, Lu 3 N@PC 80 BEH has a lower electron affinity than standard fullerenes, which can raise the open circuit voltage of photovoltaic devices. Electron microscopy techniques are used to produce {{a detailed account of}} morphology evolution in mixtures of Lu 3 N@PC 80 BEH with the record breaking donor polymer, PTB 7 and coated using solvent mixtures. We demonstrate that common solvent additives like 1, 8 -diiodooctane or chloronapthalene do not improve the morphology of endohedral fullerene devices as expected. The poor device performance is attributed to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> mutual <b>miscibility</b> between this particular polymer:fullerene combination and to co-crystallization of Lu 3 N@PC 80 BEH with 1, 8 -diiodooctane.

This feature can be exploited in many extraction processes, even ones which employ thermolabile liquids.

This thesis work is divided into different parts; at first the underlying theory will be presented, this outline ranges from statistical thermodynamics to incompressible binary mixture equation of motion, therefore the adopted numerical scheme will be described, together with the aspects related to the implementation of the mathematical expressions into the solver.

Despite the goodness of the paper there is a CFL constrain that is avoided in fluent given the implicit nature of the solver.

These structures have been studied using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, ab initio calculations and photoemission spectroscopy from core-levels and valence bands at room temperature. At 1 / 3 of a monolayer of Bi on Ag(111) leads to the formation of BiAg 2 surface alloy with a long range ordered (√ 3 ×√ 3) R 30 ° superstructure. A detailed analysis of this structure using LEED I-V measurements together with DFT calculations is presented. The Bi atom is found to replace one top layer Ag atom in each unit cell, forming a substitutional BiAg 2 surface alloy. This mode of accommodation of Bi was found to be energetically favourable based on ab initio total-energy calculations. Based on photoemission spectroscopy we find the sp-derived Shockley surface state on Ag(111) is rapidly quenched upon deposition of Bi, due to the strong variation of inplane surface potential in the Ag 2 Bi surface alloy. The core levels of Bi 4 f of the (√ 3 ×√ 3) R 30 ° Ag 2 Bi alloy and Bi(110) thin film are shifted to lower binding energy by ~ 0. 6 eV and ~ 0. 3 eV compared with the Bi bulk value, respectively. Mechanisms inducing the core level shifts are discussed as due to a complex superposition of several factors. At coverage above a critical value of 0. 55 monolayers, the Ag 2 Bi alloy phase gradually converts into an ordered Bi (p × √ 3) overlayer structure supported on Ag(111). We postulate that the dealloying transition is likely driven by compressive strain induced by incorporation of large-size Bi atoms into Ag at a high coverage and the subsequent <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>miscibility</b> of Ag and Bi bulk phases. After completion of the dealloying process, Bi(110) thin films can be grown epitaxially on top of Ag(111) with a chemically abrupt interface.

Quasicrystals, materials with aperiodic long-range order, are usually formed by at least two elements with a specific chemical composition.

This is achieved by the measurement of the free volume content in blends of carefully selected systems-styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) /poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), PMMA/poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and PVC/polystyrene (PS) -with positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The free Volume content can predict the miscible/ immiscible nature of the blends but provides no information on the extent <b>of</b> <b>miscibility</b> for different compositions of the blends. We have generalized a model used to understand the viscometric behavior of polymer/solvent systems to polymer/polymer systems through the free volume approach.

This work highlights the effect <b>of</b> <b>miscibility</b> on interdiffusion dynamics and interfacial behavior, employing both experimental and modeling tools.;Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) was used to quantify interdiffusion in the PS/PBS bilayers. PBS volume fraction versus depth profiles {{were obtained from the}} evolution of the bromine peak in the RBS spectra of these bilayers as a function of annealing time. From these profiles, mutual diffusion coefficients were calculated. In miscible PS/PBS systems, interdiffusion of the bilayers results in a single layer of constant composition. In bilayers with PS and PBS having a disparity in N, the interface is observed to move toward the faster diffusing (lower N) component, in agreement with the fast-mode theory of mobility. In partially miscible PS/PBS layers, interdiffusion is observed to occur until binodal conditions that agree with predicted phase diagrams are reached.;Interfacial widths (wi) in PS/PBS bilayers were measured with X-ray reflectivity (XR) and are in qualitative agreement with the results of RBS. It was observed in miscible systems that features corresponding to a bilayer configuration disappeared after short diffusion times, indicating complete interdiffusion, while partially miscible and immiscible systems retained bilayers features for even the longest annealing times, indicating interdiffusion to binodal conditions or minimal interdiffusion, respectively. Implications <b>of</b> the <b>miscibility</b> dependence <b>of</b> the mutual diffusion coefficient and interfacial width are discussed both in the context of theoretical arguments as well as for strengthening partially miscible polymer interfaces...|$|R
40|$|The <b>miscibility</b> <b>of</b> poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) PVP with {{copolymers}} of vinyl butyral and vinyl alcohol, containing 11 % and 19 % {{by weight}} of vinyl alcohol, has been investigated. To {{examine how the}} state <b>of</b> <b>miscibility</b> <b>of</b> these blends varies with the vinyl alcohol content of the copolymers, differential scanning calorimetry(DSC) and solid-state NMR methods were employed. PVP was found to form miscible blends with poly(vinyl butyral) PVB, containing 11 wt% of vinyl alcohol, up to a weight ratio of 40 / 60 (PVP/PVB 11). At higher PVP loading, phase separated blends were obtained. In contrast, poly(vinyl butyral) containing 19 wt% vinyl alcohol units {{was found to be}} miscible with PVP, over the entire composition range, with an estimated domain size of 2. 5 nm. Taken together, the results indicate the importance of the number of hydroxyl groups in achieving miscibility...|$|R
