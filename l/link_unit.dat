40|$|International audienceHerein {{we discuss}} band gap {{modification}} of MIL- 125, a TiO 2 / 1, 4 -benzenedicarboxylate (bdc) metal-organic framework (MOF). Through {{a combination of}} synthesis and computation, we elucidated the electronic structure of MIL- 125 with aminated linkers. The band gap decrease observed when the monoaminated bdc-NH 2 linker was used arises from donation of the N 2 p electrons to the aromatic <b>linking</b> <b>unit,</b> resulting in a red-shifted band above the valence-band edge of MIL- 125. We further explored in silico MIL- 125 with the diaminated linker bdc(NH 2) (2) and other functional groups (-OH, -CH 3, -Cl) as alternative substitutions to control the optical response. The bdc-(NH 2) 2 <b>linking</b> <b>unit</b> was predicted to lower the band gap of MIL- 125 to 1. 28 eV, and this was confirmed through the targeted synthesis of the bdc-(NH 2) (2) -based MIL,- 125. This study illustrates the possibility of tuning the optical response of MOFs through rational functionalization of the <b>linking</b> <b>unit,</b> {{and the strength of}} combined synthetic/computational approaches for targeting functionalized hybrid materials...|$|R

These could be disassembled by adding more Zn(II) ions and reassembled to form extended 3 D networks S 3 - 6 by inserting linear n-type or p-type <b>linking</b> <b>units.</b> BET data suggests that these expanded networks are more porous than the original networks S 1 - 2, but the low porosity and surface area suggest a high degree of interpenetration remains within the expanded networks.

Seafloor crustal {{deformation}} data will contribute significantly to understanding {{the nature of the}} tectonic processes at these plate boundaries. We have developed a seafloor positioning system with a GPS-acoustic link. This system consists of two main components; (1) the surface positioning by differential GPS to on-land reference and (2) the precise acoustic ranging using the M-sequence between the surface and seafloor references. The position and attitude of the surface GPS-acoustic <b>link</b> <b>unit</b> are determined from the GPS observations. Simultaneously, the acoustic ranging between the surface unit and seafloor references are carried out. The positions of the seafloor references are determined from these observations and a sound-speed structure model of the seawater. We performed preliminary seafloor positioning experiments. In these experiments, simple 1 -D structure models are assumed for the sound-speed in the sea. The results show that the positions of the seafloor references are estimated with an accuracy on order of 10 cm. The residuals for acoustic ranging imply that there are systematic differences between the assumed and real sound-speed structure. It is necessary to reduce the uncertainties of sound-speed structures for more accurate positioning.|$|E

Fuzzy logic control is very easy and simple to implement. This kind of control system does not require exact mathematical model to represent output {{as a function of}} input. Input and Output have membership functions that are related with rules. Those membership functions are required to perform three major processes in fuzzy logic control which are Fuzzification, Rule Evaluation and Defuzzification. The system, which is designed, is a Fuzzy Control Unit minimum system that is designed to work with Omron PLC. This system provides fuzzy logic control facility for PLC. Using this Fuzzy Control Unit, a PLC can perform fuzzy logic contiol easily. This Fuzzy logic control is connected to a PLC thru Host <b>Link</b> <b>Unit</b> for data transmission, and is connected to computer to develop fuzzy's membership functions and rules. This Fuzzy Control Unit will start fuzzy calculation due to specific flag activation at certain memory location in PLC. Right after the flag is active the unit will take normalized fuzzy input, and then perform fuzzy calculation according to membership functions and rules, which are already stored in the system and previously downloaded from computer. After the fuzzy calculation is completed, the result will be sent to specific memory location in the PLC and the result flag will be activated. From the experiment which use a PC Motor Speed Control System, shows that Fuzzy Logic Control using the Fuzzy Control Unit works well with PLC and the time required for one fuzzy calculation process is relatively fast...|$|E

Vacancy production, radiation-induced segregation of substitutional Cr at defect clusters (point defect sinks) in BCC Fe-Cr ferritic/martensitic steels 3.

Energetics and kinetics of dislocation bypass of defects formed by interstitial clustering and formation of prismatic loops, informing statistical models of continuum character with regard to processes of dislocation glide, vacancy agglomeration and swelling, climb and cross slip This project will consider the Fe, Fe-C, and Fe-Cr ferritic/martensitic material system, accounting for magnetism by choosing appropriate interatomic potentials and validating with first principles calculations.
