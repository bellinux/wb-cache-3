With a step-like <b>loading</b> <b>path,</b> namely the internal pressure is increased step by step, among the steps, the pressure is kept constant, and the strain rate of bulging can be kept into a small range. Thus the deformation around the hoop direction is more even than the linear <b>loading</b> <b>path,</b> and than bursting can be postponed. During bulging, the inner pressure should be lowered with the increase of diameter to keep the strain rate in a small range around a constant value.

40|$|Abstract. Tube {{hydroforming}} {{process is}} a well-established manufacturing process widely employed to form tubular parts that are lighter and stronger compared to those from stampings. Nevertheless, determination of process <b>loading</b> <b>paths,</b> i. e. axial feed distance versus hydraulic pressure, still typically relies on trial-and-error FEM approach. In this paper, a semi-forward adaptive simulation concept is proposed as an effective FEM approach, able to select a feasible THF <b>loading</b> <b>path</b> within a single FEM simulation run. The semi-forward adaptive simulation technique {{is based on the}} ability to “adapt ” or adjust the <b>loading</b> <b>path</b> as to keep the forming strains within a preferred stain trajectory {{over the course of a}} simulation run. Forming strains at the current simulation time step are used as inputs to the fuzzy logic control; the output sets are then used to readjust the <b>loading</b> <b>path</b> for the current and next time steps. This semi-forward adaptive simulation scheme allows one to “correct ” the <b>loading</b> <b>path</b> at the current time step as well as to better predict the forming strains in the next time step. It was found that the corrective and predictive nature of this semi-forward simulation approach coupled with the strain trajectory based fuzzy logic control scheme could handle a highly non-linear forming behavior of tube hydroforming processes effectively. In this work, a feasible <b>loading</b> <b>path</b> was determined thru only one simulation run for successful hydroforming of an eccentric bulged tubular part...|$|R
