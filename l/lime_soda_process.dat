40|$|Twenty One Educational Institutes of Gondia Block were visited {{throughout}} the year to collect the drinking water samples. The different parameters such as dissolved oxygen, total solids, chlorides, hardness, alkalinity, temperature and pH were tested in the Laboratory of M. I. E. T., Gondia (M. S.). All the parameters were compared with the standards of drinking water as per ICMR & WHO. After the analysis of season wise, {{it is found that}} nearly all the parameters are within the permissible limit except the hardness in some water samples. The samples having more hardness are nearly permissible limit in bore wells water, and increase in hardness is mainly due to the location of these bore wells in rocky area. To remove the level of hardness to the permissible limit, a pilot treatment unit (<b>lime</b> <b>soda</b> <b>process)</b> is proposed which is economical & affordable to the institutes.

30|$|The {{process of}} caustic {{embrittlement}} occurs in boilers {{and leads to}} formation of cracks on the riveted mild steel plates. The temperature ranges from 200 to 250  °C, which further leads to deposition of concentrated hydroxide on the waterside of the boiler [46]. We can also explain caustic embrittlement as a phenomenon where boiler becomes brittle, due to accumulation of caustic soda [47]. Caustic embrittlement {{is also known as}} stress corrosion cracking [46]. Caustic embrittlement is caused due to the presence of caustic soda in the boiler feed water, which is in direct contact with the steel and drums of the boiler [48]. In the boiler, when the water evaporates, the concentration of sodium carbonate increases. Sodium carbonate is used for the softening of water via. <b>lime</b> <b>soda</b> <b>process.</b> During this process, there are chances that some of the sodium carbonate particles may be left behind. With the passage of time, the concentration of sodium carbonate increases, and it undergoes hydrolysis to form sodium hydroxide. When the concentration of sodium hydroxide increases by a certain amount, it makes water alkaline. This alkaline water enters into small cracks of inner walls of the boiler. Evaporation of this water leads to a continuous increase in the amount of sodium hydroxide present in the boiler tubes. This sodium hydroxide attacks the iron present on the boilers and dissolves it; thus, forming sodium ferrate, which further leads to caustic embrittlement [49].|$|E

40|$|The {{spectacular}} {{increase in}} lithium battery applications {{has raised the}} question of whether global lithium resources will be enough in the future. Experts in the field have estimated that the existing lithium resources will probably be sufficient to support demands until the year 2100, assuming that lithium batteries are recycled. Without lithium batteries being recycled, the resources are expected to be depleted in 50 years’ time. Therefore, there is a great interest in developing better methods of lithium recycling from batteries, and also, better methods of lithium extraction from natural resources. Currently, lithium is extracted from natural brines via the <b>lime</b> <b>soda</b> evaporation <b>process,</b> i. e. a solar evaporation plus chemical plant process, which takes between 12 and 24 months. The drawbacks of this process are that it is complex, slow and inefficient. Also, the currently available methods of lithium recycling from batteries are too complex and expensive. Thus, the main objective of this work is to develop a novel, inexpensive and less timeconsuming approach to recover lithium chemically, from the lithium salts (lithium sources) that contain other metal cations. The new process is also based on environmental concerns. A battery material, lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4) has the olivine structure and heterosite structure once it discharges to iron phosphate (FePO 4). This structure shows excellent properties of the charge/discharge reversibility. A few studies on the heterosite FePO 4 have reported that it is more selective for lithium ions (Li+) over other cations. The main advantages of this structure are the small potential differences of the redox couple, i. e. Fe(II) /Fe(III), and the stability of LiFePO 4 over a wide range of acid-based conditions in an aqueous solution. This work investigates a novel process that may be superior to the <b>lime</b> <b>soda</b> evaporation <b>process</b> for extracting lithium. Heterosite FePO 4 was employed to selectively remove Li+ from lithium sources with the support of a reducing agent, i. e. sodium thiosulphate (Na 2 S 2 O 3). The resulting LiFePO 4 can be directly sent not only to lithium battery industries, but also to other industrial uses. In principle, the other cations could be retrieved back into their sources. The novel process was examined and demonstrated lithium insertion into a heterosite FePO 4, working as a framework, in aqueous salt solutions. The evaluation of this process is presented by the Li+ uptake value. The amount of Li+ uptake can be up to 46 mgLi +/gsolid where other cations (i. e. sodium, potassium, and magnesium) can take less than 3 mg/gsolid, using this process. Furthermore. This work could also be developed for future lithium recycling processes. <br/...|$|R

The insertion of Cr thin films between glass substrates and a-Si significantly improves the adhesion of Si films to the glass substrates, resulting in uniform crystallization of a-Si in 20 × 20 mm^ 2 area. Several types of substrate, such as quartz substrates, are also used instead of <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> glass to elucidate {{the effects of the}} properties of glass substrates on formation of the poly-Si films.

AMSORB® PLUS was used during the first four weeks and <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> (Intersurgical) the following four weeks. General anaesthesia was administered as routinely done but fresh gas flow (FGF) during the maintenance phase was limited to a maximum flow of 2 L/min. The CO 2 absorber was only changed when there was evidence of exhaustion. Total duration of anaesthesia, sevoflurane (bottles) and CO 2 absorber (kg) consumption, and amount of waste product (kg) was calculated {{at the end of}} each study period. The total cost of delivering general anaesthesia was lower in the AMSORB® PLUS group, RM 82. 40 (USD 19. 89) /hour versus the <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> group, RM 91. 50 (USD 22. 09) /hour (p= 0. 17), which translates to a 10 % reduction in cost per hour. Reduction in sevoflurane consumption in the AMSORB® PLUS compared to the <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> group was also not statistically significant (p= 0. 22).

In conclusion, AMSORB® PLUS consumption was significantly reduced compared to that of <b>soda</b> <b>lime.</b> However, the use of AMSORB® PLUS did not significantly reduce sevoflurane consumption nor the total cost of delivering general anaesthesia.
