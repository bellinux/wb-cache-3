In a distinctly Malthusian fashion, Postan proposed that the English agrarian economy saw little technical development during the period and by the early 14th century was unable to support the growing population, leading to inevitable famines and economic depression as the population came back into balance with <b>land</b> <b>resources.</b> Postan began the trend towards stressing continuities between the pre- and post-invasion economies, aided by fresh evidence emerging {{from the use of}} archaeological techniques to understand the medieval economy from the 1950s onwards.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the present <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> {{surveying}} methods and techniques used in Eritrea, to evaluate different methods and techniques of <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> surveying which are currently in use in various parts of the world, to design improved methods and techniques of <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> surveying for Eritrea and to indicate the importance of cost-effective ways of <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> surveying in achieving optimal land use. A literature survey of methods and techniques of soil, rangeland, and agro-climatic survey was done in-depth. An analysis was conducted on the present resource surveying methodologies and techniques used in Eritrea. International publications on <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> surveying methods and techniques were studies and evaluation of their appropriateness for Eritrea was conducted. Finally an appropriate and affordable set of <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> surveying methodologies and techniques are proposed for Eritrea. The main conclusion of the study is to adapt international methods and techniques of resource surveying which are appropriate under the country’s socio-economic and technical conditions. Developing local methods and techniques under present condition is not possible due to various reasons. Dissertation (M Inst Agrar (Land-use Planning)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

25|$|When the Great Smoky Mountains National Park {{was opened}} in 1934, the Tennessee Valley Authority {{reported}} {{that there were no}} tourism-oriented businesses in Pigeon Forge. By the 1950s, improvements to US-441 led to the establishment of a few campgrounds and lodges, but little that would generate major revenue. During this period, however, two factors in nearby Gatlinburg would lead to the commercial boom Pigeon Forge would experience {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century. First, Gatlinburg, itself surrounded by high mountain ridges, had limited <b>land</b> <b>resources.</b> Second, the <b>land</b> <b>resources</b> it did have were largely controlled by a few local families who thwarted attempts by outside businesses to take advantage of the town's prime location. Thus, outside entrepreneurs were forced to look elsewhere. Pigeon Forge, being just north of Gatlinburg along US-441, was a target.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Autesserre's most {{well-known}} {{research focuses on}} local violence and international intervention {{in the eastern part}} of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It culminated in her book, The Trouble with the Congo: Local Violence and the Failure of International Peacebuilding, released by Cambridge University Press in 2010. This book explains why international efforts to end civil wars so often fail. Drawing from over 330 interviews and a year and a half of field research, it presents a case study of the international intervention during the Democratic Republic of Congo’s unsuccessful transition from war to peace and democracy (2003-2006). It argues that local rivalries over <b>land,</b> <b>resources,</b> and political power motivated widespread violence. However, an international peacebuilding culture shaped the intervention strategy in a way that precluded action on local conflicts, ultimately dooming the international effort.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the era of}} European colonization, {{those in}} power {{routinely}} partitioned land masses and created borders that are still in place today. It {{has been estimated that}} Britain and France traced almost 40% of the entire length of today’s international boundaries. Sometimes boundaries were naturally occurring, like rivers or mountains, but other times these borders were artificially created and agreed upon by colonial powers. The Berlin Conference of 1884 systemized European colonization in Africa and is frequently acknowledged as the genesis of the Scramble for Africa. The Conference implemented the Principle of Effective Occupation in Africa which allowed European states with even the most tenuous connection to an African region to claim dominion over its <b>land,</b> <b>resources,</b> and people. In effect, it allowed for the arbitrary construction of sovereign borders in a territory where they had never previously existed.|$|E

After the Six Day War, when Israel occupied the Palestinian territories, water use and sanitation have been closely linked to developments in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The water and <b>land</b> <b>resources</b> in the West Bank in particular are considered to constitute the major obstacle to the resolution of conflict in the area. Palestinians claim they have a legal right to ownership, or claim to use of three water sources in the area:(a)the groundwater reservoir of the Mountain Aquifer, the Gaza Strip Coastal Aquifer and the Jordan River to the amount of 700 MCM/Y, over 50% of natural water resources between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Agricultural Economics)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The study broadly {{assesses the}} {{usefulness}} of available digital spatial <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> data {{as a source for}} agritourism and ecotourism information by comparing the inventory of available spatial data sets for South Africa and the SADC region, with the needs for spatial data as derived from a literature study of travel motivations and demand determinants. Spatial <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> data have been collected, processed and stored for agricultural planning purposes, like land suitability assessment, agricultural production and infrastructural planning. Given a) the growth in agritourism and ecotourism, b) the more detailed information required by tourists to aid them during decision making processes like destination selection and c) the progress in information technology rendering access of information via the internet easier; the question arose whether the available <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> digital data can be processed to provide relevant tourism information on internet websites. Four tasks had to be done, namely: a) identifying tourists’ needs by means of a literature study on travel motivations and demand determinants; b) identifying the <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> data sets that could be processed into information to meet these identified needs; c) determining the accessibility of spatial information on internet tourism websites to potential agritourists and ecotourists, and d) exploring opportunities for adding value by looking at what information existing websites are offering in comparison with what can be obtained from repackaging the <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> data. Common ground was found between the spatial tourist information needs and the available spatial <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> data. This, coupled with the ability of combining meteorological and other humanmade environmental data in GIS modelling, suggests that repackaging <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> data seems to have the potential to offer useful tourism information in correspondence with confirmed tourist information needs...|$|R

25|$|Harvests of P. clarkii {{account for}} a large {{majority}} of the crayfish produced in the United States and elsewhere. Crayfish farming began in Louisiana in the 18th century, taking place in rice fields in a concurrent or alternate culture system. The concurrent culture of rice and crayfish makes good use of <b>land,</b> <b>resources,</b> equipment, and infrastructure already being used for rice production. However, crawfish production has decreased in recent years due to an increase of imports from China, which is now the world's leading producer of crawfish and is also using a rice-based system. A number of species of crustaceans were introduced to China to create markets for aquaculture and because they are better adapted to growing in a rice field than native fish species. Rice-fish farming originated in China and is once again growing as the yields from Green Revolution practices used to grow rice are no longer increasing, and resources such as land and water are becoming more limited.|$|E
