40|$|This paper describes, the {{experimental}} {{performance of a}} fabricated single grooved Parallel Coupled Microstrip Bandpass Filter (PCMBF) on a low cost <b>laminate</b> <b>board,</b> with improved passband response and first harmonic suppression for various operating bandwidth. The suppression of the first harmonic spurious response is possible through transmission zero frequency realignment method. A single groove of specific dimensions located {{at the center of}} the parallel coupled line has been employed for the realignment of the transmission zero and first harmonic frequencies. An implemented single-stage bandpass filter with various coupling gaps, on a low cost <b>laminate</b> <b>board,</b> showed excellent harmonics suppressions with optimized groove. Then, two-stage bandpass filters of different operating bandwidth were designed for optimized groove. It was then implemented on a low cost <b>laminate</b> <b>board</b> and tested.

The process does not require the use of steam pretreatment, surface activation methods, a gastight press, friction or adhesives. It strictly involves the heat and the pressure induced by the press in the veneers. The levels of temperature, pressure and time leading to the highest bending-strength values when material factors are held constant are investigated. The objective of optimizing the process is reached using response surface methodology for modelling and analysis. The parameter interactions are found to be significant.

40|$|The wood {{industry}} applies hard metal tools which combine good performance with high final cutting surface quality. Possibilities {{for increasing the}} performance of hard metal tools are surface hardening by thermo-chemical treatments or covering with hard coatings. A promising technique for wood-working tools is gas boronizing because of increasing the surface hardness {{as well as the}} corrosion resistance against aggressive organic components in wood. Three WC-Co grades with cobalt contents of 2, 4 and 10 % were used as substrate materials. The wedge angle of the cutting inserts is 55 o. Gas boronizing was performed using a wide area of process parameters. Temperature, total pressure, BCl 3 -concentration and boronizing time were varied systematically and the surface zones were characterized by metallography, SEM, TEM, EDX, GDOES depth profiling, hardness and surface roughness.
