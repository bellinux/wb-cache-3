40|$|This {{contains}} the original Phys. Rev. Lett. article and the supplementary information fileWe show that, {{contrary to the}} common wisdom, surface plasmon poles {{are not involved in}} the imaging process in <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> microscopy. Identifying the <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> modes directly from a transverse magnetic potential leads us to reconsider the surface plasmon field and unfold the non-plasmonic contribution to the image formation. While both contributions interfere in the imaging process, our analysis reveals that the reassessed plasmonic field embodies a pole mathematically similar to the usual surface plasmon pole. This removes a long-standing ambiguity associated with plasmonic signals in <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> microscopy...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the distribution of <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> from two unshielded diagnostic-type X-ray tube housings. This information was used to determine the shielding required in the housings to bring them into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing, as set forth by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements in Report No. 33. Two special diagnostic X-ray tube units were used, one containing a rotating anode tube and the other a stationary anode tube. The only shielding supplied was that provided by the steel, oil-containing tube casing which surrounds the X-ray tube. A measurement of the distribution of <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> on a sphere of one meter radius about the focal spot of the X-ray tube was made on each tube when the tube was operated at its maximum rated continuous current for its maximum rated operating voltage. From the <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> measured, the thickness of lead shielding required to bring the X-ray tube housing into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing was calculated. Lead shielding was placed on each of the X-ray tube housings, and measurements were made to determine if each housing was then in compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing. As a result of this study, it was found that the distribution of <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> from an unshielded diagnostic-type tube housing is non-uniform. The amount and location of shielding required in the housing is dependent upon the distribution of the <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation,</b> and is, therefore, a function of the design and rating of the X-ray tube used in the housing...|$|E

5000|$|The iris {{hypothesis}} is a hypothesis proposed by Richard Lindzen et al. in 2001 that suggested increased sea surface {{temperature in the}} tropics would result in reduced cirrus clouds and thus more infrared <b>radiation</b> <b>leakage</b> from Earth's atmosphere. His study of observed changes in cloud coverage and modeled effects on infrared radiation released to space as a result supported the hypothesis. [...] This suggested infrared <b>radiation</b> <b>leakage</b> was hypothesized to be a negative feedback in which an initial warming would result in an overall cooling of the surface. The consensus view is that increased sea surface temperature would result in increased cirrus clouds and reduced infrared <b>radiation</b> <b>leakage</b> and therefore a positive feedback.|$|R

To establish the correct chamber configuration required for the characterization of the transmission factors for primary, <b>leakage</b> and scatter <b>radiation</b> and to determine the scatter-to-incidence dose ratio a, we have measured the build-up curves and verified the validity of the inverse square law for these different radiations.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{attenuation}} coefficients of 20 tropical hard wood species {{based on their}} linear and mass attenuation and half value layer (HVL) properties for X-rays of energy 50 – 150 keV using a narrow collimated beam from a Cs- 137 source. The narrow collimated beam method made corrections from multiple and small-angle scatterings of photons unnecessary. The attenuation depended on the chemical composition and densities of the wood species. The linear attenuation coefficients of wood species at 50 – 150 keV were highest for Pterygota macrocarpa (4. 53 m− 1) and lowest for Antiaris africana (1. 24 m− 1); the mass attenuation coefficient was highest for Triplochiton scleroxylon (17. 62 m 2 /kg) and lowest for Nesogordonia papaverifera (2. 27 m 2 /kg). The HVL was highest for Antiaris africana (0. 27 m) and lowest for Pterygota macrocarpa (0. 149 m).

The public {{security}} industry standard “General technical requirements for micro-dose X-ray transmission body scanner ” (GA 926 - 2011) {{was released in}} March 25, 2011 and was formally implemented in July 1, 2011.

40|$|Introduction: Recent {{increase}} of endocrine disorders may be correlated {{to the increased}} exposure to electromagnetic fields from various instruments. <b>Radiation</b> <b>leakage</b> from microwave oven may be harmful for users. Ladies have {{the highest levels of}} contact with microwave ovens. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of <b>radiation</b> <b>leakage</b> from microwave oven on body weight, cortisol and thyroid hormones. Methods: <b>Radiation</b> <b>leakage</b> of microwave oven was measured by RF measuring instrument. For this study, 20 adult two-month-old female mice weighing 25 - 28 g were randomly divided in control and test groups. Test group was exposed to 2450 MHZ microwaves produced by a microwave oven 3 times a day, 30 minutes each time. After 60 days, body weights of both groups were determined and blood was collected by heart puncture. Cortisol and thyroid levels were evaluated in serum by an RIA method. Results: <b>radiation</b> <b>leakage</b> from oven showed variation and ranged from 6. 5 to 57. 5 mW/cm 2. Mean body weight changes in test and control groups were 0 and 4. 54 grams, respectively. Cortisol (23. 6 ± 2. 24 vs. 13. 6 ± 1. 47 ng/ml) and T 4 (98. 4 ± 7. 3 vs. 67. 0 ± 5. 9 nmol/L) levels were significantly increased in the test group compared to the control group, respectively. Level of T 3 did not alter significantly. Conclusion: We found that microwaves leaked from oven decrease body weight and increase T 4 and cortisol levels, and therefore have deleterious health effects...|$|R

30|$|We {{present a}} method to couple surface plasmon {{polariton}} (SPP) guiding mode into dielectric-loaded SPP waveguide (DLSPPW) devices with spectral and mode selectivity. The method combined a transmission-mode near-field spectroscopy to excite the SPP mode and a <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> optical microscope for direct visualization. By using a near-field fiber tip, incident photons with different wavelengths were converted into SPPs at the metal/dielectric interface. Real-time SPP radiation images were taken through <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> images. The wavelength-dependent propagation lengths for silver- and gold-based DLSPPWs were measured and compared. It confirms that silver-based SPP has a propagation length longer than a gold-based one by 1.25, 1.38, and 1.52 times for red, green, and blue photons. The resonant coupling {{as a function of}} wavelength in dual DLSPPWs was measured. The coupling lengths measured from <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> images were in good agreement with finite-difference time domain simulations. In addition, the propagation profile due to multi-SPP modes interference was studied by changing position of the fiber tip. In a multimode DLSPPW, SPP was split into two branches with a gap of 2.237 μm when the tip {{was at the center of}} the waveguide. It became a zigzag profile when the SPP was excited at the corner of the waveguide.|$|E
40|$|The thesis work {{contains}} two related projects. The first project examines {{the characteristics of}} the Farmer-type ionization chamber (Farmer-type IC 2571 A) used in our experiments. An investigation was carried out to determine if the simplified "two-voltage technique" used in clinics is sufficiently accurate for saturation current estimation. Three models were used to fit the measured currents and to estimate the saturation current. The estimation was carried out by measuring the currents set-up in the Farmer-type IC while varying the applied voltages, for both polarities, for fixed and variable dose rates. The second project investigated peripheral dose in 6 MV beam using the Farmer-type IC. The signal produced in the ionization chamber when measuring the peripheral dose is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the signal produced with the chamber in the primary beam, thus, the leakage and saturation characteristics of the ionization chamber had to be investigated to ensure {{that they do not have}} adverse effects on the chamber reading. Measurements were acquired in open field (10 x 10 cm 2) and in a dynamic MLC field (10 x 1 cm 2), with the IC at the machine's isocenter. Measurements allowed us to determine peripheral dose due to scatter and <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation.</b> Measurements were repeated for a blocked beam, which allow us to determine only the <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> component of the peripheral dose. The two components of the peripheral dose depend strongly on the linac head configuration and shielding. <b>Leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> per MU for a dMLC field is similar or higher than the <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> for a static field, which implies an increase in peripheral dose for IMRT-type treatments. Knowledge of peripheral dose can be useful in estimating dose and risk to sensitive structures outside of the primary treatment field...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Collimators {{are used}} in {{radiosurgery}} or radiotherapy systems to accurately focus their high-energy rays on the target to avoid causing damage to the collateral healthy tissues. With the development of conformal radiotherapy techniques, variable visual field collimators (VVFC) are widely used and many designs of VVFC have been proposed.

Therefore, in this paper, an innovative design of VVFC is proposed through analyzing the original VVFC, determining the conflicts and solving them using the inventive problem solving methods (TRIZ).

30|$|The {{system was}} used to study the {{propagation}} properties of the DLSPPW. The SPP mode in the DLSPPW has a propagation constant β[*]=[*]β′[*]+[*]iβ″ with an effective index (nspp), where nspp[*]=[*]β/k 0. The effective index is the equivalent refractive index of the surface plasmon waveguide. It depends on the wavelength, modes, dielectric constants of materials, and geometry of the waveguide. That can be calculated by numerical method [13] or determined by Fourier plane analysis [14]. For a dielectric stripe with a refractive index similar to the glass substrate, the nspp will be smaller than the index of glass (ng[*]=[*] 1.48). The metallic film thickness is smaller than 100 nm; therefore, the SPP mode will have an evanescent tail in the glass substrate. It results in a small leakage of light, radiating at an angle (θ) of sin-[*] 1 (nspp/ng). The angular wave vector of the <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> {{is the same as}} nspp and larger than air. Conventional optical microscope with an air lens cannot image the SPP mode. In the system, we applied a high numerical aperture (NA[*]=[*] 1.45) oil objective. The 1.45 NA is larger than the nspp which can collect the <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> from the SPP mode. The intensity distribution of the leakage light is proportional to the SPP mode profile. Therefore, the propagation properties of SPP mode in the DLSPPW can be directly observed by recoding the <b>leakage</b> <b>radiation</b> images from a CCD camera.|$|E
