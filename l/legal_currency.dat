25|$|The {{introduction}} of adópengő {{was an attempt}} to keep inflation amongst limits, however, it could only slow down somewhat but did not stop the depreciation of the currency.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} design for {{complementary}} community currencies for education communities to boost {{cooperation of the}} more advanced students with the less advanced ones. Its design follows two goals: motivating students to learn by doing extra homework (effort) and share knowledge with younger students (tutoring), and shifting the role of teachers towards a more supervisory, tutoring and dynamic tasks. The hypothesis, following a Brazilian example, is that colleges may accept as payment for their tuitions not only conventional <b>legal</b> <b>currencies,</b> but also educational complementary currencies. The traditional grants policies based on personal effort will be paid with bunnies, and modern community tutoring effort will be paid with knowls. The bunnies and knowls will be obtained as a reward of doing homework and providing help for homework, respectively, and as an expected result, students will have more solid knowledge background at all levels resulting from their boosted personal and community effort. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{circulation}} of this metallic currency declined during the Republic: the old {{gold and silver}} coins were taken out of circulation and exchanged for printed assignats, initially issued as bonds backed by {{the value of the}} confiscated goods of churches, but later declared as <b>legal</b> tender <b>currency.</b> The withdrawn gold and silver coins were used to finance wars and to import food, which was in short supply.|$|R

25|$|The {{end result}} {{was a series of}} {{circular}} clear discs with colored centers, symbolizing the eight planets of the Solar System inside, and denominations ranging from 1 to 10.

25|$|When the Temporary Provisions {{were made}} {{ineffective}} in 1991, the ROC lacked a legal national currency {{until the year}} 2000, when the Central Bank of China (CBC) replaced the Bank of Taiwan in issuing NT bills. In July 2000, the New Taiwan dollar became Taiwan's <b>legal</b> <b>currency.</b> It is no longer secondary to the silver yuan. At this time, the central bank began issuing New Taiwan dollar banknotes, and the notes issued earlier by the Bank of Taiwan were taken out of circulation.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} states are less {{integrated}} into the EU than others. In most cases this is because those states have gained an opt-out from a certain policy area. The most notable is the opt-out from the Economic and Monetary Union, {{the adoption of the}} euro as sole <b>legal</b> <b>currency.</b> Most states outside the Eurozone are obliged to adopt the euro when they are ready, but Denmark and the United Kingdom have obtained the right to retain their own independent currencies.|$|E

25|$|On July 30, 2002, the 1933 {{double eagle}} {{was sold to}} an {{anonymous}} bidder at a Sotheby's auction held in New York for $6.6 million, plus a 15-percent buyer's premium, and an additional $20 needed to “monetize” the face value of the coin so it would become <b>legal</b> <b>currency.</b> This brought the final sale price to $7,590,020.00, almost twice the previous record for a coin.

The auction took less than nine minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{metric system}} was {{introduced}} in 1803, as was the franc, worth one hundred centimes, and the sou, worth five centimes. The gold Napoleon coin was worth either 20 or 40 francs, and the government also issued silver coins worth five, two and one franc. The government {{did not have the}} resources to collect and remake all the coins of the former regimes, so the gold Louis, with an image of the King, worth 24 pounds, and the écu, a silver count worth three of six pounds, were also <b>legal</b> <b>currency.</b> The coins of all the states within the Empire were also in circulation, including those of the German states, northern and central Italy, the Netherlands, and the Austrian Netherlands (now Belgium).|$|E
25|$|After Norway {{achieved}} constitutional {{independence in}} 1814, {{in the period}} of romantic nationalism that followed, the urban ‘cultural élite’ as well as some farmers themselves began to consider the ‘Norwegian farmer’ as representative or a symbolic figure of ‘Norwegianness’. Norwegian farmers had always been relatively free compared to farmers in continental Europe, something to which the lack of a large and strong nobility had contributed. Farmers had in general sufficient amounts of food, and lived ‘in peaceful and natural circumstances’. Furthermore, {{from the middle of the}} 18th century, and peaking in the 19th, many Norwegian farmers managed to buy their own farms. Factors like these contributed to some farmers coming to regard themselves as a kind of farmer nobility. Such ideas are reflected, for example, in romantic nationalistic literature, but the term has never had any <b>legal</b> <b>currency</b> in Norway, and such farmers were and remained commoners.|$|E
