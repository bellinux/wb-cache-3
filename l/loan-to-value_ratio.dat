The results {{of the use of}} a modified Black-Scholes option model suggest that <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios</b> are bound from below by borrowers' desires to maximize project leverage in a limited liability setting and constrained from above by lenders' requirement to originate loans with institutional-grade (Baa) contract interest rates. Given the prevailing risk-free rate and the investment-grade rate, this model at the time of mortgage origination predicts the possibility of default for a new commercial mortgage.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has proposed a}} pro-cyclical link between sales volume and prices {{in the real estate}} market through changes in the equity of existing homeowners. This article uses data from the Boston condominium market to show that owners with high <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios</b> take longer to sell their properties than owners with low loan-to- value ratios. Properties with high <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios</b> are listed at higher asking prices; when sold, they receive higher prices than units with less debt. Together, these results are consistent with a search model in which owners 'constrained' by large amounts of debt set a higher reservation price than 'unconstrained' owners, accepting a lower probability of sale in exchange for a higher final sales price. ...|$|R

40|$|Without a {{subprime}} market, some borrowers {{by virtue}} of poor credit history, unstable income, and other characteristics are unable {{to qualify for a}} mortgage. With a subprime market, there is a more complete credit supply schedule with the market pricing for poorer credit quality in the mortgage rate. By completing the capital market, subprime lenders reduce borrowing constraints. The result is a social welfare gain. Low-credit applicants otherwise denied funding are able to qualify by paying higher interest rates in exchange for offering more equity or lower <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios.</b> This prediction is consistent with the subprime applicants financing or refinancing their mortgages at relatively low <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios.</b> Copyright Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2004 mortgages, market completion, subprime lending,...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{mortgage}} lenders {{do not charge}} HLCs.

5000|$|However, if the {{property}} values decrease, {{it is likely}} that the borrower will owe more on {{the property}} than it is worth, known colloquially in the mortgage industry as [...] "being underwater." [...] In this situation, if the property owner cannot make the new monthly payment, he or she may be faced with foreclosure or having to refinance with a very high <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratio,</b> requiring additional monthly obligations, such as mortgage insurance, and higher rates and payments due to the adversity of a high <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the effect of {{implicit}} seller reserves on the estimation of value-at-risk based on historical asset sales data. We direct our examination toward how and whether fine art might prove an appropriate form of loan collateral for banks and other financial institutions. Using a data set of French Impressionist paintings brought to auction from 1985 to 2001, we control for the effect of works that are bought in-house to construct a distribution of potential sale values that corrects for sample selection bias. It turns out that the downside risk surrounding deviations of auction prices from expert presale estimates depends critically on how buy-ins are incorporated. If downside risk is assessed solely on historical experience with successful auction sales, the data appear to support <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios</b> between fifty and a hundred percent larger than <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios</b> that countenance the existence of seller reserves. The auction process, however, appears quantifiable and can reveal the necessary default risk information required for loan consideration...|$|R
40|$|We use city-level data {{to analyze}} the {{relationship}} between homeowner borrowing patterns and house-price dynamics.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the correlation between}} <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios</b> and probability of default, and tests alternative cost-based default models, {{using data from the}} portfolios of FSLIC and a major regional lender. The theoretical premises for the research are synthesized from a review of the linkages between supply and demand for space, and for capital; and of the appraisal process and its reliability. Two major conclusions are drawn from statistical evidence: (1) there is no apparent correlation between value-based underwriting criteria and between default, and (2) hard cost-based criteria correlate closely to probability of default. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse how the {{availability}} of credit influences the relationship between government size {{as a proxy for}} fiscal stabilization policy and the amplitude of business cycle fluctuations in a sample of advanced OECD countries. Interpreting relatively low <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios</b> as an indication of tight credit constraints, we find that government size exerts a stabilizing effect on output and consumption growth fluctuations only when credit constraints are relatively tight.

40|$|We {{develop and}} {{estimate}} a unified model of house prices, <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios</b> (LTVs), and trade and foreclosure behavior. House prices are only observed for traded properties, and trades are endogenous, creating sample-selection problems for traditional estimators. We develop a Bayesian filtering procedure {{to recover the}} price path for each individual property and produce selection-corrected estimates of historical LTVs and foreclosure behavior, both showing large unprecedented changes since 2007. Our model reduces the index revision problem by nearly half, and has applications in economics and finance (e. g., pricing mortgage-backed securities). ...|$|R

50|$|Beginning {{with the}} advent of the FHA, <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios</b> {{steadily}} increased, alleviating the need for borrowers to hold multiple mortgages as was the case with the Philadelphia Plan. In a continuing effort to thicken the residential mortgage market, the Federal Government created the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae), which purchased mortgages issued under the auspices of the FHA in order to create a large secondary market for residential mortgages. The FHA applied increasingly stringent terms as time progressed, and by the 1950s many mortgages had increased terms to some 30 years, which has since become the industry standard.|$|R

50|$|Millions of borrowers found {{themselves}} in a difficult predicament after the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2008. As inventories soared nationwide, home prices plummeted. Many new homeowners saw the value of their homes drop below the balance of their mortgages, or nearly so. Later, these same homeowners were prevented from taking advantage of lower interest rates through refinancing, since banks traditionally require a <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratio</b> (LTV) of 80% or less to qualify for refinancing without private mortgage insurance (PMI).|$|E
50|$|Congressional {{deregulation}} {{exacerbated the}} S&L crisis. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 {{led to a}} boom in commercial real estate. The passage of DIDMCA and the Garn-St. Germain Act expanded the authority of federally chartered S&Ls to make acquisition, development, and construction real estate loans, and the statutory limit on <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios</b> was eliminated. The changes allowed S&Ls to make high-risk loans to developers. Beginning in 1982, many S&Ls rapidly shifted away from traditional home mortgage financing and into new, high-risk investment activities such as casinos, fast-food franchises, ski resorts, junk bonds, arbitrage schemes, and derivative instruments.|$|R
40|$|This paper solves {{a dynamic}} model of households' {{mortgage}} decisions incorporating labor income, house price, inflation, and interest rate risk.

40|$|We study optimal {{exercise}} by mortgage borrowers of {{the option}} to default. Also, we use an equilibrium valuation model incorporating default to show how mortgage yields and lender recovery rates on defaulted mortgages depend on initial <b>loan-to-value</b> <b>ratios</b> when borrowers default optimally. The analysis treats both the frictionless case and the case in which borrowers and/or lenders incur deadweight costs upon default. The model is calibrated using data on California mortgages. We find that the model’s principal testable implication for default and mortgage pricing—that default rates and yield spreads will be higher for high loan-to-value mortgages—is borne out empirically...|$|R
