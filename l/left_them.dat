5|$|Before the murders, Kovář's family became {{worried about}} his mental state {{to the point that}} they {{contacted}} authorities in connection with his possession of gun license. Just four days before the murders, Kovář had received a police request to present a new health clearance under the threat of revoking his license. Before entering the Družba restaurant, Kovář visited at least two other venues. Those, however, had fewer customers, and Kovář <b>left</b> <b>them</b> immediately after entering.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 {{there were}} nine band members and Zappa was {{supporting}} the group himself from his publishing royalties whether they played or not. 1969 was also the year Zappa, fed up with MGM Records' interference, <b>left</b> <b>them</b> for Warner Bros. Records' Reprise subsidiary where Zappa/Mothers recordings would bear the Bizarre Records imprint.|$|E

5|$|Mills was {{appointed}} manager of Gateshead's National League rivals Wrexham on 28 April 2015 on a one-year rolling contract. On 13 October 2016, Mills was dismissed by Wrexham, after {{a run of}} four defeats from six matches <b>left</b> <b>them</b> 15th in the table.|$|E
5|$|On 6 February 2006, on ABC's Good Morning America, Van der Sloot's parents {{stated that}} {{their son was}} unfairly singled out and that the {{investigation}} <b>left</b> <b>them</b> devastated. Later that month, while Van der Sloot and his father were in New York City {{for an interview with}} ABC's Primetime, they were served with a lawsuit filed by Natalee's parents, Beth and Dave Holloway, alleging personal injury; the case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds that August.|$|E

5|$|The French {{success at}} {{completely}} encircling Cornwallis <b>left</b> <b>them</b> firmly {{in control of}} Chesapeake Bay.

5|$|The Giants {{won their}} first five games in 2009, but lost their next four. After beating the Atlanta Falcons in overtime, they lost badly to Denver on Thanksgiving. They {{defeated}} Dallas 31–24 in Week 13, then lost 45–38 to Philadelphia the next week. At 8–6, {{they still had}} a chance to make the playoffs, but losses to Carolina and Minnesota to finish the season <b>left</b> <b>them</b> out of the playoffs at 8–8.|$|E
5|$|The evicted {{residents}} were mostly Jewish immigrants from Arab states whose weak financial status <b>left</b> <b>them</b> vulnerable to Kollek's plan. The following steep increase in real-estate values of formerly depressed areas like Mamilla near the former armistice {{line and the}} Old City was perceived by evicted Mizrahi Jews as an injustice. This became a key issue in 1970s Israeli social upheaval and {{the founding of the}} Black Panthers movement in Israel.|$|E

5|$|With {{this new}} power he persuaded the chamber {{to pass the}} radical Ventôse Decrees, under which the régime would {{confiscate}} aristocratic émigré property and distribute it to needy sans-culottes. But these acts of wealth redistribution, arguably the most revolutionary acts of the French Revolution, never went into operation. The Committee faltered in creating procedures for their enforcement, and the frantic pace of unfolding political events <b>left</b> <b>them</b> behind.|$|E
5|$|A 65-yard screen {{pass from}} Vince Evans to Walter Payton gave the Bears a 13–10 lead. The Buccaneers {{answered}} {{that with a}} drive that ended with an eight-yard touchdown reception by Isaac Hagins. This score, with 5:08 left in the game, put the Buccaneers ahead of the Bears and <b>left</b> <b>them</b> as the only remaining undefeated team in the league. It was the third consecutive loss for the Bears. Jerry Eckwood also contributed a 61-yard touchdown run, the longest running play in Buccaneers history to that point. A broken wrist suffered in this game would contribute to Eckwood's diminished performance later in the season.|$|E
5|$|Buckner {{was again}} cited for gallant conduct at the Battle of Molino del Rey, and was {{appointed}} a brevet captain. He {{participated in the}} Battle of Chapultepec, the Battle of Belen Gate, and the storming of Mexico City. At {{the conclusion of the}} war, American soldiers served as an army of occupation, which <b>left</b> <b>them</b> time for leisure activities. Buckner joined the Aztec Club, and in April 1848 {{was a part of the}} successful expedition of Popocatépetl, a volcano southeast of Mexico City. Buckner was accorded the honor of lowering the American flag over Mexico City for the last time during the occupation.|$|E

5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This <b>left</b> <b>them</b> vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E
5|$|Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) {{returns to}} his team in {{spectacular}} fashion, walking {{into the middle of}} a hostage situation involving his team and an alien Blowfish, shooting the intoxicated Blowfish in the head. At the Hub, his team question why he <b>left</b> <b>them,</b> and he simply responds that he had found his Doctor and that he belongs at Torchwood. The team is then alerted to a death near a multi-storey car park, where the team detect energy from the Rift on the corpse. Jack, to even his surprise, gets a hologram message on his vortex manipulator from a person he recognises, and leaves the team to talk to him.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the highly}} {{productive}} lead-up, Davidson faltered {{in his first}} outing as Australia's Test spearhead. He conceded 1/115 in only 32 overs in the first innings as South Africa reached 9/470 in the First Test in Johannesburg. With Australia 102 behind on the first innings, Davidson's tour nearly ended. Unable {{to cope with the}} 10 pm curfew imposed by team manager Jack Norton, Davidson and roommate Les Favell absconded and went sightseeing. By the time they had returned, Norton had confiscated their keys and <b>left</b> <b>them</b> a note asking them to report. The pair then went to sleep at the home of some supporters who had hosted the team for dinner the previous day.|$|E

'You {{should have}} <b>left</b> <b>'em</b> on the clothes-horse,' said the young {{mistress}} severely; {{and she came}} upstairs with the garments on her arm, quickly passed Stockdale's room, and threw them forcibly into a closet {{at the end of}} a passage.

5|$|From {{that point}} onwards, Kouao pretended that Climbié was her daughter. Kouao had {{originally}} {{planned to take}} another young girl called Anna Kouao, but Anna's parents changed their minds. Climbié travelled on a French passport {{in the name of}} Anna Kouao and was known as Anna throughout her life in the United Kingdom. It is not known exactly when Kouao started abusing Climbié. Climbié's parents received three messages about her from when she <b>left</b> <b>them</b> until her death, all saying she was in good health.|$|E
5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with their teeth. They fly back to their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice and {{spitting}} the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have <b>left</b> <b>them,</b> and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal. The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14g (0.11–0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the team's {{first season}} as a Pirates affiliate, the Sounds {{finished}} last in the American Conference East Division with a 67–76 record. The Sounds were led by manager Trent Jewett who {{would go on to}} win 320games from 1998 to 2000 and 2003 to 2004, placing him first on the all-time wins list for Sounds managers. The Sounds experienced their longest winning streak in franchise history when they won 15consecutive games from June 2 to June 20, 1999. Overall, the team improved from the previous year, putting together an 80–60 record, but their second-place finish <b>left</b> <b>them</b> out of the PCL playoffs where only division winners advance to the postseason.|$|E
