Among the reasons are: 1) Cogeneration plants face possible contamination of returned condensate. Because boiler feed water from cogeneration plants has much lower return rates than 100% condensing power plants, industries usually {{have to treat}} proportionately more boiler make up water. Boiler feed water must be completely oxygen free and de-mineralized, and the higher the pressure the more critical the level of purity of the feed water. 2) Utilities are typically larger scale power than industry, which helps offset the higher capital costs of high pressure. 3) Utilities {{are less likely to}} have sharp <b>load</b> <b>swings</b> than industrial operations, which deal with shutting down or starting up units that may represent a significant percent of either steam or power demand.|$|E

Main cycles of the work of Crawler Cranes can be divided into: lifting and lowering the working load, boom lifting and lowering, rotation (slewing) around its vertical axes in 360 º, and translational movement forward/backwards. In this workshop, we are going to simulate the work of crawler crane while rotating around its vertical axes when fully engaged with load, which hangs in some height. The aim is to see the effects of dynamic forces (or moments) in the crane’s construction during this work cycle, particularly at the start and end of the rotation when working <b>load</b> <b>swings.</b> Reasons for doing this study are occasions of crane instability, while the crane rotates and <b>load</b> <b>swings.</b> We will research the effects of angular speed and workload swaying (swinging) in overall stability of crawler crane by looking for results of swaying angles, dynamic momentums and tensions in cables. By using the modeling applications and applying simulations [3], we are confident that we will have better view of occasions in case of crane rotation and some conclusions for enforcing security and design rules in order to avoid instability and overturning.

During the monthly surveillance test STP 0125. 002 A on 12 / 21 / 00, the "A " diesel generator experienced <b>load</b> <b>swings</b> during unloading. Replacement of the Woodward Governor EGA unit eliminated the load swing problem. Following removal of the EGA unit, an on-site bench test and inspection was performed. Although the EGA successfully passed the bench test, the inspection identified some questionable solder joints on the stability potentiometer (pot). This pot has three ring terminal connections through which wire leads are looped and then soldered. One of the connections had the wire lead looped through it, but did not appear to have any solder on it. It was suspected that if contact between the lead and terminal were intermittent on the stability pot, then the output signal from the EGA would be erratic and cause <b>load</b> <b>swings</b> and instability, as was experienced on 12 / 21 / 00. Since all of the pots in an EGA were replaced during refurbishment by Power Control Services (PCS) of Engine Systems, Inc.

Most research and development focuses {{on the creation of}} larger, more powerful and expensive lifting vehicles, such as Boeing’s JHL- 40 (Skyhook). These systems accomplish the task by scaling up existing technology to provide increased payload capability but unfortunately at increased complexity and cost. As the vehicles become larger, more attention needs to be paid to the structural dynamics. Larger airframes result in slower, significant vibrational modes which couple into the rotation and translation dynamics. The ensuing higher-order system requires study and simulation to guarantee safety and adequate performance. An alternative approach would be to possibly use smaller, existing unmanned autonomous helicopters working cooperatively to perform the same task.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a {{combination}} of brain emotional learning based intelligent controllers (BELBICs) is employed to control an unidentified practical overhead crane. The proposed controller is a model free controller and has the capability to deal with multi objective control problems. These properties make BELBIC a powerful controller for unknown complex systems when identification in not cost effective or cannot be performed. The fast emotional learning capability has resulted in good performance even in short procedure (training) time, which {{is very important in}} real time model free control. The proposed controller is implemented on a laboratorial overhead crane 1 in a real time model free control task. Two different loads are added to the crane set to simulate uncertainties of an actual crane. To consider main and extra objectives a nonlinear combination of them is used to generate emotional stress signal. Experimental results show that the proposed control system has so rapid and powerful learning capability that can eliminate any need for prior system identification. The results are compared with original sample controller and HFLC-ANFIS. In comparison with ANFIS compensator it has faster compensation of tracking and regulating of the <b>load</b> <b>swings</b> and in rejecting of disturbances. Also, in presence of disturbances, BELBIC performance does not decrease significantly and is slightly better than the others. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} the non-time based control {{strategy}} named Delayed Reference Control (DRC) to the control of industrial robotic cranes. Such a control scheme has been developed to achieve two relevant objectives in the control of autonomous operated cranes: the active damping of undesired <b>load</b> <b>swing,</b> and the accurate tracking of the planned path through space, with the preservation of the coordinated Cartesian motion of the crane. A paramount advantage of the proposed scheme over traditional ones is its ease of implementation on industrial devices: it can be implemented by just adding an outer control loop (incorporating path planning) to standard position controllers. Experimental performance assessment of the proposed {{control strategy}} is provided by applying the DRC to the control of the oscillation of a cable-suspended load moved by a parallel robot mimicking a robotic crane. In order to implement the DRC scheme on such an industrial robot it has been just necessary to manage path planning and the DRC algorithm on a separate real-time hardware computing the delay in the execution of the desired trajectory suitable to reduce <b>load</b> <b>swing.</b> <b>Load</b> <b>swing</b> has been detected by processing the images from two off-the-shelf cameras with a dedicated vision system.

The proposed topologies employ a high frequency link; direct DC to AC conversion approach. The direct DC to AC conversion approach is more efficient and operates without an intermediate dc-link stage. The absence of the dc-link, results in the elimination of bulky, aluminum electrolytic capacitors, which in turn leads to a reduction in the cost, volume, size and weight of the power electronic converter. The feasibility of two direct DC to AC converter topologies and their suitability to meet SECA objectives will be investigated.

30|$|Efforts to {{separately}} {{optimize the}} two networks can fail {{to capitalize on}} the potential economic benefits of an integrated energy network [4]. Moreover, far worse is that neglecting the interdependencies can lead to inappropriate decisions [5, 6]. A number of studies have focused on modeling integrated natural gas and electric power systems. An optimal power flow model for combined gas and electric networks, denoted as GEOPF, was proposed in [7, 8, 9]. Here, the primary elements in a gas network were modeled to resemble an electric system. However, electricity travels at the speed of light, while a natural gas system features considerably slower transient processes caused by <b>load</b> <b>swings,</b> leading to gas flow coupling in time and space. Consequently, efforts to optimize integrated gas and electric systems have increasingly employed multi-period models. A detailed gas network model was formulated, and considerations of gas storage and line pack were introduced in [10, 11]. Moreover, it was argued that, although a steady-state model is applicable for an electric system, it is not applicable for gas systems due to the low gas velocity. Therefore, dynamic approximations for a gas system are required to guarantee a reliable optimal solution to an integrated model [12]. From this viewpoint, the optimization of an integrated gas and electric system has been recently conducted in the field of unit commitment [13]. However, most researchers have formulated integrated systems as a linear programming problem using linearized electric power/gas flow models to guarantee a global optimum solution. Despite the computational efficiency, the obtained solution may not be the representative of a solution to the original nonlinear problem. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, multi-period integrated gas and electric system optimal power flow (M-GEOPF) has not been formulated based on precise nonlinear electric power and gas flow models.|$|E

This technique is frequently used in construction, firefighting, and disaster relief operations, among other applications. Unfortunately, the suspended <b>load</b> <b>swings,</b> which makes load positioning difficult and can degrade control of the helicopter. This dissertation investigates the use of input shaping (a command-filtering technique for reducing vibration) to mitigate the load swing problem. The investigation is conducted using two different, but complementary, approaches. One approach studies manual tracking tasks, where a human attempts to make a cursor follow an unpredictably moving target. The second approach studies horizontal repositioning maneuvers on small-scale helicopter systems, including a novel testbed that limits the helicopter and suspended load to move in a vertical plane. Both approaches are used to study how input shaping affects control of a flexible element (the suspended load) and a driven base (the helicopter). In manual tracking experiments, conventional input shapers somewhat degraded control of the driven base but greatly improved control of the flexible element. New input shapers were designed to improve load control without negatively affecting base control. A method for adjusting the vibration-limiting aggressiveness of any input shaper between unshaped and fully shaped was also developed. Next, horizontal repositioning maneuvers were performed on the helicopter testbed using a human-pilot-like feedback controller from the literature, with parameter values scaled to match the fast dynamics of the model helicopter. It was found that some input shapers reduced settling time and peak load swing when applied to Attitude Command or Translational Rate Command response types. When the load was used as a position reference instead of the helicopter, the system was unstable without input shaping, and adding input shaping to a Translational Rate Command was able to stabilize the load-positioning system. These results show the potential to improve the safety and efficiency of helicopter suspended load operations. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|We {{designed}} a feedback controller to automate crane operations by controlling the load position and its swing. First, a PD tracking controller {{is designed to}} follow a prescribed trajectory. Then, another controller {{is added to the}} control loop to damp the <b>load</b> <b>swing.</b> The anti-swing controller is designed based on two techniques: a time-delayed feedback of the <b>load</b> <b>swing</b> angle and an anti-swing fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The rules of the FLC are generated by mapping the performance of the time-delayed feedback controller. The same mapping method used for generating the rules can be applied to mimic the performance of an expert operator. The control algorithms were designed for gantry cranes and then extended to tower cranes by considering the coupling between the translational and rotational motions. Experimental results show that the controller is effective in reducing load oscillations and transferring the load in a reasonable time. To experimentally validate the theory, we had to compensate for friction. To this end, we estimated the friction and then applied a control action to cancel it. The friction force was estimated by assuming a mathematical model and then estimating the model coefficients using an off-line identification technique, the method of least squares (LS) ...|$|R

However, the crane acceleration, required for motion, always induces undesirable <b>load</b> <b>swing.</b> This paper presents dynamic modelling of a 3 -D overhead gantry crane system based on closed-form equations of motion. The Lagrangian method is used to derive the dynamic model of the system. A dynamic model of the system incorporating payload and rope length is developed. Then the effects of payload and rope length on {{the response of the}} system are discussed. Extensive results that validate the theoretical derivation are presented in the time and frequency domains...|$|R
