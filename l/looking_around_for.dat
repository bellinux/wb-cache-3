5|$|The Confederate {{ordnance}} establishment at Little Rock was reactivated in August, 1862. <b>Looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> {{a suitable}} person to head this activity, General Hindman {{turned to the}} Confederate Navy and borrowed Lieutenant John W. Dunnington. Lt. Dunnington was {{the commander of the}} gunboat C.S.S. Ponchartrain, which had been brought to Little Rock in hopes of converting it to an ironclad. Dunnington was selected to head the ordnance works at Little Rock, and although he continued to draw his pay from the Confederate Navy Department, he was placed in charge of all Confederate ordnance activities (which included artillery functions) there with the rank of lieutenant colonel.|$|E
25|$|In 1616, the 22-year-old Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden started <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> a Protestant bride. He {{had since}} 1613 {{tried to get}} his mother's {{permission}} to marry the noblewoman Ebba Brahe, {{but this was not}} allowed, and he had to give up his wishes to marry her, though he continued to be in love with her. He received reports with the most flattering descriptions of the physical and mental qualities of the beautiful 17-year-old princess Maria Eleonora. Elector John Sigismund was favorably inclined towards the Swedish king, but he had become very infirm after an apoplexic stroke in the autumn of 1617. His determined Prussian wife showed a strong dislike for this Swedish suitor, because Prussia was a Polish fief and the Polish King Sigismund III Vasa still resented his loss of Sweden to Gustavus Adolphus' father Charles IX.|$|E
500|$|... "Share My Love" [...] is an uptempo {{song with}} Philadelphia soul-styled strings. It has a pop-R style {{similar to that}} of Michael Jackson's 1979 album Off the Wall. The song has a theme of romance and tongue-in-cheek lyrics: [...] "Populate / Let's get {{together}} / Populate". [...] "Green Light" [...] has a quiet storm style and low-key mood. It is about a man wanting to please a woman who has a negligent boyfriend. [...] "Feelin' Single" [...] is about the [...] "liminal sense of having checked out of a relationship and started <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> escape routes." [...] Kelly sings in a high register on the song, which Greg Kot views [...] "evok the boyish innocence of a Michael Jackson over a stepping dance groove accented with finger snaps." ...|$|E

500|$|Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer {{highlighted}} positively {{the first}} part of the mission. He remarked the game [...] " [...] a decent job of allowing you to feel like you're being stealthy as you negotiate your way past guards, usually by <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> not-very-hidden alternate routes." [...] However, he criticized the final two thirds for being very linear and repetitive, and also reacted negatively to the game's insistence on having to fight solo almost the entire time. He explained that Mass Effect 2 is a squad game, where players [...] " [...] fluid team strategy to cope with different situations", but fighting solo means that players [...] "have to deal with every encounter in the exact same way." [...] Brad Gallaway, reviewer of GameCritics, concluded that the relatively short mission and included extras were not enough to justify the pack's price tag. [...] "Mass Effect 2: Arrival" [...] was nominated for Best DLC (downloadable content) at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, but lost to [...]|$|E
500|$|Although it grew {{during its}} {{first five years of}} existence, ETNC {{relocated}} from Cooper to Commerce after its original campus was destroyed in a fire in July 1894. Due to the fire, the lack of railroad service in Cooper, his fairly poor personal financial situation, and a disturbing public execution that occurred near the college in 1894, Mayo looked to move ETNC to whichever community made him the best offer, ultimately selecting Commerce after it promised him land and $20,000. According to Gladys Mayo, the daughter of William and Etta Mayo, her father did not have [...] "any desire to rebuild in Cooper", and [...] "was anxiously <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> a place where he might re-establish the college". One of Commerce's chief advantages was that it was well connected by rail, boasting regular service on the St. Louis Southwestern Railway of Texas ("Cotton Belt") to Dallas, Sherman, and Texarkana and on the Texas Midland Railroad to Paris, Ennis, and Houston.|$|E
500|$|A 1999 deal {{in which}} Falk forced the Minnesota Timberwolves to trade Stephon Marbury gives a good {{indication}} of how Falk used his power. [...] Falk threatened the Timberwolves by telling them that Marbury would walk away in free agency {{at the end of}} the season if he was not traded, as well as suggesting that he would dump his stable of free agents into the lap of Chicago Bulls GM Jerry Krause if Marbury was not moved. [...] As the Minnesota Timberwolves started <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> possible trade scenarios, Falk even went so far as to veto a trade that would have brought Kerry Kittles (another Falk client) to Minnesota for Marbury, claiming that Kittles had no interest in playing for Minnesota. [...] The Timberwolves were eventually forced to send Marbury to New Jersey in a three-team trade. [...] Minnesota's General Manager, Kevin McHale, was greatly embittered about the trade, and has been quoted as saying that [...] "If a nuclear bomb dropped on earth, two things would survive: roaches and David Falk." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1968, Fisher re-entered {{private law}} practice, again with Covington & Burling (during the Dwight D. Eisenhower Administration (1953â€“60) Fisher joined the Covington firm, with Dean Acheson, {{for the first}} time) and became General Counsel to the Washington Post. Fisher's {{connection}} with the Washington Post arose because of his close friendship with the Post's then-owner Phillip Graham since his early days in Washington, D.C. [...] Both Fisher and Graham had clerked for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter and had shared a rented house (belonging to future Secretary of State Dean Acheson), together with [...] Donald Hiss (brother of Alger Hiss). From 1969 to 1975, Fisher served as Dean of Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C. According {{to a report in}} the Georgetown student newspaper [...] "The Hoya", Fisher was not solicited as a candidate for the position, but simply submitted his own name. [...] "I heard they were <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> a new person, so I called up and asked to be considered." [...] Dean Fisher was installed as the first occupant of the Francis Cabell Brown Chair in International Law of the center on January 25, 1977, and served as law professor from 1977 to 1980.|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Life" [...] was raved {{by music}} critics. John Calvert of The Quietus {{described}} the song as [...] "really big. Like R. Kelly's [...] "I Believe I Can Fly" [...] big. Like Superman eating a super hotdog while fighting King Kong while...ok {{you get the}} picture. If you were <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> a high concept pitch-style descriptor, with its synth brass and Philly soul strings {{you might call it}} 'Stevie Wonder meets N.E.R.D in space'. But then that would be too simplistic a definition for the multifaceted, resolutely accomplished 'Sweet Thing'." [...] Pitchforks Larry Fitzmaurice labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and noted that [...] "this was a week where Frank Ocean bravely invited us to learn more about his personal story; 'Sweet Life' is another reminder of how well he can structure a narrative in the musical realm." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick noted that Ocean took the R genre and pushed it out into strange new places, with tracks like the [...] "blissful, jazzy jigsaw of 'Sweet Life', which seems to assemble itself from disconnected elements as it goes along." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman mused that the track served as one of the album's lighter moments, and wrote that [...] "the bright 'Sweet Life' and the relatively exuberant 'Monks,' both of which would be standouts on any N.E.R.D. album, offer more than bright coating, dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Greek {{geographer}} Strabo also {{mentions the}} institution: [...] "and {{in fact a}} barbaric, and Scythian, element predominates in the sacred usages, for the people set up as priest merely a run-away slave who has slain with his own hand the man previously consecrated to that office; accordingly the priest is always armed with a sword, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> the attacks, and ready to defend himself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kingsolver {{was criticized}} for a Los Angeles Times opinion piece {{following}} the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan {{in the wake of}} the September 11 attacks. She wrote, [...] "I feel like I'm standing on a playground where the little boys are all screaming at each other, 'He started it!' and throwing rocks that keep taking out another eye, another tooth. I keep <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> somebody's mother to come on the scene saying, 'Boys! Boys! Who started it cannot possibly be the issue here. People are getting hurt." [...] One reader cited her essay as an example of the [...] "shabby nihilism of the left." [...] Another wrote, [...] "Kingsolver seemingly believes an insufficient number of us died in New York to warrant our response in Afghanistan." [...] Another reader, however, praised her [...] "loving sentiments." [...] By some accounts, she was [...] "denounced as a traitor," [...] but rebounded from these accusations and wrote about them.|$|E
