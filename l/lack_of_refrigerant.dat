50|$|Refrigerant {{may also}} explain flash-gas occurrence. When a system lacks refrigerant, {{or has a}} leakage, it may exhibit flash-gas as the volume in the piping exceeds the {{capacity}} of the refrigerant to fill it as liquid. This may force the refrigerant into a phase change. On the other hand, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> can sometimes also produce the opposite effect: an overall increase on the subcooling (and superheating) which will depend on the size and design of the system and its piping. If the system’s refrigerant is degenerate, flash-gas may also be produced, as physical properties of the fluid change. This happens because the piping is designed for a specific refrigerant mixture that allows liquid in the liquid line, given certain thermodynamic conditions. If the refrigerant mixture changes its composition considerably, the original designs will not be adequate. Degenerated refrigerant produced by leakage, chemical decomposition or loading with gas when using a glided refrigerant; will most likely make the system perform very poorly, alter oil’s circulation or composition, and may eventually render gear inoperative.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{refrigeration}} system achieves its refrigeration function generally through cryogenic refrigerant generated by multiple refrigerant compressor units. Traditionally, the operation <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> compressor units is controlled only by experience or the proportional-integral-derivative controller <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> temperature or pressure. Due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> scientific, systematic and optimum logic basis, {{it is difficult}} to optimize the operation of {{refrigeration system}} and control the excessive energy consumption with these methods. On this basis, this study employs the system optimization method to determine the optimum operation of each compressor unit within the system to obtain the most energy-saving operation for maximum operation efficiency of the refrigeration system (energy consumption efficiency), according to the actual required refrigeration capacity at load side, actual performance and operation condition of each unit. The results reflect that the system optimization method can obtain the optimum solution and increase the coefficient of performance of the original refrigeration system by 7. 83 %.

40|$|Natural {{refrigerant}} CO 2 {{is widely}} used in refrigeration and heat pump systems. It is of great significance for reductions of ozone depletion and global warming. The efficiency of heat pump system is affected by many factors. The amount <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> charge in the heat pump is a primary parameter that influences the energy efficiency. Undercharge or overcharge <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> degrade its performance and deteriorate system reliability. Therefore, heat pump should be charged with an optimum amount <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> to achieve high performance. However, {{it is difficult to}} calculate the optimum charge accurately because of the various components and operating parameters. Â In this paper, a trans-critical CO 2 Â heat pump system is set up to investigate the influence <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> charge on the performance of a small-sized heat pump water heater. The trans-critical CO 2 Â heat pump system is composed of a rotary compressor, a tube-in-tube evaporator and gas cooler, an electronic expansion valve (EEV), and an internal heat exchanger (IHX). The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the characteristics of the CO 2 heat pump under various refrigerant charging conditions. Therefore, the performance of the CO 2 Â system was measured and discussed on the basis <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> charge amount. Â Based on the experimental results, the effects <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> charge on the power of system, rejection pressure, evaporating pressure, mass flow rate and coefficient of performance (COP) were analyzed with different EEV openings. The experimental results show that the COP was strongly related to CO 2 mass charge and that the formation of the trans-critical cycle depended on CO 2 mass charge greatly. The pressures in the gas cooler and the evaporator increased with the rise <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> charge. The compression ratio decreased with the increase <b>of</b> the <b>refrigerant</b> charge. The COP has a maximum value at a specific CO 2 mass charge. Undercharged CO 2 systems could result in a fast decrease of the heating capacity and COP. However, overcharged CO 2 systems could cause an abrupt increase of compressor power consumption. The heating cycle displayed different characteristics with different CO 2 mass charges.

Capillary tube length is important as it decides the evaporator temperature and pressure directly but also affects the tendency of refilling of evaporator with liquid refrigerant after initial start up and alters the amount of optimum charge in the system.
