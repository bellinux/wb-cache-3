The thesis is divided into a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical part defines what the <b>lesson</b> <b>planning</b> is, which types and aspects it has.

40|$|AbstractA {{number of}} {{students}} who are educated to be primary and secondary school teachers still have problems in designing <b>lesson</b> <b>plans.</b> In this research, an instruction model for improving the ability of students in designing the <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> was developed. The instruction model was based on the theories of constructivism and metacognition. The research activities consist of 4 steps as follows. Firstly, a learning unit was created by using the backward design approach. Secondly, an instruction model was designed by employing the theories of constructivism and metacognition. Based on this instruction model, the <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> of the learning units were prepared for teaching the students. Thirdly, 18 students of Nakhon Pathom Rajabhat University were taught by using this instruction model for one semester. Finally, the ability in designing the <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> of these students were evaluated. The evaluation was based on the achievement of the study {{and the quality of the}} <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> produced by these students. It was found that the ability in designing the <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> of the student after being taught by using this instruction model was significantly improved.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises three {{projects that}} were designed to investigate specific <b>lesson</b> <b>planning</b> practices and how music teacher educators might improve students' instructional preparation. The first investigation is a review of literature pertaining to <b>lesson</b> <b>planning</b> and teacher knowledge-specifically Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) and Content Knowledge (CK). The second investigation is a survey study about preservice teachers' perceptions of where in their coursework <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> were taught and used, beliefs regarding the importance of planning, and how prepared they felt to use <b>lesson</b> <b>planning</b> in their classes. Respondents (N equals 107) {{indicated that they were}} taught <b>lesson</b> <b>planning</b> more often in music education courses than in general education or music method courses. The third investigation is an experimental study. Novice conductors (N equals 20) were randomly divided into two equal groups (n equals 10 per group). I sought to determine whether novices who focused their rehearsal preparation using typical score study methodologies (CK) differed from those whose preparation involved both score study and specific rehearsal strategies (CK and PCK). I found {{no significant differences between the}} control and experimental groups' score study knowledge or rehearsal effectiveness ratings. Results from these three projects indicated that preservice teachers (a) found <b>lesson</b> <b>planning</b> to be important, (b) felt prepared to use <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> as part of the instructional process, and (c) could use either preparation method to prepare for rehearsals...|$|R

While the importance of <b>lesson</b> <b>planning</b> is widely recognized, research evidence that is exclusively dedicated to this issue is limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effect of a biannual, university practicum course (<b>lesson</b> <b>planning,</b> teaching, observing and evaluating, supervision) on pre-service physical education teachers’ ability to design <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> for elementary school students. Twenty-seven student-teachers who were enrolled in the seventh semester of studies participated. Each teacher was evaluated in three out of twelve lesson plans; one for each measurement (pre-, post-, retention), using the <b>lesson</b> <b>planning</b> domain of the Rubric of the Tennessee State Board of Education (2009). One-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted for data analysis in each of the three indicators of <b>lesson</b> <b>planning.</b> Results yielded statistically significant differences in teachers’ performance among measures with regard to the establishment of appropriate instructional goals and objectives (indicator 1), and instruction planning and student evaluation, as a result of understanding the content, student needs, curriculum standards, and the community (indicator 2).
