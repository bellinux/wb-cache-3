5|$|In Europe golden jackals are {{not listed}} under the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Golden jackals in Europe fall under various {{international}} <b>legal</b> <b>instruments.</b> These include the 1979 Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, and the 1992 European Union Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Council Directive provides both guidance and limits on what participating governments can do when {{responding to the}} arrival of expanding jackals. These legislative instruments aim to contribute to conserving native wildlife; some governments argue that the golden jackal is not native wildlife but an invading species. The Golden Jackal informal study Group in Europe (GOJAGE) is an organization that is formed by researchers from across Europe to collect and share information on the golden jackal in Europe. The group also has an interest in the golden jackal's relationship with its environment across Eurasia. Membership is open to anyone that has an interest in golden jackals.|$|E

25|$|In the Middle Ages, the {{majority}} of seals were pendent. They were attached both to <b>legal</b> <b>instruments</b> and to letters patent (i.e. open letters) conferring rights or privileges, which were intended to be available for all to view. In the case of important transactions or agreements, the seals of all parties to the arrangement {{as well as of}} witnesses might be attached to the document, and so once executed it would carry several seals. Most governments still attach pendent seals to letters patent.|$|E
25|$|Although the Shakespeare papers had {{prominent}} believers (including James Boswell), sceptics had questioned their authenticity {{from the}} beginning, {{and as the}} premiere of Vortigern approached, the press was filled with arguments over whether the papers were genuine or forgeries.

His attack on the papers, stretching to more than 400 densely printed pages, showed convincingly that the papers could be nothing other than modern forgeries. Although believers tried to hold their ground, scholars were convinced by Malone's arguments.|$|E

If the honour was not so great as the Chancellorship, the financial rewards were a great compensation.

25|$|The most {{important}} <b>legal</b> <b>instruments</b> {{for the promotion}} of renewable energy are Law 25,019 from 1998 and Law 26,190 from 2007. The 1998 law, known as the “National Wind and Solar Energy Rules”, declared wind and solar generation of national interest and introduced a mechanism that established an additional payment per generated kWh which, in 1998, meant a 40% premium over market price. It also granted certain tax exemptions for a period of 15 years from the law's promulgation. The 2007 Law complemented the previous one, declaring of national interest the generation of electricity from any renewable source intended to deliver a public service. This law also set an 8% target for renewable energy consumption in the period of 10 years and mandated the creation of a trust fund whose resources will be allocated to pay a premium for electricity produced from renewable sources.|$|E
25|$|Since Singapore {{was founded}} as a factory or trading post of the East India Company in 1819, {{a number of}} laws having {{constitutional}} status have applied to it. Singapore {{became part of the}} Straits Settlements in 1867, which were granted a colonial constitution by way of letters patent dated 4 February 1867 that established the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements. Further letters patent dated 17 November 1877 set up an Executive Council and authorized the Governor to appoint judges. Thereafter, a number of other <b>legal</b> <b>instruments</b> were issued to streamline the constitutional structure of the colony, but did not make significant changes to the arrangements put in place by the 1867 and 1877 letters patent. The last constitution of the Straits Settlements was based on letters patent dated 17 December 1911 as amended by letters patent and royal instructions both dated 18 August 1924.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{examined}} {{the provisions of the}} European <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> governing the right of access to a lawyer within the criminal proceedings in a Member State of the European Union, especially in situations where against the person concerned it was imposed a measure of deprivation of liberty and the right to have access to consular authorities, the right to inform a third person and the right of access to a lawyer in execution proceedings of a European Arrest Warrant. With the actual examination of these provisions, we referred also to the provisions of law, emphasizing the differences of the existing regulation and the need to transpose the European <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> into the national law by a separate legislative act and not by completing the special law, as it is intended at the moment. The innovations consist of examining the European <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> focusing on the right to have access to all the criminal proceedings, with reference to relevant national legislation, including the procedure of executing a European arrest warrant. The paper can be useful to academics, practitioners in the field and to the Romanian legislator from the perspective of transposing this European <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> into the national law...|$|R

25|$|Applied seals, by contrast, were {{originally}} used to seal a document closed: {{that is to}} say, the document would be folded and the seal applied {{in such a way}} that the item could not be opened without the seal being broken. Applied seals were used on letters close (letters intended only for the recipient) and parcels to indicate whether or not the item had been opened or tampered with since it had left the sender, as well as providing evidence that the item was actually from the sender and not a forgery. In the post-medieval period, seals came to be commonly used in this way for private letters. A letter writer would fold the completed letter, pour wax over the joint formed by the top of the page, and then impress a ring or other seal matrix. Governments sometimes sent letters to citizens under the governmental seal for their eyes only, known as letters secret. In general, seals are no longer used in these ways except for ceremonial purposes. However, applied seals also came to be used on <b>legal</b> <b>instruments</b> applied directly to the face of the document, so that there was no need to break them, and this use continues.|$|E

500|$|The <b>legal</b> <b>instruments</b> {{used by the}} Council for the Common Foreign and Security Policy are {{different}} from the legislative acts. Under the CFSP they consist of [...] "common positions", [...] "joint actions", and [...] "common strategies". Common positions relate to defining a European foreign policy towards a particular third-country such as the promotion of human rights and democracy in Myanmar, a region such as the stabilisation efforts in the African Great Lakes, or a certain issue such as support for the International Criminal Court. A common position, once agreed, is binding on all EU states who must follow and defend the policy, which is regularly revised. A joint action refers to a co-ordinated action of the states to deploy resources to achieve an objective, for example for mine clearing or to combat the spread of small arms. Common strategies defined an objective and commits the EUs resources to that task for four years.|$|E
