40|$|In {{order to}} gain a better {{understanding}} of the complex structural lining behavior of bored tunnels in the specific Dutch soils, a test set-up has been developed in the Stevin Laboratory at Delft University of Technology. In this facility a full-scale model, consisting of three segmented rings of a tunnel lining, has been subjected to construction and serviceability loading conditions. The first test series five years ago have shown that higher stresses occur in the construction phase than under serviceability conditions. In view of recent test series the set-up has been adapted for performing tests at the ultimate limit state. Various tests have been performed in which the test specimen was loaded until failure of the rings. In the tests the axial prestressing force was varied and the interaction between the neighboring rings was studied. Simultaneously, simulations with the finite element program DIANA were conducted for studying the lining behavior in more detail. The test results have been used for validating the numerical model at the ultimate <b>limit</b> <b>stat...</b>|$|E

This work proposes an efficient Bayesian parameter estimation method suitable for fragility curves based on a given probability model; in particular, the bi - parameter Log Normal probability distribution. This approach consists of Bayesian param eter estimation for the mean and the standard deviation of the L og Normal Fragility Model, given a limited (in the order of 10 to 50) number of structural analysis results for a specific structural performance variable denoted as Y. This leads to calculati on of the robust fragility and its percentiles or plus/minus standard deviation confidence interval underlying the number of simulations/realizations. The application of the robust fragility method is investigated in two cases: (a) vulnerability assessment to flooding for a class of non - engineered structures; (b) seismic vulnerability assessment for an existing structure.. In case (a), the critical flooding height for collapse limit state is adopted as structural performance variable Y. In this case, the r esulting fragility curves are validated {{with respect to the}} results of Standard Monte Carlo simulation.

40|$|T-cell {{responses}} to a cytokine milieu instruct the development of multiple effector phenotypes. While transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) inhibits the development of T helper type 1 (Th 1) and Th 2 cells, we demonstrate that like interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and IL- 4, IL- 12 can inhibit the development of TGF-β 1 -induced Foxp 3 -expressing adaptive T regulatory (aTreg) cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT 4) is critical for the response to IL- 12, {{although there is a}} parallel pathway involving T box expressed in T cells (T-bet), and cells from mice double-deficient in STAT 4 and T-bet are refractory to the inhibition of aTreg-cell development by IL- 12. While the ability of these cytokines to promote Th differentiation may contribute to this effect, we observe that culture with IL- 12, or other instructive cytokines, results in an increase in repressive chromatin modifications at the Foxp 3 locus that <b>limit</b> <b>STAT</b> 5 binding to Foxp 3, without observed effects on IL- 2 signalling pathways. In a model of allergic lung inflammation there are increased percentages of Treg cells in the lungs of Stat 4 −/− mice, compared with wild-type mice, and increases in Treg cells correlate with decreased allergic inflammation. Overall, these results suggest an important role for STAT 4 in regulating Treg-cell development...|$|E

OA physiopathology is multifactorial and involves mechanical and hereditary factors. So far, there is neither preventive medicine to delay cartilage breakdown nor curative treatment. Objectives. To investigate pro-inflammatory paracrine interactions between human primary chondrocytes and macrophages following interleukin- 1 -β (IL- 1 β) treatment; {{to evaluate the}} molecular mechanism responsible for the inhibitory effect of resveratrol. Results. The activation of NF-κB in chondrocytes by IL- 1 β induced IL- 6 secretion. The latter will then activate STAT 3 protein in macrophages. Moreover, STAT 3 was able to positively regulate IL- 6 secretion, as confirmed by the doubling level of IL- 6 in the coculture compared to macrophage monoculture. These experiments confirm {{the usefulness of the}} coculture model in the inflammatory arthritis-linked process as a closer biological situation to the synovial joint than separated chondrocytes and macrophages. Il also demonstrated the presence of an inflammatory amplification loop induced by IL- 1 β. Resveratrol showed a strong inhibitory effect on the pro-inflammatory marker secretion. The decrease of IL- 6 secretion is dependent on the NFκB inhibition in the chondrocytes. Such reduction of the IL- 6 level can <b>limit</b> <b>STAT</b> 3 activation in the macrophages, leading to the interruption of the inflammatory amplification loop. Conclusion.

Previous studies have shown that Socs 3 haploinsufficiency or socs 3 deletion in the whole brain or in selective neuronal populations triggers an increased sensitivity to exogenous leptin, through increased Stat 3 activation, and protects against diet-induced obesity in mice fed a high fat diet. Intriguingly however, no phenotype was detected when Socs 3 mutant mice were maintained under standard diet, suggesting that Socs 3 may only contribute to energy homeostasis in pathological conditions and not in physiological conditions. In this study, we show that deletion of socs 3 in the medio-basal hypothalamus, when performed in adult mice by stereotaxic injection of an adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase, produces an attenuation of body weight gain, a decreased adiposity, and a decreased food intake in animals maintained under standard diet. The decreased food intake was associated with an increased hindbrain sensitivity to endogenous satiety signals, which was blocked by fourth ventricular injection of a selective oxytocin receptor antagonist. Thus, our study indicates that Socs 3 controls energy homeostasis in physiological conditions, and that oxytocin signaling functions as a downstream effector of hypothalamic leptin to enhance hindbrain sensitivity to endogenous satiety signals. This result suggests that oxytocin could be of therapeutic interest to circumvent leptin resistance associated with common forms of obesity...|$|R

This study explored several avenues to ultimately expand upon our understanding of RSV pathogenesis at the protein level. Evaluation of RSV intrinsic protein disorder increased the relatively limited description of the RSV structure-function relationship. Global proteomics analysis provided direction for further hypothesis-driven investigation of host pathways altered by RSV infection, specifically {{the interaction between the}} RSV NS 2 protein and the host ubiquitin system. NS 2 primarily acts to antagonize the innate immune system by targeting STAT 2 for proteasomal degradation. The goal was to identify NS 2 residues important for interaction with the host ubiquitin system, as well as describe the mechanism by which NS 2 induces host protein ubiquitination. Bioinformatics analysis provided a platform for development of loss-of-ubiquitin-function NS 2 mutants. Combining critical mutations as double or triple NS 2 ubiquitin mutants displayed an additive effect on reducing NS 2 -induced ubiquitination. Recombinant RSV (rRSV) containing NS 2 ubiquitin mutations maintained their effect on ubiquitin expression during infection in addition to <b>limiting</b> <b>STAT</b> 2 degradation activity. NS 2 ubiquitin mutants decreased rRSV growth and increased levels of innate immune responses, indicating a correlation between NS 2 ’s ubiquitin function and antagonism of type I IFN to enhance viral replication.

It has recently {{been shown to be}} effective in animal models of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, two autoimmune diseases that are mediated by auto-aggressive Th 1 -polarized CD 4 + T lymphocytes. Here we demonstrate potent suppressive effects of tranilast on the function of naïve human CD 4 + T cells. Tranilast inhibits activation and proliferation of purified CD 4 + T cells stimulated through the T cell receptor with an EC 50 of less than 10 μM, a concentration that is well below plasma levels achieved after oral administration of approved doses of 200 - 600 mg in humans. The antiproliferative effects were less potent on naïve CD 8 + T cells. Suppression of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell proliferation was associated with an inhibition of T cell activation. Cytokine analyses of naïve CD 4 + T cells revealed that tranilast interferes with the production of cyto- and chemokines driven by signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT 1), notably chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligands (CXCL) 9 and 10.

40|$|Many {{activities}} {{present in}} the offshore technology are affected by sea waves and their safety strongly depends on the sea state. The fundamental question in operation risk analysis is the limit sea state which enables the safe operation controlled in all phases: from the sea surface to the sea bottom. The safe limit sea state is especially important when some lifting operation is performed in sea waves. This paper presents a dynamical model of a floating crane in sea waves with a hanging load at a high altitude above sea level. The model {{is defined as a}} linearized coupled double pendulum where the usual 6 DOF of the floating crane oscillatory motions in waves are extended by additional 3 DOF of the swinging load. The numerical model of the floating crane is calibrated and tuned according to the measured model in a towing tank. The significant values of the crane boom top accelerations were estimated for the given design sea state with different vertical load positions. The problem is illustrated by the example of a floating crane consisting of a simple single pontoon with an ordinary land crane mounted on the deck. The reliability of the proposed method is evaluated on the basis of correlation between the calculated and measured data.

40|$|Abstract. We study {{stationary}} quantum fluctuations {{around a}} mean field limit in trapped, dilute atomic gases of repulsively interacting bosons at zero temperature. Our {{goal is to}} describe quantum-mechanically the lowest macroscopic many-body bound state consistent with a microscopic Hamiltonian that accounts for inhomogeneous particle scattering processes. In the mean field limit, the wave function of the condensate (macroscopic quantum state) satisfies a defocusing cubic nonlinear Schrödinger-type equation, the Gross–Pitaevskii equation. We include consequences of pair excitation, i. e., the scattering of particles in pairs from the condensate to other states, proposed in [T. T. Wu,J. Math. Phys., 2 (1961), pp. 105 – 123]. Our derivations rely on an uncontrolled yet physically motivated assumption for the many-body wave function. By relaxing mathematical rigor, from a particle Hamiltonian with a spatially varying interaction strength we derive via heuristics an integro–partial differential equation for the pair collision kernel, K, under a stationary condensate wave function, Φ. For a scattering length with periodic microstructure of subscale ɛ, we formally describe via classical homogenization the lowest many-body bound state in terms of Φ and K up to second order in ɛ. If the external potential is slowly varying, we solve the homogenized equations via boundary layer theory. As an application, we describe the partial depletion of the condensate. Key words.

This analysis revealed the induction of a set of genes that implicated IFN signaling in the HT 29 cellular response to 5 -Aza-CdR. Subsequent investigations revealed that the induction of this gene set correlates with the induction of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, 2, and 3 genes and their activation by endogenous IFN-α.

In this study, we show a novel regulatory mechanism of Stat 6 -mediated signaling in mast cells. When Stat 6 is activated by interleukin (IL) - 4 and translocated to the nucleus, Stat 6 is cleaved by a nucleus-associated protease in mast cells. The cleaved 65 -kD Stat 6 lacks the COOH-terminal transactivation domain and functions as a dominant-negative molecule to Stat 6 -mediated transcription. The retrovirus-mediated expression of cleavage-resistant Stat 6 mutants prolongs the nuclear accumulation of Stat 6 upon IL- 4 stimulation and enhances IL- 4 – induced gene expression and growth inhibition in mast cells.

Recently described inactivating mutations in Stat 5 b in humans with impaired growth have {{focused attention on}} this transcription factor as a key agent linking GH-stimulated signals to IGF-I gene expression, and several putative Stat 5 b sites {{have been identified in}} the IGF-I gene. Here, we define and characterize potential GH- and Stat 5 b-activated chromosomal enhancers that can regulate IGF-I gene transcription. Of 89 recognizable Stat 5 sequences in 200 kb centering on the rat IGF-I gene, 22 resided within conserved regions and/or were identical among different species. Only 15 of these sites, organized into 7 distinct domains, were found to bind Stat 5 b by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in liver chromatin of rats, but only after acute GH treatment. These sites could bind Stat 5 b in vitro, and individual domains could mediate GH- and Stat 5 b-stimulated IGF-I promoter activity in cultured cells. Further analyses revealed that four Stat 5 b domains possessed chromatin signatures of enhancers, including binding of co-activators p 300 and Med 1, and RNA polymerase II. These modifications preceded GH-stimulated recruitment of Stat 5 b, as did lysine 4 monomethylation of histone H 3, which was enriched in 6 / 7 Stat 5 b-binding elements. In contrast, histone acetylation was induced by GH but was <b>limited</b> to <b>Stat</b> 5 b binding domains found within the IGF-I transcription unit.

40|$|Erythropoietin (Epo) -induced Stat 5 {{phosphorylation}} (p-Stat 5) {{is essential}} for both basal erythropoiesis and for its acceleration during hypoxic stress. A key challenge lies in understanding how Stat 5 signaling elicits distinct functions during basal and stress erythropoiesis. Here we asked whether these distinct functions might be specified by the dynamic behavior of the Stat 5 signal. We used flow cytometry to analyze Stat 5 phosphorylation dynamics in primary erythropoietic tissue in vivo and in vitro, identifying two signaling modalities. In later (basophilic) erythroblasts, Epo stimulation triggers a low intensity but decisive, binary (digital) p-Stat 5 signal. In early erythroblasts the binary signal is superseded by a high-intensity graded (analog) p-Stat 5 response. We elucidated the biological functions of binary and graded Stat 5 signaling using the EpoR-HM mice, which express a "knocked-in" EpoR mutant lacking cytoplasmic phosphotyrosines. Strikingly, EpoR-HM mice are restricted to the binary signaling mode, which rescues these mice from fatal perinatal anemia by promoting binary survival decisions in erythroblasts. However, {{the absence of the}} graded p-Stat 5 response in the EpoR-HM mice prevents them from accelerating red cell production in response to stress, including a failure to upregulate the transferrin receptor, which we show is a novel stress target. We found that Stat 5 protein levels decline with erythroblast differentiation, governing the transition from high-intensity graded signaling in early erythroblasts to low-intensity binary signaling in later erythroblasts. Thus, using exogenous Stat 5, we converted later erythroblasts into high-intensity graded signal transducers capable of eliciting a downstream stress response. Unlike the Stat 5 protein, EpoR expression in erythroblasts does not <b>limit</b> the <b>Stat</b> 5 signaling response, a non-Michaelian paradigm with therapeutic implications in myeloproliferative disease.
