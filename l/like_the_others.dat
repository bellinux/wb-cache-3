5|$|The {{battalion}} commander at Taizhou ordered his officer Zhai Yong to escort Choe Bu's Korean {{party to the}} regional command centre at Shaoxing on March 6. From there they could be transferred to provincial authorities at Hangzhou and finally to the empire's capital of Beijing where the party could be officially escorted back to Korea. Choe Bu and his officers were carried in sedan chairs, an accommodation provided by the Taizhou Battalion, although in spots of rough terrain Choe Bu and his officers were forced to walk on foot <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Others.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> in his village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E
5|$|IGN {{wrote that}} the game's story and environments {{remained}} {{in the background and}} were ultimately forgettable, {{or in the case of}} the former, a hindrance, especially when the scenes could not be skipped on later replays. By the same token, predecessors such as Lara Croft Go hid treasures in its background such that players would revisit its levels, but Deus Ex Go had little to interest players besides its primary mission. The game's sole challenge of completing the puzzle in the fewest moves, GameSpot explained, quickly became uninteresting. Gamezebo reviewer instead faulted the series and wrote that after three games, its formula felt repetitive. TouchArcade concluded that, unlike the other Go games, Deus Ex Go was less creative overall and did not subvert the themes of its parent series quite <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E

He mainly contributes to the SSS through intelligence gathering and other affairs but does not actively fight. Yuri herself says to not be fooled by his glasses {{and that he is}} actually an idiot. Though appearing to be slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his shirt off, much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is turned into an NPC. However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), he is able to regain his senses and manages to disappear <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> He carries a Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel Claude Prior, the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion was formed with four machine gun companies, a {{headquarters}} company– consisting of an anti-aircraft platoon, a signals platoon and a transport platoon– and a battalion headquarters. Australian machine gun battalions were established with an authorised strength of around 800 to 900 personnel, and <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> the 2/1st was a motorised infantry unit with both wheeled motor vehicles and tracked carriers. Equipped with 48 Vickers medium machine guns, the battalion's four machine gun companies– designated 'A' to 'D' and each consisting of three four-gun platoons– were initially formed separately, with 'A' Company forming at Ingleburn, in New South Wales, 'B' Company forming at Puckapunyal, in Victoria, 'C' in South Australia, and 'D' at Rutherford, in New South Wales. At {{the end of the}} month, 'B' and 'C' Companies concentrated at Rutherford, before moving to Ingleburn with 'D' Company in January 1940. An intense period of training followed, with range shoots at Liverpool, and field exercises in the Green Hills and Wallacia areas, the latter being conducted in conjunction with the infantry battalions of the 18th Brigade. This period concluded in early May 1940, when the battalion was moved by train to Darling Harbour and embarked upon the Queen Mary.|$|E

25|$|For {{the most}} part the canons also speedily became non-resident, and this led to the {{distinction}} of residentiary and non-residentiary canons, till in most churches the number of resident canons became definitely limited in number, and the non-residentiary canons, who no longer shared in the common funds, became generally known as prebendaries only, although by their non-residence they did not forfeit their position as canons, and retained their votes in chapter <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E

25|$|The third tornado {{touched down}} in Gladstone (reportedly {{as a new}} {{circulation}} developed in the thunderstorm). <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> it was initially weak (F1), but quickly strengthened and widened to approximately 300 yards in diameter. Near the intersection of NE 63rd Terrace and N Jackson, marginal F4 occurred in the Carriage Hill subdivision. A few homes were flattened there. Just to the Northeast of this location, NWS noted an additional pocket of F4 damage. The tornado continued producing F2 to F3 damage before dissipating, after having traveled for only 5 miles. No one was killed in this tornado, though a few injuries occurred.|$|E

The assault was similarly successful on the small station on the Northern site that was found to contain thirty eight Germans but almost immediately they gave up; <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> they had been dazed, shocked and exhausted by the bombardment.|$|E
