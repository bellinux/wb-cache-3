40|$|We {{study the}} optimal {{procurement}} mechanism when contract breach and abandoning a project may be efficient, {{either because of}} completion costs higher than anticipated or because of new and more lucrative opportunities for the contractor. When contractors have private information about their costs, the procurer finds it optimal to set damages above expectation damages. There is a lock-in effect, or status quo bias; the agent that has won the award will complete the project even in situations {{when it would be}} efficient to abandon it. If the cost types of all agents are above a threshold, the optimal bidding procedure assigns the project by lottery. The optimal mechanism cannot be implemented by standard auction formats. However, the larger the number of agents bidding for the project, the closer auctions with a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> <b>clause</b> approximate the optimal mechanism. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject matter}} of the essay is freedom of {{contract}} in the European perspective. The author points out three different kinds of limits that can restrict freedom of the parties: efficiency, distributive justice and values. According to the author the interpreter’s task is to clarify on which basis the chosen solution lies. The fulfillment of this task is essential for a correct understanding of the current debate on the making of a European private law and can greatly help in elucidating the background of central issues in European contract law (i. e. consumer protection). In the author’s view arguments of “social justice” are often used in the current debate without any regard to political philosophy background. This essay is a first attempt to determine the different implications of various theories of justice (among which, utilitarianism, liberalism, marxism) on contract law.

40|$|Part I of this Article {{examines}} {{the role of}} liquidated damage provisions and penalties {{in the context of}} a general theory of efficient breach of contract. The proof problems inherent in fully recovering idiosyncratic values within the context of operationally practical damage sanctions may prevent the non-breaching party from recovering his subjective expectations if recovery is limited to legally determined remedies. The expected cost of establishing true losses under conventional damage measures will thus induce parties who face uncertain or nonprovable anticipated losses to negotiate stipulated damage agreements. The current penalty rule subjects these agreements to costly review, based not on the fairness of the process, but on whether the initial estimate sufficiently mirrors the anticipated provable loss. Part II {{examines the}} hypothesis that, absent evidence of process unfairness in bargaining, efficiency will be enhanced by the enforcement of an agreed allocation of risks embodied in a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> <b>clause.</b> We argue that agreed damage measures and in terrorem provisions represent, under many circumstances, the most efficient means by which parties can insure against the otherwise non-compensable consequences of breach. Our hypothesis is then also tested against a series of conditions in order to identify alternative legal principles that may provide less costly means of avoiding the harmful effects whose perception apparently prompted the current penalty rule...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 41 - 42). Transparency, efficiency, accountability, competitiveness, equitable treatment and free & fair competition are essential to be ensured in the procurement using public funds. In Bangladesh, these could not be ensured earlier {{due to a lack}} of proper rules and regulation. To streamline the public procurement activities, the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh has enacted Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2006 and thereafter issued Public Procurement Rules (PPR) 2008. Since then government agencies are bound to abide by the Act and Rules very strictly in their procurement activities. The Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) of the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) is continually monitoring the compliance of PPA 2006 and PPR 2008 by the target agencies in the light of 45 predetermined Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Among the four target agencies, LGED is the largest in terms of budget allocation against the projects in the Annual Development Programme (ADP). It is generally said that a total of 80 % of ADP allocation are spent for procurement of goods, works and services which are administered by PPR 2008. Thus, it seems to be a good consideration to have a look at the compliance issues of PPR 2008 in LGED’s procurement activities. The research has been designed under the questions if LGED is following PPR 2008 completely or not; and if not, then the causes behind that. The main objectives of the present study are to find out the extent of compliance of PPR 2008 by LEGD and to find out the gap of compliance and scope of improvement for implementation. The related literatures and reports, particularly from LGED and SRGB, have been thoroughly reviewed before conducting the main research work. The key findings of these reports have been compared and analyzed which helped to draw important conclusion of the study. A questionnaire survey was carried out to collect primary data from different stakeholders related to procurement activities of LGED. For in-depth study on the compliance issues of PPR 2008, eight different projects were studied carefully to collect the qualitative data too. In addition to survey, key informant interviews have been conducted to get the perceptions of few senior officers of LGED and IMED. The study result shows a clear adherence to the rules of PPR 2008 in LGED in carrying out most of the compliance related KPIs. The individual consultant’s reports as well as SRGB’s report also show a clear indication of compliance of PPR 2008 by LGED. Among the 11 different compliance issues, it has been revealed that respondents replied in an overall positive manner as satisfactory against 7 issues. For other 4 issues namely submission of report by the TEC, imposition of liquidated damage, days taken to release payment, and interest for delayed payment are not satisfactory and a clear improvement is required in these areas. Also, the perceptions of the respondents regarding the issue of releasing payment need to investigate more cautiously as there are ambiguity among the findings of present study, individual consultant’s reports and SRGB’s report. However, the scenario is more or less similar in other target agencies For improvement of these situations, four specific recommendations have been drawn. These are (i) to induce a mechanism for ensuring that TER is directly submitted to the contract approving authority as per Rule 36 (3) of PPR 2008, (ii) to ensure the timely payment to the contractors, tender should be floated only after availability of sufficient fund, (iii) a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> <b>clause</b> and (iv) payment of interest in case of delayed payment should be considered carefully to protect the interests of both the parties.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{report is}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2015. Until 2003, there was no standard and legal framework for public procurement in Bangladesh and General Financial Rules (GFR) had regulated public procurement procedures and practices in Bangladesh. These rules were originally issued during the British period and slightly revised in 1951 under the Pakistani rule. After Bangladesh’s independence, few changes were made to these rules in 1994 and 1999 respectively (Islam, 2011). To ensure transparency,accountability and better value for money in the procurement of goods, works or services using public funds, and ensuring equitable treatment and free and fair competition among all persons wishing to participate in such procurement, the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh has enacted Public Procurement Act 2006 (hereinafter called PPA 2006) on 06 July 2006. Under the framework of PPA 2006, the government issued Public Procurement Rules 2008 (hereinafter called PPR 2008) which has come into effective on January 31, 2008. All these were the outcomes of the reform process taken {{by the government to}} streamline the public procurement. Earlier in 2003, Public procurement Regulations 2003 which was effective till the PPR 2008 was issued (Hoque, 2010). Among the government agencies, DPHE is subject to large amount of budget allocation against the projects in the Annual Development Programme (ADP). It is generally said that a total of 80 % of ADP allocation are spent for procurement of goods, works and services which are administered by PPR 2008. Thus, {{it seems to be a}} good consideration to have a look at how DPHE is ensure value for money through using PPR 2008 in it’s procurement activities. The research has been designed under the questions get an idea about is present procurement practices in DPHE under PPR 2008 achieving value for money completely or not; and if not, then the causes behind that. The main objectives of the present study are to find out the extent of achieving value for money by DPHE and to find out the gap and scope of improvement for implementation. The related literatures and reports, particularly from DPHE, PPR 2008 and other international practices in public sector, have been thoroughly reviewed before conducting the main research work. The key findings of these reports have been compared and analyzed which helped to draw important conclusion of the study. The methodology of this study to undertake are (i) questionnaire survey for primary data (ii) key informant interviews (iii) Secondary data collect from project offices and DPHE website. Questionnaire survey was carried out to collect primary data from different stakeholders related to procurement activities of DPHE. For in-depth study on getting value for money different projects were studied carefully to collect the qualitative data too. In addition to survey, key informant interviews have been conducted to get the perceptions of few senior officers of DPHE. The study result shows a clear perceptions that DPHE is far away from better value for money procurement. However, the scenario is more or less similar in other government agencies. The main focus on compliance with the public procurement regulation and emphasizing the transparent use of competitive procedures, rather than necessarily achievement of competitive supply or added value outcomes lead DPHE as well as other government agencies not to always encourage in best practice procurement, in areas such as economic, efficiency and effectiveness. For improvement of these situations, four specific recommendations have been drawn. These are (i) to induce a mechanism for ensuring that TER is directly submitted to the contract approving authority as per Rule 36 (3) of PPR 2008, (ii) to ensure the timely payment to the contractors, tender should be floated only after availability of sufficient fund, (iii) a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> <b>clause</b> and (iv) payment of interest in case of delayed payment should be considered carefully to protect the interests of both the parties...|$|E

40|$|Extract] It {{has long}} been {{accepted}} that the parties are free, {{at the time they}} contract, to agree on the damages that will be payable in the event that one or other of the parties fail to perform their obligations under the contract. Such <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> <b>clauses</b> are enforceable and, if there is a failure to comply with a nominated performance obligation, the sum specified is recoverable by the other party as a debt rather than as damages, thereby rendering the normal compensation principle as well as the normal requirement to prove causation, remoteness, quantification and mitigation redundant. The one requirement for validity of a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> <b>clause</b> is that the sum specified must be a genuine pre-estimate of likely loss. If the sum specified bears no real relationship to the loss likely to be incurred {{as a result of the}} non-performance, the stipulation is not a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> <b>clause</b> but a penalty and penalties will not be enforced. Instead, the courts disregard the clause and substitute their own determination of what damages are properly payable. Until recently, the accepted view was that for a clause to be a penalty, and therefore unenforceable, it had to have, as the trigger for its operation, a breach of contract by the party against whom is was sought to be enforced. That view was challenged and dismissed by the High Court in: Andrews v ANZ Banking Group Limited (2012) 290 ALR 591; 86 ALJR 1002; [2012] HCA 3...|$|R

40|$|When a hotel {{management}} agreement is terminated {{without the consent}} of the manager, the law clearly allows the manager to recover damages (from the owner) {{as a result of the}} termination. In most cases, the owners and managers resolve their issues without litigation. For the substantial number that cannot agree and thus must be adjudicated, the courts have supported solid estimates of forgone fees for determining damage awards, based on careful, defensible calculations of the hotel’s performance during the prospective contractual period. The methodology outlined in this paper provides a way to establish with reasonable certainty the damages that occur from the involuntary termination of a {{hotel management}} agreement. While many hotel management agreements contain a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> <b>clause</b> that establishes the termination fee when the parties agree to terminate the contract, these <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> <b>clauses</b> are not applicable in a situation where the hotel management agreement is terminated even though the manager has not breached the contract. This report provides a numerical example demonstrating that the actual damage amount is at least twice and potentially five times the amount of a typical termination fee. An analysis of recent court cases shows that the courts accept the methodology proposed here, although they may debate the assumptions that underlie the calculations (such as the anticipated inflation rate).

40|$|Penalty clauses is a {{term that}} can be put in an {{agreement}} and is an amount that shall be paid by {{a part of the}} agreement if they cause any damage to the other part by breaking the agreement. Penalty clauses have since around 100 years ago had a quite clear meaning in Sweden according to a lot of authors. These authors have the opinion that penalty clauses is an exclusive judgment of the compensation the victim has right to, that means that if the parties have put a lower amount in the clause the victim won’t get full coverage for the damages caused by the other party. That the penalty clause is an exclusive judgment of the victims right to compensation means that the victim doesn’t have the right to request other compensation above the compensation in the clause if nothing else is stated in the clause. A penalty clause may be viewed as a complement to compensation you get according to The Tort Liability Act (1972 : 206) where {{it is often difficult to}} obtain full compensation for damages when it is required that a number of conditions are to be met for damages deleted. It is often difficult to obtain warrants for losses that are not directly connected with the damage itself but still caused by the injury.

It argues that unconscionability, although clearly a requirement in the Australian doctrine of penalties, is un elusive concept that has given rise to much confusion. This is because of the general uncertainty of the doctrine, ambiguity in the meaning of the term 'unconscionahility' and uncertainty as to whether unconscionability is a separate requirement in determining whether a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> provision is a penalty. This paper argues that if unconscionahility is to continue us a requirement in judicial determination of penalties, the courts should maintain a robust and relatively narrow notion of unconscionability. This is because the very purpose of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> <b>clauses</b> is to avoid uncertainty and litigation and to minimise the likelihood and costs of disputes.

40|$|Time overruns {{are common}} in public works and are not {{confined}} to inherently complex tasks. One explanation advanced in this paper is that bidders can undergo unpredictable changes in production costs which generate an option value of waiting. By exploiting the real-option approach, we examine how the inability to force sellers to meet the contract time influences their bidding behaviour, and how this can ultimately affect the parties' expected payoffs. Further, we examine {{the outcome of the}} bidding process when legal rules prevent the promisee from contracting for damage measures which would grant more than her lost expectation. We show that when the pre-agreed compensatory payments prove insufficient to discourage delayed orders, setting a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> <b>clause</b> would not lead to a Pareto superior outcome with respect to the no-damage-for delay condition. While such a clause would increase the seller's expected payoff, the buyer's expected payoff is lower than when the contract does not provide for any compensation for late-delivery...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{tests the}} intuition that parties {{to a contract}} approach each other differently before the contract is formed than they do once it is finalized.

That shift affects precaution taking even when it has no practical bearing on the costs and benefits of self-protection: the moment of contracting is a reference point that frames the costs and benefits of taking precautions. We present the results of three questionnaire studies in which respondents indicate that they would be more likely to protect their own interests—by requesting a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> <b>clause,</b> by purchasing a warranty, or by shopping around to ensure the best deal—when the contract is not yet finalized than they would when they understand the agreement to be finalized.

40|$|The {{sporting}} {{industry is}} one of the most lucrative in the world. With growing social and media interest in sport, the values and salaries of professional players continue to increase exponentially, and fierce competition within individual sports makes the process of negotiating player contracts critically important. The inclusion in contemporary times of what are known as ‘buyout clauses’ in professional sporting contracts raises questions of both legality and integrity, both of which this article will explore in the context of Association Football (Soccer). Such clauses permit a player or another club to pay a stipulated sum in the contract and effectively terminate the agreement, irrespective of its stipulated duration. From a legal perspective, buyout clauses can potentially be classified as <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> <b>clauses</b> or penalties – which may render them unenforceable – further muddying the regulatory framework in which such clauses operate in a sporting context. More broadly, buyout clauses challenge the very integrity of sport and the rationale underpinning sporting player contracts in the way they foster player disloyalty, promote competition monopoly, undermine the purpose of longer-term player contracts and over-commercialise sport. This article will argue that buyout clauses not only sit uncomfortably with the law of contract and the rules of football but challenge the very integrity of the sport itself. Mark Giancaspr...|$|R
40|$|Law and {{economics}} scholars {{have always had}} a strong interest in contract remedies. Perhaps the most explored issue in contract law has been the desirability of various contract remedies, such as expectation damages, specific performance, or <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages,</b> to name the most common. Scholars have been debating for years, from various perspectives, the comparative advantage of these remedies. Yet, most scholars have assumed that each of these remedies is exclusive, and their work has compared a single remedy contract to another single remedy contract. Interestingly, an analysis that assumes these remedies are optional (or cumulative) has not yet been explored, {{in spite of the fact}} that contract law provides the non-breaching party with a variety of optional remedies to choose from in case of a breach, and in spite of the fact that parties themselves write contracts which provide such an option. In this paper we attempt to start filling in this gap by studying the relationship between these remedies. Specifically, we study the conditions at which a contract that grants the non-breaching party an option to choose from optional remedies is superior to an exclusive remedy contract. We show that under conditions of double-sided uncertainty and asymmetric information between a seller (who might breach) and a buyer (who never breaches) the interaction of the parties 2 ̆ 7 distributions should determine whether a contract provides for exclusive or optional remedies. Specifically, if the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s conditional expected valuation is larger than the seller 2 ̆ 7 s conditional expected valuation (in both cases - conditional that their expected valuation is above the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s mean valuation), then a contract which provides the buyer an option to choose between <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> or specific performance (or actual damages) is superior. Our analysis in this paper informs transactional lawyers of the relevant economic factors they should consider when deciding the optimal composition of remedies in a given context. Moreover, our analysis is relevant for courts that interpret contracts because it will help them to better understand whether rational parties would have agreed that a particular remedy would be an exclusive remedy or an optional remedy when the language of the contract is ambiguous. Lastly, our analysis provides yet another economic rationale for why courts should enforce parties 2 ̆ 7 <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> <b>clauses</b> even if it seems ex-post over, or under, compensatory. We present a model which shows when parties will agree on a non-exclusive <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> <b>clause.</b> Under such a contract the parties stipulate ex-ante that the buyer will have the option to choose upon breach whether she prefers an optional remedy, such as actual damages or specific performance, to the pre-determined <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages.</b> We focus on the ex-ante design of the contract in light of the new information that the parties anticipate they will gain after they draft the contract. Therefore, we assume that no renegotiation or investments are involved. We demonstrate the optimal way to design contract clauses which takes advantage of the information that the seller and the buyer receive between the time they enter into the contract and the time of the actual breach. We further suggest that parties indeed use such clauses and that courts honor them. After laying out the basic model we provide some extensions to it. As is well known, an exclusive <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> contract is equivalent to granting the seller a call option to breach and pay, where the exercise price is equal to the amount of the agreed <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages.</b> What is perhaps less known is that a non-exclusive, or optional, contract, where the buyer can choose performance, is equivalent to giving the buyer a consecutive call option with the same exercise price. Yet, the consecutive call option to the buyer does not have to have the same exercise price but can rather have a higher one. We call this new contract a two-price contract and show that it is even more efficient than the basic contract we have explored before. Next, we introduce more rounds of sequential options and show that while the regular ex-ante contract can achieve on average about 4 Indeed, in an environment of asymmetric information renegotiation costs are high.
