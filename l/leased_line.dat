Communication from the satellites was relayed by radio to Ski and onwards with a <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> to the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Return information was relayed via a radio station at Jeløy. Magnetic tapes were sent to Darmstadt every other week, first via aircraft to Longyearbyen and then onwards to Germany.

25|$|For {{corporate}} or enterprise use, {{a private}} telephone exchange {{is often referred}} to as a private branch exchange (PBX), when it has connections to the public switched telephone network. A PBX is installed in enterprise facilities, typically collocated with large office spaces or within an organizational campus to serve the local private telephone system and any private <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> circuits. Smaller installations might deploy a PBX or key telephone system in the office of a receptionist.|$|E

40|$|Security {{decisions}} {{are based on}} a number of foundational assumptions. The effectiveness of any decision depends on the soundness of the underlying assumptions. To ensure that security is adequate and will work, these assumptions need to be examined. Any time we hear that "A" is secure (or insecure) because of "B", we need to ask some questions. Why that is true? How do we know? What do we know about "B" that makes "A" secure or not? This questioning must be done without bias and without assuming that the conclusion is known in advance. One assumption frequently heard is that a wide area network (WAN) is secure because its sites are linked using dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines.</b> Many people believe that these lines are inherently secure. Some providers of these lines certainly advertise them as secure. It is unsound to assume without question that dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> are secure. This paper examines the properties of <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> and the reality about their security. The main focus is the risk of loss of secrecy of information transmitted on dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines.</b> (The discussion of other aspects of security of dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines,</b> such as the analysis and risk-mitigation related to loss of service, will be left to others.) This paper reviews the evolution of dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> and discusses how this influences their security. It examines the decisions made by telephone companies in response to competitive pressures and how these decisions may impact security. The examples here are commonly used point-to-point services with DS 1 and DS 3 lines (T 1 and T 3). Not discussed is the security of the end-points, which is essentially the same irrespective of the line type.

2500|$|Engelbart, {{with the}} help of his {{geographically}} distributed team, and with Bill English directing the presentation's technical elements, demonstrated NLS's functions. The presentation used an Eidophor video projector that allowed the video output from the NLS computer to be displayed on a large 6.7-metre high screen so the audience could see what Engelbart was doing. Additionally, live video of him and his associates from ARC in Menlo Park, about 48 kilometers away, was combined with the computer's output on the Eidophor. [...] The Augment researchers also created two customized homemade modems at 1200 baud which were high-speed in 1968, linked via a <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> to transfer data from the computer workstation keyboard and mouse at Brooks Hall [...] to their Menlo Park headquarter's SDS-940 computer. [...] In order to provide live two-way video between the lab and the conference hall, two microwave links were used, relayed by a microwave van near the summit of a hill that overlooked both sites. English also commanded a video switcher that controlled what was displayed on the big screen. The camera operator in Menlo Park was Stewart Brand—at the time, a non-computer person, best known as the editor of the Whole Earth Catalog—who also advised Engelbart and the team about how to present the demo.|$|E
