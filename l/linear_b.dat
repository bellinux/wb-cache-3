We describe how <b>Linear</b> <b>B’s</b> phrase-based translation models are learned from a parallel corpus, and show how {{the quality of the}} translations produced by our system can be improved over time through editing. There are two levels at which our translations can be edited. The first is through a simple correction of the text that is produced by our system. The second is through a mechanism which allows an advanced user to examine the sentences that a particular translation was learned from. The learning process can be improved by correcting which phrases in the sentence should be considered translations of each other. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{presence}} of the important and influential military aristocracy that formed in Mycenaean society offers an overwhelming impression of a fierce and warlike people. This impression of militarism {{is reinforced by the}} fortifications erected throughout Mycenaean Greece, the large numbers and quality of the weapons retrieved from the Mycenaean royal graves, artistic representations of war scenes and the textual evidence provided by the <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> records. The <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> scripts also offer some detail about the organization of the military personnel, while military production and logistics were supervised by a central authority from the palaces. According to the records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the damos) was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army; similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|According to the Hittite inscriptions, {{it appears}} that the Ahhiya were a {{powerful}} empire, at the same scale as contemporary Egypt, Assyria and the Hittite Empire. Moreover, {{based on the fact that}} Attarsiya launched a military campaign in Anatolia and fielded one hundred chariots, in addition to infantry, Dutch researcher Jorrit Kelder suggested that Ahhiya must have had the military capacity of at least three times the size of the Mycenaean kingdom of Pylos, based on the information recorded on the <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> tablets unearthed from the specific palace. Based on this view, the Achaeans under Attarsiya may have formed some kind of alliance which included several Mycenaean kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 14th century BC, Mycenaean trade {{began to take}} {{advantage}} of the new trading opportunities in the Mediterranean after the Minoan collapse. The trade routes were expanded further reaching Cyprus, Amman in the Near East, Apulia in Italy and Spain. At that time (c. 1400 BC), the palace of Knossos yielded the earliest records of the Greek <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> script, based on the previous Linear A of the Minoans. The use of the new script spread in mainland Greece and offers valuable insight of the administrative network of the palatial centers. However, the unearthed records are too fragmentary for a political reconstruction of Bronze Age Greece.|$|E

5|$|None of {{the defence}} {{measures}} {{appear to have}} prevented the final destruction and collapse of the Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in ca. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event {{marked the end of}} Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale. The palace of Pylos, in the southwestern Peloponnese, faced destruction in c. 1180 BC. The <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean Greeks {{introduced}} several {{innovations in}} the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, the <b>Linear</b> <b>B,</b> offers the first written records of the Greek language and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon. Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax.|$|E
5|$|The {{decipherment}} of the Mycenaean <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> script, {{a writing}} system adapted {{for the use}} of the Greek language of the Late Bronze Age, demonstrated the continuity of Greek speech from the second millennium BC into the eighth century BC when a new script emerged. Moreover, it revealed that the bearers of Mycenaean culture were ethnically connected with the populations that resided in the Greek peninsula after the end of this cultural period. Various collective terms for the inhabitants of Mycenaean Greece were used by Homer in his 8th century BC epic, the Iliad, in reference to the Trojan War. The latter was supposed to have happened in the late 13thearly 12th century BC, when a coalition of small Greek states under the king of Mycenae, besieged the walled city of Troy. Homer used the ethnonyms Achaeans, Danaans and Argives, to refer to the besiegers. These names appear to have passed down from the time they were in use to the time when Homer applied them as collective terms in his Iliad. There is an isolated reference to a-ka-wi-ja-de in the <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> records in Knossos, Crete dated to c. 1400 BC, which most probably refers to a Mycenaean (Achaean) state on the Greek mainland.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the Mycenaean civilization by the German amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann in the nineteenth century, and the {{discovery of}} the Minoan civilization in Crete by the British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans in the twentieth century, helped to explain many existing questions about Homer's epics and provided archaeological evidence for many of the mythological details about gods and heroes. Unfortunately, the evidence about myths and rituals at Mycenaean and Minoan sites is entirely monumental, as the <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> script (an ancient form of Greek found in both Crete and mainland Greece) was used mainly to record inventories, although certain names of gods and heroes have been tentatively identified.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{nature of}} Mycenaean Greece (c. 1600–1100 BC) in the Late Bronze Age is evident by the numerous weapons unearthed, warrior and combat representations in contemporary art, {{as well as}} by the preserved Greek <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> records. The Mycenaeans invested in the development of military infrastructure with military production and logistics being supervised directly from the palatial centres. This militaristic ethos inspired later Ancient Greek tradition, and especially Homer's epics, which are focused on the heroic nature of the Mycenaean-era warrior élite.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} kingship in Europe {{ultimately}} originates in systems of tribal kingship in prehistoric Europe. The Minoan (c. 3200 – c. 1400 BCE) and Mycenaean civilisation (c. 1600 – c. 1100 BCE) provide the earliest examples of monarchies in protohistoric Greece. Thanks to the decipherment of the <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> script in 1952, much knowledge has been acquired about {{society in the}} Mycenaean realms, where the kings functioned as leaders of palace economies. The role of kings changed in the following Greek Dark Ages (c. 1100 – c. 750 BCE) to big gentleman farmers with military power.|$|E

5|$|Temples and shrines are strangely {{rare in the}} Mycenaean archaeological sites. Monumental cultic {{structures}} are absent at all the palatial centres, {{with the exception of}} Mycenae. However, the cultic center of Mycenae {{seems to have been a}} later (13th century BC) development. Small shrines have been identified in Asine, Berbati, Malthi and Pylos, while a number of sacred enclosures have been located near Mycenae, Delphi and Amyklae. <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> records mention a number of sanctuaries dedicated to a variety of deities, at least in Pylos and Knossos. They also indicate that there were various religious festivities including offerings. Written Mycenaean records mention various priests and priestesses who were responsible for specific shrines and temples. The latter were prominent figures in society, and the role of Mycenaean women in religious festivities was also important, just as in Minoan Crete.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean economy, {{given its}} pre-monetary nature, {{was focused on}} the {{redistribution}} of goods, commodities and labor by a central administration. The preserved <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> records in Pylos and Knossos indicate that the palaces were closely monitoring a variety of industries and commodities, the organization of land management and the rations given to the dependent personnel. The Mycenaean palaces maintained extensive control of the nondomestic areas of production through careful control and acquisition and distribution in the palace industries, and the tallying of produced goods. For instance, the Knossos tablets record c. 80,000-100,000 sheep grazing in central Crete, and the quantity of the expected wool from these sheep and their offspring, as well as how this wool was allocated. The archives of Pylos display a specialized workforce, where each worker belonged to a precise category and was assigned to a specific task in the stages of production, notably in textiles.|$|E

25|$|About {{the same}} time, Professor Alice Kober studied <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> {{and managed to}} {{construct}} grids, linking similar symbols in groups of threes. Kober noticed {{that a number of}} <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> words had common roots and suffixes. This led her to believe that <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> represented an inflected language, with nouns changing their endings depending on their case. However, some characters {{in the middle of the}} words seemed to correspond with neither a root nor a suffix. Because this effect was found in other known languages, Kober surmised that the odd characters were bridging syllables, with the beginning of the syllable belonging to the root and the end belonging to the suffix. This was a reasonable assumption, since <b>Linear</b> <b>B</b> had far too many characters to be considered alphabetic and too few to be logographic; therefore, each character should represent a syllable.|$|E
