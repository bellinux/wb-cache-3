40|$|Air quality {{assessment}} regarding metals and metalloids using experimental measurements is expensive and time consuming {{due to the}} cost and time required for the analytical determination of the levels of these pollutants. According to the European Union (EU) Air Quality Framework Directive (Directive 2008 / 50 /EC), other alternatives, such as objective estimation techniques, {{can be considered for}} ambient air {{quality assessment}} in zones and agglomerations where the level of pollutants is below a certain concentration value known as the <b>lower</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>threshold.</b> These conditions occur in urban areas in Cantabria (northern Spain). This work aims to estimate the levels of As, Cd, Ni and Pb in airborne PM 10 at two urban sites in the Cantabria region (Castro Urdiales and Reinosa) using statistical models as objective estimation techniques. These models were developed based on three different approaches: partial least squares regression (PLSR), artificial neural networks (ANNs) and an alternative approach consisting of principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with ANNs (PCA-ANN). Additionally, these models were externally validated using previously unseen data. The results show that the models developed in this work based on PLSR and ANNs fulfil the EU uncertainty requirements for objective estimation techniques and provide an acceptable estimation of the mean values. As a consequence, they could be considered as an alternative to experimental measurements for air quality assessment regarding the aforementioned pollutants in the study areas while saving time and resources. The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Project CMT 2010 - 16068.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} {{of the heavy}} metals arsenic, cadmium, nickel and mercury in ambient air in the Netherlands are so low that only one sampling point is required to meet the European directive. For benzo(a) pyrene at least three sampling points are needed. This is the conclusion of RIVM in this report, in which observed values are compared with thresholds from the European directive. Based on this analysis, the Ministry of Housing, Spatial planning and the Environment decides how many sampling points {{will be used to}} meet the European requirements. Arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a) pyrene are carcinogenic and mercury is poisonous. Therefore, the European Union has formulated target values and obligations for monitoring for these substances. Monitoring must start in 2007. The Dutch Air Quality Monitoring Network (LML) of RIVM has monitored the substances between 2000 and 2005. The observations indicate that the {{concentrations of}} heavy metals are so low that they are below the lower assessment thresholds. This implies that a minimal number of sampling points is needed. For the Netherlands one point is sufficient. RIVM suggests the location Kollumerwaard since it fits in with the European monitoring programme EMEP/Osparcom. For benzo(a) pyrene concentrations are below the target value but not everywhere below the <b>lower</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>threshold.</b> The threshold is exceeded along busy roads, as observed at Rotterdam Bentinckplein, and around the terrain of Corus in IJmuiden. This implies that at least three sampling points are needed to monitor benzo(a) pyrene in the Netherlands. RIVM suggest the locations Corus, Bentinckplein and the north of the Netherlands. Three additional locations are advisable: in the middle and south of the Netherlands and in Rotterdam at some distance from a busy road...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Many current {{guidelines}} {{for the assessment of}} osteoporosis, including those in Kuwait, initiate fracture risk assessment in men and women using BMD T-score thresholds. We compared the Kuwaiti guidelines with FRAX-based age-dependent intervention thresholds equivalent to that in women with a prior fragility fracture. FRAX-based intervention thresholds identified women at higher fracture probability than fixed T-score thresholds, particularly in the elderly. Purpose: A FRAX® model been recently calibrated for Kuwait, but guidance is needed on how to utilise fracture probabilities in the assessment and treatment of patients. Methods: We compared age-specific fracture probabilities, equivalent to women with no clinical risk factors and a prior fragility fracture (without BMD), with the age-specific fracture probabilities associated with femoral neck T-scores of − 2. 5 and − 1. 5 SD, in line with current guidelines in Kuwait. Upper and <b>lower</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>thresholds</b> for BMD testing were additionally explored using FRAX. Results: When a BMD T-score of − 2. 5 SD was used as an intervention threshold, FRAX probabilities of a major osteoporotic fracture in women aged 50 years were approximately twofold higher than those in women of the same age but with an average BMD. The increase in risk associated with the BMD threshold decreased progressively with age such that, at the age of 83 years or more, a T-score of − 2. 5 SD was associated with a lower probability of fracture than that of the age-matched general population with no clinical risk factors. The same phenomenon was observed from the age of 66 years at a T-score of − 1. 5 SD. A FRAX-based intervention threshold, defined as the 10 -year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture in a woman of average BMI with a previous fracture, rose with age from 4. 3 % at the age of 50 years to 23 %, at the age of 90 years, and identified women at increased risk at all ages. Qualitatively comparable findings were observed in the case of hip fracture probability and in men. Conclusion: Intervention thresholds based on BMD alone do not optimally target women at higher fracture risk than those on age-matched individuals without clinical risk factors, particularly in the elderly. In contrast, intervention thresholds based on fracture probabilities equivalent to a ‘fracture threshold’ consistently target women at higher fracture risk, irrespective of age...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Assessment</b> and {{intervention}} <b>thresholds</b> are developed and proposed in men aged over 50 years and postmenopausal {{women for the}} UK based on fracture probability from the WHO fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX). INTRODUCTION: The FRAX tool has recently become available to compute the 10 -year probability of fractures in {{men and women from}} clinical risk factors (CRFs) with or without the measurement of femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD). The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a case-finding strategy for men and women from the UK at high risk of osteoporotic fracture by delineating the fracture probabilities at which BMD testing or intervention should be recommended. METHODS: Fracture probabilities were computed using the FRAX tool calibrated to the epidemiology of fracture and death in the UK. The relationship between cost effectiveness and fracture probability used the source data from a prior publication that examined the cost effectiveness of generic alendronate in the UK. An intervention threshold was set by age in men and women, based on the fracture probability equivalent to that of women with a history of a prior osteoporosis related fracture. In addition, <b>assessment</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the use of BMD testing were explored. <b>Assessment</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the measurement of BMD followed current practice guidelines where individuals were considered to be eligible for assessment in the presence of one or more CRF. An upper <b>assessment</b> <b>threshold</b> (i. e. a fracture probability above which patients could be treated without recourse to BMD) was based on optimisation of the positive predictive value of the assessment tool. The consequences of <b>assessment</b> {{and intervention}} <b>thresholds</b> on the requirement for BMD test and interventions were assessed using the distribution of clinical risk factors and femoral neck BMD for women in the source cohorts used for the development of the FRAX models RESULTS: Treatment was cost effective at all ages when the 10 -year probability of a major fracture exceeded 7 %. The intervention threshold at the age of 50 years corresponded to a 10 -year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture of 7. 5 %. This rose progressively with age to 30 % at the age of 80 years, so that intervention was cost effective at all ages. <b>Assessment</b> <b>thresholds</b> for testing with BMD (6 - 9 % at the age of 50 years) also rose with age (18 - 36 % at the age of 80 years). The use of these thresholds in a case-finding strategy would identify 6 - 20 % of women as eligible for BMD testing and 23 - 46 % as eligible for treatment, depending on age. The same threshold can be used in men. CONCLUSION: The study provides a method of developing management algorithms for osteoporosis from the estimation of fracture probabilities, rather than those based on BMD alone or BMD with single or multiple CRF...|$|R

The collected PM 10 24 -h samples were analyzed for nine toxic metals and metalloids (Pb, As, Cd, Ni, Cr, Mn, V, CLI, Hg). Concerning the five elements regulated by the European Union, annual average concentrations of Ph were found below the limit values at all sites, Cd and Ni concentrations were lower than the prospective <b>assessment</b> <b>thresholds</b> at all sites, concentrations of As exceeded the <b>assessment</b> <b>threshold</b> at two sites, while concentrations of Hg were found below detection limits in all samples. Concentration levels of Mn and V were {{in compliance with the}} values proposed by the World Health Organization. The seasonal and spatial variability of metal concentrations was examined and site-specific correlation analysis was conducted for the identification of metals with similar origin. The association between trace metals and NO, concentrations was explored to account for the impact of automotive sources, at two traffic-impacted sites. Cu was the metal most closely linked with the road transport sector. The relation of concentration levels with the prevalence of winds from different sectors was studied in an effort to investigate the transport of metal particles from various zones of the city. Finally, factor analysis was carried out to extract the main components responsible for the variance of the dataset and to attribute them to specific source categories, with vehicle-related sources being important in all cases.

40|$|Abstract—Recently, tuning {{the clear}} channel <b>assessment</b> (CCA) <b>threshold</b> in {{conjunction}} with power control has been considered for improving the performance of WLANs. However, we show that, CCA tuning can be exploited by selfish nodes to obtain an unfair share of the available bandwidth. Specifically, a selfish entity can manipulate the CCA threshold to ignore ongoing transmissions; this increases the probability of accessing the medium and provides the entity a higher, unfair share of the bandwidth. We experiment on our 802. 11 testbed to characterize the effects of CCA tuning on both isolated links and in 802. 11 WLAN configurations. We focus on AP-client(s) configurations, proposing a novel approach to detect this misbehavior. A misbehaving client is unlikely to recognize low power receptions as legitimate packets; by intelligently sending low power probe messages, an AP can efficiently detect a misbehaving node. Our key contributions are: 1) We {{are the first to}} quantify the impact of selfish CCA tuning via extensive experimentation on various 802. 11 configurations. 2) We propose a lightweight scheme for detecting selfish nodes that inappropriately increase their CCAs. 3) We extensively evaluate our system on our testbed; its accuracy is 95 percent while the false positive rate is less than 5 percent.

Our approach is based on de-tecting any asymmetry in carrier-sense behavior between node pairs and finding multiple such witnesses to raise con-fidence. The approach is completely passive. It requires deploying multiple sniffers across the network to capture wireless traffic traces. These traces are then analyzed by using a machine learning approach to infer carrier-sense relationships between network nodes.

Currently, there is no accepted standard for measuring breast density. Dual energy mammography has been proposed as a technique for accurate measurement of breast density. The purpose of this study is to validate its accuracy in postmortem breasts and compare it with other existing techniques. Methods: Forty postmortem breasts were imaged using a dual energy mammography system. Glandular and adipose equivalent phantoms of uniform thickness were used to calibrate a dual energy basis decomposition algorithm. Dual energy decomposition was applied after scatter correction to calculate breast density. Breast density was also estimated using radiologist reader <b>assessment,</b> standard histogram <b>thresholding</b> and a fuzzy C-mean algorithm. Chemical analysis was used as the reference standard to assess the accuracy of different techniques to measure breast composition. Results: Breast density measurements using radiologist reader <b>assessment,</b> standard histogram <b>thresholding,</b> fuzzy C-mean algorithm, and dual energy were in good agreement with the measured fibroglandular volume fraction using chemical analysis. The standard error estimates using radiologist reader <b>assessment,</b> standard histogram <b>thresholding,</b> fuzzy C-mean, and dual energy were 9. 9 %, 8. 6 %, 7. 2 %, and 4. 7 %, respectively. Conclusions: The results indicate that dual energy mammography can be used to accurately measure breast density. The variability in breast density estimation using dual energy mammography was <b>lower</b> than reader <b>assessment</b> rankings, standard histogram thresholding, and fuzzy C-mean algorithm.

Introduction: Several international guidelines set age-specific intervention thresholds at the 10 -year probability of fracture equivalent to a woman of average BMI with a prior fracture. At older ages (≥ 70 years), women with prior fracture selected for treatment are at lower average absolute risk than those selected for treatment in the absence of prior fracture, prompting consideration of alternative thresholds in this age group.
