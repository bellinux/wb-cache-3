40|$|This paper investigates whether {{managerial}} entrenchment {{of controlling}} shareholders affects {{the distribution of}} bankers to the boards of Japanese manufacturing firms. Bankers {{are not likely to}} be appointed to firms with <b>large</b> <b>corporate</b> shareholders as controlling shareholders because <b>large</b> <b>corporate</b> shareholders have incentives to entrench managers. Moreover, in the aftermath of executive appointments of banks and <b>large</b> <b>corporate</b> shareholders, restructuring and improved performances of the appointing firms are facilitated. The results suggest that managerial entrenchment of <b>large</b> <b>corporate</b> shareholders generates the substitution of role of corporate governance between banks and <b>large</b> <b>corporate</b> shareholders.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of the <b>large</b> <b>corporate</b> banking customers {{when selecting}} the main {{bank and the}} level of their bank loyalty, are subjects that haven´t been much investigated in previous studies. Most of Portuguese large companies in our sample work with more than 5 banks and there is a positive relation between the size of the company and the number of banks used. The competition in this bank segment is fierce, so it´s important to investigate the selection of the main bank. The data showed that Banking Loyalty for <b>large</b> <b>corporate</b> banking customers depends on Perceived Service Quality, which in turn is one factor construct explained by the variety of products, reliability and by the interpersonal relationship established between the decision maker of the company and the business bank manager. There is no statistical evidence to suggest that the variables Tangibles, Responsiveness and Price conditions are important to predict Perceived Service Quality for <b>large</b> <b>corporate</b> customers. The results of his study can help banks to build a loyalty strategy towards the segment of <b>large</b> <b>corporate</b> customers. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
