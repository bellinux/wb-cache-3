5|$|After the film's mainly {{negative}} reviews Akshay Kumar <b>lashed</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> critics, {{accusing them of}} lacking {{an understanding}} of the audience and the basic ideas of filmmaking. There were rumours about a feud between Kumar and Ekta Kapoor about the former's distancing himself from the project and not promoting it enough. The three leads attended the inaugural 2013 Indian Premier League match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils to promote the film, but the match organisers asked their cameramen not to focus on the actors. After this, a disappointed Kumar asked Kapoor to re-arrange the film's marketing schedule.|$|E
5|$|During {{the months}} leading up to the battle, Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston had {{repeatedly}} retreated from Sherman's superior force. All along the Western and Atlantic Railroad line, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Marietta, Georgia, a pattern was played and replayed: Johnston took up a defensive position, Sherman marched to outflank the Confederate defenses, and Johnston retreated again. After Johnston's withdrawal following the Battle of Resaca, the two armies clashed again at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, but the Confederate senior leadership in Richmond was unhappy with Johnston's perceived reluctance to fight the Union army, even though he had little chance of winning. Thus, on July 17, 1864, as he was preparing for the Battle of Peachtree Creek, Johnston was relieved of his command and replaced by Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. The dismissal and replacement of Johnston remains one of the most controversial decisions of the civil war. Hood, who was fond of taking risks, <b>lashed</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> Sherman's army at Peachtree Creek, but the attack failed with more than two thousand five hundred Confederate casualties.|$|E
5|$|In 1392 however, Carrouges {{was present}} {{for one of}} the more notorious occurrences in fourteenth century France; the first descent into madness of King Charles VI. As a chevalier d'honneur, Carrouges {{accompanied}} the King on campaign and thus was present when the Royal Army entered Brittany to hunt for Pierre de Craon, a noble who had fled Paris following a failed attempt to murder Olivier de Clisson, Constable of France. As the army passed Le Mans on 8 August 1392, a loud noise within his entourage startled the French King, who believing himself to be under attack, <b>lashed</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the nearest person to him. The man happened to be his brother Louis of Valois, who turned and fled from his brother's sword. Killing several pages who attempted to calm his temper, the King set off on full pursuit of Louis, leaving the army strung out across the countryside behind him. The pursuit continued for hours until the exhausted King was eventually subdued by his bodyguard, including Jean de Carrouges.|$|E

25|$|On 21 April, Napoleon {{attacked}} Johann von Hiller in the Battle of Landshut but the Austrians {{managed to}} avoid being trapped. However, Hiller's left wing lost an estimated 9,000 casualties during the day. Three of d'Aspré's grenadier battalions formed the Austrian rear guard as they retreated to Neumarkt-Sankt Veit.

As Regina unleashed her hand of fire to keep Arthur at bay, she tells Emma to use the spell, which unleashes light and dark magic, freeing Merlin. The now-human sorcerer then calls out Emma, and <b>lashed</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> Arthur, telling the King that he - and not Merlin's false prophecies - {{are to blame for}} this mess, and added as long as the dagger and Excalibur are separated Merlin is untouchable. Arthur, however says this is far from over. Merlin later lifted Arthur’s spell off of David and Mary Margaret. Hook asks Merlin if he can he free Emma to remove darkness out of her. Merlin revealed he could lift the darkness from Emma, but there was just one thing he needs from Emma, and that is if Emma's heart was ready to release the darkness from hers.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the same}} tone as the French debate, {{much of the}} {{discussion}} revolved around {{the economy and the}} environment. The other four leaders keep criticizing Harper, especially for his lack of an economic platform despite asking for the format change to focus more on the economy in light of the ongoing financial crisis, and instead using the time to criticize the economic platforms of the other leaders. May <b>lashed</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> Harper for not understanding that Canadians were worried about their homes, jobs and finances, and comparing the current situation to Dutch disease, Dion stated that the only thing that keeps Canada from being hit as hard by the crisis as the US are laws created by the previous Liberal government that the Conservatives had been attempting to overturn, Duceppe repeatedly criticized Harper for financial practices and attitudes similar to the Bush administration, and Layton at one point stated that Harper's position showed he was either incompetent or uncaring to the situation, and asked which one he was, to which Harper did not respond. Harper also came under criticism for his laissez-faire attitude to the job sector, supporting primarily the oil companies and companies that outsource jobs in the manufacturing sector.|$|E

25|$|With the new ball due six overs {{into the}} fourth day Sri Lankan wickets fell thick and fast, half the team falling before lunch, the last of which being opener Michael Vandort who {{narrowly}} missed out on being the fifth batsmen ever to hold his wicket throughout an entire innings. England took to the crease just before lunch with a very slow run rate that came only from Strauss - Trescothick fell after nine runs, none of them contributed by him. The third man, Alastair Cook held out {{for the rest of}} the innings though achieving 34 not out; during this time Strauss fell to a controversial catch, replays showed it popped off his pads. Pietersen, wanting to end the Test quickly, took the wicket with his usual speed, taking 13 runs off 25 balls his confidence assured by a catch by the tourists' skipper to be called a no ball, and a further two no balls which he took boundaries off. However, his cockiness proved his downfall as he <b>lashed</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> a ball from Murali, the only bowler to take wickets in the second innings, and was caught plumb. Collingwood soon fell for 3 and it seemed as if the easy target of 78 was going to be more of a struggle but Cook, remaining from the second partnership, took two runs and two byes and skipper Flintoff, who done nothing with his first three balls, drove Murali down the ground to long on for four on his fourth ball to win the match, and his third in a row as English skipper.|$|E
25|$|Tyrone Dobbs {{was also}} the centre of a {{domestic}} abuse storyline when he was introduced to police officer Kirsty Soames whilst on a night out. Tyrone and Kirsty immediately hit it off. Kirsty's temper began to show when she used to become jealous of Tyrone's friends, specifically his friendship with Fiz Stape. Kirsty fell pregnant and her temper soon turned violent as she <b>lashed</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> Tyrone on numerous occasions, attacking him with her fists and kitchen appliances. Tyrone hid his injuries from his concerned friends and refused to leave the house. Kirsty gave birth in the Rovers Return after a heated confrontation with Tina, yet Tyrone was absent due to him fixing Fiz's boiler. This made Kirsty secretly leave out Tyrone's name as their newborn daughter Ruby's father on the birth certificate. Kirsty's violent outbursts become more frequent and a terrified Tyrone finally confides in a horrified Fiz about Kirsty's domestic abuse, this leads to Tyrone and Fiz embarking on a secret affair after she confesses her love for him. Fiz and Tyrone conspire a plan together for Tyrone to wed Kirsty then report Kirsty to the police for her domestic abuse, resulting in Kirsty being sent to prison and Tyrone getting full custody of his daughter Ruby. Tyrone proposes to a delighted Kirsty, but Kirsty eventually discovers his affair with Fiz, and their plan. Kirsty eventually reveals Fiz and Tyrone's affair {{in front of everybody}} at her and Tyrone's wedding. After the wedding, Kirsty and Tyrone have a blazing row back at their house, resulting in Kirsty falling down the stairs after trying to attack Tyrone. The row is overheard by several neighbours and they think Tyrone has been assaulting Kirsty and call the police. Kirsty lies to the police and makes a false accusation that Tyrone has been beating her for months. This leads to Tyrone's arrest and he is bailed until his appending trial. Whilst on bail, Tyrone flees Weatherfield with Fiz, her daughter Hope and his daughter Ruby causing the police to issue a warrant for his arrest. Tyrone is caught and arrested. Kirsty lies again whilst giving evidence at Tyrone's trial by playing the victim to the jury. But whilst struggling being a single mum at home, Kirsty snaps at a screaming Ruby and starts screaming at her child to stop crying. Realising that she does not trust herself around her daughter, Kirsty interrupts Tyrone's trial and confesses to the judge that it was her who had been assaulting Tyrone and he was innocent. Tyrone gets released and Kirsty gets charged and is sentenced to three years in prison. Tyrone gets full custody of Ruby and starts his new life with his girlfriend Fiz.|$|E

500|$|The Nigerian government, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of General Yakubu Gowon, was backed by the British government; the two nations enjoyed a vigorous trade partnership. Addressing the causes of the war in 1968, Achebe <b>lashed</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the Nigerian political and military forces that had forced Biafra to secede. He framed the conflict in terms of the country's colonial past. The writer in Nigeria, he said, [...] "found that the independence his country was supposed to have won was totally without content... The old white master was still in power. He had got himself a bunch of black stooges to do his dirty work for a commission." ...|$|E
500|$|When he {{returned}} to the University of Nigeria in 1976, he hoped to accomplish three goals: finish the novel he had been writing, renew the native publication of Okike, and further his study of Igbo culture. He also showed that he would not restrict his criticism to European targets. In an August 1976 interview, he <b>lashed</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the archetypal Nigerian intellectual, who is divorced from the intellect [...] "but for two things: status and stomach. And if there's any danger that he might suffer official displeasure or lose his job, he would prefer to {{turn a blind eye to}} what is happening around him." [...] In October 1979, Achebe was awarded the first-ever Nigerian National Merit Award.|$|E
500|$|As {{these works}} became more widely available, reviews and essays about African literature– {{especially}} from Europe– began to flourish. Bristling against the commentary flooding his home country, Achebe published an essay entitled [...] "Where Angels Fear to Tread" [...] in the December 1962 issue of Nigeria Magazine. In it, he distinguished between the hostile critic (entirely negative), the amazed critic (entirely positive), and the conscious critic (who seeks a balance). He <b>lashed</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> those who critiqued African writers from the outside, saying: [...] "no man can understand another whose language {{he does not}} speak (and 'language' here does not mean simply words, but a man's entire world view)." [...] In September 1964 he attended the Commonwealth Literature conference at the University of Leeds, presenting his essay [...] "The Novelist as Teacher".|$|E

Goldman suffered during his long absence. [...] Convinced Goldman {{was involved in the}} plot, police raided her apartment and—finding no evidence—pressured her landlord into evicting her.

[...] While Ionel Gherea suspected that Caragiale was merely acting, Eugen Lovinescu, who described Caragiale's personality as [...] "bizarre", also referred to him as [...] "colorful and sterile." [...] Despite his hectic lifestyle, Caragiale feared poverty and <b>lashed</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> Bohemianism, stressing that [...] "it kills, and many times not just figuratively".
