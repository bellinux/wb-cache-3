5|$|The British Universities American Football League (BUAFL) {{was formed}} in 2007 by the BAFA after the {{organisation}} that ran its predecessor ceased operations. Since 2012, the <b>league</b> <b>has</b> operated {{under the jurisdiction of}} British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS).|$|E
5|$|When the WHA ceased {{operations}} in 1979, the NHL absorbed {{four of the}} league's teams, which brought the NHL to 21 teams, a figure that remained constant until the San Jose Sharks were added as an expansion franchise in 1991. Since then, the <b>league</b> <b>has</b> grown from 22 teams in 1992 to 31 today as the NHL spread its footprint across the United States. The <b>league</b> <b>has</b> withstood major labour conflicts in 1994–95 and 2004–05, the latter of which saw the entire 2004–05 NHL season canceled, {{the first time in}} North American history that a <b>league</b> <b>has</b> canceled an entire season in a labour dispute. Wayne Gretzky passed Gordie Howe as the NHL's all-time leading scorer in 1994 when he scored his 802nd career goal. Mario Lemieux overcame non-Hodgkin lymphoma to finish his NHL career with over 1,700 points and two Stanley Cup championships. Increased use of defence-focused systems helped cause scoring to fall in the late 1990s, leading some to argue that the NHL's talent pool had been diluted by 1990s expansion. In 1998, the NHL began awarding teams a single point for losing in overtime, hoping {{to reduce the number of}} tie games; after the 2004–05 lockout, it eliminated the tie altogether, introducing the shootout to ensure that each game has a winner.|$|E
5|$|BSkyB's {{continued}} {{partnership with}} the Premier <b>League</b> <b>has</b> led {{to an increase in}} the value of broadcasting rights and matches televised. Managers however have voiced their concerns about the latter and the excessive cost of live rights is partly a reason why top-flight football has not returned to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed to have more than one holder.|$|E

5|$|Each {{team in the}} <b>league</b> <b>has</b> a manager, who is {{responsible}} for team strategy and leadership on and off the field. Assisted by various coaches, the manager sets the line-up and starting pitcher before each game, and makes substitutions throughout the game. In early baseball history, it was not uncommon for players to fill multiple roles as player-managers; specifically, they managed the team while still being signed to play for the club. The last player-manager in Major League Baseball was Pete Rose, who began managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1984.|$|E
