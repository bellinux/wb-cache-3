40|$|We {{study the}} {{relevance}} of the cross-sided externality between <b>liquidity</b> makers and <b>takers</b> from the two-sided market perspective. We use exogenous changes in the make/take fee structure, minimum tick-size and technological shocks for <b>liquidity</b> <b>takers</b> and makers, as experiments to identify cross-sided complementarities between <b>liquidity</b> makers and <b>takers</b> in the U. S. equity market. We find that the externality is on average positive, but it decreases with adverse selection. We quantify the economic significance of the externality by evaluating an exchange's revenue after a make/take fee change...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between high frequency traders (HFT) and price jumps in the stock market. Using the Nasdaq HFT dataset, we find that HFT liquidity taking activity is lower than normal while HFT liquidity supplying activity is higher. During extreme price jumps HFT liquidity providers accumulate an inventory position {{in the opposite direction}} of the jump. HFT <b>liquidity</b> <b>takers</b> take an inventory position {{in the direction of the}} jump, but the imbalance is over three times larger for permanent price movements than transitory ones, consistent with HFT impounding new information into prices. The evidence is generally consistent with HFT dampening extreme market events...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe study {{a linear}} price impact model {{including}} other <b>liquidity</b> <b>takers,</b> whose flow of orders either follows a Poisson or a Hawkes process. The optimal execution problem is solved explicitly in this context, and the closed-formula optimal strategy describes in particular how one should {{react to the}} orders of other traders. This result enables us to discuss {{the viability of the}} market. It is shown that Poissonian arrivals of orders lead to quite robust Price Manipulation Strategies in the sense of Huberman and Stanzl. Instead, a particular set of conditions on the Hawkes model balances the self-excitation of the order flow with the resilience of the price, excludes Price Manipulation Strategies and gives some market stability...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{empirical}} {{study of the}} intertwined behaviour of members in a financial market. Exploiting a database where the broker that initiates an order book event can be identified, we decompose the correlation and response functions into contributions coming from different market participants and study how their behaviour is interconnected. We find evidence for the following. (1) Brokers are very heterogeneous in liquidity provision—some appear to be primarily liquidity providers while others are primarily <b>liquidity</b> <b>takers.</b> (2) The behaviour of brokers is strongly conditioned on the actions of other brokers. In contrast, brokers are only weakly influenced by {{the impact of their}} own previous orders. (3) The total impact of market orders {{is the result of a}} subtle compensation between the same broker pushing the price in one direction and the liquidity provision of other brokers pushing it in the opposite direction. These results enforce the picture of market dynamics being the result of the competition between heterogeneous participants, interacting to form a complex market ecology...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study within econophysics, a {{research}} field where financial problems are investigated using methods from statistical physics. An artificial stock market was implemented in Java and used to assess some assertions made in empirical studies by J. -P. Bouchaud and collegues. The model was able to reproduce several characteristics of high-fequency data from financial markets, e. g. a leptocurtic return distribution and a nearly constant return function. Much of the emphasis of this report is made on the methodol-ogy itself, since many modelling issues remain to be solved in the agent-based computational economics field. However, the market was also used to simlulate trading scenarios, where the impact of different trading strategies was analysed. More specifically, it was shown in simulation that an overall diffusive price development can result from a competition between two populations of traders: one of liquidity providers, who create persistence in the prices, and another of <b>liquidity</b> <b>takers,</b> who create anti-persistence. It was also shown that a slowly decaying trade sign autocorrelation function could result from similar trading criteria, but not in any obvious way from liquidity provider’s division of large market orders into several smaller ones...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{competitive}} advantage enjoyed by dark venues over stock exchanges due to rules regulating the minimum price variation (MPV) for quoting equity securities. The MPV rule requires quotes above $ 1. 00 per share {{to be in}} pennies, but it permits subpenny trades to facilitate price improvement for marketable orders. This exception to the penny quote rule benefits dark venues by allowing broker-dealers to intercept market orders by offering subpenny trading opportunities. However, a growing chorus of critics allege that (a) dark venues exploit this exception by offering little or no price improvement for market orders, and (b) allowing dark venues to intercept market orders harms the incentive to display liquidity on exchanges on which markets depend for efficient securities pricing. Using a novel regression discontinuity design and over eight trillion observations on market data from 2011 - 2014, we provide evidence that is inconsistent with both critiques. First, increasing the incentive to use {{the exception to the}} penny quote rule increases the rate of trading in dark venues at the midpoint of the national best bid and offer, thus offering <b>liquidity</b> <b>takers</b> price improvement {{in the form of the}} quoted half-spread. Second, while enhanced order flow to dark pools decreases price competition on exchanges, this reduction is primarily because of reduced quoting among high frequency trading (HFT) firms. Consistent with concerns about HFT, we show HFT market-making increases price volatility and that overall trading volume increases when it occurs in dark pools rather than on exchanges...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 195 - 208. 1. Introduction [...] 2. Literature review [...] 3. Tick size, {{electronic}} {{liquidity providers}} and market quality [...] 4. Price discovery and dark trading [...] 5. Joint impact of fragmentation and algorithmic trading on market quality [...] 6. Conclusions. This thesis examines the combined effect of algorithmic trading and market fragmentation on market quality. Three distinct but inter-related research studies are conducted {{and the ultimate}} findings of the thesis are three fold. First, exchange listed companies can use stock splits to manage their tick size and influence the level of algorithmic market making in their security, which can subsequently impact the company’s liquidity. Stock splits alter a security’s relative tick size. In some cases, this change in relative tick size increases the quoted spread captured by market makers. This extra incentive improves liquidity and reduces transaction costs. Companies that undertake stock splits while already tick constrained increase the profit of market makers {{at the cost of}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>takers.</b> Second, the research shows that dark trading contributes very little to the price discovery of a market. Further, regulation that reduces the level of dark trading in a market does not impact the relative competitiveness in price discovery for cross listed assets. Third, the thesis examines the joint impact of fragmentation and algorithmic trading. Findings show that on exchange fragmentation increases market competition and reduced transaction costs, with two side effects: the joint growth of dark fragmentation and algorithmic trading. Dark trading reduces integrity by adding an alternate venue with lesser price impact, while algorithmic trading increases both market efficiency and integrity.

40|$|Financial {{markets and}} the pace of trading have changed {{dramatically}} over the last decade. Stock exchanges have replaced their traditional physical floors with electronic trading platforms. Most market participants now employ automated, algorithmic strategies, which {{are the focus of}} the present thesis. The thesis consists of introduction and three essays. In the first essay, I study the impact of algorithmic trading activity on market properties. The analysis is based on a proprietary dataset from NASDAQ OMX Nordic. The essay presents a method for causality identification that does not rely on exogenous events. Separating maker’s and taker’s activity provides the analysis of causality between traders and market properties. The results identify two-way causality from the activity of algorithmic liquidity providers to relative bid-ask spread and from bid-ask spread to the activity of algorithmic <b>liquidity</b> <b>takers.</b> In the second essay, I study the impact of trading fees on market properties and activity of traders using the natural experiment of unifying the tariff structure of the NASDAQ OMX Nordic exchange trading price lists. I test the hypothesis that if the change of the exchange fees is less than uncertainties of other trading costs (e. g. cost of future bid-ask spread), the impact of the change is economically insignificant. The third essay presents a quantitative approach to measure market efficiency, based on the waiting time distribution. Constructing mean-reverting portfolios of cross-listed stocks provides observation of inefficient states by divergence of price from its mean. The farther the price diverges from its mean, the quicker the mean-reversion is. The essay shows that the parameter of the waiting-time exponential distribution is a good indicator of market efficiency. The findings presented in the thesis have the potential to be of interest for investors, regulators, and policy makers internationally...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of trading in {{securities}} markets with two specialized sides: traders posting quotes (market makers) and traders hitting quotes (market <b>takers).</b> <b>Liquidity</b> cycles emerge naturally, as the market moves from phases with high liquidity to phases with low liquidity. Traders monitor the market to seize pro 8 ̆ 5 t opportunities. Complementarities in monitoring decisions generate multiplicity of equilibria: one with high liquidity and another with no liquidity. The trading rate depends on the allocation of the trading fee between each side and the maximal trading rate is achieved with asymmetric fees. The di¤erence in the fee charged on market-makers and the fee charged on market-takers ("the make-take spread") increases in (i) the tick-size, (ii) {{the ratio of the}} size of the market-making side to the size of the market-taking side, and (iii) the ratio of monitoring cost for market-takers to monitoring cost for market-makers. The model yields several empirical implications regarding the trading rate, the dura-tion between quotes and trades, the bid-ask spread, and the e¤ect of algorithmic trading on these variables...|$|R
