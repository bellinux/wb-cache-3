25|$|Poppy (Ward) is {{depicted}} as a small, innocent girl, who asks a stranger (most likely Pender) if they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her picture book. The book contains pictures of often controversial {{issues such as the}} Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse or the Ku Klux Klan, but Poppy's narration describes them more naively, suggesting they are, for example, performing acrobatics routines or playing dress-ups.|$|E

Naughty Dog's Jak & Daxter series and the Ratchet & Clank series are in similar genres; each game in both series' has been released at a similar time and both contain references to each other. Ryan Schneider, an employee of Insomniac, said, [...] "The analogy that I like to use is that at Insomniac we <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it as how Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant act {{when it comes to}} their professions. We don't really look at it as how we compare to other athletes or other games, we just try to do the best that we can and elevate the sport." ...|$|E
500|$|The first Homicide season {{featured}} the first performances of Richard Belzer as Detective John Munch, a character the actor has been credited for in 459 television episodes (...) in nine different television series, including Homicide and [...] Levinson asked Belzer {{to audition for}} the part after hearing the comedian ranting on The Howard Stern Show, where Belzer was a frequent guest. Levinson said Belzer was a [...] "lousy actor" [...] during his first audition with the [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] script. Levinson asked Belzer {{to take some time}} to reread and practice the material, then come back and read it again. During his second reading, Levinson said Belzer was [...] "still terrible", but that the actor eventually found confidence in his performance. Daniel Baldwin was cast as Beau Felton, and dyed his naturally blond hair black for the role. Baldwin {{became one of the most}} vocal supporters of the show, giving many press interviews about it and defending it amid declining ratings. Baldwin declared, [...] "Homicide is the best material I've had the chance to do." [...] Melissa Leo was cast as Kay Howard, which was considered a particularly strong part compared to other female characters in police dramas at the time, which were usually limited to love interests or minor parts. While most cast members shadowed real-life Baltimore detectives to prepare for the roles, Leo did not because, she said, [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the horror that's in the world." [...] Wendy Hughes was cast as medical examiner Carol Blythe.|$|E

2500|$|In 1844, Heine wrote {{series of}} musical feuilletons over several {{different}} music seasons discussing {{the music of}} the day. His review of the musical season of 1844, written in Paris on April 25, 1844, is his first reference to Lisztomania, the intense fan frenzy directed toward Franz Liszt during his performances. However, Heine was not always honorable in his musical criticism. In April 1844 he wrote to Liszt suggesting that he might <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a newspaper review he had written of Liszt's performance before his concert; he indicated that it contained comments Liszt would not like. Liszt took this as an attempt to extort money for a positive review and did not meet Heine. Heine's review subsequently appeared on April 25 in Musikalische Berichte aus Paris and attributed Liszt's success to lavish expenditures on bouquets and to the wild behaviour of his hysterical female [...] "fans." [...] Liszt then broke relations with Heine. Liszt was not the only musician to be blackmailed by Heine for the nonpayment of [...] "appreciation money." [...] Meyerbeer had both lent and given money to Heine, but after refusing to hand over a further 500 francs was repaid by being dubbed [...] "a music corrupter" [...] in Heine's poem Die Menge tut es.|$|E
