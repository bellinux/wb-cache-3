Current industrial practices for check-ing the results of a <b>load</b> <b>test</b> remain ad hoc, involving high-level checks. Few research efforts are devoted to the au-tomated analysis of <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> results, mainly due to the limited access to large scale systems for use as case studies. Automated and systematic <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> analysis is going to be much needed, as many services have been offered online to an increasing number of users. This dissertation proposes automated approaches to detect functional and performance problems in a <b>load</b> <b>test</b> by mining the recorded <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> data (execution logs and performance metrics).

Excess soil is carefully carved away, leaving a sample with a diameter-to-height ratio of 3 or more. Porous stones are placed {{on the top and}} bottom of the sample to provide drainage.

5000|$|Preconsolidation {{pressure}} {{cannot be}} measured directly, {{but can be}} estimated using {{a number of different}} strategies. Samples taken from the field are subjected to a variety of tests, like the constant rate of strain test (CRS) or the incremental <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> (IL). These tests can be costly due to expensive equipment and the long period of time they require. Each sample must be undisturbed and can only undergo one test with satisfactory results. [...] It is important to execute these tests precisely to ensure an accurate resulting plot. There are various methods for determining the preconsolidation pressure from lab data. The data is usually arranged on a semilog plot of the effective stress (frequently represented as σ'vc) versus the void ratio. This graph is commonly called the e log p curve or the consolidation curve.|$|E
50|$|Handloading {{cost for}} the 6.5 Creedmoor is roughly {{equivalent}} to other 6.5mm cartridges, such as the 6.5×47, due to the availability of Lapua small primer brass for both cartridges. Norma now makes brass for the cartridge and as of 2017 Norma brass is available through several major retailers at approximately the same cost as Lapua brass. Lapua brass for 6.5×47 lasts about 12 to 20 reloads. When the 6.5 CM was first introduced it was advertised as a 60,000 psi capable case. However, when it was placed into production Hornady listed it as 62,000 psi and had it SAAMI registered as such. For this reason many hand loaders have had poor experiences reloading for it. Blown primers on the first shot at 62,000 psi is not uncommon. Early shooting articles listed the ammo as loaded to 58,000 psi but later ones list it as 57,000 psi. This is because Hornady reduced the loads in its factory ammo because of complaints that it was often blowing primers. Lapua delivered Creedmoor brass at Shot show 2017, and production quantities became available via major retailers in second quarter 2017. The Lapua version has a small primer pocket. Thus, loads from a Lapua Creedmoor {{should not be used}} in another manufacturer's Creedmoor brass that features a large primer pocket without applying proper hand <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> for pressure first. Also the use of a smaller diameter decapping rod is required to size and decap.|$|E

Some new load cells, test procedure, and construction technology were adopted based on the applications to different deep foundations, which could enlarge the application scopes of bi-directional <b>loading</b> <b>test.</b> A new type of bi-directional <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> for pipe pile was conducted, in which the load cell was installed and loaded after the pipe pile with special connector has been set up.

40|$|A {{spring damper}} with trigger {{function}} and self-restoration function {{is going to}} be installed at a curved cable-stayed bridge to raise the seismic performance. Since this type of devise has never been used for a bridge so far, two types of loading tests of the spring damper were performed to verify the performance under the conditions in the actual bridge; one was a cyclic <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> and the other was a long-term constant <b>loading</b> <b>test.</b> The cyclic <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> was to identify the force-displacement relationship, and its temperature and loading-speed dependencies, verifying the performance in case of a large-scale earthquake. The long-term constant <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> was to identify the durability of the spring damper, verifying the performance in case of a dead load condition. As a result, it was verified that the spring damper could meet the specified performance criteria under the conditions in the actual bridge although a minor temperature dependency in the force-displacement relationship was found...|$|E
40|$|For {{existing}} bridges {{with large}} uncertainties, analytical methods have limitations. Therefore, to reduce these uncertainties, field testing of a bridge can be used. A type {{of such a}} field test is a proof <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> in which a load equivalent to the factored live load is applied. If the bridge can carry this load without signs of distress, the proof <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is successful, {{and it has been}} shown experimentally that the bridge fulfils the code requirements. It should be understood that this method for assessment is different from the diagnostic <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> that are carried out in Ecuador prior to opening a bridge. The loads used for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are significantly larger. Therefore, it is important to instrument the bridge for a proof <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> and to evaluate during the <b>test</b> that the <b>load</b> does not result in permanent damage to the bridge. To research this topic, and to develop recommendations for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests,</b> a series of proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> and a collapse test were carried out in the Netherlands. Additional laboratory testing was carried out as well. Based on this information, recommendations for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> of reinforced concrete slab bridges have been developed for the failure modes of flexure and shear. In the German and North American guidelines for <b>load</b> <b>testing,</b> <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> for shear is not permitted. However, many existing bridges do not fulfil the requirements for shear upon assessment according to the current live load models. Even though more experimental research is needed to develop proof <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> for shear in a guideline or code for the Netherlands, the currently available research results already lead to interesting conclusions with regard to the behaviour of bridges proof <b>load</b> <b>tested</b> in shear, and the required safety margin to avoid damage to the bridge.

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{believed}} that the static <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is the most reliable method to obtain the load-settlement relation of a pile. Most static <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are conducted using reaction piles as the reaction system. However, some researches {{point out that the}} influence of the reaction piles on the measured load-settlement relation may not be neglected, and that an analysis of the measured data is required to obtain a true load-settlement of the. From this point of view, the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> or the rapid <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> may not be necessarily inferior to the static <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> considering cost and time performance of the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>test</b> as well. In this study, a new computer program for analysing the stress-wave propagation phenomena in pile driving was developed using a finite difference scheme and rational soil resistance models. Verification analyses of the proposed method are conducted first, and then the developed method is applied to the dynamic and static <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> on an end-bearing concrete pile...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{frame of}} the tramway network {{development}} in Budapest a new tramway line has been established on the south part of Budapest, which crosses the Danube on the Rákóczi-bridge. The bridge superstructure is a continuous double-cell steel box girder having 6 spans with the largest span of 98. 52 m. The bridge was originally designed to carry four traffic and two tramway lanes, however the tramway line was only built on the bridge in 2015 and opened for the traffic with an increased tramway load level than originally planned. Related to this tramway network development the required static calculations and the <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> of the Rákóczi-bridge was executed by the BME Department of Structural Engineering. A complex <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> program was developed to check the static and dynamic behaviour of the bridge structure using 20 trucks and 4 trams having the total weight of 1040 tons. The <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> program involved local and global loading conditions investigating the local and global structural behaviour of the bridge under the combined effect {{of the truck and}} tramway loads. An extended dynamic <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> program was also carried out to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the bridge under the trucks and tramways separately.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new testing method {{to examine the}} mechanical behavior of railroad ballast subjected to repeated train passages on ballasted track. Two types of cyclic loading tests, namely a single-point <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> and a moving-wheel <b>loading</b> <b>test,</b> were performed with small-scale models of ballasted track. Next, a "multi-ring shear apparatus" was developed {{as a type of}} torsional simple shear apparatus, and the applicability of a newly proposed multi-ring shear test to an element test of railroad ballast subjected to moving-wheel loads was examined by comparing the results of multi-ring shear tests with those of small-scale model tests. As a result, it was recognized that cumulative strain obtained from multi-ring shear tests is almost equivalent to the one derived from small scale-model tests. Moreover, it was revealed that the difference between loading methods has a considerable influence on the cyclic plastic deformation of railroad ballast because settlement in a moving-wheel <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> was much larger than the one in a single-point <b>loading</b> <b>test.</b> These results lead to the conclusion that a multi-ring shear test has an excellent applicability to the estimation of deformation behavior of granular materials subjected to moving-wheel loads...|$|E

40|$|Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) systems face {{continuously}} evolving field workloads {{in terms}} of activated/disabled feature sets, varying usage patterns and changing deployment configura-tions. These evolving workloads often have a large impact {{on the performance of}} a ULS system. Hence, continuous <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> is critical to ensuring the error-free operation of such systems. A common challenge facing performance analysts is to validate if a <b>load</b> <b>test</b> closely resembles the current field workloads.
