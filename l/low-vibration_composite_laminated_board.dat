40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{investigates the}} {{responses}} of glass/epoxy <b>composite</b> <b>laminates</b> subjected to impact loading. It presents a new technique to characterize the impact properties and to correlate them with the damage process of the <b>composite</b> <b>laminates.</b> The technique, called the energy profiling technique, is based on instrumented impact tests and the least-squares method. The technique gives specific definitions of the penetration and perforation thresholds of the <b>composite</b> <b>laminates.</b> It also defines {{the range of the}} penetration process and quantifies the energy absorption efficiency of the <b>composite</b> <b>laminates.</b> The primary damage modes in the damage process of the <b>composite</b> <b>laminates</b> can also be correlated with the impact properties by using the energy profiling technique. The advantages of using this technique to analyze the experimental data obtained from impact tests are demonstrated by investigating the glass/epoxy <b>composite</b> <b>laminates</b> with various impactor sizes, laminate thicknesses, fiber orientations, and a sandwich construction. Results from the energy profiling technique show that the penetration and perforation thresholds increase nearly linearly with the size of the impactor while they increase nonlinearly with the thickness.
