40|$|The {{fermentation}} of African <b>locust</b> <b>beans</b> was studied. These {{beans in}} the raw state are inedible but may be rendered palatable by fermentation. Both their texture and taste are thereby considerably improved. The beans were first processed by boiling and dehulling. They were then fermented at 37 (+OR-) 2 (DEGREES) C in stationary fermentor units. Physico-chemical, microbiological, biochemical and enzymological investigations were carried out on the substrate undergoing spontaneous fermentation and on radappertized (11 kGy) controls. Reductions in carbohydrate (52 %), protein (12 %) and energy (9 %) contents, as obtained from the mass and energy balances, occurred during fermentation. The physico-chemical changes were due to the action of extracellular carbohydrases and proteases produced by a Bacillus spp. Pure culture inoculation with the Bacillus spp. gave the fermented product within 24 h {{in contrast to the}} normal 72 h fermentation period. Both pH and titratable acidity increased during fermentation. Ammonia was produced as a result of proteolysis.
