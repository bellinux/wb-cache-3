50|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>leakage</b> <b>effect,</b> tourism {{industries}} in developed countries often are much more profitable per dollar received than tourism in smaller countries. Islands, in particular, suffer from significant leakage. In countries such as Turkey and the United Kingdom, the benefit to the economy from tourism is twice the dollar amount spent by tourists. In smaller places, such as Micronesia and Polynesia, that benefit is half the dollar amount spent. Some locations have managed to nullify the <b>leakage</b> <b>effect</b> almost entirely - New York City claims to generate seven dollars for the local economy per dollar spent by tourists. Some estimates of the degree of leakage claim only 5% of money spent on tourism remains in a developing country's economy.|$|E

50|$|According to Goldemberg et al.. (1996, p. 28), {{short-term}} <b>leakage</b> <b>effects</b> need to {{be judged}} against <b>leakage</b> <b>effects</b> in the long-term. A policy that, for example, saw a carbon taxes set only in developed countries might lead to leakage of emissions to developing countries. However, a desirable negative leakage could occur due to a lowering in demands of coal, oil, and gas from the developed countries and thus the world prices. This will lead to developing countries being able to afford more of any hydrocarbon fuel type, thus being able to substitute more oil or gas for coal, in effect lowering their national emissions. In the long-run, however, if the transfer of less polluting technologies is delayed, this substitution by income effects might have no long-term benefit.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) {{has been}} adopted in many {{broadband}} wireless communication standards. In OFDM systems, channel estimation is a crucial module in coherent signal detection and receiver diversity combining. In this paper, we investigate the <b>leakage</b> <b>effect</b> of pilot-symbol-assisted channel estimation techniques and propose a channel-aware unequal error protection (UEP) scheme for multimedia communications in OFDM systems. The proposed method exploits the variations of the bit error rate in different OFDM subchannels caused by the <b>leakage</b> <b>effect,</b> and provides UEP by transmitting the more important data through the subchannels experiencing lower error rate. Compared with the systems that do not consider the channel estimation in the transmission of multimedia data, the proposed scheme can improve the Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) of reconstructed images by up to 3 dB.

40|$|Information sharing {{is often}} said to improve the {{profitability}} and efficiency of supply chains. However, {{it is not necessarily}} the case that information sharing always improves the profit of every party in the supply chain, or even the profit of the supply chain as a whole. This thesis studies vertical information sharing in a two-echelon supply chain with one manufacturer and two competing retailers. Two types of channel interaction are modeled with different game rules, manufacturer Stackelberg or vertical Nash. It is found that the equilibria obtained by previous work on vertical information sharing with manufacturer Stackelberg have a subtle error, which this thesis rectifies. In obtaining the correct equilibrium, two different methods are proposed, with or without <b>leakage</b> <b>effect.</b> Without <b>leakage</b> <b>effect,</b> the manufacturer is always better off by acquiring demand information from more retailers, and each retailer is worse off to disclose his demand information as the first mover but could be better off as the second mover. Two equilibria exist: both retailers sharing informat ion or none sharing; the latter Pareto always dominates the former. With <b>leakage</b> <b>effect,</b> it may occur that the manufacturer loses and the retailers gain from information sharing. The supply chain always benefits from information sharing and the retailers may want to pay the manufacturer for receiving their information. Information sharing in a vertical Nash setting is also examined. The manufacturer is always better off by acquiring more information from retailers and the retailers are always worse off by disclosing their private signals; no information sharing is the unique equilibrium. One counterintuitive finding is that information trading can be achieved even when it reduces the total supply chain profit in the case of vertical Nash or manufacturer Stackelberg without <b>leakage</b> <b>effect.</b> We start by assuming that the manufacturer is make-to-order and generalize the results to the make-to-stock situation {{on the assumption that the}} manufacturer always meets the downstream orders...|$|E

40|$|Li [1] {{examined}} the incentives for information sharing in a two-level supply chain {{in which there}} are a manufacturer and many competing retailers. Li showed that direct and <b>leakage</b> <b>effects</b> of information sharing discourage retailers from sharing their information and identified conditions under which demand information sharing can be traded. The purpose of this note is to show that full information is the equilibrium if the manufacturer adopts a discount based incentive scheme instead of the side-payment scheme used by Li. The discount-based scheme eliminates the direct as well as <b>leakage</b> <b>effects.</b> Discount based scheme is attractive because similar schemes are commonly used in practice and it results in Pareto-efficient information sharing equilibrium that has a higher social welfare and consumer surplus than the no information sharing scenario. The total social benefits and consumer surplus are higher in discount based incentive scheme. Consequently, many of the key results of Li are critically dependent {{on the assumption that the}} manufacturer uses side payment for information...|$|R

By imposing a carbon price on the electricity generation sector, our results show significant carbon leakage.
