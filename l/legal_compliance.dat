25|$|On 28 February 2008 it was {{announced}} that the ITV network, the BBC's main rival, had hired Fincham to be their new Director of Television. At the Edinburgh Television Festival in August 2008, Fincham claimed that broadcasters such as ITV were under too much pressure from industry regulator OfCom to produce programmes that were only of a minority interest, as opposed to pure entertainment programmes for a mainstream audience. In 2010 he took the decision to axe the long-running drama series The Bill; ATV News Network reported 97% of the public were against the drama being dropped.. In December 2011, he took the unilateral decision to remove a song from the Jonathan Ross Show that was commissioned especially for the show by the comedian and songwriter Tim Minchin. The song, called Woody Allen Jesus, had already been approved by Ross's producer and ITV's <b>legal</b> <b>compliance</b> officers. Minchin, disappointed at the decision, later made the footage available on his own site where he also criticised Fincham's decision.|$|E

50|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>compliance</b> is {{the process}} or {{procedure}} to ensure that an organization follows relevant laws, regulations and business rules. The definition of <b>legal</b> <b>compliance,</b> especially {{in the context of}} corporate legal departments, has recently been expanded to include understanding and adhering to ethical codes within entire professions, as well. There are two requirements for an enterprise to be compliant with the law, first its policies need to be consistent with the law. Second, its policies need to be complete with respect to the law.The role of <b>legal</b> <b>compliance</b> has also been expanded to include self-monitoring the non-governed behavior with industries and corporations that could lead to workplace indiscretions.Within the LGRC realm, {{it is important to keep}} in mind that if a strong legal governance component is in place, risk can be accurately assessed and the monitoring of <b>legal</b> <b>compliance</b> be carried out efficiently. It is also important to realize that within the LGRC framework, legal teams work closely with executive teams and other business departments to align their goals and ensure proper communication.|$|E
