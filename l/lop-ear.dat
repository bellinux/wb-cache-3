60|$|As it was, {{we were in}} {{no small}} danger. Zip! A tiny pebble whirred past with the force almost of a bullet. <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I began {{paddling}} frantically. Whiz-zip-bang! <b>Lop-Ear</b> screamed with sudden anguish. The pebble had struck him between the shoulders. Then I got one and yelled. The only thing that saved us was the exhausting of Red-Eye's ammunition. He dashed back to the gravel-bed for more, while <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I paddled away.|$|E
60|$|I saw {{the arrow}} leap up, miss <b>Lop-Ear,</b> glance against a limb, and fall {{back to the}} ground. I danced {{up and down on}} my lofty perch with delight. It was a game! The Fire-Man was {{throwing}} things at <b>Lop-Ear</b> as we sometimes threw things at one another.|$|E
60|$|My next dream, in {{the order}} of succession, begins always with the flight of <b>Lop-Ear</b> and myself through the forest. The Fire-Man and Broken-Tooth and the tree of the tragedy are gone. <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I, in a {{cautious}} panic, are fleeing through the trees. In my right leg is a burning pain; and from the flesh, protruding head and shaft from either side, is an arrow of the Fire-Man. Not only did the pull and strain of it pain me severely, but it bothered my movements and made it impossible for me to keep up with <b>Lop-Ear.</b>|$|E
60|$|Before sunrise {{the next}} morning, Raphael was faring forth gallantly, well armed and mounted, by Synesius's side, {{followed}} by {{four or five}} brace of tall brush-tailed greyhounds, and by the faithful Bran, whose <b>lop-ears</b> and heavy jaws, unique in that land of prick-ears and fox-noses, formed the absorbing subject of conversation among some twenty smart retainers, who, {{armed to the teeth}} for chase and war, rode behind the bishop on half-starved, raw-boned horses, inured by desert training and bad times to do the maximum of work upon the minimum of food.|$|R
60|$|At any rate, {{during the}} period of <b>Lop-Ear's</b> {{marriage}} I knocked about from pillar to post, in danger every night that I slept, and never comfortable. One of the Folk died, and his widow was taken into the cave of another one of the Folk. I took possession of the abandoned cave, but it was wide-mouthed, and after Red-Eye nearly trapped me in it one day, I returned to sleeping in the passage of the double-cave. During the summer, however, I used {{to stay away from the}} caves for weeks, sleeping in a tree-shelter I made near the mouth of the slough.|$|R
60|$|At {{first the}} episode seemed merely funny to me. But {{when one of}} the vagrant impulses of fear, common in that age of {{perpetual}} insecurity, moved within me, I was struck with my own loneliness. I was made suddenly aware of <b>Lop-Ear's</b> remoteness out there on that alien element a few feet away. I called loudly to him a warning cry. He awoke frightened, and shifted his weight rashly on the log. It turned over, sousing him under. Three times again it soused him under as he tried to climb out upon it. Then he succeeded, crouching upon it and chattering with fear.|$|R
60|$|I {{have said}} that <b>Lop-Ear</b> was not happy. My sister was the {{daughter}} of the Chatterer, and she made Lop-Ear's life miserable for him. In no other cave was there so much squabbling and bickering. If Red-Eye was a Bluebeard, <b>Lop-Ear</b> was hen-pecked; and I imagine that Red-Eye was too shrewd ever to covet Lop-Ear's wife.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} we {{crouched}} there, <b>Lop-Ear</b> nervous and anxious to be gone, perpetually and apprehensively peering {{this way and}} that, and myself whimpering softly and sobbing. <b>Lop-Ear</b> was plainly in a funk, and yet his conduct in remaining by me, {{in spite of his}} fear, I take as a foreshadowing of the altruism and comradeship that have helped make man the mightiest of the animals.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} this time that a slight {{defection}} arose {{on the part of}} <b>Lop-Ear.</b> He got into the habit of wandering off {{in the direction of the}} tree where my mother lived. He had taken a liking to my vicious sister, and the Chatterer had come to tolerate him. Also, there were several other young people, progeny of the monogamic couples that lived in the neighborhood, and <b>Lop-Ear</b> played with these young people.|$|E
60|$|We {{looked at}} it with startled eyes. The heat of it drove us back. Another tree caught, and another, and then half a dozen. We were frightened. The monster had broken loose. We {{crouched}} down in fear, while the fire ate around the circle and hemmed us in. Into <b>Lop-Ear's</b> eyes came the plaintive look that always accompanied incomprehension, and I know that in my eyes {{must have been the}} same look. We huddled, with our arms around each other, until the heat began to reach us and the odor of burning hair was in our nostrils. Then we made a dash of it, and fled away westward through the forest, looking back and laughing as we ran.|$|R
50|$|The Welsh is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} pig native to Wales. It {{is a large}} white breed known for its hardiness in outdoor (extensive) farming, its long, pear-shaped body and its <b>lop-ears.</b> The breed was first mentioned in the 1870s, and after the Howitt committee report in 1955, became the third most common sire in the United Kingdom after the Large White pig and British Landrace pig. The Welsh pig experienced a decline in numbers {{in the late twentieth}} century because consumer demands had changed and the carcase was considered too fatty. In 2005 the breed was considered endangered and later came under the auspices of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. Since then numbers have expanded somewhat, and by 2012, the registered breeding herd had increased to over 1000 animals.|$|R
60|$|<b>Lop-Ear</b> got married. It was {{the second}} winter after our adventure-journey, and it was most unexpected. He gave me no warning. The first I knew was one {{twilight}} when I climbed the cliff to our cave. I squeezed into the entrance and there I stopped. There {{was no room for}} me. <b>Lop-Ear</b> and his mate were in possession, and she was none other than my sister, the daughter of my step-father, the Chatterer.|$|E
60|$|<b>Lop-Ear,</b> {{struggling}} with the second puppy, scowled at me and intimated {{by a variety of}} sounds the different kinds of a fool and a bungler that I was. This made me ashamed and spurred me to valor. I grabbed the remaining puppy by the tail. He got his teeth into me once, and then I got him by the nape of the neck. <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I sat down, and held the puppies up, and looked at them, and laughed.|$|E
60|$|The hours passed. The sun climbed {{overhead}} and began its descent to the west. The light wind died down and left <b>Lop-Ear</b> on his log floating around {{a hundred feet}} away. And then, somehow, I know not how, <b>Lop-Ear</b> made the great discovery. He began paddling with his hands. At first his progress was slow and erratic. Then he straightened out and began laboriously to paddle nearer and nearer. I could not understand. I sat down and watched and waited until he gained the shore.|$|E
60|$|When <b>Lop-Ear</b> had chewed off {{the head}} of the arrow, the shaft was {{withdrawn}} easily enough. I started to go on, but this time it was he that stopped me. My leg was bleeding profusely. Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured. Running out {{to the end of a}} branch, <b>Lop-Ear</b> gathered a handful of green leaves. These he stuffed into the wound. They accomplished the purpose, for the bleeding soon stopped. Then we went on together, back to the safety of the caves.|$|E
60|$|The first morning, {{after my}} night's sleep with <b>Lop-Ear,</b> I learned the {{advantage}} of the narrow-mouthed caves. It was just daylight when old Saber-Tooth, the tiger, walked into the open space. Two of the Folk were already up. They made a rush for it. Whether they were panic-stricken, or whether he was too close on their heels for them to attempt to scramble up the bluff to the crevices, I do not know; but at any rate they dashed into the wide-mouthed cave wherein <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I had played the afternoon before.|$|E
60|$|But {{he carried}} {{something}} in his hand that I had never seen before. It was a bow and arrow. But at that time a bow and arrow had no meaning for me. How was I to know that death lurked in that bent piece of wood? But <b>Lop-Ear</b> knew. He had evidently seen the Fire People before and knew something of their ways. The Fire-Man peered {{up at him and}} circled around the tree. And around the main trunk above the fork <b>Lop-Ear</b> circled too, keeping always the trunk between himself and the Fire-Man.|$|E
60|$|The latter {{abruptly}} reversed his circling. <b>Lop-Ear,</b> caught unawares, also hastily reversed, {{but did not}} win {{the protection}} of the trunk until after the Fire-Man had twanged the bow.|$|E
60|$|As {{twilight}} came on, {{the open}} space was deserted. The Folk were seeking {{the safety of the}} caves. <b>Lop-Ear</b> led the way to bed. High up the bluff we climbed, higher than all the other caves, to a tiny crevice that could not be seen from the ground. Into this <b>Lop-Ear</b> squeezed. I followed with difficulty, so narrow was the entrance, and found myself in a small rock-chamber. It was very low--not {{more than a couple of}} feet in height, and possibly three feet by four in width and length. Here, cuddled together in each other's arms, we slept out the night.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately for <b>Lop-Ear,</b> she died. An unusual thing {{happened}} that summer. Late, {{almost at the}} end of it, a second crop of the stringy-rooted carrots sprang up. These unexpected second-crop roots were young and juicy and tender, and for some time the carrot-patch was the favorite feeding-place of the horde. One morning, early, several score of us were there making our breakfast. On one side of me was the Hairless One. Beyond him were his father and son, old Marrow-Bone and Long-Lip. On the other side of me were my sister and <b>Lop-Ear,</b> she being next to me.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the fall}} of the year when <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I {{returned}} from our long adventure-journey, and the winter that followed was mild. I made frequent trips to the neighborhood of my old home-tree, and frequently I searched the whole territory that lay between the blueberry swamp and the mouth of the slough where <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I had learned navigation, but no clew could I get of the Swift One. She had disappeared. And I wanted her. I was impelled by that hunger which I have mentioned, and which was akin to physical hunger, albeit it came often upon me when my stomach was full. But all my search was vain.|$|E
60|$|At last {{his teeth}} opened and {{released}} my torn flesh. I carried his body up the cliff with me, and perched out {{the night in}} the entrance of my old cave, wherein were <b>Lop-Ear</b> and my sister. But first I had to endure a storm of abuse from the aroused horde for being the cause of the disturbance. I had my revenge. From time to time, as the noise of the pack below eased down, I dropped a rock and started it up again. Whereupon, from all around, the abuse of the exasperated Folk began afresh. In the morning I shared the dog with <b>Lop-Ear</b> and his wife, and for several days the three of us were neither vegetarians nor fruitarians.|$|E
60|$|<b>Lop-Ear</b> took a smashing fall {{as he ran}} beside me. An arrow {{had driven}} through the calf of his leg and tripped him. He tried to run, but was tripped and thrown by it a second time. He sat up, crouching, {{trembling}} with fear, and called to me pleadingly. I dashed back. He showed me the arrow. I caught hold of it to pull it out, but the consequent hurt made him seize my hand and stop me. A flying arrow passed between us. Another struck a rock, splintered, {{and fell to the}} ground. This was too much. I pulled, suddenly, with all my might. <b>Lop-Ear</b> screamed as the arrow came out, and struck at me angrily. But the next moment we were in full flight again.|$|E
6000|$|Broken-Tooth {{displayed}} remarkable agility in the game. He was [...] "It" [...] {{less frequently}} {{than any of}} us, {{and in the course}} of the game he discovered one difficult [...] "slip" [...] that neither <b>Lop-Ear</b> nor I was able to accomplish. To be truthful, we were afraid to attempt it.|$|E
60|$|I {{stared at}} <b>Lop-Ear,</b> {{and he stared}} back. We {{understood}} each other. Immediately, and with great caution and quietness, we began climbing up the cliff. When we reached the top we looked back. The abiding-place was deserted, Red-Eye remained in his cave, and the horde had disappeared {{in the depths of}} the forest.|$|E
60|$|Also, {{he had a}} cough, and {{he gasped}} and hacked and spluttered prodigiously. Every time he tried to climb the tree we pulled him back, until at last he {{surrendered}} to his weakness and did no more than sit and weep. And <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I sat with him, our arms around each other, and laughed at his wretchedness.|$|E
60|$|All {{of which}} is neither here nor there. The Swift One was radically {{different}} {{from any of the}} females of the horde, and I had a liking for her from the first. Her mildness and gentleness attracted me. She was never rough, and she never fought. She always ran away, and right here may be noted the significance of the naming of her. She was a better climber than <b>Lop-Ear</b> or I. When we played tag we could never catch her except by accident, while she could catch us at will. She was remarkably swift in all her movements, and she had a genius for judging distances that was equalled only by her daring. Excessively timid in all other matters, she was without fear when it came to climbing or running through the trees, and <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I were awkward and lumbering and cowardly in comparison.|$|E
60|$|The {{mountains}} were {{bleak and}} inhospitable, {{and three times}} that afternoon we tried to regain the woods. But the Tree People were lying in wait, and they drove us back. <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I slept that night in a dwarf tree, {{no larger than a}} bush. Here was no security, and we would have been easy prey for any hunting animal that chanced along.|$|E
60|$|He kept {{me there}} {{half a day}} before he gave up. After that, when <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I were {{reasonably}} sure of gaining the double-cave, we did not retreat up the cliff to our own cave when Red-Eye came upon the scene. All we did was {{to keep an eye}} on him and see that he did not cut across our line of retreat.|$|E
60|$|How {{she yelled}} and squalled. The Chatterer, {{who had been}} away all day and who was only then returning, heard the noise and rushed for the spot. My mother also rushed, but he got there first. <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I did not wait his coming. We were off and away, and the Chatterer gave us the chase of our lives through the trees.|$|E
60|$|And so <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I had chased Saber-Tooth {{across three}} miles of forest. Toward the last {{he put his}} tail between his legs and fled from our gibing like a beaten cur. We did our best {{to keep up with}} him; but when we reached {{the edge of the forest}} he was no more than a streak in the distance.|$|E
60|$|I {{found her}} {{down in the}} old {{neighborhood}} near the blueberry swamp, where my mother lived and where <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I had built our first tree-shelter. It was unexpected. As I came under the tree I heard the familiar soft sound and looked up. There she was, the Swift One, sitting on a limb and swinging her legs {{back and forth as}} she looked at me.|$|E
60|$|Here {{and there}} between the trunks were water-cracks, and through them {{we could see}} schools of small fish, like minnows, darting back and forth. <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I became {{fishermen}} at once. Lying flat on the logs, keeping perfectly quiet, waiting till the minnows came close, we would make swift passes with our hands. Our prizes we ate on the spot, wriggling and moist. We did not notice the lack of salt.|$|E
60|$|Also, I {{can apply}} {{the logic of}} events to the various happenings. For instance, {{there is no doubt}} {{whatever}} that my mother and I were treed by the wild pigs and fled and fell in the days before I made the acquaintance of <b>Lop-Ear,</b> who became what I may call my boyhood chum. And it is just as conclusive that between these two periods I must have left my mother.|$|E
60|$|At the end {{of several}} days his leaving home was accomplished. He wailed his grief, unheeded, from {{the centre of the}} open space, for at least half an hour, and then came to live with <b>Lop-Ear</b> and me. Our cave was small, but with {{squeezing}} there was room for three. I have no recollection of Broken-Tooth spending more than one night with us, so the accident must have happened right away.|$|E
60|$|Our logs drifted {{slowly and}} at last {{grounded}} gently on the bank. <b>Lop-Ear</b> and I crept ashore. The logs drifted on out of the eddy and swept away down the stream. We looked at each other, {{but we did not}} laugh. We were in a strange land, and it did not enter our minds that we could return to our own land in the same manner that we had come.|$|E
