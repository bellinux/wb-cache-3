The {{incident}} was later memorialized as part of country music lore in numerous songs and videos, including Jones’ own “Honky Tonk Song” in 1996. Twelve years earlier, the video for Hank Williams Jr.’s “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight” featured George Jones riding a lawnmower. Vince Gill’s 1993 hit “One More Last Chance” includes the line, “She might have took my car keys, but she forgot about my old John Deere.” The video ends with Gill on a John Deere tractor passing Jones on a John Deere lawnmower. The video for John Rich’s “Country Done Come to Town” also features Jones on a riding lawnmower.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, newer cemeteries might be {{designed}} to be more efficiently maintained with lower labour through {{the increased use of}} equipment, e.g. lawn cemeteries where the maintenance can be performed with a ride-on mower or <b>lawn</b> <b>tractor.</b> However, efficient maintenance of newer graves is often frustrated by the actions of mourners who often place flowers and other objects on graves. These objects often require manual intervention; in some cases objects will be picked up and returned after maintenance, in other cases (e.g. dead flowers) they will be disposed of.|$|E

50|$|Garden {{tractors}} (mini tractors) are small, light tractors {{designed for}} use in domestic gardens and small estates. Garden tractors are designed for cutting grass, snow removal, and small property cultivation. In the U.S., the term riding lawn mower today often is {{used to refer to}} mid- or rear-engined machines. Front-engined tractor layout machines designed primarily for cutting grass and light towing are called <b>lawn</b> tractors; heavier-duty <b>tractors</b> of similar size are garden tractors. Garden tractors are capable of mounting a wider array of attachments than <b>lawn</b> <b>tractors.</b> Unlike <b>lawn</b> <b>tractors</b> and rear-engined riding mowers, garden tractors are powered by horizontal-crankshaft engines with a belt-drive to transaxle-type transmissions (usually of four- or five-speeds, although some may also have two-speed reduction gearboxes, drive-shafts, or hydrostatic or hydraulic drives). Garden tractors from Wheel Horse, Cub Cadet, Economy (Power King), John Deere, Massey Ferguson and Case Ingersoll are built in this manner. The engines are generally a one- or two-cylinder petrol (gasoline) engines, although diesel engine models are also available, especially in Europe. Typically, diesel-powered garden tractors are larger and heavier-duty than gasoline-powered units and compare more similarly to compact utility tractors.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} {{input drive}} {{is a central}} hydraulic pump and final drive unit(s) is/are a hydraulic motor, or hydraulic cylinder (see: swashplate). Both components can be placed physically far apart on the machine, being connected only by flexible hoses. Hydrostatic drive systems are used on excavators, <b>lawn</b> <b>tractors,</b> forklifts, winch drive systems, heavy lift equipment, agricultural machinery, earth-moving equipment, etc. An arrangement for motor-vehicle transmission was probably used on the Ferguson F-1 P99 racing car in about 1961.|$|R
50|$|Dighton is {{home of the}} Cow Chip Festival. The Dighton Lions Club {{hosts the}} event. Every June a {{traveling}} carnival comes and sets up behind the Town Hall.

They place cows out on the enclosed squares. People then place bets on the square that they believe will be defecated on first {{by one of the}} cows.|$|E
50|$|A long-standing {{tradition}} of GCA {{has been a}} parade on Independence Day. The parade commences at 10:00 am {{at the intersection of}} Albright and Central avenues and proceeds north to Chatsworth, turns left to Railroad Avenue, and then again to the starting point and the historic O’Meara lawn. There, the federal flag is affixed to the end of an extended fire-truck ladder, a prayer is said, and all join in the singing of the national anthem, followed by hot dogs, lemonade and cookies. The parade is in essence a bike parade with children and adults marching the route. The Glyndon Volunteer Fire Department leads the event with one of its trucks, accompanied on occasion by a historic vehicle or <b>lawn</b> <b>tractor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|While {{the main}} draw {{to the day}} is the clam chowder, the event {{has evolved into a}} family-oriented day. There is no {{admission}} fee except for those who wish to sample the chowder.

[...] Proceeds go to the local Fire Brigade, which uses the money for restoration of the town's original fire station, and also to help supplement the expenses of the Fire Department by purchasing much needed equipment that would otherwise have to wait for town funding.|$|E
