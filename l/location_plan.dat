40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{accepted}} techniques of location {{analysis in the}} food sector {{with the realities of}} “real world” forecasting in convenience store (c-store) retailing. To offer a conceptual framework for c-store operators intending to become more strategic in their small store <b>location</b> <b>planning</b> but currently lacking established expertise or extensive research budgets. Approach/Methodology: Outlines potential best practice based on industry experience, and contact and discussion with location analysts and retail consultants, as well as a wide ranging examination of the academic literature in this area. Research/practical implications: First, to briefly detail the strategic regulatory motivations and <b>location</b> <b>planning</b> implications of the major UK food retailers entering this market. Second, to summarise the established sales forecasting techniques in food retailing. Third, to review why these established approaches are difficult to apply to convenience stores in neighbourhood markets. Fourth, to detail basic approaches that should be further developed by small store operators lacking budgets to develop specialist <b>location</b> <b>planning</b> departments. Originality/value: Academic conceptualisations of <b>location</b> <b>planning</b> in the convenience store sector are largely absent from the literature.

40|$|<b>Location</b> <b>planning</b> {{is crucial}} in {{determining}} the best site for industrial development. Currently, industrial <b>location</b> <b>planning</b> focuses more on the physical rather than the economic aspects for selecting such locations. This research focuses on the latter, taking bread manufacturing industry as a study case. This research has two objectives. Firstly, to review the theoretical aspects of industrial location. Secondly, to demonstrate how Geographic Information System (GIS) is used to apply the concept of Spatial Margin to Profitability (SMTP) to determine best locations by taking bread manufacturing as a case. Questionnaires were distributed to respondents {{in the study area}} to gather data on revenue, cost of materials, operation, management, marketing and transportation. Network analysis was performed using ArcView 3. 3 software to calculate bread distribution cost. It was found that the most profitable area for the bread industry was Pelangi with the profit of around RM 0. 20 per capita. It was recommended that future research combines the physical characteristics of industry and industrial location’s level of profitability into industrial <b>location</b> <b>planning</b> by using GIS. Besides, it should also consider profit-based industrial location theory to improve industrial <b>location</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|R

50|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on where to place an airport dating back to 1923. The first study developed the site <b>location</b> <b>plan</b> for Lindbergh field. Eighteen studies were conducted by private groups, most in the early days by those who were opposed to Lindbergh being built instead of on land set aside at what is now Montgomery Field. One was a revisiting of a study done in the 1980s by the City in 1994 when NAS Miramar closed as a naval air station and was then immediately transferred to the Marine Corps as a marine corps air station, MCAS Miramar. Another was by the City of San Diego in 1984 and another that started in 1996 and sat dormant with SANDAG until the Airport Authority was formed. This study is the first study ever done to look for a new site by an agency that actually had jurisdiction over the issue, and the first non-site specific comprehensive study of the entire region.|$|E
5000|$|Having visited {{several hundred}} prisons across England, Scotland, Wales and wider Europe, Howard {{published}} {{the first edition}} of The State of the Prisons in 1777. It included very detailed accounts of the prisons he had visited, including plans and maps, together with detailed instructions on the necessary improvements, especially regarding hygiene and cleanliness, the lack of which was causing many deaths. It is this work that has been credited as establishing the practice of single-celling in the United Kingdom and, by extension, in the United States. The following account, of the Bridewell at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, is typical:Two dirty day-rooms; and three offensive night-rooms: That for men eight feet square: one of the women's, nine by eight; the other four and a half feet square: the straw, worn to dust, swarmed with vermin: no court: no water accessible to prisoners. The petty offenders were in irons: at my last visit, eight were women.Howard viewed his work as humanitarian. Terry Carlson, in his 1990 biographical tract on Howard, remarks:Howard's detailed proposals for improvements were designed to enhance the physical and mental health of the prisoners and the security and order of the prison. His recommendations pertaining to such matters as the prison <b>location,</b> <b>plan</b> and furnishings, the provision of adequate water supply, and prisoner's diet promoted hygiene and physical health. Recommendations concerning the quality of prison personnel, rules related to the maintenance of standards of health and order and an independent system of inspection, reflect the need for prison personnel to set a moral example.In April 1777, Howard's sister died, leaving him £15,000 and her house. He used this inheritance and the revenue from the sale of her house to further his work on prisons. In 1778, he was again examined by the House of Commons, who were this time inquiring into [...] "hulks", or prison ships. Two days after giving evidence, he was again travelling Europe, beginning in the Dutch Republic.|$|E
30|$|Results {{have shown}} that, with uniform traffic, {{location}} plans designed for maximum low dominance ratios have worse call blocking and outage ratios. Specifically, a fourfold increase in both {{key performance indicators}} has been observed in the simulated scenario with uniform traffic {{when compared to the}} worse values obtained with coverage-based and interference-based femtocell location plans. However, with uneven spatial user distribution, the <b>location</b> <b>plan</b> designed to increase low dominance ratios obtains the best results before and after executing the traffic sharing process. In the simulated extreme scenario, the unsatisfied user ratio obtained by handover-based traffic sharing with the overlapping-based <b>location</b> <b>plan</b> is 40 % smaller than that of the best of the other location plans.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the contribution of visitor demand to the seasonal sales variations experienced at grocery retailers in Cornwall, South West England. Design/methodology/approach: Working collaboratively with a major UK retailer provides access to store trading information and customer data from a popular loyalty card scheme. The authors use spatial analysis to identify revenue originating from outside the store catchment, and explore the spatial and temporal nature of the visitor demand recorded in‐store. Findings: The paper demonstrates the significant degree of seasonality experienced around stores in terms of their revenue generated from out‐of‐catchment visitors, and highlights implications for store <b>location</b> <b>planning.</b> Most notably, visitor expenditure tends to demonstrate far more spatial and temporal clustering than residential demand. The authors argue that it is essential for retailers to ensure that their <b>location</b> <b>planning</b> makes full use of all available consumer data to understand the local nature of demand, including the impact of visitor expenditure. Research limitations/implications: The authors aim to use this insight to develop a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for use within site <b>location</b> <b>planning</b> in the retail sector. This would incorporate a spatial interaction model to estimate and account for variation in local demand generated by seasonal tourist visits. Originality/value: Customer level loyalty card data are rarely available for academic investigations and the authors are able to provide a unique insight into customer expenditure in tourist locations. There has been little exploration of seasonal tourist demand in store <b>location</b> <b>planning,</b> and this study addresses an identified academic and commercial need...|$|R
30|$|Femtocells {{have been}} {{suggested}} as a promising solution {{for the provision of}} indoor coverage and capacity. In this paper, a new planning strategy for placing femtocell access points so as {{to make the most of}} automatic traffic sharing algorithms is proposed for a long-term evolution (LTE) heterogeneous network. The aim of the proposed method is to increase overlapping between femtocells by increasing the percentage of area with low dominance of the serving femtocell. Method assessment is carried out by simulating classical traffic sharing algorithms in a three-dimensional office scenario with femtocell <b>location</b> <b>plans</b> designed based on different network performance criteria. Results show that <b>location</b> <b>plans</b> with a larger low dominance ratio achieve better network performance after sharing traffic than plans designed for maximum coverage or connection quality.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Multi-depot Location-Routing Problem (MDLRP) {{is about}} finding the optimal number and {{locations}} of depots while allocating customers to depots and determining vehicle routes to visit all customers. In {{this study we}} propose a nested Lagrangian relaxation-based method for the discrete uncapacitated MDLRP. An outer Lagrangian relaxation embedded in subgradient optimization decomposes the parent problem into two subproblems. The first subproblem is a facility location-like problem. It is solved to optimality with Cplex 9. 0. The second one resembles a capacitated and degree constrained minimum spanning forest problem, which is tackled with an augmented Lagrangian relaxation. The solution of the first subproblem reveals a depot <b>location</b> <b>plan.</b> As soon as a new distinct <b>location</b> <b>plan</b> {{is found in the}} course of the subgradient iterations, a tabu search algorithm is triggered to solve the multi-depot vehicle routing problem associated with that plan, and a feasible solution to the parent problem is obtained. Its objective value is checked against the current upper bound on the parent problem’s true optimal objective value. The performance of the proposed method has been observed on a number of test problems, and the results have been tabulated. Key words: location routing; Lagrangian relaxation; heuristics; tabu search. 1...|$|E

However, the properties of the site <b>location</b> <b>plan</b> resulting from the optimization process have not been analyzed in detail. Thus, no basic rules have been proposed to build near-optimal solutions without the need for the optimization process in real scenarios. Moreover, to the authors’ knowledge, no study has evaluated the impact of femtocell positions on the performance of automatic traffic sharing algorithms in a heterogeneous LTE network.|$|E
