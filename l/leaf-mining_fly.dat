Insects used as biological pest control for this plant include weevils of the genus Bagous and the Asian hydrilla <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>fly</b> (Hydrellia pakistanae). Tubers pose a problem as they can lie dormant {{for a number of}} years, making it even more difficult to remove from waterways and estuaries. Hydrilla holds the advantage in that in can spread efficiently through both tubers and turions.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{objective}} {{of these studies}} {{was to determine if}} <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>flies</b> in the genus Hydrellia (H. pakistanae Deonier and H. balciunasi Bock) introduced as biological control agents would impact the fluridone-resistant biotype of Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle (hydrilla). This was accomplished using a combination of small-scale container bioassays and by examining establishment and impact at field locations. BACKGROUND: With the development of fluridone resistance in hydrilla in the United States (MacDonald et al. 2001, Michel et al. 2004, Poovey et al. 2005), questions have been raised concerning whether or not genetic changes in the plant would influence the application and impact of other management techniques used for its control. One management method that may be particularly sensitive to genetic changes is the use of introduced hydrilla <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>flies.</b> Fly feeding and development are directly linked to a variety of physiological plant properties including nutrition, gustatory chemicals, olfactory cues, etc. All of these properties may be influenced by genetic changes that {{led to the development of}} a fluridone-resistant biotype.

40|$|PURPOSE: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the suitability of using introduced hydrilla <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>flies</b> (Hydrellia pakistanae Deonier and H. balciunasi Bock) for the management of monoecious hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle). This was accomplished using a variety of procedures and experimental designs, including small container bioassays, development of a greenhouse-based fly colony reared exclusively on monoecious hydrilla, a larger tank study designed to evaluate short-term impact on both monoecious and dioecious hydrilla, use of small ponds to evaluate establishment in a more natural situation, evaluation of overwintering biology of the agents, and field releases to determine establishment success. BACKGROUND: Introduction of biological control agents is a critical component of aquatic plant management. Using host-specific agents complements the goal of targeting nuisance vegetation while minimally affecting native vegetation. Two species of introduced ephydrid <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>flies,</b> Hydrellia pakistanae Deonier and H. balciunasi Bock, have been shown to suppress dioecious hydrilla by reducing photosynthesis, thereby impacting biomass production, tuber formation...|$|R

Native species, including two stem-mining weevils, a stem-mining fly, a <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>fly,</b> a scale insect, two fungi, and aphids (taxonomic identification for all species is pending) were found attacking garlic mustard in North America.

40|$|Specialist <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>fly</b> Scaptomyza nigrita {{is a major}} {{herbivore}} of {{its host}} plant Cardamine cordifolia. Host plants are found along a gradient from sun-exposed bog to deep spruce shade habitat where herbivory decreases as shade increases. Prior studies have failed to {{support the hypothesis that}} plant quality determines plant distribution. A series of outdoor cage experiments utilizing a factorial design tested whether herbivore choice may instead drive plant distribution. It was found that adult female S. nigrita exhibited a significant preference for feeding and ovipositing on C. cordifolia leaves exposed to light, regardless of habitat origin of plant, leaf width, or presence of prior herbivore damage. This study does not support the phytocentric explanation that host plant distribution is determined by herbivore preference for plants based on their quality. My findings instead support the hypothesis that herbivores drive plant distributions into the shade by creating enemy-free space for host plants through their preference for light...|$|E
40|$|Several field surveys {{conducted}} during 2009 - 2014 with attention for leaf mines of Diptera revealed thirteen species of <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>flies</b> {{new to the}} Belgian fauna: Agromyza archangelicae Hering, 1937; Agromyza flavipennis (Hendel, 1920); Agromyza spiraeoidarum Hering, 1954; Agromyza vicifoliae Hering 1932; Aulagromyza similis (Brischke, 1880); Phytomyza aconiti Hendel, 1920; Phytomyza brunnipes Brischke, 1880; Phytomyza griffitsi Spencer, 1963; Phytomyza hellebori Kaltenbach, 1872; Phytomyza petoei Hering, 1924; Phytomyza thysselinivora Hering, 1924; Phytomyza podagrariae Hering, 1954 and Phytomyza tussilaginis (Hendel, 1925).

40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{structure of}} two host-parasitoid communities based on <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>flies</b> (Diptera, Agromyzidae) in Argentina is described. The two communities consisted of 29 and 27 hosts, 46 and 40 parasitoids, and 193 and 179 recorded host-parasitoid associations. Also, food webs were constructed for one community {{based solely on}} samples taken in the wet and dry seasons. Data were expressed as quantitative food webs, {{and the manner in}} which food web properties, such as connectance and compartmentalization, were influenced by sampling intensity was explored. The potential importance of indirect effects between hosts mediated by parasitoids (e. g. apparent competition) was assessed using quantitative parasitoid overlap diagrams. The study's results suggest that indirect effects are likely to be important in these highly connected communities. The limitations of the study's analysis, and how the conclusions can be tested experimentally, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A central but little-tested {{prediction}} of “escape and radiation” coevolution is that colonization of novel, chemically defended host plant clades accelerates insect herbivore diversification. That theory, in turn, exemplifies {{one side of}} a broader debate about the relative influence on clade dynamics of intrinsic (biotic) vs. extrinsic (physical-environmental) forces. Here, we use a fossil-calibrated molecular chronogram to compare the effects of a major biotic factor (repeated shift to a chemically divergent host plant clade) and a major abiotic factor (global climate change) on the macroevolutionary dynamics of a large Cenozoic radiation of phytophagous insects, the <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>fly</b> genus Phytomyza (Diptera: Agromyzidae). We find one of the first statistically supported examples of consistently elevated net diversification accompanying shift to new plant clades. In contrast, we detect no significant direct effect on diversification of major global climate events in the early and late Oligocene. The broader paleoclimatic context strongly suggests, however, that climate change has at times had a strong indirect influence through its effect on the biotic environment. Repeated rapid Miocene radiation of these flies on temperate herbaceous asterids closely corresponds to the dramatic, climate-driven expansion of seasonal, open habitats...|$|E
40|$|The {{life history}} and host {{range of the}} {{herringbone}} <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>fly</b> Ophiomyia camarae, a potential biological control agent for Lantana spp., were investigated. Eggs were deposited singly {{on the underside of}} leaves. Although several eggs can be laid on a single leaf and a maximum of three individual mines were seen on a single leaf, only one pupa per leaf ever developed. The generation time (egg to adult) was about 38 days. Females (mean 14 days) lived longer than males (mean 9 days) and produced about 61 mines. Oviposition and larval development occurred on all five lantana phenotypes tested. Eleven plant species representing six families were tested to determine the host range. Oviposition and larval development occurred on only lantana and another nonnative plant Lippia alba (Verbenaceae), with both species supporting populations over several generations. A CLIMEX model showed that most of the coastal areas of eastern Australia south to 30 ° 16 ' S (Coffs Harbour) would be suitable for O. camarae. O. camarae was approved for release in Australia in October 2007 and mines have been observed on plants at numerous field sites along the coast following releases...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This {{technical}} note describes {{development of a}} decision support tool that uses multi-attribute utility analysis to aid resource managers in selection of suitable sites for establishing native aquatic vegetation in large, multi-purpose reservoirs. BACKGROUND: There is increasing awareness that a diverse native aquatic plant community is a valuable, but often missing, component of aquatic habitat in reservoir ecosystems (Smart et al 1996). As a result, {{there is a need}} for technical information on methods for establishing native aquatic plants in reservoirs. Because the presence of a diverse native plant community has been shown to enhance weed management efforts, especially in the presence of capable herbivores, native vegetation establishment may also be an important consideration when designing weed biocontrol projects (Grodowitz et al. 2007; Smart et al. 1996). Such is the case for management of submersed aquatic plants; i. e., greatest hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata L. f. Royle) declines occur in the presence of both a diverse native plant assemblage and sustained herbivory by the hydrilla <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>fly</b> (Hydrellia pakistanae; Grodowitz et al. 2007). While progress has been made in developing techniques for native aquatic plant culturing/planting (Dick et al. 2005), only limited information is available describing methodologies for selection o...|$|E
40|$|Plant-feeding insects {{account for}} about one fourth of {{macroscopic}} biodiversity. This study aims to document factors contributing to this diversity by investigating phylogenetic relationships within a large radiation of herbivorous insects, Phytomyza <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>flies</b> (Diptera: Agromyzidae). 	After a brief introduction (Chapter 1), a general overview of phylogenetic patterns in phytophagous insects is presented, based on over 200 phytophagous insect phylogenies from the recent literature (Chapter 2). A few salient results include 1) host use conservatism at the family level predominates, with shifts occurring at about 5 % of speciation events; 2) host shifts are {{a major contributor to}} speciation, occuring in about half of 145 speciation events tabulated; 3) insect-host associations mostly reflect colonization of already diversified host plant clades; and 4) variation in diversification rates is not yet well-documented for phytophagous insects, except at the broadest scale. 	Chapter 3 is a phylogenetic study of the genus Phytomyza sensu lato, using over 3, 000 nucleotides of DNA sequence data from three genes. Results indicate that the genus Chromatomyia, considered by some as synonymous with Phytomyza, is in fact polyphyletic and nested within Phytomyza. Possible parallelism in a biological trait (internal pupation in leaf tissue) {{which is one of the}} defining traits of species in the former Chromatomyia is discussed. In addition, the internal classification of Phytomyza is assessed and revised insofar as the data permit. 	Divergence times for the Agromyzidae, and also for Phytomyza and related genera, were estimated using a molecular phylogeny calibrated by three agromyzid fossils (Chapter 4). Results suggest that the temperate Phytomyza group of genera originated in the relatively warm Eocene epoch. Ranunculaceae, a primitive plant family, is inferrred as the ancestral host for a clade including most Phytomyza species, but is probably secondary to feeding on more derived plant families ("asterid clade"). Ten clades were identified for comparison of diversification rates between Ranunculaceae- and asterid-feeding lineages, which showed that asterid-feeding clades exhibit higher rates of diversification. Phytomyza originated approximately at the early Oligocene global cooling event, but contrary to expectations, diversification significantly slowed during the Oligocene cool period, when suitable habitats for Phytomyza were presumably widespread...|$|R
40|$|Although {{relatively}} few insects {{have been reported}} to feed on submersed aquatic plants, field surveys on Hydrilla verticillata (L. F.) Royle for biological control agents have demonstrated that insect herbivores should be expected when surveying submersed aquatic plants in the native ranges. Beetles, or Coleoptera, especially the weevils (Curculionidae), are important herbivores. Weevils attack submersed plant species both when water is present and when water is absent during dry periods which leave the plants exposed. Pupal success appears to be the major determinant of weevil life cycle strategies. Donaciine leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) attack the roots or crowns of submersed species, but their feeding and damage is difficult to determine. <b>Leaf-mining</b> Hydrellia <b>flies</b> (Diptera: Ephydridae) are diverse and common on submersed species. Other flies, the midges (Chironomidae), are also common on submersed species, but many utilize the plants only for shelter. However, midge larvae ate the apical meristems on the tips of hydrilla stems. Aquatic caterpillars (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) are the herbivores most eas-ily observed on submersed species because of their large size and conspicuous damage, but their host ranges might be too broad for use as biological control agents. More research is needed on the field biologies of aquatic insect herbivores. Field surveys should be conducted on submersed aquatic weeds {{even in the absence of}} literature reports of insect herbivores. Until a reasonable database of herbivores and their host plants is assem-bled, it is difficult to evaluate the suitability of biological control for a submersed aquat-ic weed...|$|R
40|$|In 1997, nine insect {{species were}} prioritised for {{investigation}} in the South African programme against Chromolaena odorata, based on factors such as type and severity of damage caused, and ease of culturing. Host-specificity testing has been completed on the butterfly Actinote thalia pyrrha, and is almost complete on the stem-boring weevil, Lixus aemulus and <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>fly,</b> Calycomyza sp., the latter two with encouraging results. The host range of A. thalia thalia has also been investigated. Rearing techniques and biologies have been determined for the shoot-tip galling weevil Conotrachelus reticulatus and the root-mining flea beetle Longitarsus horni, and host-specificity testing of these species has been initiated. Following several failed attempts to breed the shoot-tip boring agromyzid Melanagromyza eupatoriella, C. reticulatus was substituted as it occupies a similar functional niche. Melanagromyza eupatoriella may be reconsidered in the future. Several other candidates {{that had not been}} prioritised were investigated on the merits of the damage observed in the field. The stem-galling fly Polymorphomyia basilica may be considered as a substitute for Cecidochares connexa, which seems incompatible with the South African biotype of C. odorata.

40|$|Recently diverged taxa often show {{discordance}} in genetic divergence among genomic loci, {{where some}} loci show strong divergence and others show none at all. Genetic studies alone cannot distinguish among the possible mechanisms but experimental studies on {{other aspects of}} divergence may provide guidance in the inference of causes of observed discordances. In this study, we used no-choice mating trials to test {{for the presence of}} reproductive isolation between host races of the <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>fly,</b> Phytomyza glabricola on its two holly host species, Ilex coriacea and I. glabra. These trials inform our effort to determine the cause of significant differences in the degree of divergence of nuclear and mitochondrial loci of flies collected from the two host plants. We present evidence of reproductive isolation between host races in a controlled greenhouse setting: significantly more mate pairs consisting of flies from the same host plant species produced offspring than inter-host mate pairs, which produced no offspring. We also tested whether the presence of the natal or non-natal host plant affects reproductive success. Flies collected from I. coriacea were more likely to produce offspring when {{in the presence of the}} natal host, whereas the presence or absence of either the natal or non-natal host had no effect on flies collected from I. glabra.

40|$|Phytomyza glabricola (Diptera: Agromyzidae) is a <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>fly</b> {{native to}} the eastern United States that mines two {{sympatric}} native holly species, Ilex coriacea and I. glabra. Recent work revealed significant genetic divergence between host-associated populations of flies in North and South Carolina, suggesting the populations are host forms and recent work in Ilex phylogenetics hint the two holly hosts may hybridize. In this work, I investigated potential ecological speciation in P. glabricola, hybridization in its host plants, and how the hybridization among host plants may affect gene flow between host forms of the flies. No-choice mating trials in a greenhouse revealed reproductive isolation between host forms of P. glabricola and suggested female flies are capable of making oviposition mistakes resulting in adult offspring on the non-natal host. Based on these results, I used sequences of the nuclear gene EF- 1 α and AFLPs to genetically confirm host form status of the flies, and identify I. glabra as the ancestral host. In addition, genome scans revealed several loci under divergent selection among the hosts, suggesting the flies may be undergoing ecological speciation. To investigate the role host plants may play in the genetic divergence among flies, I first used AFLPs to confirm hybridization between I. coriacea and I. glabra. Hybridization rates differed across the geographic range of the species, which was also reflected in the morphology of the leaves. There were no general patterns, however, in the phenotypes of hybrid plants, and no single morphological trait that could reliably identify the hybrids. Finally, I combined genetic data of the flies and the plants to determine whether hybrid plants serve as bridges or barriers for the flies. Population comparisons revealed a significant positive relationship between hybridization in the plants and gene flow in the flies, and individual comparisons indicated flies are using the hybrid plants, albeit at low levels. The results suggest hybrids could serve as bridges between parental species, helping explain how a species from a typically monophagous lineage could expand its host range...|$|E
40|$|Tecoma stans (L.) Juss. Ex Kunth (Bignoniaceae) {{also known}} as yellow bells, has a native {{distribution}} from Northern Argentina, central America, Mexico and the Southern USA. In many warm climatic regions of the world, T. stans is commonly planted as an ornamental plant because of its yellow flowers, hence the name yellow bells, and pinnate foliage. As a result, this evergreen shrub has wide distribution in the tropical and subtropical parts of the western hemisphere. As {{is the case in}} many other parts of the world, T. stans was introduced into South Africa as an ornamental plant, but escaped cultivation and now invades roadsides, urban open spaces, watercourses, rocky sites in subtropical and tropical areas of five South African provinces; Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and neighboring countries. Tecoma stans has the potential of extending its range because its seeds are easily dispersed by wind. The purpose of this work was to carry out pre-release efficacy studies to determine the host specificity and suitability of Pseudonapomyza sp. (Diptera: Agromyzidae), a <b>leaf-mining</b> <b>fly,</b> as a biological control agent of T. stans. Available information suggests that the fly was brought to South Africa (SA) from Argentina in 2005. In that year a worker collected adult root feeding fleabeetles from T. stans and their eggs by collecting soil around the plants in the Argentinian Province of Jujuy, at San Pedro (24 ° 12 ’ 592 ”S, 64 ° 51 ’ 328 ”W). The soil was brought to the SA quarantine laboratory of the Agricultural Research Council, Plant Protection Research Institute (Weeds Division), Pretoria, and placed in a cage containing T. stans plants for flea-beetle larvae to emerge from the eggs. The Pseudonapomyza sp. flies which emerged from that soil were reared to produce a colony of flies used in the study reported here. The feeding behavior of Pseudonapomyza sp. adults is initiated by females which use their ovipositor to puncture holes in the leaf mesophyll and then they feed on the sap oozing from the holes. Since males have no means of puncturing the leaves, they feed from holes made by females. Eggs are laid singly into the tubular leaf punctures. Soon after hatching, the larva feeds on the leaf mesophyll tissue. As the larva feeds within the leaf it creates mines which eventually coalesce to form large blotches. The damaged leaf area reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant especially when damaged leaves dry and fall off the plants. The potential of Pseudonapomyza sp. as a biocontrol agent is enhanced {{by the fact that it}} has a high level of fecundity and a short life cycle. As a result, its populations can build up rapidly to exert a significant impact on T. stans. Host-specificity tests undertaken on 35 plant species in 12 plant families showed that out of the 35 plant species tested, the fly was able to develop on T. stans only. Although Pseudonapomyza sp. adults fed on T. capensis, a South African indigenous ornamental shrub, no larval mines were observed on this plant. This suggests two possibilities; either females of Pseudonapomyza sp. do not oviposit on T. capensis or oviposition takes place but larvae cannot feed and develop on this plant. These studies indicate that this fly is sufficiently host-specific, and can be released against T. stans without posing any threat to either commercial or indigenous plant species grown in South Africa. Experimental designs simulating high populations of Pseudonapomyza sp. showed that the impact of leaf mining fly on T. stans can cause approximately 56 percent aboveground biomass reduction. Other concurrent studies have also showed that low and high density fly infestations can cause 23 percent and 48 percent belowground biomass reductions, respectively. Based on the available information, it appears that Pseudonapomyza sp. may have the potential to reduce the invasive capacity of T. stans in the affected areas. In order to exert more herbivore pressure on T. stans, it is suggested that agents belonging to other feeding guilds, such as root-, stem- and seed-feeding insects, be considered for release to complement the leaf-feeding of Pseudonapomyza sp. An application to release this fly in SA has been submitted to one of the two regulatory authorities...|$|E
