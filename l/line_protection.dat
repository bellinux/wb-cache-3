5|$|The San Diego Chargers got 16 first downs, {{compared}} to 5 for the Buccaneers. Chargers {{players and coaches}} praised the Buccaneers’ defense, who held them to 9 points until the final three minutes of the game, saying that they played the equivalent of five quarters. Three Tampa Bay quarterbacks completed a combined 3 of 8 passes for −4 yards. Buccaneers receiver Bob Moore said, “We’re at rock bottom now...but if we start pointing a finger, we’ll go 0–14”. The Chargers finished with 325 yards of offense to the Buccaneers’ 125. Inconsistent blocking was blamed for the offensive problems, a situation that was not helped by the injury to tackle Dave Reavis. Mercury Morris, who had been picked up on waivers by the Chargers from the Miami Dolphins after the Buccaneers’ preseason game against the Dolphins, commented that the difference in Buccaneers’ offensive <b>line</b> <b>protection</b> between the two games was like watching two different teams. The Buccaneers’ lack of speed was also noticeable.

500|$|Although he {{was criticized}} for his autocratic {{coaching}} style and strained relationships, Brown {{played a significant role}} in the evolution and modernization of football. The draw play he invented – a formation in which the quarterback drops back to pass but then hands off the ball to a running back – is still in wide use. In his autobiography, Brown said the play came about by accident in 1946 when Graham botched a play and improvised by making a late handoff to Marion Motley, who ran past the onrushing defenders for a large gain. He developed detailed pass patterns that were designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the defense.

2500|$|Along {{with other}} {{graduates}} of the school, Zinoviev {{was sent to the}} front in the Winter War. He became a company commander in the 4th NKVD Border Troops Regiment. The company under his command was tasked with supply <b>line</b> <b>protection</b> in the village of Uoma. From 15 December 1939, the border troops conducted continuous fighting with Finnish partisans and repulsed several attempts to destroy the outpost. On 10 January 1940, Zinoviev's company was surrounded by two Finnish battalions. Although wounded, he continued to lead the defence. For about a month, the company repulsed fierce Finnish attacks. By this time, only 32 out of 132 Border Troops were still in fighting condition, as the rest were either dead, seriously injured or frostbitten. Zinoviev himself had been wounded twice. On the night of 11–12 February, he led a counterattack that broke through the encirclement and extricated the company. On 26 April, Zinoviev was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin for his reported [...] "courage and heroism".|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent cascade {{tripping}} in case of distance protection directionality loss in an application with capacitors series-compensation, the substitution of the distance <b>protections</b> by differential <b>line</b> <b>protections</b> was carried out. The present paper describes the process of studies that led to deciding the above mentioned change and the tests carried out for qualification of the new selected protections. Due to demand growth, capacitive compensation was increased in 10 % during 2005 in the Argentine System {{in order to increase}} transmission capacity. This was implemented in two substations of the corridor that have series-compensation. Prior to implementation, it was deemed necessary to study the behaviour of the protections of the corridor in the new projected scenario. The corridor was simulated in a digital TNA and all <b>line</b> <b>protections</b> were tested. Special attention was paid to the observation of relay directionality measurements in case of external faults. Results showed a case of a distance protection overoperation for a fault in a parallel line. In particular cases, the current analytical tools to estimate protections behaviour are not enough and {{there is a need to}} study the internal performance of the protection in the presence of certain faults. In order to determine exactly the cause of a wrong operation or the protections operational limits for a certain application, it was decided to implement a protection algorithm that would be as close a...|$|R

Adding a left-handed backup in Wilhelm allowed the Bengals not only additional depth, but the luxury of leaving offensive <b>line</b> <b>protections</b> unchanged should Wilhelm enter the game, with the right tackle rather than the left tackle being responsible for the critical task of blindside protection on passing plays. Initially wearing the number 12, Wilhelm saw limited action backing up Esiason in 6 games during his 1989 rookie season, completing 30 of his 56 passes for 4 touchdowns, {{at a cost of}} 2 interceptions.|$|R

50|$|The {{plan was}} that the wire tail would be dragged for about 30 mi across the {{countryside}} and eventually encounter a high-voltage transmission line. A phase-to-phase short circuit would be initiated; during trials, arcs 15 ft long were initiated by the wire. The arc would burn for some time before the transmission <b>line</b> <b>protection</b> operated; {{there was a good}} chance the circuit breaker itself would be damaged and the conductors might burn through due to arcing. This could cause a line to collapse and require repairs. German efforts to protect transmission lines from attack were unsuccessful: neither a new type of line conductor clamp nor different overcurrent protection settings had any useful effect.|$|E
50|$|To use the {{scrimmage}} kick formation exemption, {{the player}} who receives the snap (presumably the kicker or placeholder) must stand at least seven yards behind the line of scrimmage. The A-11 places the quarterback in that position, which becomes a deep shotgun formation. This {{has the effect of}} reducing the need for offensive <b>line</b> <b>protection</b> since defensive players have more ground to cover before reaching the passer. The offense also places an additional passing back (similar to the wildcat offense) in the backfield next to the quarterback, creating the potential for either back to receive the snap, pitch to the other back, run or pass the ball, block, or go out for a pass.|$|E
