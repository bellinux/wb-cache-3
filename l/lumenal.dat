In Arabidopsis, out of the predicted <b>lumenal</b> proteins possessing the Tat signal, the largest groups with known functions are 19% involved in protein processing (proteolysis and folding), 18% in photosynthesis, 11% in metabolism, and 7% redox carriers and defense.|$|E
25|$|The lumen of the thylakoids is {{also the}} site of water {{oxidation}} by the oxygen evolving complex associated with the <b>lumenal</b> side of photosystem II.|$|E
25|$|According {{to these}} studies, the {{thylakoid}} proteome consists {{of at least}} 335 different proteins. Out of these, 89 are in the lumen, 116 are integral membrane proteins, 62 are peripheral proteins on the stroma side, and 68 peripheral proteins on the <b>lumenal</b> side. Additional low-abundance <b>lumenal</b> proteins can be predicted through computational methods. Of the thylakoid proteins with known functions, 42% are involved in photosynthesis. The next largest functional groups include proteins involved in protein targeting, processing and folding with 11%, oxidative stress response (9%) and translation (8%).|$|E
25|$|Water {{oxidation}} is catalyzed by a manganese-containing enzyme complex {{known as}} the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) or water-splitting complex found associated with the <b>lumenal</b> side of thylakoid membranes. Manganese is an important cofactor, and calcium and chloride are also required for the reaction to occur.|$|E
25|$|Thylakoids contain many {{integral}} and peripheral membrane proteins, {{as well as}} <b>lumenal</b> proteins. Recent proteomics {{studies of}} thylakoid fractions have provided further details on the protein composition of the thylakoids. These data have been summarized in several plastid protein databases that are available online.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} proportion of artery flow-disrupting events occur at locations with less than 50% <b>lumenal</b> narrowing. Cardiac stress testing, traditionally the most commonly performed noninvasive testing method for blood flow limitations, generally only detects lumen narrowing of ~75% or greater, although some physicians advocate nuclear stress methods that can sometimes detect as little as 50%.|$|E
25|$|Thylakoids can be {{purified}} from plant cells using {{a combination}} of differential and gradient centrifugation. Disruption of isolated thylakoids, for example by mechanical shearing, releases the <b>lumenal</b> fraction. Peripheral and integral membrane fractions can be extracted from the remaining membrane fraction. Treatment with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) detaches peripheral membrane proteins, whereas treatment with detergents and organic solvents solubilizes integral membrane proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in {{photosynthesis}} is the light-driven reduction (splitting) of water to provide the electrons for the photosynthetic electron transport chains as well as protons {{for the establishment of}} a proton gradient. The water-splitting reaction occurs on the <b>lumenal</b> side of the thylakoid membrane and is driven by the light energy captured by the photosystems. It is interesting to note that this oxidation of water conveniently produces the waste product O2 that is vital for cellular respiration. The molecular oxygen formed by the reaction is released into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Liver cells {{express the}} transmembrane enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase in the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum. The catalytic site is {{found on the}} <b>lumenal</b> face of the membrane, and removes the phosphate group from glucose-6-phosphate produced during glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. Free glucose is transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum via GLUT7 and released into the bloodstream via GLUT2 for uptake by other cells. Muscle cells lack this enzyme, so myofibers use glucose-6-phosphate in their own metabolic pathways such as glycolysis. Importantly, this prevents myocytes from releasing glycogen stores they have obtained into the blood.|$|E
25|$|Thylakoid {{proteins}} {{are targeted}} to their destination via signal peptides and prokaryotic-type secretory pathways inside the chloroplast. Most thylakoid proteins encoded by a plant's nuclear genome need two targeting signals for proper localization: An N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide (shown in yellow in the figure), {{followed by a}} thylakoid targeting peptide (shown in blue). Proteins are imported through the translocon of outer and inner membrane (Toc and Tic) complexes. After entering the chloroplast, the first targeting peptide is cleaved off by a protease processing imported proteins. This unmasks the second targeting signal and the protein is exported from the stroma into the thylakoid in a second targeting step. This second step requires the action of protein translocation components of the thylakoids and is energy-dependent. Proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP-dependent pathway (1), the Tat-dependent pathway (2), or spontaneously via their transmembrane domains (not shown in figure). <b>Lumenal</b> proteins are exported across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen by either the Tat-dependent pathway (2) or the Sec-dependent pathway (3) and released by cleavage from the thylakoid targeting signal. The different pathways utilize different signals and energy sources. The Sec (secretory) pathway requires ATP as energy source and consists of SecA, which binds to the imported protein and a Sec membrane complex to shuttle the protein across. Proteins with a twin arginine motif in their thylakoid signal peptide are shuttled through the Tat (twin arginine translocation) pathway, which requires a membrane-bound Tat complex and the pH gradient as an energy source. Some other proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP (signal recognition particle) pathway. The chloroplast SRP can interact with its target proteins either post-translationally or co-translationally, thus transporting imported proteins {{as well as those}} that are translated inside the chloroplast. The SRP pathway requires GTP and the pH gradient as energy sources. Some transmembrane proteins may also spontaneously insert into the membrane from the stromal side without energy requirement.|$|E
50|$|The {{contractile}} {{function of}} vascular smooth muscle regulates the <b>lumenal</b> {{diameter of the}} small arteries-arterioles called resistance vessels, thereby contributing significantly to setting the level of blood pressure and blood flow to vascular beds. Smooth muscle contracts slowly and may maintain the contraction (tonically) for prolonged periods in blood vessels, bronchioles, and some sphincters. Activating arteriole smooth muscle can decrease the <b>lumenal</b> diameter 1/3 of resting so it drastically alters blood flow and resistance. Activation of aortic smooth muscle doesn't significantly alter the <b>lumenal</b> diameter but serves to increase the viscoelasticity of the vascular wall.|$|E
