40|$|<b>Late-spawning</b> Fraser River sockeye salmon, O. nerka, {{stocks have}} {{suffered}} significant pre-spawn mortality {{associated with an}} unusually early freshwater migration pattern and the myxosporean parasite, P. minibicornis. Surveys of migrating adult salmon from several spawning populations were conducted in 1999 and 2000 {{to determine the extent}} of infection with P. minibicornis, when and where the parasite first became detectable during migration, and whether early migrating stocks might be used as sentinels to assess risk of infection in <b>late-spawning</b> stocks. Posterior kidney, preserved in 95 % ethanol, was examined for P. minibicornis in stained histological sections and using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The prevalence of this parasite in all Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks examined was high (range 47 - 100 % infected). In contrast, P. minibicornis was not detected in the fish tested from the 2 sockeye salmon stocks outside the Fraser River drainage in either 1999 or 2000. The parasite was also not detected histologically or by PCR in the kidney tissue of the fish from the Fraser River that were sampled in salt water or early during their freshwater migration up the river. These findings and the progression in the prevalence and intensity of infection as the fish from 3 stocks (early Stuart, Weaver Creek and Cultus Lake) were monitored over time, suggest that the salmon acquired the parasite either in the lower Strait of Georgia or in the lower Fraser River before the confluence of the Harrison River. In both 1999 and 2000, the parasite was present in all Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks sampled, which suggests that early Stuart salmon may be valuable as a sentinel stock for the presence of the parasite in later-spawning stocks...|$|E
40|$|We {{used the}} {{variation}} at 64 allozyme loci to examine genetic relationships among 32 samples of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka and kokanee (resident sockeye salmon) from the Snake River basin and other North American locations. The genetic differentiation among populations was pronounced: Wright’s FST was higher (0. 244) {{than has been}} reported in any other study of Pacific salmon. A detailed examination of the O. nerka from lakes in the Sawtooth Valley of Idaho was undertaken to help guide recovery planning for the endangered Redfish Lake population and to help resolve the relationships between the resident and anadromous forms. In Redfish Lake, adult sockeye salmon that returned in 1991 – 1993 were genetically distinct from local kokanee but similar to a small group of “residual” sockeye salmon discovered in the lake in 1992. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the original sockeye salmon population was not extirpated by Sunbeam Dam early in this century. Populations of O. nerka that appear to be native to the Snake River were also found in Alturas Lake, Stanley Lake, and Warm Lake, although the latter two lakes also showed evidence of nonnative gene pools. Kokanee sampled from Pettit Lake are clearly the result of an introduction of <b>late-spawning</b> kokanee from northern Idaho, and we found evidence of two O. nerka gene pools in Wallowa Lake, both traceable to introductions of nonnative kokanee...|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} distribution of young of year searobin (Prionotus) was delineated in the Hudson River from museum specimens. All young searobins in the Hudson River were Prionotus evolans (L.). The smallest young striped searobin {{are found in the}} southern estuary in July and they move farther upriver as they grow. Most individuals leave the estuary in the autumn, but some <b>late-spawned</b> individuals probably remain in the estuary through the winter and into late spring...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —To test {{potential}} competitive {{interactions between}} larvae of white crappie Pomoxis annularis and of gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum. we added adult gizzard shad to eight of twelve 0. 1 -ha ponds {{that had been}} stocked with adult white crappies. Larval white crappies and larval gizzard shad appeared within 1 week of one another and larval white crappie density did not differ between treatments. Zooplankton density declined similarly between treatments, and zooplankton species composition and size did not differ. Although larval white crappie and larval gizzard shad had moderate diet overlap, prey selection by white crappie did not differ between treatments. During April, more than 70 % of larval gizzard shad had empty stomachs, compared with less than 20 % of larval white crappies. Age- 0 gizzard shad recovery was extremely low (< 10 kg/ha) in five of eight ponds. Daily ring counts from otoliths indicated that <b>late-spawned</b> gizzar...|$|R
40|$|Hypotheses: Recently {{established}} populations, sharing common ancestry but facing different reproductive habitat seasonality, will genetically diverge in {{the timing}} of their reproductive migrations. Organism: Exotic populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) established from common ancestors introduced to South Island of New Zealand between 1901 and 1907. Site of experiments: Early rearing at Silverstream Hatchery, Waimakariri River, New Zealand, followed by release to sea, growth in coastal ocean, and return to freshwater. Methods: We reared early- and <b>late-spawned</b> juveniles from two populations that differ in spawning time in the wild, and released those fish to mature at sea. We obtained dates of migratory return to freshwater, fish age, and experimental group identity from angler captures at river mouths. Analyses involved assessment of population, spawning date, and age at return effects for the current experiment, plus an expanded analysis of data from previous release experiments. Results: After ∼ 26 generations, the population that reproduces later in the wild now returns to freshwater an average of 18 days later than the early spawning population. This divergence is likely genetic, given the common-garden nature of our experimental design, and was apparent even after accounting for significant effects of age at return and marginal effects of initial spawning date...|$|R
40|$|For {{many species}} of fish, size-specific overwinter {{mortality}} {{is an important factor}} structuring year-class strength. Protracted spawning by bluegill Lepomis macrochirus leads to extreme variation in individual size going into winter that could result in strong, size-specific overwinter mortality, particularly in locations with limited food resources or long, cold winters. We performed laboratory trials to test the effects of winter temperature (4 ◦C or 9 ◦C) and food availability (food present or no food) on the survival of two size-classes (20 – 30 or 50 – 60 mm total length) of young-of-year bluegills. Mortality was strongly size selective and appeared to be related to relative condition, suggesting that energy limitation was the primary mechanism of mortality. Fish of both sizes were less active at colder temperatures, leading to increased survival (presumably via reduced energy expenditure). Bluegills fed heavily in food treatments (wet weight/d consumed was typically 2 – 4 % for both large and small fish in the warm treatment, 1 – 2. 5 % for small fish in the cold treatment, and 0. 4 – 0. 8 % for large fish in the cold treatment) and experienced increased survival. However, small fish in all treatments had more than 55 % mortality after 150 d, indicating that some of the mortality was not due to starvation. It appears that <b>late-spawned,</b> small fish are unlikely to survive lengthy periods of winter conditions and will therefore be selected against at northern latitudes. Mechanisms other than overwinter mortality that lead to increased lifetime reproductive success may explain the persistence of late-summer or fall spawning a...|$|R
40|$|Age, size, abundance, and birthdate {{distributions}} {{were compared}} for larval Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) collected weekly during their estuarine recruitment seasons in 1989 – 90, 1990 – 91, and 1992 – 93 in lower estuaries near Beaufort, North Carolina, and Tuckerton, New Jersey, {{to determine the}} source of these larvae. Larval recruitment in New Jersey extended for 9 months beginning in October but was discontinuous and was punctuated by periods of no catch that were associated with low water temperatures. In North Carolina, recruitment was continuous for 5 – 6 months beginning in November. Total yearly larval density in North Carolina was higher (15 – 39 ×) than in New Jersey {{for each of the}} 3 years. Larvae collected in North Carolina generally grew faster than larvae collected in New Jersey and were, on average, older and larger. Birthdate distributions (back-calculated from sagittal otolith ages) overlapped between sites and included many larvae that were spawned in winter. Early spawned (through October) larvae caught in the New Jersey estuary were probably spawned off New Jersey. Larvae spawned later (November–April) and collected in the same estuary were probably from south of Cape Hatteras because only there are winter water temperatures warm enough (≥ 16 °C) to allow spawning and larval development. The percentage contribution of these <b>late-spawned</b> larvae from south of Cape Hatteras were an important, but variable fraction (10 % in 1992 – 93 to 87 % in 1989 – 90) {{of the total number of}} larvae recruited to this New Jersey estuary. Thus, this study provides evidence that some B. tyrannus spawned south of Cape Hatteras may reach New Jersey estuarine nurseries...|$|R
