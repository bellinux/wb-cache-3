5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. While logging {{events is}} {{becoming}} increasingly common in computing, in communication and in collaborative environments, <b>log</b> <b>systems</b> need to satisfy increasingly challenging (if not conflicting) requirements. In this {{paper we propose a}} high-level framework for modeling <b>log</b> <b>systems,</b> and reasoning about them. This framework allows one to give a high-level representation of a <b>log</b> <b>system</b> and to check whether it satisfies given audit and privacy properties which in turn can be expressed in standard logic. In particular, the framework can be used for comparing and assessing <b>log</b> <b>systems.</b> We validate our proposal by formalizing a number of standard log properties and by using it to review a number of existing systems. Despite the growing pervasiveness of <b>log</b> <b>systems,</b> we believe this is the first framework of this sort. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>System</b> <b>logs</b> {{constitute}} {{valuable information}} for analysis and diagnosis of system behavior. The size of parallel computing {{systems and the}} number of their components steadily increase. The volume of generated <b>logs</b> by the <b>system</b> is in proportion to this increase. Hence, long-term collection and storage of <b>system</b> <b>logs</b> is challenging. The analysis of <b>system</b> <b>logs</b> requires advanced text processing techniques. For very large volumes of logs, the analysis is highly time-consuming and requires a high level of expertise. For many parallel computing centers, outsourcing the analysis of <b>system</b> <b>logs</b> to third parties is the only affordable option. The existence of sensitive data within <b>system</b> <b>log</b> entries obstructs, however, the transmission of <b>system</b> <b>logs</b> to third parties. Moreover, the analytical tools for processing <b>system</b> <b>logs</b> and the solutions provided by such tools are highly system specific. Achieving a more general solution is only possible through the access and analysis <b>system</b> of <b>logs</b> of multiple computing systems. The privacy concerns impede, however, the sharing of <b>system</b> <b>logs</b> across institutions {{as well as in the}} public domain. This work proposes a new method for the anonymization of the information within <b>system</b> <b>logs</b> that employs de-identification and encoding to provide sharable <b>system</b> <b>logs,</b> with the highest possible data quality and of reduced size. The results presented in this work indicate that apart from eliminating the sensitive data within <b>system</b> <b>logs</b> and converting them into shareable data, the proposed anonymization method provides 25 % performance improvement in post-processing of the anonymized <b>system</b> <b>logs,</b> and more than 50 % reduction in their required storage space.
