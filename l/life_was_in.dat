5|$|Born in Brussels on 15 September 1505, between ten {{and eleven}} in the morning, Archduchess Mary of Austria {{was the fifth}} child of King Philip I and Queen Joanna of Castile. Her birth was very difficult; the Queen's <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger and {{it took her a}} month to recover. On 20 September, she was baptized by Nicolas Le Ruistre, Bishop of Arras, and named after her {{paternal}} grandmother, Mary of Burgundy, who had died in 1482. Her godfather was her paternal grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.|$|E
5|$|Having {{managed to}} quietly depose their father, the {{brothers}} {{now had to}} deal with Constantine VII. Unfortunately for them, rumours soon spread around Constantinople, to the effect that, following Romanos's deposition, Constantine VII's <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger. Before long, crowds gathered before the palace, demanding to see their emperor in person. The contemporary Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona notes that the ambassadors and envoys from Amalfi, Gaeta, Rome, and Provence present in the capital also supported Constantine VII. Stephen and his brother had to succumb to the inevitable, recognizing their brother-in-law as the senior emperor.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 1865, Davis {{was imprisoned}} in a casemate at Fortress Monroe {{on the coast}} of Virginia. Irons were riveted to his ankles at the order of General Nelson Miles {{who was in charge of}} the fort. Davis was allowed no visitors, and no books except the Bible. He became sicker, and the {{attending}} physician warned that his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger, but this treatment continued for some months until late autumn when he was finally given better quarters. General Miles was transferred in mid-1866, and Davis's treatment continued to improve.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 26 September 1981, Bill Shankly was {{admitted}} to Broadgreen Hospital following a heart attack. His condition appeared to be stable {{and there was no}} suggestion that his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger. But, on the following Monday morning, his condition suddenly deteriorated and was transferred into intensive care. At 00:30 on 29 September, he suffered another cardiac arrest and was certified dead, aged 68, at 01:20. He was cremated at the Anfield Crematorium on 2 October and his ashes were scattered on the Anfield pitch at the Kop end.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus {{realised}} {{that his}} <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger but struggled to decide upon {{a course of}} action and remained at Antioch. He sent a force of cavalry commanded by Ulpinus Julianus to regain control of the rebels, but they failed and Ulpinus died in the attempt. This failure further strengthened Elagabalus' army. Soon after, a force under Elagabalus' tutor Gannys marched on Antioch and engaged Macrinus' army on 8 June 218 near the village of Immae, located approximately 24 miles from Antioch. At some point during the ensuing Battle of Antioch, Macrinus deserted the field and returned to Antioch. Macrinus was then forced to flee from Antioch as fighting erupted in the city as well. Elegabalus himself subsequently entered Antioch as the new ruler of the Roman Empire. Macrinus fled for Rome; he traveled as far as Chalcedon before being recognized and captured. His son and co-emperor Diadumenianus, sent to the care of Artbanus V of Parthia, was himself captured in transit at Zeugma and killed in June of 218. Diadumenianus' reign lasted a total of 14 months, and he was about 10 years old when he died. Macrinus, upon learning of his son's death, tried to escape captivity, but he injured himself in the unsuccessful attempt and was afterward executed in Cappadocia; his head was sent to Elegabalus. Much like Macrinus, Diadumenianus' head was also cut off and sent to Elegabalus as a trophy.|$|E

He had been concerned about this threat when he read the script. Connery insisted that Ken Adam build a special Plexiglas partition inside the pool, {{but this was not}} a fixed structure, and one of the sharks managed to pass through it. He had to abandon the pool immediately.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1960s Holdridge had become estranged from {{his second wife}} and their daughter. Holdridge was not invited to the latter's wedding to Woolworth heir Lance Reventlow in November 1964, and shortly thereafter, moved to Toledo, Ohio. His {{principal}} occupation during {{the last years of}} his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> attempting to keep alive his Hopi government project, which was rendered futile by his inability to attract either funding or supporters. Holdridge died at the Veteran's Administration Hospital in Brecksville, Ohio, on September 29, 1974.|$|E
25|$|The major {{difference}} between novel and real <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the chronology of Cameron's relation with his protégé Howard Roark, the novel's hero, who eventually goes on to redeem his vision. That Roark's uncompromising individualism and his innovative organic style in architecture were drawn from the life and work of Frank Lloyd Wright is clear from Rand's journal notes, her correspondence and various contemporary accounts. In the novel, however, the 23-year-old Roark, a generation younger than the real-life Wright, becomes Cameron's protégé in the early 1920s, when Sullivan was long in decline.|$|E

25|$|The {{conflict}} between Chulalongkorn and Wichaichan over these reforms erupted in open confrontation, after Wichaichan received an anonymous letter threatening his life. On the 28 December 1874 a fire {{erupted in the}} Grand Palace, Wichaichan's reluctance to help quell the flames gave Chulalongkorn the excuse he needed to lay siege to the Front Palace. As a result, {{on the night of}} 2 January 1875, Wichaichan fled to the British Consulate to the south of Bangkok to seek refuge from the King. Negotiations between the two cousins began, however no clear conclusions were reached, with Wichaichan under the impression that his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger, he refused all reconciliation.|$|E
25|$|When {{there was}} not enough money to buy food for the yeshiva students, Rabbi Wasserman {{traveled}} to America {{to raise money for the}} yeshiva. Rabbi Wasserman made an impression on many young Jews that he met while in the United States. Rabbi Wasserman returned to Poland although he knew his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger by returning. This was partly because he did not want to abandon his students, and partly because he took a dim view of American Jewry. In 1939, just before the Nazi invasion, he even forbade his students from accepting visas to the United States to study at Yeshiva University and what is now the Hebrew Theological College due to what he perceived as a spiritually dangerous atmosphere in these two institutions.|$|E
25|$|Kuvempu {{was more}} than a writer for his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> itself a 'great message'. He was against casteism, {{meaningless}} practices and religious ritual. Kuvempu's writings reflect his resentment against these practices. The Shoodra Tapaswi ("untouchable saint") was one such writing. Kuvempu who was from the Vokkaliga community gave a perspective to the ancient epic Ramayana that was quite unlike the portrayal of the characters by the original author Valmiki. Kuvempu's version of the epic called Sri Ramayana Darshanam won him the prestigious Jnanpith Award. His epic underscores his vision of Sarvodaya ("upliftment of all"). The protogonist of his epic, the Hindu god Rama, personifies this when he tests himself along with his consort Sita by jumping into the fire.|$|E

25|$|After the Union of Lublin (1569) {{that created}} the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the city flourished further {{in part due to}} the {{establishment}} of Vilnius University by Stephen Báthory, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1579. The university soon developed {{into one of the most}} important scientific and cultural centers of the region and the most notable scientific center of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Political, economic and social <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> full swing there. This is among all proven by the Lithuanian Statutes issued in the 16th century, the last of which was still in force until the 19th century. In 1610 the city was racked by a large fire. In 1769 the Rasos Cemetery was founded; today it is one of the oldest surviving cemeteries in the city.|$|E

He had been infected by an alien virus (for the second time), but Scully {{found a way to}} rescue him. After Mulder returned home to his apartment, an application was submitted to the FBI for his reinstatement to the X-Files but this was declined by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh, who had been promoted in charge of the X-Files shortly after Mulder had been abducted. He returned to work for a brief period of time, but was eventually fired for failure to follow orders not to investigate any X-Files. After Scully gave birth to William, Mulder went into hiding in New Mexico after Kersh said his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger.|$|E
25|$|After {{having been}} deposed by Leontius, Justinian escaped to the Khagan of the Khazars who welcomed him and even gave his sister {{as a wife}} to him. Renaming his wife Theodora he settled at Phanagoria at the {{entrance}} to the Sea of Azov where they could keep an eye on Imperial events. Justinian was forced to act when in 704 word reached that he was wanted dead or alive for a handsome reward. Such rumors were confirmed when a band of soldiers arrived at his location. Realizing that his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger, he invited two of the officers (whom he suspected as the assassins) to his house and murdered them. Leaving his wife in the safety of her brother, he fled to Bulgaria, Byzantium's chief opponent in the West. There he secured a pact with the Bulgar King Tervel granting him the title of Caesar if he aided him in regaining the throne of Byzantium.|$|E
