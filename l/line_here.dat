5|$|NY220 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY41 {{north of the}} hamlet of Smithville Flats in the Chenango County town of Smithville. It heads to the northeast, paralleling a small creek as it progresses through the rural town consisting mostly of cultivated fields. NY220 passes into the town of McDonough and enters a hamlet bearing the same name, where it turns eastward. The route winds {{its way through the}} eastern, forested portion of the town to the small community of East McDonough, located near the McDonough–Preston town <b>line.</b> <b>Here,</b> NY220 turns southeast and continues into Preston.|$|E
5|$|The 26th Infantry Division {{remained}} {{in a relatively}} quiet region of the lines along the Chemin des Dames for several months before it relieved the 1st Division near St. Mihiel on 3 April. The <b>line</b> <b>here</b> taken over extended from the vicinity of Apremont, on the west, in front of Xivray-Marvoisin, Seicheprey, and Bois de Remieres, {{as far as the}} Bois de Jury, on the right, where the French line joined the American line. Division Headquarters were at Boucq.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{branches}} off westbound {{from the}} North Wales Coast Line at Gaerwen, and turns north-east to descend into Malltraeth Marsh (Welsh: Cors Ddyga), passing below Thomas Telford's A5 and the A55 just before Holland Arms station at Pentre Berw. The Red Wharf Bay branch (now removed) left the <b>line</b> <b>here,</b> as the Amlwch line continues north-west, crossing the River Cefni and approaching Llangefni.|$|E

5|$|When {{the brigade}} left the 1st Airborne Task Force, the 1st Special Service Force {{replaced}} them. The task force advanced eastwards {{and reached the}} Franco-Italian border in the Menton area and the French Alps along part of what was the Maginot <b>line.</b> <b>Here</b> they halted in a defensive position for three months before being pulled out. The task force was now surplus to requirements and was disbanded on 23 November 1944. Its surviving manpower was used as reinforcements for the other American airborne formations.|$|E
5|$|Within Perinton, {{the route}} {{initially}} passes through residential areas {{similar to those}} located in East Rochester and Pittsford but soon enters a heavily commercial area centered on the intersection between NY31F and Jefferson Avenue. During this stretch, the route passes under the CSX Transportation-owned West Shore Subdivision railroad <b>line,</b> <b>here</b> situated on a large embankment. At {{the eastern edge of}} the commercial strip, NY31F narrows to two lanes and crosses over the Erie Canal into Fairport, where it becomes West Church Street.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of aerial reconnaissance, Liman von Sanders had fairly {{accurate}} knowledge on 17 September 1918, regarding the forces deployed against his Fourth, Seventh and Eighth Armies. He understood there to be five infantry divisions and a French detachment facing the Eighth Army with another two divisions facing the Seventh Army and two mounted divisions facing the Fourth Army. Liman von Sanders was not surprised by the strength and location of the attack. He shifted all his available reserves and reinforcements to the west, not to the east. The strategically vital coastal plain was the most strongly defended sector of the front <b>line.</b> <b>Here</b> Liman von Sanders deployed his most experienced infantry divisions supported by heavy artillery.|$|E

5|$|NY32B, as routed at {{the time}} of its removal, began at the {{intersection}} of Boulevard (then-NY32), Warren Street (NY32 west of Boulevard), and Highland Avenue east of Glens Falls in the Warren County town of Queensbury. The route headed east along Warren Street (here named Lower Warren Street), paralleling the eastern bank of the Hudson River. It crossed over the Glens Falls Feeder Canal prior to reaching the Warren–Washington county <b>line.</b> <b>Here,</b> Warren Street turns north to straddle the county line; however, NY32B continued southeastward into Hudson Falls on River Street. NY32B ended five blocks later at a junction with US4 in downtown Hudson Falls.|$|E
5|$|Past the exit, NY264 turns northeastward {{away from}} the freeway to serve less {{developed}} areas of Schroeppel. The highway winds its way past a mixture of cultivated fields and forested areas, passing {{the south end of}} CR54 and crossing over Sixmile Creek on its way to a small cluster of homes near the northern town <b>line.</b> <b>Here,</b> NY264 connects to Godfrey Road, a local highway leading southeast to CR54 in the hamlet of Pennellville. The route climbs a hill as it crosses into the town of Palermo and the hamlet of Suttons Corner, located at the junction of NY264 and NY49. From Suttons Corner, the route heads generally north-northeastward across along another sparsely populated stretch to a junction with NY3 south of the hamlet of Palermo. NY264 ends here while NY3 continues north on NY264's right-of-way toward Palermo.|$|E
5|$|Following this exit, {{the road}} becomes eight lanes again and crosses over the Bronx River Parkway, the Bronx River, and Metro-North Railroad's Harlem <b>Line.</b> <b>Here,</b> the road crosses into White Plains and reaches an {{interchange}} with NY22. Past NY22, I-287 makes a sharp curve {{to the south}} as it narrows to six lanes and runs near inhabited neighborhoods. The road has a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with the Central Westchester Parkway, a road that provides access to the Taconic State Parkway by way of NY22. The freeway runs past commercial areas {{to the east of}} downtown White Plains as it encounters Westchester Avenue, which connects to NY119, NY127, and Anderson Hill Road as well as The Westchester shopping mall in the downtown area. Within this interchange, the Cross-Westchester Expressway turns east along the border between Harrison to the north and White Plains to the south. Westchester Avenue becomes a frontage road for I-287 as the road passes corporate parks to the north and populated neighborhoods to the south.|$|E

5|$|Near the {{northern}} edge of downtown, NY5, NY8, and NY12 interchange with NY5A and NY5S on the southern bank of the Mohawk River. At the exit, the three state routes are joined on the arterial by I-790, which follows NY5, NY8, and NY12 across the Mohawk River and the neighboring Erie Canal to a large interchange north of the canal. Here, I-790 and NY5 separate from the concurrency while NY8 and NY12 remain concurrent into Deerfield as a limited-access highway. After an interchange with a former routing of NY12, NY8 separates from the highway and returns to an at-grade roadway as it heads northeast to Poland. Near the Oneida-Herkimer County <b>line</b> (<b>here</b> delimited by West Canada Creek), NY8 merges with NY28 and follows the route across the county line (as well as the creek) into Poland. In the center of the village, NY8 splits from NY28 and heads northeast into Adirondack Park.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} {{bank of the}} river, NY31 exits NY690 but joins NY370 {{at the end of}} the exit ramp. Together, NY31 and 370 enter Baldwinsville, {{intersecting}} NY48 in the village center. Three blocks from NY48, NY370 splits from NY31. As NY370 heads for downtown Syracuse, NY31 continues east, overlapping NY631 for a short distance before passing through Lysander New Community and crossing the Seneca River again. Now in the town of Clay, NY31 meets NY481 at an interchange in the shadow of the Great Northern Mall. NY31 continues eastward through the town to Cicero, where it meets US11 and I-81 at exit30. As NY31 heads away from I-81, Oneida Lake slowly becomes visible to the north. NY31 comes within a mile (about 1.6km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the Madison County <b>line,</b> <b>here</b> delimited by Chittenango Creek, NY31 enters the western half of Bridgeport and meets the eastern terminus of NY298 near the banks of the creek. NY31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.|$|E

25|$|At {{the bottom}} of Marley's Bank the line turns sharply north and runs along the level to Leedon Loop. The <b>line</b> <b>here</b> passes through housing. After Leedon, the railway crosses Hockliffe Road and crosses the Clipstone Brook and begins to climb again on a 1 in 50 (2%) {{gradient}} to cross Vandyke Road.|$|E
25|$|Peterborough Nene Valley (aka Peterborough West), is {{the current}} end of the <b>line.</b> <b>Here</b> there is a {{platform}}, a bay platform and a station building housing a ticket office, a small souvenir shop and toilets.

25|$|After {{another few}} blocks, US1 {{comes to the}} Mamaroneck town <b>line.</b> <b>Here</b> it comes closer to Long Island Sound when it passes Harbor Island Park {{a mile from the}} {{municipal}} boundary, and then enters the village at Mamaroneck Avenue. A mile past that junction and downtown, NY127, also bound for White Plains, forks left at Keeler Avenue as US 1 itself begins to trend more to the east into Rye, passing Rye Neck High School at the town line.|$|E

25|$|Once {{transferred}} to Flik 28 along the Isonzo, he soon {{trained as a}} pilot, returning to Wiener-Nieustadt. While attending school there, he taught student observers while also undergoing flight training. He qualified as a pilot on 30 December 1916, and received Austrian Pilot Certificate No. 596 on 30 January 1917. The new pilot was posted to Flugegeschwader I on the Isonzo <b>line.</b> <b>Here</b> he and Julius Arigi flew as fighter escort to the unit's bombers and Strohschneider scored his first two victories despite a certain lack of finesse at the controls, as on 17 April 1917, he wrecked Hansa-Brandenburg D.I serial number 28.08. However, this assignment saw him awarded the Silver Military Merit Medal with Swords, {{as well as the}} Military Merit Medal Third Class.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} week of play, LSU {{traveled}} to Ladd Stadium in Mobile, Alabama and defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide, 13–3 in coach Bear Bryant's first game with the team. Paul Dietzel had previously served as an assistant coach for Bryant during his tenure at Kentucky. Neither teams' defense allowed a score in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Cannon fumbled at Alabama's 45-yard line, and Duff Morrison picked it up for the Tide and returned it to the LSU 5-yard <b>line.</b> <b>Here,</b> the Chinese Bandits had the first of their famous goal-line stands, and held Alabama to a field goal. Alabama's defensive line and linebackers made it difficult for LSU to run the ball in the first half, and they also put pressure on Rabb during passing plays. The Crimson Tide went into halftime with a 3–0 lead. Midway through the half, a section of bleachers in the north end zone collapsed and resulted in 60 spectators being injured. The collapse caused a stoppage of play while emergency responders worked to assist those injured by the collapse.|$|E
25|$|SR634 {{parallels}} the river, until the highway crosses the river {{just south of}} Dupont. The road enters the village of Dupont, after the bridge over the Auglaize River ends. SR634 passes through mostly residential properties in Dupont. The route leaves Dupont, heading north passing through farmland. SR634 turns east concurrent with SR613. The two routes head concurrently into Continental, passing through commercial and residential properties. SR634 turns due north leaving SR613. The highway heads through downtown Continental, passing through commercial properties. In downtown the route crosses two Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks.The road crosses over a railroad branch <b>line.</b> <b>Here,</b> SR634 has its highest traffic counts with 2,690vehicles on a section of highway that is in downtown Continental. The highway passes through residential properties, before leaving Continental. North of Continental, the route passes through farmland, before coming to its northern terminus at an intersection with SR15. Continuing north after SR634 ends is County Road 21. There are no segments of SR634 that are included {{as a part of}} the National Highway System (NHS).|$|E
