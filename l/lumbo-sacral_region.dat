40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between Copeman’s nodules, which are seen in the presacral region, and demographic features such as: age, gender, body mass index, number of pregnancies, and presence of lumbar disc lesions and biomechanics of the lumbar region. Materials and Methods: This trial included 58 inpatients (49 women, 9 men; mean age SD: 40. 7 ± 11. 7 years, range 21 - 67 years) with low back pain. Standing lateral roentgenograms of <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region,</b> ultrasonography of soft tissues and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging were performed in all patients. Sacral angle, lumbo-sacral angle and lumbar lordotic curve were evaluated using Cobb’s method in lumbo-sacral x-rays. Results: Significant correlations between Copeman’s nodules and body mass index, presence of lumbar discopathy, degrees of lumbar lordotic curve were found. However, age, gender, number of pregnancies, sacral and lumbosacral angle did not correlate with the presence of Copeman’s nodules. Conclusion: Copeman’s nodules may represent the alterations of the biomechanics of <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region</b> and lumbar disc herniation due to weakness of abdominal muscles. Therefore, strengthening of abdominal muscles and correction of lumbar biomechanics in patients with nodules and low back pain are important in the management of lumbar lordosis.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Spine {{disorders}} affect various {{sections of}} the spine and {{have a variety of}} causes. Most pain occurs in the <b>lumbo-sacral</b> and cervical <b>regions.</b> Dance is associated with exercise. High levels of physical activ-ity predispose to back pain occurrence. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 237 ballet learners; 80 children (primary school level), mean age 11. 24 ± 0. 77, mean of years of training ballet 2. 14 ± 0. 74; 93 students (junior high school level), mean age 14. 01 ± 0. 84, mean of years of learning ballet 4. 64 ± 1. 24; 64 students (high school) mean age 17. 01 ± 0. 77, mean of years of learning ballet 7. 47 ± 1. 54. Numeric rating scale was used to determine spine pain. [Re-sults] Feelings of pain were analyzed on the basis of “now ” and “before ” between levels education by using point statistics and statistical tests to compare groups. “Now ” exhibited weaker back pain feelings than “before ” at all the education levels. There were statistically significant differences in pain feeling for “before ” (at any time of learning) and “now ” (the day of survey). [Conclusion] All patients reported pain “before ” and “now ” in cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. At all levels of education there were statistically significant differences in feelings of pain between “before ” and “now”...|$|R

40|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) or {{pain of the}} <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region</b> of the {{vertebral}} column is a polyetiological clinical state. LBP is a common medical condition and has a recurrent nature. The incidence of the first LBP episode in life varies from 6. 3 to 15. 4 % a year, while the total annual LBP incidence is estimated at up to 36 %. The cause of LBP can {{be located in the}} osseous structures and the joints of the vertebral column, the intervertebral discs, as well as the muscles, ligaments and nerves of the <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region.</b> Commonly, the disease mechanism is complex. Differential diagnosis {{is an important part of}} the management of LBP patients due to a number of potential causes. Some forms of LBP need emergency management, and their features are known as “red flag symptoms”. Such LBP forms occur at night and lack any connection with physical activity (especially in the early stage of the disease). Rapidly deteriorating LBP also needs to be considered as an emergency. Inflammatory LBP occurs in patients with inflammatory spondyloarthropathies (in 70 – 80 % of the patients). The presented recommendations are designed to facilitate the identification of patients with inflammatory LBP. They also describe rules of referring to a rheumatologist, as well as focus on the cooperation of a family doctor and a rheumatologist in the treatment of these patients. In most patients LBP is the first symptom of inflammatory spondyloartropathy. The classification criteria of inflammatory LBP are as follows: 1) onset at the age below 40; 2) insidious onset; 3) an improvement after physical exercise; 4) the lack of improvement after rest; 5) pain at night with improvement after getting up from bed. Non-pharmacological (kinesiotherapy, patient education) and pharmacological methods (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, TNF -alpha blockers) are used in the management of patients with inflammatory spondyloartropathy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The current report {{describes}} {{the case of}} a 29 -year-old female with a sacral giant cell tumor (GCT) during pregnancy. Originally, the patient presented with severe pain in the <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region,</b> radiating posterolaterally from the lumbar spine into the bilateral thigh and subsequently, into the bilateral crus posterolaterally. Plain X-rays, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed osteolytic destruction of the sacrococcygeal bones and a huge soft-tissue mass with features of a chordoma. The patient underwent a partial en bloc sacrec-tomy (partial S 1 and completely below) and curettage for tumors located at the sacroiliac joint and underlying left ilium, with bilateral internal iliac arteries ligated to control intraoperative hemorrhage. The patient's bilateral S 2 nerve roots were killed. The diagnosis of conventional GCT was determined based on the histopathological examination of the resected specimen.

40|$|During {{first stage}} of labour, many women suffer from lower back pain. Since {{cutaneous}} afferents from the lower back converge to the dorsal horns in the same segments there is anatomical support for the lower back pain being a referred pain. Intracutaneous injections of sterile water in the skin over the sacrum {{have been shown to}} relieve the pain of labour and it is free from negative side effects associated with use of other methods. The study was conducted after approval of institutional ethical committee on 100 pregnant patients admitted to the labour room of Lok Nayak hospital, New Delhi. Patients received 4 intracutaneous injections of sterile water or normal saline 0. 5 ml in the <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region.</b> Pain scores, progress of labour and fetal outcome were studied. There was significant reduction of pain scores in the sterile water group but not in the normal saline group at 10, 45 and 90 minutes after injection. There was no difference in the progress of labour and fetal outcome between the two groups. To conclude intracutoneous sterile water injections over the sacrum is a simple and effective method to control pain during labour...|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{epidural}} abscess is a severe, generally pyogenic, {{infection of}} the epidural space of spinal cord or cauda equina. The swelling caused by the abscess leads to compression or vascular disruption of neurological structures that requires urgent surgical decompression to avoid significant permanent disability. We share a rare case of Klebsiella pneumoniae spinal epidural abscess secondary to haematogenous spread of previous lung infection that presented late at our centre with cauda equina syndrome that showed good short-term outcome in delayed decompression. A 50 -year old female presented with one-week history of persistent low back pain with progressively worsening bilateral lower limb weakness for seven days and urinary retention associated with saddle anesthesia of 2 -day duration. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region</b> showed an intramuscular collection of abscess at left gluteus maximus and left multifidus muscle with a L 3 -L 5 posteriorly placed extradural lesion enhancing peripherally on contrast, suggestive of epidural abscess that compressed the cauda equina. The pus was drained using the posterior lumbar approach. Tissue and pus culture revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae, suggestive of bacterial infection. The patient made immediate improvement of muscle power over bilateral lower limbs postoperative followed by ability to control micturition and defecation in the 4 th post-operative day. A good short-term outcome in delayed decompression of cauda equine syndrome is extremely rare. Aggressive surgical decompression combined with antibiotic therapy led to good short-term outcome in this patient despite delayed decompression of more than 48 hours. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{earliest}} {{signs of}} the lymphatic vascular system are the lymph sacs, which develop adjacent to specific embryonic veins. It {{has been suggested that}} sprouts from the lymph sacs form the complete lymphatic vascular system. We have studied the origin of the jugular lymph sacs (JLS), the dermal lymphatics and the lymph hearts of avian embryos. In day 6. 5 embryos, the JLS is an endothelial-lined sinusoidal structure. The lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) stain (in the quail) positive for QH 1 antibody and soybean agglutinin. As early as day 4, the anlagen of the JLS can be recognized by their Prox 1 expression. Prox 1 is found in the jugular section of the cardinal veins, and in scattered cells located in the dermatomes along the cranio-caudal axis and in the splanchnopleura. In the quail, such cells are positive for Prox 1 and QH 1. In the jugular region, the veins co-express the angiopoietin receptor Tie 2. Quail-chick-chimera studies show that the peripheral parts of the JLS form by integration of cells from the paraxial mesoderm. Intra-venous application of DiI-conjugated acetylated low-density lipoprotein into day 4 embryos suggests a venous origin of the deep parts of the JLS. Superficial lymphatics are directly derived from the dermatomes, as shown by dermatome grafting. The lymph hearts in the <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region</b> develop from a plexus of Prox 1 -positive lymphatic capillaries. Both LECs and muscle cells of the lymph hearts are of somitic origin. In sum, avian lymphatics are of dual origin. The deep parts of the lymph sacs are derived from adjacent veins, the superficial parts of the JLS and the dermal lymphatics from local lymphangioblasts...|$|E
40|$|In the {{prospective}} <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region</b> of the chick embryo, neurulation {{is achieved by}} cavitation of the medullary cord, a process called secondary neurulation. Neural crest cells (NCC) are generated in this region and they give rise to {{the same types of}} derivatives as in more rostral parts of the trunk where neurulation occurs by dorsal fusion of the neural plate borders (primary neurulation). However, no molecular data were available concerning the different steps of their ontogeny. We thus performed a detailed expression study of molecular players likely to participate in the generation of secondary NCC in chick embryos between Hamburger and Hamilton stages 18 - 20 (HH 18 - 20) at the level of somites 30 to 43. We found that specification of secondary NCC involves, as in primary neurulation, the activity of several transcription factors such as Pax 3, Pax 7, Snail 2, FoxD 3 and Sox 9, which are all expressed in the dorsal secondary neural tube as soon as full cavitation is achieved. Moreover, once specification has occurred, emigration of NCC from the dorsal neuroepithelium starts facing early dissociating somites and involves a series of changes in cell shape and adhesion, as well as interactions with the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, Bmp 4 and Wnt 1 expression precedes the detection of migratory secondary NCC and is coincident with maturation of adjacent somites. Altogether, this first study of molecular aspects of secondary NCC ontogeny has revealed that the mechanisms of neural crest generation occurring along the trunk region of the chick embryo are generally conserved and independent of the type of neurulation involved. © 2009 UBC Press.

40|$|A {{lorry driver}} aged thirty-five had complained of {{progressive}} backache in the <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region</b> for seven years. The pain radiated into the buttock and lateral {{aspect of the}} thigh and into the right foot. It was relieved slightly by rest but never completely disappeared. It was not exaggerated by coughing. Just before his first attendance further pain radiated {{down the back of}} the left leg. Systematic enquiry revealed occasional dysuria. On examination the patient appeared to be in good general health although rather obese. FIG. 1 FIG. 2 Figure 1 -An antero-posterior radiograph showing spina bifida occulta of the fifth lumbar vertebra. Figure 2 -A lateral radiograph showing first-degree spondylolisthesis of the fifth lumbar on the first sacral vertebra. There was some increase in the lumbar lordosis and a “step ” could be felt at the lumbo-sacral level. Movements of the spine were full and painless, and there was no local tenderness or muscle spasm. Straight-leg raising was to 90 degrees on both sides, and Las#{ 232 }gue’s sciatic stretch test was positive on both sides. O’Connell’s femoral stretch test was negative. All leg reflexes were normal apart from some reduction of the right ankle-jerk. No motor or sensory impairment could be detected. Examination of the other systems revealed no abnormality. Investigations-The chest radiograph was normal. Antero-posterior, lateral and oblique views of the lumbar and sacral spine showed a first-degree spondylolisthesis of the fifth lumbar vertebra on the first sacral vertebra, with a defect of the lamina and pars articularis but not of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra (Figs. 1 and 2).

30|$|In {{the entire}} group of 65 patients, 5 {{developed}} pain at the distal ends of the rods requiring surgical revision. Each of the symptomatic patients was in Group 2. In those patients requiring revision to shorten the rod at the sacral region, the excessive length of the rods at time of insertion and their lack of close coaptation to the posterior sacral bone explain the subsequent problems (Fig.  3). Four of the five surgical revisions for pain were due to prominence of the distal ends of the rods at the sacral level. Each of these four (all with DMD) was successfully managed with local exploration, shortening of the rods by a length of 2 – 3  cm, and, if still necessary, bending of the rods to lie firmly against the sacrum. One of these had associated skin breakdown and sepsis at the distal site which healed after rod shortening. The fifth patient (limb girdle muscular dystrophy) benefited from surgical shortening of the distal end of one rod on the painful side, {{even though it was}} not prominent subcutaneously and relief was due to associated release of foraminal nerve pressure at L 5. Prior to the revision, the patient had three <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region</b> injections by the Pain Service, each with only a few months relief. We noted that four of the five patients had a significant weight loss between the time of original surgery and the time of rod prominence and local discomfort. In these patients, the mean weight loss was 13.8  kg (range 10 – 17  kg) and mean time following original surgery was 4.4  years (range 1.5 – 7.0  years). The weight loss and time after initial surgery in the four patients were: 17  kg (71 – 54  kg), 1.5  years; 13  kg (62 – 49  kg), 3.3  years; 10  kg (54 – 44  kg), 4.1  years; and 15  kg (61 – 46  kg), 7.0  years. One patient had gained 13  kg (85 – 98  kg) at time of revision at 0.8  years. In each of the five cases, the rods did not migrate from the bone but were in retrospect relatively too long and not positioned closely against the sacrum at time of initial surgery.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Work-related {{lower back}} disorders, which involve the <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region,</b> {{as well as}} {{injuries}} of the lumbar section of the spine, are a serious and constantly growing problem in Europe. Whole body vibration {{is one of the}} major hazardous factors suspected of the development of back pain. Material and Methods: The study covered a selected group of males, 98 farmers (aged 55. 3 ± 10. 1) from the area of 7 communes in the Lublin Region, engaged in the mixed agricultural production (plant-animal). The control group consisted of 40 academic workers (university and research institute employees) aged 48. 9 ± 9. 6 years. A questionnaire concerning low back pain (in the lumbar region) designed by the researchers of the Institute of Rural Health in Lublin was used as a major research tool. The degree of farmers' exposure to whole body vibration was evaluated based on the parameter known as a cumulative vibration dose (d) (years×m 2 ×s- 4). Results: The measurements showed that the cumulative vibration dose for the selected group of farmers (98) remained within the range of 2. 90 - 9. 68 (years×m 2 ×s- 4), in the time interval between 15 - 50 years of work in conditions of exposure to vibration. The survey confirmed that private farmers exposed to whole body vibration considerably more frequently complained of back pain (92 farmers, 94 % of the total number of respondents), than academic workers (control group not exposed to whole body vibration (25 researchers, 63 %); p < 0. 0001. Also the frequency of back pain in all the three time intervals of employment (15 - 25, 26 - 35, 36 - 50 years) is significantly higher in the group of farmers than in the control group (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: The frequency of back pains experienced by farmers during the entire period of occupational activity increases with a growing dose of whole body vibration (p = 0. 005). In the incidence of chronic pain an upward tendency was observed (statistically insignificant). Med Pr 2014; 65 (1) : 55 – 6...|$|E
40|$|To present 58 cystic space-occupying {{formations}} of {{the spinal}} canal in 53 cases; these formations are called “juxtafacet cysts”. Fifty-Three patients (33 women and 20 men, {{with an average}} age of 60. 8  years) were evaluated retrospectively by neurosurgery. All of the patients had received simple X-P, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before surgery. The neurological findings were evaluated on admission and in a follow-up review. Surgical intervention was performed on all patients and they underwent gross-total cyst removal. During surgery, the origin of a cyst was well observed. Follow-up data ranged from 6 to 46  months. Patient outcome was graded on a scale of excellent, good, or poor. Histological findings were evaluated. In 53 patients 58 cysts were identified. Four of the patients had multiple cysts. All cysts were associated with mobile spine. Fifty-five cysts were found in the <b>lumbo-sacral</b> <b>region,</b> two cysts were found in the cervico-thoracic region and one cyst in the thoracic region. Forty-two patients presented back pain and 52 patients presented radicular pain. Four patients had a cauda equina syndrome. Sensory disturbance was observed in 24 cases and motor weakness was observed in 21 cases. Claudication was observed in 19 cases. All cases with cervico-thoracic or thoracic cysts presented myelopathy. The duration of these clinical symptoms ranged from 10  days to 10  years. After surgery there was no case of a recurrent cyst during the follow-up period. Thirty-four cases had an excellent outcome, 18 a good outcome, and one a poor outcome. Out of 58 cysts 32 were joint cysts (11 synovial cysts, 21 ganglion cysts). A further 19 were flavum cysts, one was a posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) cyst and six others were unknown pseudo cysts. In 34 of the cysts we found hemosiderin deposits and in eight amyloid deposits. Present investigation and findings in literature show a clear comparison of these cystic formations and the mobile part of the spine. An anatomical relation to a vertebral joint (“facet”) is only found in some of the cases (32 of 58). Further to that, the name “cyst” is not correct either, because most of the cystic formations are presented without a cell lining on their internal wall and therefore they are pseudo-cystic. We think that these cystic formations should be called “cystic formations of mobile spine” (CYFMOS) rather than “juxtafacet cysts”. A surgical intervention is the best treatment for these cysts if they cause a compression of nerve roots or/and of the spinal cord...|$|E
