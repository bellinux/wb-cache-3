Studies provide evidence that different types of instruction {{have a positive effect on}} L 2 learners’ productions (i. e., Derwing, Munro 2 ̆ 6 Wiebe, 1998; González-Bueno 2 ̆ 6 Quintana-Lara, 2011) and L 2 learners may achieve native-like mastery of the target language phonetic features (Bongaerts, 1995). Some studies provide evidence that drills are effective for producing more native-like speech (Paulston, 1970; Yoshida 2 ̆ 6 Fukada, 2014). Other studies provide evidence that visualization of the speech contours has a significant effect on improving suprasegmentals (i. e., Chun, 1989; James, 1979) and segmentals (i. e., Motohashi-Saigo 2 ̆ 6 Hardison, 2009). For stop rhotic clusters (SRC), Spanish and English differ in: short vs. long <b>lag</b> <b>stop</b> voicing; rhotic manner (tap vs. retroflex), and epenthesis (presence vs. absence). Studies suggest that L 2 learners may achieve native-like mastery of target language phonetic properties of SRC (Colantoni 2 ̆ 6 Steele, 2006) but no known studies have compared the use of a visual feedback paradigm (VFP), Drills, and traditional instruction in their production. Three groups of native English speaker learners of Spanish recorded a pre-test, 3 trainings and post-test throughout one semester. The visual feedback group and drills group performed a visual and auditory discrimination task respectively, comparing their productions with those of NSS. The control group performed cultural activities. Target tokens, containing SRCs, were embedded in novel phrases and carrier sentences. While both trainings were equally effective for the durational parameters of the plosive and the rhotic segment, the other two features (rhotic manner and epenthesis) showed more resistance to be mastered. Results show that the acquisition of SRC seems to follow a difficulty acquisition hierarchy, but there is a strong co-dependence between the rhotic manner and the presence of an epenthetic vowel. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{model to}} {{calculate}} etching rates in SiO 2 features in fluorocarbon plasmas is presented. The model can predict several aspect ratio dependent phenomena such as {{reactive ion etching}} (RIE) <b>lag,</b> etch <b>stop,</b> inverse RIE <b>lag,</b> and aspect ratio independent etching (ARIE) {{at least for a}} limited range of aspect ratio values. The model includes three components: (a) a surface model for open area etching of SiO 2 (and Si) [Gogolides et al., J. Appl. Phys. 88, 5570 (2000) ]; (b) a flux calculator, which calculates local fluxes on each elementary surface of the feature being etched; and (c) a coupling of the two models (a) and (b), the focal point of coupling being the simultaneous calculation of the neutral species fluxes and the corresponding effective sticking coefficients. The model is applied for trench etching and the gas phase conditions considered correspond to a generic fluorocarbon gas. A different approach is presented by which the gas phase composition is divided (i. e., mapped) into regions leading to (a) deposition, (b) RIE lag with no etch stop, (c) intense RIE <b>lag</b> and etch <b>stop,</b> (d) inverse RIE lag, and (e) ARIE. Based on the proposed model an explanation of the aspect ratio dependent phenomena and ARIE is attempted, and a comparison with experimental data is done. Two parameters were found to be important in this explanation: the polymer surface coverage {{at the bottom of the}} etched feature and the effective sticking coefficients of the neutral species on the sidewalls of the etched feature. © 2002 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|When {{building}} a story-intensive game, {{there is always}} the question of how much freedom to give the player. Give the player too little, and he may feel constrained and disconnected from the character he is controlling. Give him too much freedom, and the progression of the story may <b>lag</b> or <b>stop</b> altogether. The field of interactive drama attempts {{to strike a balance between}} interaction and authorship. The story experienced in an interactive drama is dependent both on the plot content authored as well as the player’s choices in the story. Which story representation is appropriate for a particular approach to interactive drama and the relationship between that language and other elements of the architecture is a key factor in design. This paper introduces our interactive drama architecture, IDA, and addresses the requirements it has for a story representation. How those requirements are met by our representational choices is the focus of the rest of the paper...|$|R

Give him too much freedom, and the progression of the story may <b>lag</b> or <b>stop</b> altogether. This paper focuses on our attempt to find a balance between offering the player a high degree of interaction and providing a story-based experience where the player is a key character. Our approach is embedded in our Interactive Drama Architecture (IDA), which includes an omniscient story director agent who manages the player’s narrative experience. The director agent uses a declarative description of the plot to track the player’s progress, detect deviations from the plot, and make directions to supporting characters in the game. Our director is used within a game we have developed, called Haunt 2, which is an extension to the Unreal Tournament engine...|$|R
40|$|In the few {{past years}} the expert team in our {{institution}} identified five children with specific disorders in speech development caused by difficulties in understanding of speech. All children had normal psychophysical development {{up to three}} to four years of life, when speech disorders, very often entirely nonspecific, started. In some children the changes had been preceded by epileptic attacks either in vigilance or in sleep. Gradually speech expression <b>lags</b> behind, speech <b>stops</b> to be meaningful, it is not the result of child’s creativity but a series of learned schemes, sometimes related to current situation, so that in this period the environment very often does not detect the problem. Progressively behavior disturbance takes place as a result of incomprehension of verbal demands put upon a child. Parents usually start to suspect hearing impairment and this is the main reason for coming to our institution. Additional diagnostics confirmed the existence of non-specific disorder related to syndrome epilepsy-aphasia, whereupon medical treatment and rehabilitation started...|$|R

40|$|Fluorocarbon plasma for {{silicon oxide}} etching is a {{complicated}} system involving many ion and neutral species. Depending on the plasma condition, many difficulties arise such as RIE <b>lag,</b> etch <b>stop,</b> and low selectivity to photoresist. For {{a better understanding of}} the process it is necessary to have an appropriate physical model to describe the surface kinetics including simultaneous etching and deposition. A novel surface kinetic model, the translating mixed-layer (TML) model, has been developed. ABACUSS II, a modeling environment and simulator was used for solving differential algebraic equations that describes the surface kinetics. In the modeling, the effect of many variables were investigated including neutral and ion fluxes to the surface, sticking probabilities, surface composition, sputter etching reactions, ion enhanced chemical etching reactions and neutral-to-ion flux ratio. The model has been applied to various systems including silicon etching with chlorine chemistry, silicon oxide etching with fluorine chemistry and silicon oxide etching with fluorocarbon plasma. The verification of the model was done using measured etching yield data determined by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) in conjunction with plasma neutral and ion concentrations/fluxes determined by mass spectrometry. The etching and deposition rates have been measured as functions of ion impinging angle, sample temperature, which are necessary for profile evolution modeling of silicon oxide etching in inductively coupled plasma. Angular dependence of etching yield of oxide in fluorocarbon plasma shows very unique behavior unlike typical ion-induced chemical etching or physical sputtering. Ion-induced deposition model was suggested and tested. by Ohseung Kwon. Thesis (Sc. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, 2004.

40|$|We study a plane {{circular}} {{model of}} a frictional fault using numerical methods. The model is dynamic since we specify the effective stress at the fault. In one model {{we assume that the}} fault appears instantaneously in the medium; in another, that the rupture nucleates at the center and that rupture proceeds at constant subsonic velocity until it suddenly stops. The total source slip is larger at the center and the rise time is also longer {{at the center of the}} fault. The dynamic slip overshoots he static slip by 15 to 35 per cent. As a consequence, the stress drop is larger than the effective stress and the apparent stress is less than one half the effective stress. The far-field radiation is discussed in detail. We distinguish three spectral regions. First, the usual constant low-frequency level. Second, an intermediate region controlled by the fault size and, finally, the high-frequency asymptote. The central region includes the corner frequency and is quite complicated. The corner frequency is shown to be inversely proportional to the width of the far-field displacement pulse which, in turn, is related to the time <b>lag</b> between the <b>stopping</b> phases. The average corner frequency of S waves o 0 s is related to the final source radius, a, by Oo s = 0. 21 fl/a. The corner frequency of P waves is larger than v 0 s by an average factor of 1. 5...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: EUROFORS was a 2 -yr prospective, {{randomized}} {{trial of}} postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis, designed to investigate various sequential treatments after teriparatide 20 microg/d for 1 yr. The present secondary analysis {{examined the effects}} of 2 yr of open-label teriparatide in women previously treated with antiresorptive drugs for at least 1 yr. METHODS: A subgroup of 245 women with osteoporosis who had 2 yr of teriparatide treatment were stratified by previous predominant antiresorptive treatment into four groups: alendronate (n= 107), risedronate (n= 59), etidronate (n= 30), and non-bisphosphonate (n= 49). Bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and hip was determined after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and bone formation markers were measured after 1 and 6 months. RESULTS: Significant increases in bone formation markers occurred in all groups after 1 month of teriparatide treatment. Lumbar spine BMD increased at all visits, whereas a transient decrease in hip BMD, which was subsequently reversed, was observed in all groups. BMD responses were similar in all previous antiresorptive groups. Previous etidronate users showed a higher increase at the spine but not at the hip BMD. Duration of previous antiresorptive therapy and <b>lag</b> time between <b>stopping</b> previous therapy and starting teriparatide did not affect the BMD response at any skeletal site. Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar to those reported in treatment-naive postmenopausal women with osteoporosis treated with teriparatide. CONCLUSIONS: Teriparatide induces positive effects on BMD and markers of bone formation in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis, regardless of previous long-term exposure to antiresorptive therapies. status: publishe...|$|R
