500|$|The {{biosphere}} is {{subdivided into}} distinct geographical regions called biomes. Newfoundland and Labrador {{are divided into}} two biomes: tundra [...] and taiga. Northern Labrador {{is part of the}} tundra, while southern Labrador is part of the taiga. Newfoundland is not typical of either biome, as it lacks much of the plant and animal life that are characteristic to these biomes. During the last ice age the island of Newfoundland was completely covered by glaciers and swept clean of life. Only those species which were able to recolonize the island after the glaciers retreated about 18,000 years ago are considered [...] "native". Similarly, only freshwater-fish capable of surviving seawater swam to the island. Labrador has 42 native mammals, Newfoundland is home only to 14, with no snakes, raccoons, skunks or porcupines. [...] large herds of Woodland caribou {{can be found in the}} barren interior regions of the island. Two animals formerly resident in Newfoundland have been declared extinct: the Great auk, a flightless seabird, and the Newfoundland wolf, a subspecies of the Gray wolf. The <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck,</b> believed to have nested in Labrador, was one of the first North American bird species to be recorded as becoming extinct.|$|E

60|$|I {{have been}} {{informed}} by Mr. B.P. Brent, that he crossed a white Aylesbury drake {{and a black}} so-called <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck,</b> {{both of which are}} true breeds, and he obtained a young drake closely like the mallard (A. boschas). Of the musk- duck (Cairina moschata, Linn.) there are two sub-breeds, namely, white and slate-coloured; and these I am informed breed true, or nearly true. But the Rev. W.D. Fox tells me that, by putting a white drake to a slate-coloured duck, black birds, pied with white, like the wild musk-duck, were always produced. I hear from Mr. Blyth that hybrids from the canary and gold-finch almost always have streaked feathers on their backs; and this streaking must be derived from the original wild canary.|$|E

50|$|Market hunting {{severely}} depleted {{populations of}} large birds through the 19th century. Several species were exterminated, and the threatened loss of others caused popular legislation effectively prohibiting market hunting. At {{the time of}} European discovery, migratory flocks a mile wide and hundreds of miles long contained billions of passenger pigeons flying so closely together that they darkened the sky for hours as they passed overhead; the weight of roosting pigeons would break trees up to 2 ft in diameter. Michigan market hunters killed 25,000 pigeons daily for a month in 1874 before the flocks disappeared {{at the end of}} the century. Market hunters then turned their attention to migratory flocks of millions of Eskimo curlews and harvested up to 7,000 birds per day. Market hunters used small cannon called punt guns in Long Island Sound, Delaware Bay, and Chesapeake Bay to harvest Atlantic Flyway waterfowl. New York, New Jersey, and Maryland market hunters sold <b>Labrador</b> <b>ducks</b> from 1840 to 1860, and the species was extinct by 1875. The last known breeding colony of great auks on Funk Island was destroyed for feathers sold to stuff pillows and mattresses. Herons and egrets were hunted for their long, filamentous nuptial plumage used in the millinery trade from 1840 until prices rose to $32 per ounce in 1903. Heath hens were exterminated from the mainland by 1835, and were extinct within a century. Hunting seasons were eventually established to conserve surviving wildlife and allow a certain amount of recovery and re-population to occur. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act signed in 1918 regulated hunting and prohibited all hunting of wood ducks until 1941 and swans until 1962.|$|R
60|$|In one {{skeleton}} of the <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck</b> {{there were the}} usual fifteen cervical vertebrae and the usual nine dorsal vertebrae bearing ribs; in the other skeleton there were fifteen cervical and ten dorsal vertebrae with ribs; nor, as far as could be judged, was this owing merely to a rib having been developed on the first lumbar vertebra; for in both skeletons the lumbar vertebrae agreed perfectly in number, shape, and size {{with those of the}} wild duck. In two skeletons of the Call duck there were fifteen cervical and nine dorsal vertebrae; in a third skeleton small ribs were attached to the so-called fifteenth cervical vertebra, making ten pairs of ribs; but these ten ribs do not correspond, or arise from the same vertebra, with the ten in the above-mentioned <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck.</b> In the Call duck, which had small ribs attached to the fifteenth cervical vertebra, the haemal spines of the thirteenth and fourteenth (cervical) and of the seventeenth (dorsal) vertebrae corresponded with the spines on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighteenth vertebrae of the wild duck: so that each of these vertebrae had acquired a structure proper to one posterior to it in position. In the eighth cervical vertebra of this same Call duck (figure 40, B), the two branches of the haemal spine stand much closer together than in the wild duck (A), and the descending haemal processes are much shortened. In the Penguin duck the neck from its thinness and erectness falsely appears (as ascertained by measurement) to be much elongated, but the cervical and dorsal vertebrae present no difference; the posterior dorsal vertebrae, however, are more completely anchylosed to the pelvis than in the wild duck. The Aylesbury duck has fifteen cervical and ten dorsal vertebrae furnished with ribs, but the same number of lumbar, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, as far as could be traced, as in the wild duck. The cervical vertebrae in this same duck (figure 40, D) were much broader and thicker relatively to their length than in the wild (C); so much so, that I have thought it worth while to give a sketch of the twelfth cervical vertebra in these two birds. From the foregoing statements we see that the fifteenth cervical vertebra occasionally becomes modified into a dorsal vertebra, and when this occurs all the adjoining vertebrae are modified. We also see that an additional dorsal vertebra bearing a rib is occasionally developed, the number of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae apparently remaining the same as usual.|$|E
60|$|The Penguin duck is {{the most}} {{remarkable}} of all the breeds; the thin neck and body are carried erect; the wings are small; the tail is upturned; and the thigh-bones and metatarsi are considerably lengthened in proportion with the same bones in the wild duck. In five specimens examined by me there were only eighteen tail-feathers instead of twenty as in the wild duck; but I have also found only eighteen and nineteen tail-feathers in two Labrador ducks. On the middle toe, in three specimens, there were twenty- seven or twenty-eight scutellae, whereas in two wild ducks there were thirty-one and thirty-two. The Penguin when crossed transmits with much power its peculiar form of body and gait to its offspring; this was manifest with some hybrids raised in the Zoological Gardens between one of these birds and the Egyptian goose (Anser aegyptiacus) (8/18. These hybrids have been described by M. Selys-Longchamps in the 'Bulletins (tome 12 No 10) Acad. Roy. de Bruxelles.'), and likewise with some mongrels which I raised between the Penguin and <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck.</b> I am not much surprised that some writers should maintain that this breed must be descended from an unknown and distinct species; but from the reasons already assigned, {{it seems to me}} far more probable that it is the descendant, much modified by domestication under an unnatural climate, of Anas boschas.|$|E
60|$|The skulls of {{the several}} breeds differ {{from each other and}} from the skull of the wild duck in very little except in the {{proportional}} length and curvature of the premaxillaries. These latter bones in the Call duck are short, and a line drawn from their extremities to the summit of the skull is nearly straight, instead of being concave as in the common duck; so that the skull resembles that of a small goose. In the Hook-billed duck (figure 39), these same bones as well as the lower jaw curve downwards in a most remarkable manner, as represented. In the <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck</b> the premaxillaries are rather broader than in the wild duck; and in two skulls of this breed the vertical ridges {{on each side of the}} supra-occipital bone are very prominent. In the Penguin the premaxillaries are relatively shorter than in the wild duck; and the inferior points of the paramastoids more prominent. In a Dutch tufted duck, the skull under the enormous tuft was slightly more globular and was perforated by two large apertures; in this skull the lachrymal bones were produced much further backwards, so as to have a different shape and nearly to touch the post. lat. processes of the frontal bones, thus almost completing the bony orbit of the eye. As the quadrate and pterygoid bones are of such complex shape and stand in relation with so many other bones, I carefully compared them in all the principal breeds; but excepting in size they presented no difference.|$|E
60|$|From these {{considerations}} there {{can hardly be}} a doubt that the wild duck is the parent of the common domestic kind; nor need we look to other species for the parentage of the more distinct breeds, namely, Penguin, Call, Hook- billed, Tufted, and Labrador ducks. I will not repeat the arguments used in the previous chapters on the improbability of man having in ancient times domesticated several species since become unknown or extinct, though ducks are not readily exterminated in the wild state;--on some of the supposed parent-species having had abnormal characters in comparison {{with all the other}} species of the genus, as with Hook-billed and Penguin ducks;--on all the breeds, as far as is known being fertile together (8/10. I have met with several statements on the fertility of the several breeds when crossed. Mr. Yarrell assured me that Call and common ducks are perfectly fertile together. I crossed Hook-billed and common ducks, and a Penguin and Labrador, and the crossed Ducks were quite fertile, though they were not bred inter se, so that the experiment was not fully tried. Some half-bred Penguins and Labradors were again crossed with Penguins, and subsequently bred by me inter se, and they were extremely fertile.);--on all the breeds having the same general disposition, instinct, etc. But one fact bearing on this question may be noticed: in the great duck family, one species alone, namely, the male of A. boschas, has its four middle tail-feathers curled upwardly; now in every one of the above-named domestic breeds these curled feathers exist, and on the supposition that they are descended from distinct species, we must assume that man formerly hit upon species all of which had this now unique character. Moreover, sub-varieties of each breed are coloured almost exactly like the wild duck, as I have seen with the largest and smallest breeds, namely Rouens and Call ducks, and, as Mr. Brent states (8/11. 'Poultry Chronicle' 1855 volume 3 page 512.), is the case with Hook-billed ducks. This gentleman, as he informs me, crossed a white Aylesbury drake and a black <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck,</b> and some of the ducklings as they grew up assumed the plumage of the wild duck.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck</b> (Camptorhynchus labradorius) was a North American bird; {{it has the}} {{distinction}} of being the first endemic North American bird species to become extinct after the Columbian Exchange, with the last known sighting occurring in 1878 in Elmira, New York. It was already a rare duck before European settlers arrived, {{and as a result of}} its rarity information on the <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck</b> is not abundant, although some, such as its habitat, characteristics, dietary habits and reasons behind its extinction, are known. There are 55 specimens of the <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck</b> preserved in museum collections worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Another, {{completely}} unrelated, duck {{with similar}} (but even more specialized) bill morphology is the Australian pink-eared duck, which feeds largely on plankton, but also mollusks; the condition in the <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck</b> probably resembled {{that in the}} blue duck most in outward appearance.Its peculiar bill suggests it ate shellfish and crustaceans from silt and shallow water.

50|$|The <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck</b> fed {{on small}} molluscs, and some {{fishermen}} reported catching it on fishing lines baited with mussels.

50|$|The female plumage was gray. Although weakly patterned, {{the pattern}} was scoter-like. The male’s plumage {{was black and}} white in an eider-like pattern, but the wings were entirely white except for the primaries. The trachea of the male was scoter-like. An {{expansion}} of the tracheal tube occurred at the anterior end, and two enlargements (as opposed to one enlargement as seen in scoters) were near {{the middle of the}} tube. The bulla was bony and round, puffing out from the left side. This asymmetrical and osseus bulla was unlike that of scoters; this bulla was similar to eiders and harlequin duck's bullae. The <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck</b> has been considered the most enigmatic of all North American birds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{biosphere}} is {{subdivided into}} distinct geographical regions called biomes. Newfoundland and Labrador {{are divided into}} two biomes: tundra and taiga.

40|$|The 21 {{species of}} sea ducks {{are one of}} the larger subgroups (Tribe Mergini) of the {{waterfowl}} family Anatidae, and the 16 species (one historically extinct) that are native to North America represent the largest number to be found on any continent, and also the largest number of endemic sea duck species native to any continent. Although generally not important as game birds, the sea ducks include some economically important birds such as the eiders, the basis for the Arctic eiderdown industry and a historically important food source for some Native American cultures. They also include what is probably the most northerly breeding species of all waterfowl and an icon of Arctic bird life, the long-tailed duck. The sea ducks also include species having some of the most complex and diverse pair-forming postural and acoustic displays of all waterfowl (goldeneyes and bufflehead), and some of the deepest diving species of all waterfowl (scoters and long-tailed duck). Sea ducks are highly prone to population disasters caused by oil spills and other water contaminants and, like other seabirds, are among the first bird groups that are being affected by current global warming trends in polar regions. This book is an effort to summarize succinctly our current knowledge of sea duck biology and to provide a convenient survey of the vast technical literature on the group, with over 900 literature references. It also includes 90, 000 words of text (more than 40 percent of which is new), 15 updated range maps, 11 black 2 ̆ 6 white and 20 color photographs, over 30 ink drawings, and nearly 150 sketches. Lastly, the North American sea ducks include the now extinct <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck,</b> the only northern hemisphere waterfowl species to have gone extinct in modern times. I have gratefully reprinted a <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck</b> watercolor by Sir Peter Scott. Considering recent population crashes in other sea ducks, such as the Steller’s eider and spectacled eider, it should also offer a sobering reminder of the fragility of our natural world and its inhabitants, including us. doi: 10. 13014 /K 22 Z 13 FS[URL]...|$|E

They are found in fresh-water as well as marine habitats, and primarily have Northern Hemisphere distribution patterns. Except for the two isolated Southern Hemisphere species, all of the sea ducks have considerable sexual dimorphism in plumage. Males in breeding plumage are usually elaborately patterned, often with predominantly black and white markings, which probably serve very well to localize and identify these birds at considerable distances in their marine environments. However, iridescent coloration is generally limited to the head, and the wing speculum patterns, instead of being iridescent, are generally white and black. Nesting is usually done on fairly open shoreline or in grassy tundra, as in the eiders and long-tailed duck, or in cavities, under heavy brush, or in similar well-concealed locations, as in the goldeneyes, mergansers, and harlequin duck. Females of the ground-nesting forms approach the patterns found among female dabbling ducks in their cryptic coloration, and the downy young of these species are also rather brownish and obscurely patterned. Females of the hole-nesting species are more uniformly brownish and their ducklings are frequently contrastingly spotted with white and dark markings...|$|E
40|$|The sea ducks are a {{group of}} mostly arctic-adapted diving ducks that usually winter in coastal waters and {{typically}} breed in tundra situations or in northern forests. All twenty species (two of which are now extinct) depend predominantly on animal sources of food, and some feed exclusively on such materials. These foods include shellfish, mollusks, other invertebrates, and aquatic vertebrates such as fish. In general the sea ducks are thus not regarded as highly as table birds as are the surface-feeding ducks {{and some of the}} more vegetarian pochard species. Like the pochards, their legs are placed well to the rear and their feet are unusually large; thus the birds have sacrificed the ability to walk easily for their diving adaptations. Also in common with pochards, their generally heavier bodies relative to wing surface area prevent them from taking flight without running some distance over the water prior to reaching minimum flight speed. In the air they often make up in speed for their limited maneuverability, although some of the largest sea ducks are rather ponderous in flight. Some species exhibit a good deal of white on the wings while in flight, and, unlike the pochards, two species have iridescent speculum patterns. The arctic-breeding and tundra-nesting forms typically build open-cup nests in low vegetation, while the forest-nesting species often use hollow trees or other natural cavities for their nest sites. Some of these tree-nesting species have moderately long tails and can perch fairly well, but the larger eiders and scoters rarely stray far from the water 2 ̆ 7 s edge and are rather helpless on land. Of the total of twenty species of sea ducks, North America is well endowed with fifteen extant breeding species, as well as the extinct <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck.</b> Further, the Old World smew has been reported several times in recent years, so that the only species not reported from North America are two Southern Hemisphere mergansers and an Asian species of merganser. Most of the North American species also occur extensively in the Old World, with the bufflehead, surf scoter, Barrow goldeneye, and hooded merganser being the exceptions...|$|E
40|$|The {{species of}} {{waterfowl}} breeding in North America have distribution patterns that collectively reflect the past geologic and ecological histories of this continent. In general, our waterfowl species {{may be grouped}} into those that are limited (endemic) to North America, those that are shared between North and South America, {{and those that are}} shared with Europe and/or Asia. Of the forty-four species known to breed in continental North America, the resulting grouping of breeding distributions is as follows: Limited to North America: Snow goose (also on Greenland and Wrangel Island), Ross goose, Canada goose (also on Greenland), wood duck, American wigeon, black duck, blue-winged teal, redhead, canvasback, ringnecked duck, lesser scaup, <b>Labrador</b> <b>duck</b> (extinct), surf scoter, bufflehead, hooded merganser. Shared with Eurasia: Trumpeter swan (whooper swan), whistling swan (Bewick swan), white-fronted goose, brant goose, gadwall, green-winged teal, mallard, pintail, shoveler, greater scaup, common eider, king eider, harlequin duck, oldsquaw, black scoter, white-winged scoter, common goldeneye, red-breasted merganser, common merganser. Shared with South America: Fulvous whistling duck, black-bellied whistling duck, muscovy duck, cinnamon teal, masked duck, ruddy duck. Shared with Asia only: Emperor goose, spectacled eider, Steller eider (rarely to Norway). Shared with Europe only: Barrow goldeneye (Iceland and Greenland). Native to Eurasia, introduced into North America: Mute swan. It is thus clear that the strongest zoogeographic affinities of our waterfowl are with Europe and Asia, since twenty-three out of the forty-four native North American species have. populations shared with one or both of these areas. Only six species are shared with South America, and, of these, the fulvous whistling duck has a more general tropical distribution that includes Africa and southern Asia. Consequently, it would appear that South America has played only a minor role in providing waterfowl stock for North America, and vice versa. Certainly the great number of waterfowl species shared between the North American and Eurasian landmasses can be largely attributed to Pleistocene and post-Pleistocene history. Ploeger (1968) analyzed the distributions of eighteen species of arctic-breeding Anatidae and concluded that both their present distributions and their described geographic variations could be at· tributed to the physical-geographical situation existing in the Northern Hemisphere during Late Glacial times. Only a minority (38 percent) of these species exhibit noticeable geographic variation, and most of the eighteen have breeding ranges that include both North America and Eurasia. The exceptions are three Eurasian geese (red-breasted, bean, and lesser white-fronted geese), three North American geese (Canada, Ross, and snow geese), and the North Atlantic barnacle goose. It is of interest that these are all geese, a group noted for their strongly traditional wintering and breeding grounds, as opposed to the less tradition-bound ducks...|$|E
