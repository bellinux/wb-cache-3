40|$|Contained herein is the {{research}} and data acquired from the Turntable Design portion of the Spinning Rocket Simulator (SRS) project. The SRS Project studies and eliminates the effect of coning on thrust-propelled spacecraft. This design and construction of the turntable adds a structural support for the SRS model and two degrees of freedom. The two degrees of freedom, radial and circumferential, will help develop a simulated thrust force perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} spacecraft model while undergoing an unstable coning motion. The Turntable consists of a ten-foot <b>linear</b> <b>track</b> mounted to a sprocket and press-fit to a thrust bearing. A two-inch high column grounded by a Triangular Baseplate supports this bearing and houses the slip rings and pressurized, air-line swivel. The thrust bearing allows the entire system to rotate under the moment applied through the chain-driven sprocket producing a circumferential degree of freedom. The radial degree of freedom is given to the model through the helically threaded <b>linear</b> <b>track.</b> This track allows the Model Support and Counter Balance to simultaneously reposition according to the coning motion of the Model. Two design factors that hinder the <b>linear</b> <b>track</b> are bending and twist due to torsion. A Standard Aluminum "C" channel significantly reduces these two deflections.

40|$|Wheel/track impact due to {{rail joints}} or wheel flats {{has been studied}} over many years. The railway track is usually assumed to be linear {{in order to simplify}} the track model, {{although}} the rail pad and ballast are actually non-linear. This may cause incorrect results to some extent in some circumstances, as the pad and ballast stiffness varies with load. In this paper wheel/track impact is studied using a non-linear track model. The rail is represented by a finite element (FE) model and is supported by a non-linear track foundation. Wheel/track impacts are simulated at different train speeds and three types of rail pad, soft, medium and stiff, are used in the simulations. It is shown that the impact forces rise dramatically when the stiff rail pads are used. On the other hand, using soft pads can reduce impact forces significantly. Compared with the results from the <b>linear</b> <b>track</b> model, both the impact force and the track vibration level are shown to be noticeably higher from the nonlinear track than those from the <b>linear</b> <b>track.</b> It is therefore concluded that <b>linear</b> <b>track</b> models are not appropriate for wheel/track impact because the track foundation stiffness varies dramatically under the impact force...|$|R

These motions are in a plane radial to {{the rotation of the}} record and at angles of 45 degrees to the plane of the disk (normal to the groove faces).

The control variable is taken as mass acceleration with respect to body coordinates. Motion is limited to defined quantities and a penalty function is used to insure a given range of positions.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} Edison phonographs used horizontal, spring-powered {{drives to}} carry the stylus across the recording at a pre-determined rate. But, historically as a whole, the <b>linear</b> <b>tracking</b> systems never gained wide acceptance, due largely to their complexity and associated production/development costs. The resources it takes to produce one incredible linear turntable could produce several excellent ones. Some {{of the most sophisticated}} and expensive tonearms and turntable units ever made are linear trackers, from companies such as Rockport and Clearaudio. In theory, it seems nearly ideal; a stylus replicating the motion of the recording lathe used to cut the [...] "master" [...] record could result in minimal wear and maximum sound reproduction. In practice, in vinyl's heyday it was generally too much too late.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} an extremely light tracking force, the stylus arm is surrounded by coils which sense deflection, and a circuit in the player responds to the signals from these coils by moving the stylus head carriage in steps as the groove pulls the stylus across the disc. Other coils are used to deflect the stylus, to finely adjust tracking. This system is very similar to—yet predates—the one used in Compact Disc players to follow the spiral optical track, where typically a servo motor moves the optical pickup in steps for coarse tracking {{and a set of}} coils tilts the laser lens for fine tracking, both guided by an optical sensing device which is the analogue of CED stylus deflection sensing coils. For the CED player, this tracking arrangement has the additional benefit that the stylus drag angle remains uniformly tangent to the groove, unlike the case for a phonograph tonearm in which the stylus drag angle and consequently the stylus side force varies with the tone arm angle, which in turn depends on the radial position on the record of the stylus. Whereas for a phonograph, where the stylus has a pinpoint tip, <b>linear</b> <b>tracking</b> is merely ideal to reduce wear of records and styli and to maximize tracking stability, for a CED player <b>linear</b> <b>tracking</b> is a necessity for the keel-shaped stylus, which must always stay tangent to the groove. Furthermore, the achievement of an extremely light tracking force on the CED stylus enables the use of a fine groove pitch (i.e. fine spacing of adjacent revolutions of the spiral), necessary to provide a long playing time at the required high rotational speed, while also limiting the rate of disc and stylus wear.|$|E
50|$|High {{fidelity}} {{made great}} advances during the 1970s, as turntables became very precise instruments with belt or direct drive, jewel-balanced tonearms, some with electronically controlled <b>linear</b> <b>tracking</b> and magnetic cartridges. Some cartridges had frequency response above 30 kHz {{for use with}} CD-4 quadraphonic 4 channel sound. A high fidelity component system which cost under $1,000 could {{do a very good}} job of reproducing very accurate frequency response across the human audible spectrum from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz with a $200 turntable which would typically have less than 0.05% wow and flutter and very low rumble (low frequency noise). A well-maintained record would have very little surface noise, though it was difficult to keep records completely free from scratches, which produced popping noises. Another characteristic failure mode was groove lock, causing a section of music to repeat, separated by a popping noise. This was so common that a saying was coined: you sound like a broken record, referring to someone who is being annoyingly repetitious.|$|E
5000|$|Another <b>linear</b> control <b>track,</b> at the tape's lower edge, holds pulses {{that mark}} the {{beginning}} of every frame of video; these are used to fine-tune the tape speed during playback, so that the high speed rotating heads remained exactly on their helical tracks rather than somewhere between two adjacent tracks (known as [...] "tracking"). Since good tracking depends on precise distances between the rotating drum and the fixed control/audio head reading the <b>linear</b> <b>tracks,</b> which usually varies by a couple of micrometers between machines due to manufacturing tolerances, most VCRs offer tracking adjustment, either manual or automatic, to correct such mismatches.|$|R
