2500|$|The term {{infrared}} microscopy {{refers to}} microscopy performed at infrared wavelengths. In the typical instrument configuration a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) {{is combined with}} an optical microscope and an infrared detector. [...] The infrared detector can be a single point detector, a <b>linear</b> <b>array</b> or a 2D focal plane array. [...] The FTIR provides the ability to perform chemical analysis via infrared spectroscopy and the microscope and point or array detector enable this chemical analysis to be spatially resolved, i.e. performed at {{different regions of the}} sample. As such, the technique is also called infrared microspectroscopy [...] (an alternative architecture involves the combination of a tuneable infrared light source and single point detector on a flying objective). This technique is frequently used for infrared chemical imaging, where the image contrast is determined by the response of individual sample regions to particular IR wavelengths selected by the user, usually specific IR absorption bands and associated molecular resonances [...] A key limitation of conventional infrared microspectroscopy is that the spatial resolution is diffraction-limited. [...] Specifically the spatial resolution is limited to a figure related to the wavelength of the light. [...] For practical IR microscopes, the spatial resolution is limited to 1-3X the wavelength, depending on the specific technique and instrument used. [...] For mid-IR wavelengths, this sets a practical spatial resolution limit of ~3-30 μm.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>linear</b> <b>arrays</b> of rigid spheres and deformable drops in a Poiseuille flow between parallel walls is investigated {{to determine the}} effect of particle deformation on the collective dynamics in confined particulate flows. We find that <b>linear</b> <b>arrays</b> of rigid spheres aligned in the flow direction exhibit a particle-pairing instability and are unstable to lateral perturbations. <b>Linear</b> <b>arrays</b> of deformable drops also undergo the pairing instability but also exhibit additional dynamical features, including formation of transient triplets, cascades of pair-switching events, and the eventual formation of pairs with equal interparticle spacing. Moreover, particle deformation stabilizes drop arrays to lateral perturbations.
