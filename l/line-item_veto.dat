5|$|Cordray ran for Ohio's 15th congressional {{district}} in the 1992 U.S. House of Representatives elections, and won the Democratic nomination over Bill Buckel by an 18,7315,329 (7822%) margin, following the withdrawal of another candidate, Dave Sommer. Cordray's platform included federal spending cuts, term limits for Congress and a <b>line-item</b> <b>veto</b> for the president. When Pryce announced that she would vote to support abortion rights, Linda S. Reidelbach entered the race as an independent. Thus, the general election was a three-way affair, with Pryce taking a plurality of 110,390 votes (44.1%), Cordray taking 94,907 votes (37.9%) and Linda Reidelbach taking 44,906 votes (17.9%).|$|E
5|$|The 1799 {{constitution}} contained, for {{the first}} time, {{the power of the}} governor to veto legislation; this power was substantially similar to, and probably based upon, that found in the 1792 New Hampshire Constitution and the 1798 Georgia Constitution. The governor's veto can be overridden by a majority vote of both houses of the legislature. The 1891 constitution empowered the governor with a <b>line-item</b> <b>veto,</b> but its use was forbidden on constitutional amendments and laws related to the classification of property for tax purposes.|$|E
50|$|This {{amendment}} asked {{voters to}} allow the Governor of Virginia to use <b>line-item</b> <b>vetos</b> for bills passed by the Virginia General Assembly.|$|R
5000|$|In this Legislature, all acts {{have been}} {{approved}} (signed) by Governor Mark Dayton, {{with the exception of}} chapters 123, 124, 303, and items in chapters 99, 137, and 293. Chapter 123 became law without the governor's signature. Chapter 124, a proposed amendment to the Minnesota Constitution, did not require his approval. Chapters 99, 137, and 293 were subject to <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoes.</b> In chapter 99, the omnibus higher education act, an appropriation for a grant to Teach For America was <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoed.</b> In chapter 137, the omnibus legacy act, two appropriations were line-item vetoed: one for the Twin Cities metropolitan area regional parks system and one for aquatic invasive species grants to tribal and local governments. In chapter 293, the so-called [...] "Timberjay bill," [...] wording directing the appropriation of funds from a special account for the use by the legislative auditor was <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoed.</b> Chapter 303 (...) , a bill that restricted the Minnesota State Lottery from certain activities, was vetoed in its entirety. No bills or items were enacted by the Legislature over the governor's veto.|$|R
50|$|As {{governor}} of Florida, Bush frequently made {{the restoration of}} ex-felons' civil rights (including the right to vote) contingent on sobriety from drugs or alcohol. At the same time, 32 of Bush's <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoes</b> (totaling almost $13 million) cut funding for programs for substance-abuse treatment and offender-reintegration programs.|$|R
5|$|Despite gaining {{considerable}} power {{during the}} mid twentieth-century, {{the governor is}} still much weaker than those of other states. He has no <b>line-item</b> <b>veto</b> authority, and the pocket veto was ruled unconstitutional. If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically. This led to a fist fight during the term of Claude Matthews, who was locked out of the House chambers {{to prevent him from}} returning a bill in time. Vetoes are also easily overridden, requiring only a simple majority as opposed to a supermajority. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government's agencies, such as the Indiana State Police and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Other large agencies, such as the Department of Administration, are {{under the control of the}} cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The two {{chambers}} {{announced that}} their negotiations had reached an impasse {{just days before}} the constitutionally mandated end of the session on April 15, but Bevin insisted he would not call a special legislative session for them to continue negotiations. Just before 3:00a.m. on April 14, negotiators announced they had reached a compromise that would cut public universities' budgets by 4.5 percent over the biennium instead of the 9 percent requested by Bevin and implement a performance-based funding model in 2017. The money would be reallocated to contribute over $1 billion toward the state pension system's liabilities, which exceeded $30 billion. Republicans agreed to fund a Democratic proposal for a scholarship program providing free community college tuition for qualified students, relented on their demands to stop state funding for Planned Parenthood, and spared the state's prevailing wage guidelines. Bevin signed the budget, but used his <b>line-item</b> <b>veto</b> to strip funding for the scholarship program {{in the first year of}} the biennium, saying the guidelines were poorly written and should be revised before implementing the program in 2017. Because of the constitutional prohibition against the legislative session extending past April 15, the General Assembly was unable to override the veto.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the end of}} the legislative session, Beshear called for a special legislative session to consider a way to meet the state's Medicaid obligations and whether or not to raise the minimum dropout age. In the special session, legislators also approved raising the minimum dropout age to 18 during the special session. Following the session, the National Education Association honored Beshear with its America's Greatest Education Governor Award for 2011, citing his advocacy for raising the minimum dropout age and his consistent refusal to cut education funding. Both houses also approved a plan that allowed Beshear to move the funds from the second year of the budget, but triggered automatic spending cuts if the managed care plans did not generate sufficient savings. The bill also called for the hiring of an independent accounting firm to assess the savings achieved by the managed care plans. Beshear then used his <b>line-item</b> <b>veto</b> to strike the spending cuts and the savings assessment provisions, per a previous arrangement with Democratic lawmakers. By eliminating these provisions, the version of the bill signed by Beshear was essentially the plan he had proposed during the regular session. The House adjourned the session March 24, but the Senate remained in session until April 6, voting to override Beshear's vetoes, but without concurrence from the House, the override votes were ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{vetoed the}} {{transfer}} of funds from the contingency account. The veto was overturned by the legislature, and indeed for the 2006 budget, all 250 <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoes</b> were overturned, and for the entire year of 2006, all of Romney's vetoes of legislative bills were subsequently overturned by the Massachusetts Legislature.|$|R
50|$|Like the U.S. President, the {{governor}} has veto power over bills passed by the Minnesota State Legislature. As in most states, but unlike the U.S. President, {{the governor}} can also make <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoes,</b> where specific provisions in bills can be stripped out while allowing the overall bill to be signed into law.|$|R
50|$|Bills are enacted {{after being}} {{passed by the}} Legislature and signed by the {{governor}}. However, if the governor vetoes a bill or <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoes</b> items that appropriate money in a bill, the bill or items can still be enacted by a two-thirds vote in both houses, unless the Legislature by adjournment prevents the bill's return.|$|R

25|$|At its passage, the Act was {{politically}} controversial, with many Democrats breaking with Clinton to oppose it. Of the opposition, {{six members of}} Congress, including Republican Mark Hatfield, sued to prevent use of the <b>line-item</b> <b>veto.</b> They were granted summary judgment by the U.S. District Court, but the Supreme Court held that the Congressmen lacked standing {{because they could not}} show any particularized harm, and dismissed their suit in Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811 (1997). Within the next two months, Clinton began using the <b>line-item</b> <b>veto,</b> prompting several entities to file suit in a second attempt to have the Act declared unconstitutional.|$|E

50|$|Carey {{came into}} office with New York City close to bankruptcy. He brought {{business}} and labor together to help save New York City from the fiscal crisis that befell it in the 1970s. Carey managed to keep the growth of state spending below {{the rate of inflation}} through his frequent use of <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoes</b> and fights with the New York State Legislature, which was at the time divided between a Republican-controlled Senate and a Democratic-controlled Assembly.|$|R
25|$|One {{highlight}} of the debate occurred when Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani debated whether the <b>line-item</b> <b>veto</b> was constitutional or not. Giuliani claimed that it was unconstitutional and challenged former President Bill Clinton on its use, while Romney praised the practice citing that he used it 844 times as Governor of Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|Indiana {{does not}} have a legal {{requirement}} to balance the state budget either in law or its constitution. Instead, Indiana has a constitutional ban on assuming debt. It has a Rainy Day Fund and for healthy reserves proportional to spending. Indiana is one of six states in the U.S. which do not allow a <b>line-item</b> <b>veto.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} {{has the power}} of the <b>line-item</b> <b>veto,</b> which allows them to sign part of appropriation bills into law, while sending appropriations items they disagree with back to the legislature. Items disapproved by the governor in this manner become void, unless the legislation is re-passed in both the Oklahoma House of Representatives and Oklahoma Senate with a two-thirds vote in favor of overriding the veto.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked how}} this {{proposed}} legislation {{was different from}} the 1996 Line Item Veto Act that was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoes.</b> Thus, in order for the President to successfully rescind previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.|$|R
25|$|Romney’s {{austerity}} {{budget for}} fiscal year 2004, unveiled just weeks later, included even more substantial cuts in state funding for cities and towns. The final budget passed by the legislature (after overriding Romney’s attempt to make still further cuts using <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoes),</b> cut funding for local aid to many communities {{by as much as}} 20percent. Already struggling to absorb funding cuts from the prior year’s budget, communities across the state were forced to cut services and hike fees, while laying off teachers, police officers, and other municipal workers.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his first}} two terms as governor, Thompson used 1,500 <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoes</b> to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden. The only {{judicial}} limitation was Risser v. Klauser, which prohibited the [...] "reduction veto", stating that [...] "the constitution prohibits a writein veto of monetary figures which are not appropriation amounts." [...] In 2009, a constitutional amendment was passed abolishing the [...] "Vanna White veto". Yet, in 2011, Governor Scott Walker controversially crossed out 116 words in a pension-related {{section of the budget}} bill.|$|R
25|$|Clinton v. City of New York, , is a {{legal case}} in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the <b>line-item</b> <b>veto</b> as granted in the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 {{violated}} the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution because it impermissibly gave the President of the United States the power to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of statutes that had been duly passed by the United States Congress. The decision of the Court, in a six-to-three majority, was delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens.|$|E
25|$|On {{that same}} day, Joshua Bolten, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, gave {{a press conference}} on the president’s <b>line-item</b> <b>veto</b> proposal. Bolten {{explained}} that the proposed Act would give the President the ability to single out “wasteful” spending and to put such spending on hold. While the spending line-item is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to rescind the particular line-item. The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis, and could be passed by a simple majority. Additionally, such proposals could not be filibustered.|$|E
25|$|In {{first year}} of his second term, Vilsack used a <b>line-item</b> <b>veto,</b> later ruled unconstitutional by the Iowa Supreme Court, to create the Grow Iowa Values Fund, a $503million {{appropriation}} designed to boost the Iowa economy by offering grants to corporations and initiatives pledged to create higher-income jobs. He vetoed portions of the {{bill that would have}} cut income taxes and eased business regulations. After a special session of the Iowa General Assembly on September 7, 2004, $100million in state money was set aside to honor previously made commitments. The Grow Iowa Values Fund was reinstated {{at the end of the}} 2005 session: under the current law, $50million per year will be set aside over the next ten years.|$|E
5000|$|White opposed <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoes</b> by Governor Heineman in 2007 {{that cut}} funding for Meals on Wheels in Omaha and {{programs}} for the disabled. The budget was already balanced prior to the vetoes, so the Governor's reduction was not necessary. During debate, White said Appropriations Committee members {{had come to the}} chamber and said about the budget: “This is lean, this is mean, this is responsible. And now we’re whacking it out... Budgets are moral documents, and we are kicking to the curb those that Christ pulled to him.” ...|$|R
50|$|In this Legislature, all acts were {{approved}} (signed) by Governor Mark Dayton, with the exceptions of H.F. No. 844, an omnibus education bill; H.F.

No. 1437, an omnibus jobs, economic development, and energy bill; and , an omnibus bill modifying {{state and local government}} employee retirement statutes, all of which were vetoed. In chapter 186, an environment and natural resources appropriations act, seven appropriations were <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoed.</b> H.F. No. 848, the omnibus tax bill, was pocket vetoed. No bills or items were enacted by the Legislature over the governor's veto.|$|R
2500|$|From 1914-1917, Butte was a UT law {{professor}} and led the university's opposition to then Governor James Ferguson, who <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoed</b> the UT appropriation bill in 1917, a procedure by which a governor can strike out selected spending but keep other items in the bill intact. On Texas Independence Day, March 2, 1917, Butte delivered the address [...] "Academic Freedom" [...] or [...] "In the Spirit of 1836" [...] to reply to Ferguson's repudiation of the UT spending bill. Soon Ferguson was impeached by the Texas House of Representatives, convicted by the state senate, and removed from office and thereafter ineligible to serve {{in a position of}} public trust.|$|R
25|$|In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans ran on a {{platform}} that included fiscal responsibility drafted by then-Congressman Newt Gingrich called the Contract with America, which advocated such things as balancing the budget, providing the president with a <b>line-item</b> <b>veto,</b> and welfare reform. After the elections gave the Republicans {{a majority in the}} House of Representatives, newly minted Speaker of the House Gingrich pushed aggressively for reduced government spending, which created a confrontation with the White House that climaxed in the 1995–1996 government shutdown. After Clinton's re-election in 1996, they were able to cooperate and pass the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which lowered the top capital gains tax rate from 28% to 20% and the 15% rate to 10%.|$|E
500|$|The Assembly {{passed a}} {{biennial}} budget, {{but did not}} allow enough time in the session to reconvene and potentially override any of Fletcher's vetoes. In an attempt to avoid [...] "excessive debt", Fletcher used his <b>line-item</b> <b>veto</b> to trim $370 million in projects from the budget passed by the Assembly. Although falling far short of his initial prediction of vetoing $938 million, Fletcher used the <b>line-item</b> <b>veto</b> {{more than any other}} governor in state history. One project not vetoed by Fletcher was $11 million for the University of the Cumberlands to build a pharmacy school. LGBT rights groups had asked Fletcher to veto the funds because the university, a private Baptist school, had expelled a student for being openly gay.|$|E
500|$|In {{his sixth}} term in 2008, Ryan began {{introducing}} budget proposals {{as a member}} of the House, distinct from his contributions to budget proposals in his capacity as a member and later ranking member and chair of the House Budget Committee.

25|$|In February 2008, during Sebelius's {{second term}} in office, {{there was a}} report in the Wichita Eagle that the State of Kansas was {{suspending}} tax refunds and that, {{because of a lack of}} tax revenue, may not have been able to meet payroll for state employees. Sebelius called for issuing certificates of indebtedness, moving funds from various state agency accounts into the general fund to alleviate the crisis. However, Republican leaders in the legislature did not agree with her certificate of indebtedness plan, saying the state would be unable to repay the certificates unless Sebelius issued allotments or signed a budget rescission bill that had been passed by the legislature but had not yet been delivered to her desk. The standoff ended when the budget arrived, and Sebelius agreed to sign it, although she <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoed</b> several cuts she felt were too large. The rescission bill reduced the budget by about $300 million. $7 million of the cuts came in the form of reduced educational funding.|$|R
50|$|In this Legislature, all acts {{have been}} {{approved}} (signed) by Governor Mark Dayton, with the notable exceptions of H.F.

In Laws 2017, First Special Session chapter 4, the omnibus state government appropriations act, two appropriations for the Senate and the House of Representatives were <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoed.</b> Chapter 13, the reinsurance act, became law without the governor's signature.|$|R
500|$|That year, he vetoed two budgets {{that failed}} to include a voucher program and a {{government}} shutdown was threatened, but ultimately yielded to Democratic majorities {{in both houses of}} the New Mexico Legislature, who opposed the plan. Johnson signed the budget, but <b>line-item</b> <b>vetoed</b> a further $21million, or 0.5%, from the legislative plan. In 1999, Johnson became one of the highest-ranking elected officials in the US to advocate the legalization of marijuana. Saying the War on Drugs was [...] "an expensive bust", he advocated the decriminalization of marijuana use and concentration on harm-reduction measures for all other illegal drugs. He compared attempts to enforce the nation's drug laws with the failed attempt at alcohol prohibition. In remarks in 2011, he noted: [...] "Half of what government spends on police, courts and prisons is to deal with drug offenders." [...] He suggested that drug abuse be treated as a health issue, not as a criminal issue. His approach to the issue garnered supportive notice from conservative icon William F. Buckley, as well as the Cato Institute and Rolling Stone.|$|R
