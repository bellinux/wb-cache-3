[...] The cuts were usually made during whip pans or in scenes when the screen would go dark. With the exception of Mulder jumping off the Queen Anne, the only noticeable editing occurs between scenes, when a side swipe shifts between the two different time periods. Many of the takes needed to be nearly perfect; for example, of the takes made on the eighth day of filming, only two of ten were deemed satisfactory.|$|E

He {{found it difficult to}} adapt to the pace and physicality of the division, but impressed enough for Chester manager Steve Burr to extend his loan spell into {{until the end of the}} season. Lloyd returned for a second loan spell at Chester in August 2016. He scored his first goal in senior football on 27 August, in a 4-0 victory over Sutton United at the Deva Stadium. Just two days later he scored again in a 3-1 defeat to Woking at Kingfield Stadium. His performance in a 2-0 victory over Aldershot Town on 17 December was good enough to win him a place in the Non-League Team of the Week.

40|$|A land of plenty, or plenty in the land, asks Peter Mares in Griffith Review   DAYS ARE {{numbered}} for the Monday morning Mernda market. Last year, after operating {{for more}} than a century, the weekly livestock auction shut down. A few traders still sell live chicks, layer pullets and ducks from wire cages, and other signs of the market’s rural origins survive in stalls offering second-hand agricultural implements, bales of lucerne hay or boxes of locally grown red peppers. But the wooden saleyards are collapsing in disrepair, the corrugated roofing is decaying to rust and {{there is no longer any}} bidding on cattle, sheep or goats – the auction that originally gave people reason to gather each Monday at the rear of Mernda’s Bridge Inn Hotel (c. 1891). What remains is a scruffy trash-and-treasure market increasingly populated by professional traders retailing fruit and veg bought wholesale in the city, or the same toyshop junk and cheap Chinese socks found in a two-dollar shop. A few ruddy blokes in broad-brimmed hats perched at the plastic table next to the dim sim van cannot hide the fact that Mernda no longer belongs to the ring of countryside draped around Melbourne – it is being tucked firmly into the city’s mortgage belt. On the morning of my visit, just over the ridge line from the market three aquamarine excavators waved dinosaur necks, digging trenches for sewerage pipes, while a yellow bulldozer smoothed flat the land between ancient gums. The wooden skeletons of house frames stood like bleached bones against a thick grey sky. This is Renaissance Rise, one of several new housing estates being built in and around Mernda. Nearby are Woodland Waters (alliteration is big in real estate) and Mernda Villages. A woman who had driven down from Bright to sell chestnuts from a van told me that the muddy patch of land where the market is held had also been sold to developers. Traders had been warned, she said, that they will have to move on when work begins on the site. Mernda is about an hour’s drive from central Melbourne, north up the Plenty Valley. It is in one of the urban growth corridors extending out from the city like the fingers of a splayed hand. Soon after we passed La Trobe University and RMIT’s Bundoora campus, evidence of land sales and subdivisions appeared on the roadside in the form of banners, bunting and billboards. ‘More Nature’ promised one advertisement for Renaissance Rise. ‘More Open Space’ pledged the next. To underline the attractions of Mernda, both billboards were fringed at the base with tall, luxuriant fronds of fake green grass. Irony is not a characteristic of real estate promotion, but I had to wonder if a tongue was firmly in a cheek when the copywriter came up with the line on the next billboard: ‘Kiss the urban sprawl goodbye. ’ The new subdivisions deliver the opposite of a rural lifestyle. Messy paddocks have been converted into regulation-size plots. Tangled fences have given way to precise kerbing and Astroturf nature strips. The border markers of the estates are not rusty wire gates but monumental stone walls framing the entrance road. When I visited the display homes at Mernda Villages, I was acutely aware that Mernda will be anything but a village once all the sites are sold, the houses built and the homes occupied. The double-storey luxury-model residence had four bedrooms, three with ensuite bathrooms and walk-in robes of generous proportions. The kitchen presented acres of granite bench tops and dazzled with gleaming appliances; there was a breakfast bar and a formal dining area, four separate lounge rooms (‘living’, ‘family’, ‘leisure’ and ‘rumpus’), a study and a covered deck built around the shrine of an industrial-scale hooded barbeque. ‘Five-star resort living in a home that is pleasantly affordable and great for growing families,’ burbled a young man’s voice piped through every room. Construction costs on the two-storey model start at $ 286, 500. Throw in another $ 220, 000 for land and your dream home can be built to order in eighteen weeks for less than half a million dollars. Construction starts at $ 196, 000 for the more modest, single-storey residence, which still boasts multiple living areas, a master bedroom with ensuite and walk-in robe and double garage as standard. The building extends to the very edge of the block. There was a narrow strip of lawn and a palm-fringed garden bed in the display, but I could not help wondering where I would hang out the washing. Mernda Villages may promise ‘life surrounded by nature’, with ‘sustainably planned’ conservation zones, rain gardens and spacious parklands full of native trees and flora, but the future residents of Mernda Villages won’t be going to the Monday market to purchase young layers for a backyard chook shed. It is easy to be snide. Having entered the property market twenty years ago, my wife and I now live comfortably in a suburb within easy bike-riding distance of the city centre. There is not enough room for chooks, but we have space to hang out the washing and to grow basil and tomatoes in summer, broad beans in winter. We are well served by public transport (bus, tram and train) and it’s a short walk to parks, schools, shopping and good coffee. While not as spacious as the homes on display on Mernda, our house would once have accommodated a bigger tribe than our one-child family, and it has almost tripled in value since we bought it ten years ago. On paper we might be millionaires, but if we were trying to buy in the same suburb today we would be lucky to secure a one-bedroom apartment with parking for the same price as the most luxurious two-storey house and land package we looked at in Mernda. As we toured the display homes I asked myself where we would end up living if we were trying to buy our first home in the current market. A friendly salesman extolled the virtues of country life – though he admitted to living further west, in Sunbury, along another of Melbourne’s stretching suburban fingers. ‘It’s much safer than the inner-city,’ he said. ‘There is no crime, no theft, no need to lock your door. ’ (I refrained from asking him why all the display homes were equipped with burglar alarms.) The people moving to Mernda are not just young families and first home-buyers, he explained, but also empty-nesters cashing in the family home to move to something smaller, or seeking new pastures because established suburbs closer to the city, like Greensborough, are ‘getting a bit too built-up’. Marketing brochures promise that Mernda will soon have its own Village Centre with local shopping, making it ‘ideal for those seeking a convenient lifestyle without compromise’. A new Catholic primary school has been built, a state school and a childcare centre are under construction, and there is a secondary college just a few minutes’ drive away. There is no mention of public transport, though Mernda is included on two privately run bus routes. I asked my wife to drop me at the bus stop back near the Bridge Inn Hotel. Unfortunately I had just missed the 12. 32 pm to Greensborough. The next service was at 1. 13. As I sat at the shelter in front a billboard promising ‘elevated land with stunning views’, there was a steady rumble of trucks carrying construction materials and equipment to the new subdivisions. A lone council worker in a fluoro-orange jacket used tongs to collect butts from the grassy verges of Plenty Road. Eventually a young man in a black T-shirt joined me at the stop. He had just moved out from Greensborough, after buying land and building a house, and he was commuting to the city for only the second time. He hadn’t actually bought in Mernda, as planned, but a few kilometres east, towards Doreen. ‘What I didn’t realise is that we’ve ended up exactly halfway between two bus stops,’ he said. ‘It’s a fifteen-minute walk to the nearest stop, either way. ’ When I asked him why he bought there, he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was a bit simple. ‘It’s cheap,’ he replied. ‘We’re on a budget, mate. ’ He buried his head in some lecture notes. The Dyson’s bus arrived ten minutes late and carried us towards the city. The key stops are at shopping centres ringed by car parks: University Hill, Axis Homemaker Centre, Rivergum Village. After a half-hour journey we were deposited at Greensborough Station, just in time to miss the 1. 48 to Flinders Street. There was a fifteen-minute wait until the next train. As it pulled out of the station I stared through scratched glass at the leafy, undulating suburb, looking into sloping backyards, with lawns, shrubs, vegetable gardens, even the odd chook shed. I contemplated whether a move from Greensborough to Mernda might mean less open space, not more. I arrived at Flinders Street about two hours after being dropped off at the bus stop. My wife made the trip by car in less than half the time. No wonder there were hardly any passengers on the bus. Read the full text of Peter Mares essay at Griffith Review or Download the PD...|$|E
