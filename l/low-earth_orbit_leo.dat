One method is based on the drag perturbation equation of the semi-major axis and the temporal resolution of retrieved density could be 150  s for CHAMP satellite. Another method generates corrections to densities computed from a baseline density model through a Kalman filter orbit drag coefficient determination (KFOD) process and the temporal resolution of derived density could be as high as 30  s for CHAMP satellite. The densities estimated from these two methods are compared with densities obtained from accelerometer data of CHAMP satellite.

Aircraft icing conditions can be accurately diagnosed in near-real time (NRT) retrievals of cloud effective particle size, phase, and water path, providing valuable data for pilots. NRT retrievals of surface skin temperature can also be assimilated in numerical weather prediction models to provide more accurate representations of solar heating and longwave cooling at the surface, where convective initiation. These and other applications are being exploited more frequently as the value of NRT cloud data become recognized.

40|$|For {{satellites}} {{which are}} operated in <b>low-Earth</b> <b>orbits</b> (<b>LEO),</b> gravitational forces {{due to the}} non-uniform mass distribution of the Earth are dominating the orbit and at-titude perturbation spectra. Non-gravitational forces are mainly caused by momentum exchange with the space-craft surface, and they are mostly of second order. The most prominent of these forces originate from the interac-tion of the spacecraft surface with molecules and ions of the thermosphere, and from the impact of photons which come directly from the sun, which are reflected as albedo from the illuminated Earth hemisphere, or which are re-emitted by the whole Earth as delayed infra-red (IR) re-radiation. In contrast with gravitational perturbations, the aerodynamic and radiation pressure effects are difficult to model since they require a good knowledge of the space-craft geometry and surface properties, and they also re-quire reliable estimates of the molecule and photon par-ticle flux. The necessary models of the thermosphere, and of the Earth albedo and IR re-radiation distributions are depending on a large set of parameters, including the spacecraft location, the time, the season (sun position), and solar and geomagnetic activity levels. The variabil-ity of these environment models will be explained, and mathematical models will be described which allow to use the resulting molecule and photon flux models to com-pute perturbing forces and torques acting on a LEO satel-lite.

Full sounding capabilities with the GOES system is highly desirable because of the advantageous spatial and temporal coverage that is possible from GEO.

40|$|The new radio-occultation (RO) {{instrument}} on-board of {{the future}} EUMETSAT Polar System 2 nd Generation (EPS-SG) satellites, flying at 820 km height, is primarily focusing on neutral atmospheric profiling. It will {{provide an opportunity for}} ionospheric sounding as well, but only below impact heights of 500 km. This will leave a gap of 320 km without occultation measurements, which impedes the application of the direct inversion techniques to retrieve the electron density profile. The challenge of looking for new ways (accurate and simple) of extrapolating the electron density (also applicable to other future and past <b>Low-Earth</b> <b>Orbiting,</b> (<b>LEO),</b> radio-occultation missions like CHAMP) has motivated this research. In this paper we propose a new Vary-Chap Extrapolation Technique (VCET) of the electron density. VCET is based on the scale height behavior, linearly dependent on the altitude above hmF 2. This allows the electron density profile extrapolation for impact heights above its peak height (this is the case for EPS-SG), up to the satellite orbital height. VCET has been assessed with more than 3700 complete electron density profiles obtained in 4 representative scenarios of FORMOSAT- 3 /COSMIC occultations, in solar maximum and minimum conditions, and geomagnetically disturbed conditions, by applying an updated Improved Abel Transform Inversion technique to dual-frequency GPS measurements. It is shown that VCET performs much better than other classical Chapman models, with 60 % of occultations showing relative extrapolation errors below 20 %, in contrast with conventional Chapman model extrapolation approaches with 10 % or less of the profiles with relative error below 20 %.

Like its predecessor, ORDEM 2010 serves the ODPO mission of providing spacecraft designers/operators and debris observers with a publicly available model to calculate orbital debris flux by current-state-of-knowledge methods. The key advance in ORDEM 2010 is the input file structure of the yearly debris populations from 1995 - 2035 of sizes 10 micron - 1 m. These files include debris from <b>low-Earth</b> <b>orbits</b> (<b>LEO)</b> through geosynchronous <b>orbits</b> (GEO). Stable orbital elements (i. e., {{those that do not}} randomize on a sub-year timescale) are included in the files as are debris size, debris number, material density, random error and population error. Material density is implemented from ground-test data into the NASA breakup model and assigned to debris fragments accordingly. The random and population errors are due to machine error and uncertainties in debris sizes. These high-fidelity population files call for a much higher-level model analysis than what was possible with the populations of ORDEM 2000. Population analysis in the ORDEM 2010 model consists of mapping matrices that convert the debris population elements to debris fluxes. One output mode results in a spacecraft encompassing 3 -D igloo of debris flux, compartmentalized by debris size, velocity, pitch, and yaw with respect to spacecraft ram direction. The second output mode provides debris flux through an Earth-based telescope/radar beam from LEO through GEO.

40|$|Australia’s {{large extent}} and {{relatively}} low population density, {{as well as}} its range of climates, means that it is heavily dependent upon satellite observations to identify the extent and magnitude of climate change. This work examines three types of satellite missions that are used to assess different aspects of climate change. The first involves the use of radio occultation measurements based on signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) spacecraft made by <b>low-Earth</b> <b>orbiting</b> (<b>LEO)</b> satellites to identify changes in the height of the tropopause, a sensitive indicator of climate change owing to its response to temperature changes in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. The second deals with rainfall over Australia, as measured by the Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM), in conjunction with other satellite- and ground-based observations. Such observations are invaluable, given the scarcity of ground-based observations over vast areas of Australia. While a comparison between the TRMM product and existing ground-based data is very good, {{there appears to be a}} decrease in the correlation between datasets, the reason for which is still being investigated. Finally, we examine the state of terrestrial water storage over Australia as determined from variations in the regional gravity field as measured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin-satellite mission. The loss of substantial volumes of ground water from the Murray-Darling River Basin in the southeast corner of the continent is very apparent, as is an increase over the northern parts of the country. Together, such satellite missions provide a continental-scale picture of climate change over Australia, with temperature and rainfall variations, as well as water resources, able to be monitored, providing valuable information to natural resource managers and climate modellers who endeavour to predict future changes...|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 ’s {{three large}} and {{relatively}} expensive constellations of small to medium sized communication satellites flying in <b>Low-Earth</b> <b>Orbits</b> (<b>LEO)</b> were deployed, namely Orbcomm, Iridium, and Globalstar. The experience of building {{one of these}} constellations of “little-LEOs”, Orbcomm, was captured in the book “Silicon Sky”. Although these systems addressed existing and new niche markets compared to terrestrial or GEO communications, the business cases for Orbcomm, Iridium and GlobalStar were not achieved. Indeed, due to the very large infrastructure costs of setting up the space segment, all three initial systems failed commercially. Technically, however, all three systems were a success and all three continue to operate, with satellite performance and longevity generally being better than the original specifications. The service they provide also demonstrates a real need, after commercial actions allowed offsetting the initial debts, such as bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of US Law, or asset buyout, or government involvement. Thus, it is assumed that, if the costs or {{the value of the}} constellation deployment can be reduced significantly, “LEO Comms” does have a business case. Given these systems were launched in the 1900 ’s, all three systems need to replenish their satellites {{in the next few years}} if they are to continue providing services or upgrading them. Indeed, in 2006 both Orbcomm and GlobalStar initiated procurements leading to the replenishment of their constellations. This paper analyses what has changed in the last 15 years to enable the replenished systems to be delivered at much lower cost than the original systems allowing updated business cases to be profitable for the owners. The paper will also look at areas where there has been little change and analyse why this should be the case. It will also perform a parametric market analysis to support the technical trade-offs.

40|$|MCAT (Meter-Class Autonomous Telescope) is a 1. 3 m f/ 4 Ritchey-Chr tien on {{a double}} {{horseshoe}} equatorial mount {{that will be}} deployed in early 2011 to the western pacific island of Legan in the Kwajalein Atoll to perform orbital debris observations. MCAT will be capable of tracking earth orbital objects at all inclinations and at altitudes from 200 km to geosynchronous. MCAT s primary objective is the detection of new orbital debris in both low-inclination <b>low-earth</b> <b>orbits</b> (<b>LEO)</b> and at geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO). MCAT was thus designed with a fast focal ratio and a large unvignetted image circle able to accommodate a detector sized to yield a large field of view. The selected primary detector is a close-cycle cooled 4 Kx 4 K 15 um pixel CCD camera that yields a 0. 9 degree diagonal field. For orbital debris detection in widely spaced angular rate regimes, the camera must offer low read-noise performance {{over a wide range}} of framing rates. MCAT s 4 -port camera operates from 100 kHz to 1. 5 MHz per port at 2 e- and 10 e- read noise respectively. This enables low-noise multi-second exposures for GEO observations as well as rapid (several frames per second) exposures for LEO. GEO observations will be performed using a counter-sidereal time delay integration (TDI) technique which NASA has used successfully in the past. For MCAT the GEO survey, detection, and follow-up prediction algorithms will be automated. These algorithms will be detailed herein. For LEO observations two methods will be employed. The first, Orbit Survey Mode (OSM), will scan specific orbital inclination and altitude regimes, detect new orbital debris objects against trailed background stars, and adjust the telescope track to follow the detected object. The second, Stare and Chase Mode (SCM), will perform a stare, then detect and track objects that enter the field of view which satisfy specific rate and brightness criteria.

40|$|Aims: Knowledge of {{properties}} of the Earth’s upper atmosphere is important for predicting the lifetime of low-orbit spacecraft {{as well as for}} planning operation of space instruments whose data may be distorted by atmospheric effects. The accuracy of the models commonly used for simulating the structure of the atmosphere is limited by the scarcity of the observations they are based on, so improvement of these models requires validation under different atmospheric conditions. Measurements of the absorption of the solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation in the upper atmosphere below 500  km by instruments operating on <b>low-Earth</b> <b>orbits</b> (<b>LEO)</b> satellites provide efficient means for such validation as well as for continuous monitoring of the upper atmosphere and for studying its response to the solar and geomagnetic activity. 				 					Method: This paper presents results of measurements of the solar EUV radiation in the 17  nm wavelength band made with the SPIRIT and TESIS telescopes on board the CORONAS satellites and the SWAP telescope on board the PROBA 2 satellite in the occulted parts of the satellite orbits. The transmittance profiles of the atmosphere at altitudes between 150 and 500  km were derived from different phases of solar activity during solar cycles 23 and 24 in the quiet state of the magnetosphere and during the development of a geomagnetic storm. We developed a mathematical procedure based on the Tikhonov regularization method for solution of ill-posed problems in order to retrieve extinction coefficients from the transmittance profiles. The transmittance profiles derived from the data and the retrieved extinction coefficients are compared with simulations carried out with the NRLMSISE- 00 atmosphere model maintained by Naval Research Laboratory (USA) and the DTM- 2013 model developed at CNES in the framework of the FP 7 project ATMOP. 				 					Results: Under quiet and slightly disturbed magnetospheric conditions during high and low solar activity the extinction coefficients calculated by both models agreed with the measurements within the data errors.

40|$|Spaceborne {{high-end}} geodetic-type dual-frequency Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers {{have become}} an enabling technology for contemporary earth observation missions in <b>Low-Earth</b> <b>Orbits</b> (<b>LEO).</b> Such receivers deliver measurements for space vehicle Precise Orbit Determination (POD) with position accuracy of a few centimeters to geo-locate the measurements taken by other sensors. Roughly speaking, the more precise an earth-observation instrument, the more accurate its position must be determined {{in order to be}} able to produce accurate measurement maps. In addition, real-time positioning, accurate within tens of meters - a byproduct of POD-receivers - performed for internal purposes, readily supports the Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS) of the host Spacecraft (S/C). While the notion of recurrence and off-the-shelf availability is reflected in customer price and delivery schedule expectations, POD-receivers are typically procured according to mission specifications concerning performance under a broad range of boundary conditions. This is due to the fact that knowledge concerning important issues like antenna accommodation, maneuvers and on-board interference environment only gradually evolve during the course of the mission design and that the space environment is always good for a surprise. Consequently, accurate performance prediction techniques are of paramount importance to avoid disappointment on the one hand and over-specification on the other. In the present paper we place emphasis on the verification component of our spaceborne GNSS-receiver product platform which we routinely apply for product end-to-end testing, design validation and systems engineering purposes. The latter goes far beyond the level of usual feasibility studies in that in-orbit measurement data can be analyzed and fed back into the design process for optimizing both receivers and verification platform. After a brief introduction of our spaceborne GNSS-receivers and the ground test- and system-in-the loop simulation environment, we present results of the evaluation of initial in-orbit measurements provided by the three SWARM GPS receivers during the commissioning phase which widely overlapped with a period of increased solar activity, resembling a stress case for a high precision dual-frequency POD receiver. Our analyses concern carrier-, code-phase, signal-to-noise ratio, real-time positioning as well as POD and show that the receivers work very well within their specifications due to considerate design margins but they also reveal subtle differences between real space conditions and models typically used for system simulation and GNSS satellite simulator based ground testing...|$|R
