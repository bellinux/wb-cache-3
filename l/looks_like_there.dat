Even now, not two hours after watching him play the lead role in Inside Men, I can scarcely remember what he <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> <b>There</b> is something about his neat features and office-worker pallor that makes Mackintosh both vaguely familiar and instantly forgettable.

5000|$|SBCADD is {{included}} as a secondary target condition in most newborn screening programs, as the key analyte {{is the same as}} is used to identify isovaleric acidemia.

[...] Currently, there is no accepted treatment, as most affected individuals do not require any. Some recommend avoidance of valproic acid, as it can be a substrate for 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase.|$|E
50|$|Culturally {{responsive}} {{classroom management}} (CRCM) is {{an approach to}} running classrooms with all children simply for racial/ethnic minority children in a culturally responsive way. More than a set of strategies or practices, CRCM is a pedagogical approach that guides the management decisions that teachers make. It is {{a natural extension of}} culturally responsive teaching, which uses students' backgrounds, rendering of social experiences, prior knowledge, and learning styles in daily lessons. Teachers, as culturally responsive classroom managers, recognize their biasesand values and reflect on how these influence their expectations for behavior and their interactions with students as well as what learning <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> <b>There</b> is extensive research on traditional classroom management and a myriad of resources available {{on how to deal with}} behavior issues. Conversely, there is little research on CRCM, despite the fact that teachers who lack cultural competence often experience problems in this area.|$|E

Aspects of her character that come naturally {{with a young}} teenager who enters puberty, and a great plot device since her repeated stubbornness and inobedience {{is the source of}} many an adventure. Since her emotions and human shortcomings often overpower her rationality, she is sensitive to paranormal and mystical happenings that are routinely dismissed by the others. Her relationship with Spike (both are considered orphans) is mostly one between siblings, although at times it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> are more feelings under the surface, as she can get quite jealous and querulous when Spike gets female attention. Suzy is also a brave girl, {{especially when it comes to}} defending her doll Muffin, for whom she shows unconditional motherly love. Despite her difficult character at times, she appears contrite and righteous. She carries her heart in the right place and won't hesitate to battle injustice.|$|E
2500|$|In 1775 the British first ventured toward Long Island at Fort Pond Bay at Montauk {{during the}} Siege of Boston.

50|$|In Bisei one {{can visit}} the famous astronomical observatory, known as Bisei Tenmondai, as well as Chuusei Yume-ga-Hara, a sort of themepark devoted to showing what a typical Medieval Japanese {{mountain}} village <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> <b>There</b> you can enjoy making traditional crafts such as indigo dying, Shakuhachi (Japanese flute), and various children's games.

Since that point Ozz {{took control of the}} rest of the Dark Family to remake that stable from the rubble that was La Secta.|$|R
