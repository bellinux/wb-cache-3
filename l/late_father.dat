5|$|The British favoured the {{prospect}} of the Temenggong in taking over the administration of Johor from the Sultan.

At that time, Johor came under the effective charge of the Temenggong's <b>late</b> <b>father,</b> Abdul Rahman, as with Pahang, which was under the control of the Bendahara. Further documents revealed that if Johor were to be under the control of a monarch, de jure sovereignty would have been laid under the charge of the Sultan of Lingga, Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah and not with Sultan Ali.|$|E

She proposed an alliance, something which she had refused to do when offered one by Feodor's father, but was turned down.|$|E
