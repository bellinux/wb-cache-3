40|$|We {{examine the}} ability of {{selected}} accounting and audit quality variables measured in a period prior to the financial crisis (i. e., the four quarters of 2006), to predict banks that subsequently failed during the financial crisis. We employ two sets of samples from the US: a troubled banks sample that includes banks that failed in or after 2007 as well as banks classified as being troubled based on profitability, loan quality, and balance sheet position in 2007, and a full sample that includes all banks with available required data. Using the troubled banks sample, we identify six reliable predictors of bank failure: auditor type, auditor industry specialization, Tier 1 capital ratio, proportion of securitized loans, growth in loans, and <b>loan</b> <b>mix.</b> For the larger full sample of banks, we identify the following ten predictors of bank failure: auditor type, Tier 1 capital ratio, proportion of securitized loans, nonperforming loans, loan loss provisions, growth in commercial loans, growth in real estate loans, growth in overall loans, <b>loan</b> <b>mix,</b> and whether the bank is a public bank.

40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{empirical}} tests for financial protectionism, {{defined as a}} nationalistic change in banks' lending behaviour, {{as the result of}} public intervention, which leads domestic banks either to lend less or at higher interest rates to foreigners. We use a bank-level panel data set spanning all British and foreign banks providing loans within the United Kingdom between 1997 Q 3 and 2010 Q 1. During this time, a number of banks were nationalised, privatised, given unusual access to loan or credit guarantees, or received capital injections. We use standard empirical panel-data techniques to study the 'loan mix', domestic (British) loans of a bank expressed as a fraction of its total loan activity. We also study effective short-term interset rates, though our data set here is much smaller. We examine the <b>loan</b> <b>mix</b> for both British and foreign banks, both before and after unusual public interventions such as nationalisations and public capital injections. We find strong evidence of financial protectionism. After nationalisations, foreign banks reduced the fraction of loans going to the United Kingdom by around 11 precentage points and increased their effective interest rates by about 70 basis points. By way of contrast, nationalised British banks did not significantly change either their <b>loan</b> <b>mix</b> or effect interest rates. Succinctly, foreign nationalised banks seem to have engaged in financial protectionism, while British nationalised banks have not.

40|$|During {{the crisis}} of 2008 - 09, many {{countries}} engaged in bank nationalizations and other large public interventions in the financial sector.

To understand {{the extent to which}} emerging Australia entities were impacted by these extreme events as compared to established entities, this paper compares entities comprising the Emerging Markets Index (EMCOX) to established entities comprising the S 2 ̆ 6 P/ASX 200 Index using four risk metrics.

We apply these measures both prior to and during the GFC, and find that Emerging Market shares show higher risk for all metrics used, the spread between the emerging and established portfolios narrows during the GFC period and that the default risk spread between the two portfolios is greatest in the tail of the distribution.

40|$|The Indonesian {{market is}} a {{critical}} market to the South East Asian region, being that region’s largest economy. The primary sectors of the Indonesian economy, incorporating Agriculture and Mining, are of critical importance to the country, representing approximately one quarter of GDP and providing nearly 40 % of the nation’s employment. Mining and Agriculture stock returns significantly outperformed the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) composite index {{in the five years}} leading up to Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and experienced savage falls during the GFC. Against this background, we examine the market and credit risk of these sectors during the pre-GFC, GFC and post-GFC periods. Market risk is measured using Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). VaR is a popular metric which measures potential losses over a specific time period, up to a selected threshold. A key downside of this metric is that it says nothing of the extreme risk beyond VaR, which is a major limitation for this study, given the extreme volatility experienced by the primary sectors in Indonesia over the studied period. We therefore also use CVaR, which measures the extreme risk beyond VaR. For credit risk, we use the Merton-KMV Distance to Default (DD) metric, as well as our own Conditional DD (CDD) metric to measure extreme default risk. The key advantage that the Merton-KMV model has over other credit models, it that it incorporates fluctuating asset values. This makes it more responsive to changes in market conditions than most other credit models which remain static between rating periods. The importance of fluctuating asset values in measuring credit risk has been raised by the Bank of England (2008), who make makes the point that not only do asset values fall in times of uncertainty, but rising probabilities of default make it more likely that assets will have to be liquidated at market values. Similar to VaR, the Merton-KMV model has deficiencies in that it uses the standard deviation of asset value fluctuations, which tends to smooth the volatility and does not capture tail risk over that period. Our CDD model is able to measure risk at the most extreme times of the economic cycle, which is precisely when firms are most likely to fail, and when banks are most likely to experience high credit losses. We find that market risk for the primary industries is significantly higher than the broader market, {{and that there is a}} relatively higher difference between VaR and CVaR, indicating a higher tail risk. Mining, in particular has a higher market risk than other Indonesian sectors. Interestingly, this is not the case with credit risk, where the risk for Agriculture is lower than the overall market, and the risk for Mining is not significantly different to the overall market. This is because the leverage of a firm is a key component of the Merton-KMV model and we find the leverage for the Agriculture and Mining industries to be far more conservative than the broader market. This means that these primary sectors are able to withstand relatively higher levels of asset volatility. These findings can benefit both lenders and investors when considering the inclusion of these sectors in their investment or <b>loan</b> portfolio <b>mix...</b>|$|R
