40|$|Purpose It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that, if pedagogical and learning theories are integrated into <b>lesson</b> <b>and</b> learning study, a systematic construction of pedagogical knowledge is possible (Elliott, 2012). In this Special Issue, it is reported how theory and theoretical concepts can add value to <b>lesson</b> <b>and</b> learning study. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to introduce the Special Issue and explore the above concepts. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents the Special Issue papers thematically and the main issues are discussed. Findings Together the papers suggest that pedagogical theories and theorizing practice may contribute to the improvement of teachers’ practical knowledge and knowledge about teachers’ professional tasks and objects. Furthermore, some theories and theoretical concepts hitherto under-exploited in <b>lesson</b> <b>and</b> learning study are presented and discussed from the point of view how these might improve the quality of the studies. Originality/value As a total, this collection of papers bring out issues about the role of pedagogical and learning theories and how these could inform <b>lesson</b> <b>and</b> learning study...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discern and discuss links and {{connections}} between the ideas and insights contained in the articles published in Issue 6. 2, in a way which portrays the key features of lesson study in an international context, its conceptual relationship with the ideas of Lawrence Stenhouse, and its analytic potential to effect pedagogical transformation in a global context. Design/methodology/approach: To create a basis for a fruitful discussion about the critical features of <b>Lesson</b> <b>and</b> Learning Studies as it globalises between readers and the authors of the eight texts published, three of which are authored by practicing school teachers. Findings: The author pinpoints four critical implementation issues that should provide a focus for further deliberation about how to realise the potential of <b>lesson</b> <b>and</b> learning studies for improving the quality of teaching and learning in educational institutions. These are: developing methods of analysis that disrupt and challenge the cultural scripts that shape teaching and learning in educational institutions; developing conditions and support systems that enable teachers not only to develop their practice through <b>lesson</b> <b>and</b> learning study, but also to participate in the development of theories that can powerfully inform such study; creating sustainable programmes of high-quality <b>lesson</b> <b>and</b> learning studies in educational institutions when they may stand in a state of tension with the prevailing organisational culture; and exploring the potential of creative methodological mixes, using both qualitative and quantitative research methods, for improving the quality of teaching <b>and</b> learning through <b>lesson</b> <b>and</b> learning study. Originality/value: This editorial review provides a criterial framework for evaluating the quality of programmes of <b>lesson</b> <b>and</b> learning studies in educational institutions...|$|R
