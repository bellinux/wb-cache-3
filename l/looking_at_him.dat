5|$|In the Book of Esther it {{is related}} that Haman, a public servant, plots to get Esther's husband, the King of Persia, to slay all the Jewish {{people in his}} land. The King, who is going over his books during a sleepless night, realises {{something}} is amiss. Esther, discovering the plot, denounces Haman, and her husband orders his execution on a scaffold he has built. The King's eunuchs promptly carry this out. Michelangelo shows Haman crucified with Esther <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> from a doorway, the King giving orders in the background.|$|E
5|$|Skinner {{sees the}} old woman <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> on a city street. However, when he pursues {{the old woman}}, he instead finds Sharon. The agents talk to Sharon, who says that the {{marriage}} failed because of Skinner's emotional distance. Scully learns that Skinner had been receiving treatment for a sleep disorder, in which he apparently had dreams about being suffocated in bed by an old woman. She fears that Skinner may have unwittingly killed Sayles in his sleep. However, Mulder believes that Skinner may be having visions of a succubus, a female demon, with the mention of similar symptoms of people's bad dreams they've experienced.|$|E
5|$|Once in Nightopia, they {{discover}} and release Nights, who tells them about dreams and Wizeman and his plans; the three begin {{a journey to}} stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia. When they defeat Wizeman and Reala, peace is returned to Nightopia {{and the world of}} Nightmare is suppressed. The next day, back in Twin Seeds, a centenary ceremony begins. Elliot is seen walking through the parade until he has a vision of Nights <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> through a billboard. Realizing that Claris is performing in a hall, Elliot runs through the crowd and sees Claris on stage in front of a large audience, singing well. The two look at each other, and are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia, which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real or just a dream.|$|E

60|$|The woman <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadfastly, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{as though}} she had come into contact with some strange creature.|$|R
60|$|The {{silence of}} that minute was horrible to Undy, {{and yet he}} could hardly bring himself to break it. The judge <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with eyes which seemed to read his inmost soul; the jury <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> condemning him one and all; Alaric <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with fierce, glaring eyes of hatred, the same eyes that had glared <b>at</b> <b>him</b> that night {{when he had been}} {{collared}} in the street; the whole crowd <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> derisively; but the eyes of them all were as nothing to the eyes of Mr. Chaffanbrass.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2005–06 season, Sevilla were {{reported}} to be interested in Samaras as a replacement for Júlio Baptista. While Arsenal were also <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> after they had missed out on signing Baptista, some news organisations had reported that Arsenal had already signed Samaras and that he would join {{at the end of the}} season. However, the player's father, Ioannis Samaras said that this was untrue and that his son wanted to stay at the club for another year. Samaras scored on the opening day of the season, on 20 August, when he helped Heerenveen to a 5–4 victory over Roda JC. He picked up a minor leg injury in September, which ruled him out of Heerenveen's UEFA Cup tie against Baník Ostrava. But he returned to action on 23 September, and scored as Heerenveen beat NEC Nijmegen 2–1. On 14 December, Samaras scored as Heerenveen came back from behind to beat Levski Sofia 2–1 in the UEFA Cup. On 30 December, Samaras scored twice as Heerenveen beat Ajax 4–2. In January 2006, Arsenal and Manchester City showed interest in signing the striker. Samaras tried to get released from his contract after Heerenveen had rejected a bid from Manchester City. However, the Dutch arbitration commission ruled that he had no grounds to end his contract. Samaras scored 25 goals in 88 appearances for Heerenveen.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E
25|$|Locke's {{ideology}} and leadership even had impact in Europe. In France, people were <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> like {{a figure that}} brought the black population together in the racist era that America was facing at the time. They compared that movement to how the Jewish population in Europe was staying tight together, especially after World War II.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> quizzically for a moment, {{as she had}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> often {{since he}} had gone to work for Feinheimer.|$|R

5000|$|... "This dog, he {{was saying}} to himself, was the apple of Irwin Botts' eye. It was also the apple of Ponsford Botts' eye. To seek it out and kick it in the slats, therefore, would be to shoot that system of his to pieces beyond repair. Irwin Botts would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> askance. Ponsford Botts would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> askance. And if they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> askance, Vera Witherby would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> askance, too, for they were presumably the apples of her eye, just as Alfonse was the apple of theirs.|$|R
25|$|As the new king, Wiglaf gives Beowulf a Norse funeral. Grendel's mother appears {{and gives}} Beowulf a final kiss before his burning ship sinks into the sea. Wiglaf sees the golden horn washed by {{the waves of}} the sea in the sand while Grendel's mother floats in the sea, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> seductively. The movie ends ambiguously with Wiglaf holding the horn and staring back at her, leaving his fate unknown.|$|E
25|$|On September 17, 2012, a {{man from}} the Republic of Kiribati was rescued after being at sea for 105 days. The man said that a shark swam around the boat and took it off in a direction. He {{followed}} it and as he followed it with his eyes he looked up and there was the stern of a purse seiner with a bunch of crewmen with binoculars <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of a road in Paris and Adele is seen walking on it alone. She {{continues}} to walk and starts singing the song with a sad look as the camera makes circles and shots more locations in Paris including the Eiffel Tower. During the second chorus, Adele stops singing and pauses on the Pont Alexandre III {{to look over the}} Seine. She continues walking through the deserted streets during the bridge before finally entering a building in which she sees her ex-lover. After seeing her, he starts to walk away and several shots of Adele <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> follow.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jarvis <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> coldly. He {{continued}} to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> coldly. His lower jaw began slowly to protrude, and his forehead retreated further behind its zareba of forelock.|$|R

6000|$|The Hermit <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> irresolutely, {{and retired}} to his soot and cinders and lay down, {{and got up}} again {{and came to the}} bars, and again <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> irresolutely, and finally said with sharpness: [...] "I don't like tobacco." ...|$|R
25|$|Jojo and Sadie, {{who have}} reconciled, {{put on a}} rooftop concert, with Prudence {{as a member of}} their band ("Don't Let Me Down"). Max brings Jude to the rooftop, but the police arrive to break up the concert, while Lucy nearly joins, but can't bring herself to face Jude again. Jude manages to remain on the roof and begins to sing ("All You Need Is Love"). The police allow the band to {{accompany}} him, while Lucy tries {{to get back to the}} building, but is blocked by the police. Max draws Jude's attention to an opposite rooftop where Lucy is standing and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Lucy and Jude gaze smilingly at each other across opposite rooftops as the performance concludes ("Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds").|$|E
500|$|Patrick Lefevere, the Etixx-Quick Step team manager, {{afterwards}} {{described the}} team's [...] "bad luck" [...] throughout the race, which included crashes for Cavendish and Martin Velits and punctures for Terpstra and Štybar. Lefevere {{pointed to the}} absence of Tom Boonen as a reason for his riders' nervousness. Geraint Thomas felt that the other riders had been <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in particular to chase Paolini because of his win in the E3 Harelbeke; he said that he [...] "didn't have much left" [...] in the sprint {{at the end of the}} race.|$|E
500|$|The film alludes {{several times}} to actual incidents, {{including}} a scene where Bhandarkar appears at a fashion show to research his upcoming film on the fashion industry. One of the models <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> says, [...] "Oh that's Madhur Bhandarkar, the realistic filmmaker. Now {{he is going to}} expose the fashion world." [...] It is taken from the Bhandarkar's experiences while researching the subjects of his films. The Indian Express said that Chopra's character, who indulges in drug and alcohol abuse and undergoes rehabilitation, resembles the life of British-educated model Shivani Kapur, who had similar experiences. The scene in which Ranaut's character's top slips off during a ramp walk resembles the experience of Carol Gracias at the 2006 Lakme Fashion Week.|$|E
60|$|His mother <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He had {{forgotten}} Miriam now. He {{told her about}} the girls in the Willow Tree. Mrs. Morel <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> It seemed unreal, his gaiety. At the back of it was too much horror and misery.|$|R
60|$|Very remarkably, Riderhood put no {{question}} to <b>him.</b> He had <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> on opening the door, {{and he now}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again (stealthily this time), {{and the result of}} his looking was, that he asked him {{no question}}.|$|R
60|$|Berry {{stopped a}} moment and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Lemuel. The art-students did not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> all; they passed on upstairs with Berry.|$|R
500|$|While {{waiting in}} the green room, Larson met Ed Long, a Baptist {{minister}} from California booked for the third episode of the session. They struck up a conversation. Long recalled that Larson asked {{how many times he}} had seen the show. When Long replied he had seen it only once, Larson responded by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as though he [...] "were from another planet." [...] Larson told Long, [...] "I really hope we don't have to play each other" [...] before leaving the green room, but they would in fact face off as Long won his match and a total of $11,516 in cash and prizes. The two men competed against Janie Litras, a dental assistant, in the next episode of the session.|$|E
500|$|... "The War of the Simpsons" [...] is {{the twentieth}} episode of The Simpsons second season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on May 2, 1991. In the episode, Homer gets drunk at a party and embarrasses his wife Marge, so she decides to sign them up for a marriage counseling retreat. Homer finds out that the retreat will be held near a lake and packs his fishing equipment, despite Marge telling him that all they will be doing is resolving their differences. At the lake the next morning, Homer tries to sneak away to go fishing, but Marge catches him and he takes a walk instead. On the dock, Homer grabs hold of a fishing pole only to be yanked onto a small rowboat by the fish. When he notices an upset Marge is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> he immediately lets the fish go to prove his love for her.|$|E
500|$|Fonville noted at {{the time}} that, in his opinion, speed was more {{essential}} than beef and weight in the shot put. Speaking about his technique, Fonville said, [...] "You concentrateand then you just try to explode across the circle." [...] His coach, Ken Doherty, described Fonville as [...] "one of the hardest working, most studious athletes" [...] he had ever coached. Doherty also added that Fonville's technique distinguished him from most shot putters: [...] "Fonville drives completely across the ring in one continuous motion. Previously, most shotputters made their initial hop and hesitated before their final drive. ... Any track coach <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> would recognize all the points of good form. The {{only difference is that}} he has unusual speed and quicknessand he is the greatest competitor I've ever coached." [...] One columnist described Fonville's steady improvement from his freshman year in 1946 through his junior year in 1948 and concluded: [...] "Small as shot-putters go, Fonville is the greatest in the long history of sensational [...] heavers." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Pinnegar <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{and did not}} speak. In {{that moment}} all the anger which was due to him from all womanhood was silently {{discharged}} <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> like a black bolt of silent electricity. But Miss Pinnegar, the engine of wrath, felt she would burst.|$|R
60|$|Courthon <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as {{he might}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> an impertinent lackey.|$|R

500|$|I {{can only}} {{remember}} {{bits and pieces}} of the game. I was psyched. I had a feeling of euphoria. I was zeroed in on the [...] glove, but I didn't hit the glove too much. I remember hitting a couple of batters, and the bases were loaded two or three times. The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn't. Sometimes, I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. I started having a crazy idea in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire, and once I thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was holding a guitar and swinging it over the plate. They say I had about three to four fielding chances. I remember diving {{out of the way of}} a ball I thought was a line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn't hit hard and never reached me.|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} a train journey in Japan that Abbe first met Ueshiba. Abbe didn't {{know who he}} was and he reacted to Ueshiba <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> saying: [...] "What are you staring at, old man?" [...] Ueshiba replied: [...] "I know who you are," [...] to which Abbe {{modestly}} retorted: [...] "Everyone knows me, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Champion of All Japan." [...] Ueshiba then introduced himself as the Founder of Aikido, and was told by Abbe that he didn't look strong enough to be a martial arts master. Ueshiba then offered Abbe his little finger, and said: [...] "But young man, you look very strong indeed. Please break my finger." [...] Abbe at first declined, but eventually accepted the challenge, presumably to shut the old man up. Abbe claimed that, as he took hold of the old man's finger and tried to break it, he found himself {{on the floor of the}} carriage and totally immobilised. Whilst on the floor Abbe asked Ueshiba for permission to study under him.|$|E
500|$|During the Utopia storyline, the X-Men {{leave their}} San Francisco base and {{establish}} the island [...] "Utopia" [...] for mutants on {{the remains of}} Asteroid M. [...] The anthology series [...] explores the characters' reactions to this relocation, with Anole featuring in his own story, [...] "Big Boy Pants". [...] The story depicts Cannonball teaching the younger X-Men how to farm their own crops, but Anole argues {{that it is a}} waste of time since they could just buy their food from a store. [...] He looks to Magik for agreement, but she responds by teleporting him to Limbo for five days without food or water. [...] Eventually she returns to bring him water, and Anole tells her that he learned his lesson: without their own food supply, the mutant race could die. [...] Magik informs him that this was not a lesson and that she merely sent him to Limbo because she was sick of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> [...] She returns them both to Utopia and Anole resumes farming, too afraid of Magik to tell anyone what happened. He is almost killed by the mutant Sack, who wanted his own corner of Utopia.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Brisk enough, sir!' replied John, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{the place}} where the horse had been, as if not yet {{understanding}} quite, what had become of him. 'He melts, I think.
