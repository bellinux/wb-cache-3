25|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} about the neurological basis of dreaming. This includes the activation synthesis theory—the theory that dreams result from brain stem activation during REM sleep; the continual activation theory—the theory that dreaming {{is a result of}} activation and synthesis but dreams and REM sleep are controlled by different structures in the brain; and dreams as excitations of long term memory—a theory which claims that <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> excitations are prevalent during waking hours as well but are usually controlled and become apparent only during sleep.|$|E
25|$|Consistent with hemispheric lateralization, {{there is}} {{evidence}} to suggest that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are responsible for different components of musical memory. By studying the learning curves of patients who have had damage to either their left or right medial temporal lobes, Wilson & Saling (2008) found hemispheric differences in the contributions of the left and right medial temporal lobes in melodic memory. Ayotte, Peretz, Rousseau, Bard & Bojanowski (2000) found that those patients who had their left middle cerebral artery cut in response to an aneurysm suffered greater impairments when performing tasks of musical <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory,</b> than those patients who had their right middle cerebral artery cut. Thus, they concluded that the left hemisphere is mainly important for musical representation in <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory,</b> whereas the right is needed primarily to mediate access to this memory. Sampson and Zatorre (1991) studied patients with severe epilepsy who underwent surgery for relief as well as control subjects. They found deficits in memory recognition for text regardless of whether it was sung or spoken after a left, but not right temporal lobectomy. However, melody recognition when a tune was sung with new words (as compared to encoding) was impaired after either right or left temporal lobectomy. Finally, after a right but not left temporal lobectomy, impairments of melody recognition occurred in the absence of lyrics. This suggests dual memory codes for musical memory, with the verbal code utilizing the left temporal lobe structures and the melodic relying on the encoding involved.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{is one of}} {{the brain}} structures located within the medial temporal lobe and {{is considered one of the}} main structures of the brain associated with eyewitness testimony because it is the area that is important for the formation of <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memories.</b> Declarative <b>memories</b> are <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memories</b> that can be consciously remembered, which include: specific events and factual knowledge. Eyewitnesses use declarative memories, specifically episodic memory when they are asked to recall specific events that took place in the past.

As per her request, Anna was awoken {{at the same time as}} her sister, though she was unaffected by Ogre's influence. Nina also began to suffer ill effects from the 'cold-sleep', resulting in <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> loss. In an act of compassion, Anna set out to stop Nina from once again becoming an assassin, and to help her recover her memory loss. However, she failed at the end of the tournament when Nina recovered her memory about her rivalry with Anna, which resulted in Nina leaving and cutting all contact with Anna.|$|E
25|$|The hippocampal neocortical dialog {{refers to}} the very {{structured}} interactions during SWS between groups of neurons called ensembles in the hippocampus and neocortex. Sharp wave patterns (SPW) dominate the hippocampus during SWS and neuron populations in the hippocampus participate in organized bursts during this phase. This is done in synchrony with state changes in the cortex (DOWN/UP state) and coordinated by the slow oscillations in cortex. These observations, coupled {{with the knowledge that}} the hippocampus plays a role in short to medium term memory whereas the cortex plays a role in <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory,</b> have led to the hypothesis that the hippocampal neocortical dialog might be a mechanism through which the hippocampus transfers information to the cortex. Thus, the hippocampal neocortical dialog is said {{to play a role in}} memory consolidation.|$|E
25|$|A savant {{syndrome}} {{is described as}} a person with a low IQ but who has superior performance in one particular field. Sloboda, Hermelin and O'Connor (1985) discussed a patient, NP, who was able to memorize very complex musical pieces after hearing them three or four times. NP's performance exceeded that of experts with very high IQs. However, his performance on other memory tasks was average for a person with an IQ in his range. They used NP to suggest that high IQ is not needed for the skill of musical memorization and in fact, other factors must be influencing this performance. Miller (1987) also studied a 7 year old child who was said to be a musical savant. This child had superior short term memory for music that was found to be influenced by the attention given to the complexity of the music, the key signature, and repeated configurations within a string. Miller (1987) suggests that a savant's ability is due to encoding the information into already existing meaningful structures in <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E

25|$|Building on {{the wide}} {{understanding}} of culture brought about by cultural anthropology, archeology and biology, Mosterín has developed a new philosophical understanding of what culture is, where it is localized and how it evolves in time. Human nature is information, and so is human culture, but both are distinguished by their different means of transmission: whereas nature is transmitted genetically and is encoded in the genome, culture is transmitted through social learning and is encoded in the brain. Only individuals have a brain, and only they have a culture. Talk of collective cultures has {{to be understood as}} a statistical artifact for talking about a plurality of individual cultures. The set of elementary chunks of culture (variously known as memes, cultural variants or cultural traits) codified as neuronal circuits in the <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> of the individual make up that individual’s culture. Corresponding to the different uses of ‘culture’ in ordinary and scientific language, Mosterín defines several notions of collective culture, going from the cultural pool (the union of the cultures of all individuals of the group) to the unanimous culture (the intersection of all those cultures). In 2009 he has completed a thoroughgoing analysis of the forces driving cultural change, paying special attention to the role of Internet and other factors of information technology. He considers that preserving the freedom and efficiency of Internet is crucial for the future thriving of human culture.|$|E
25|$|Experts have {{tremendous}} experience through practice and {{education in a}} particular field. Musical experts {{use some of the}} same strategies as do many experts in fields that require large amounts of memorization: chunking, organization and practice. For example, musical experts may organize notes into scales or create a hierarchical retrieval scheme to facilitate retrieval from <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory.</b> In a case study on an expert pianist, researchers Chaffin & Imreh (2002) found that a retrieval scheme was developed to guarantee that the music was recalled with ease. This expert used auditory and motor memory along with conceptual memory. Together the auditory and motor representations allow for automaticity during performance, whereas the conceptual memory is mainly used to mediate when the piece is getting off track. When studying concert soloists, Chaffin and Logan (2006) reiterate that a hierarchical organization exists in memory, but also take this a step further suggesting that they actually use a mental map of the piece allowing them {{to keep track of the}} progression of the piece. Chaffin and Logan (2006) also demonstrate that there are performance cues that monitor the automatic aspects of performance and adjust them accordingly. They distinguish between basic performance cues, interpretive performance cues, and expressive performance cues. Basic cues monitor technical features, interpretive cues monitor changes made in different aspects of the piece, and expressive cues monitor the feelings of the music. These cues are developed when experts pay attention to a particular aspect during practice.|$|E

Knowing only Walter could comprehend the memories concerning how to open a portal to another reality, the shapeshifters kidnap him. By the time the others find Walter, Newton has already learned {{what he needs to}} know and escapes. Olivia manages to stop them, but is forced to choose between seizing Newton and saving Walter, as he has been given a lethal dose of a neurotoxin that will kill him unless Newton gives them the correct directions.

5000|$|A {{second line}} of study {{has shown that}} {{frequency}} estimation {{may not be the}} only strategy we use when making frequency judgments. A recent line of research has shown that our situational working <b>memory</b> can access <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memories,</b> and this memory retrieval process includes the ability to determine more accurate probabilities. [...] This finding suggests that more research should be conducted to determine how much memory activation affects the availability heuristic.|$|R
40|$|Fully {{convolutional}} {{neural networks}} (FCN) {{have been shown}} to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the task of classifying time series sequences. We propose the augmentation of fully convolutional networks with <b>long</b> short <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> recurrent neural network (LSTM RNN) sub-modules for time series classification. Our proposed models significantly enhance the performance of fully convolutional networks with a nominal increase in model size and require minimal preprocessing of the dataset.

We also explore the usage of attention mechanism to improve time series classification with the Attention <b>Long</b> Short <b>Term</b> <b>Memory</b> Fully Convolutional Network (ALSTM-FCN). Utilization of the attention mechanism allows one to visualize the decision process of the LSTM cell. Furthermore, we propose fine-tuning as a method to enhance the performance of trained models.

5000|$|Memory and {{imagination}} {{have been shown}} to be affected by one another. [...] "Images made by functional magnetic resonance imaging technology show that remembering and imagining sends blood to identical parts of the brain." [...] An optimal balance of intrinsic, extraneous, and germane forms of information processing can heighten the chance of the brain to retain information as <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memories,</b> rather than short <b>term</b> <b>memories.</b> This is significant because experiences stored as <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memories</b> are easier to be recalled, as they are ingrained deeper in the mind. Each of these forms require information to be taught in a specific manner so as to use various regions of the brain when being processed. This information can potentially help develop programs for young students to cultivate or further enhance their creative abilities from a young age. The neocortex and thalamus are responsible for controlling the brain's imagination, along with many of the brain's other functions such as consciousness and abstract thought. Since imagination involves many different brain functions, such as emotions, memory, thoughts, etc., portions of the brain where multiple functions occur—such as the thalamus and neocortex—are the main regions where imaginative processing has been documented. The understanding of how memory {{and imagination}} are linked in the brain, paves the way to better understand one's ability to link significant past experiences with their imagination.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the items}} on the Alcohol Dependence scale most {{positively}} related to their prenatal alcohol exposure includes [...] "blacking out". [...] Blackouts are alcohol-related amnesia, occurring when <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> creation is impaired during a drinking episode, resulting in an inability to remember. The frequency of blackouts in young adults while drinking is strongly related to prenatal alcohol exposure; those exposed to alcohol as a fetus are more vulnerable to experiencing blackouts as an adult.Prenatal alcohol exposure can also lead to decreased problem solving skills and/or attention deficits. Attention deficits result in an inability to maintain focus on one task for a length of time, and being prone to distraction.|$|E
2500|$|Atkinson and Shiffrin's 1968 model {{consists}} of separate components for short and <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> storage. It states that {{short term memory}} is limited by its capacity and duration. Research suggests that musical short term memory is stored differently from verbal short term memory. Berz (1995) found dissimilar results for the correlation between modality and recency effects in language versus music, suggesting that different encoding processes are engaged. Berz also demonstrated different levels of interference on tasks {{as a result of}} language stimulus vs. musical stimulus. Finally Berz provided evidence for a separate store theory through the [...] "Unattended Music Effect", stating [...] "If there was a singular acoustic store, unattended instrumental music would cause the same disruptions on verbal performance as would unattended vocal music or unattended vocal speech; this, however, [...] not the case".|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{dermatological}} {{changes are}} the most obvious symptoms of Urbach–Wiethe disease, many patients also have neurological symptoms. [...] About 5075% [...] of the diagnosed cases of Urbach–Wiethe disease also show bilateral symmetrical calcifications on the medial temporal lobes. These calcifications often affect the amygdala and the periamygdaloid gyri. The amygdala {{is thought to be}} involved in processing biologically relevant stimuli and in emotional <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory,</b> particularly those associated with fear, and both PET and MRI scans have shown a correlation between amygdala activation and episodic memory for strongly emotional stimuli. [...] Therefore, Urbach–Wiethe disease patients with calcifications and lesions in these regions may suffer impairments in these systems. These calcifications are the result of a buildup of calcium deposits in the blood vessels within this brain region. [...] Over time, these vessels harden and the tissue they are a part of dies, causing lesions. [...] The amount of calcification is often related to disease duration. The true prevalence of these calcifications is difficult to accurately state as not all patients undergo brain imaging. [...] Some patients also exhibit epilepsy and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Epilepsy symptoms could begin with light anxiety attacks and it can be controlled with [...] "Epilum" [...] (Epilepsy Medicine) [...] Other patients present with symptoms similar to schizophrenia while some suffer from mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders.|$|E
40|$|The chaotic {{spike train}} of a homoclinic {{dynamical}} system is self-synchronized by applying a time delayed correction {{proportional to the}} laser output intensity. Due to the sensitive nature of the homoclinic chaos to external perturbations, stabilization of very long periodic orbits is possible. On these orbits, the dynamics appears chaotic over a finite time, but then it repeats with a recurrence time that is slightly longer than the delay time.

50|$|The current {{model for}} memory {{retrieval}} {{in the brain}} is step 1, <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memories</b> occur from the accumulation of synaptic changes in the cortex {{as a result of}} multiple reinstatements of the memory. Step 2, these reinstatements are directed by the hippocampus, perhaps for many years. Step 3, eventually the memory becomes independent of the medial temporal lobe, and this newer, more stable memory trace is permanently stored in the cortex. Step 4, retrieval mechanisms may reconstruct the original pattern of neurons initially recruited during the first moments of learning.|$|R

2500|$|Henry Molaison, {{formerly}} known as H.M., changed the way people thought of memory. The case was first reported in a paper by William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy attributed to a bicycle accident {{at the age of}} nine. [...] Physicians were unable to control his seizures with drugs, so the neurosurgeon Scoville tried a new approach involving brain surgery. He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by doing a temporal lobectomy. His epilepsy did improve, but Molaison lost the ability to form new long-term memories (anterograde amnesia). He exhibited normal short-term memory ability. If he was given a list of words, he would forget them in about a minute's time. In fact, he would forget that he was even given a list in the first place. Once Molaison stopped thinking about the lists he was unable to recall them again from <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory.</b> This gave researchers evidence that short-term and long-term memory are in fact two different processes. Even though he forgot about the lists, he was still able to learn things through his implicit memory. The psychologists would ask him to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror. Though he could never remember ever doing that task, he would improve after doing it over and over again. This showed the psychologists that he was learning and remembering things unconsciously.|$|E

We introduce Bidirectional <b>Long</b> Short <b>Term</b> <b>Memory</b> - <b>Long</b> Short <b>Term</b> <b>Memory</b> networks (BLSTM-LSTM) as the encoder-decoder model to fully utilize the power of deep learning. In the sequence labelling task, the input and output sequences are aligned word by word, while the attention mechanism cannot provide the exact alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a novel focus mechanism for encoder-decoder framework. Experiments on the standard ATIS dataset showed that BLSTM-LSTM with focus mechanism defined the new state-of-the-art by outperforming standard BLSTM and attention based encoder-decoder. Further experiments also show that the proposed model is more robust to speech recognition errors. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
