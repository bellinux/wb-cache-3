5|$|Little {{is known}} about the habitat requirements– such as humidity, temperature, soil {{composition}} and water content– of B.nothofagi. However, as the species seems to only occur together with N.fusca, it should largely conform to their demands. The tree species prefers lowlands and hills along river valleys and usually grows on nutrient-rich, well-drained soil. The species is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> inland than in the coastal regions.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{reptiles}} in the forest. Snakes species include bullsnakes {{and rubber}} boas, {{as well as}} western rattlesnakes, which are most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> at lower elevations and in the Minidoka District. Amphibians including the Columbia spotted frog, long-toed salamander, and the Rocky Mountain tailed frog are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|They are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in valley {{regions that}} exhibit diurnal {{mountain}} wind systems, {{such as those}} of the dry mountain ranges of the US. Deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases.|$|E
50|$|How {{complete}} fossils are <b>was</b> {{once thought}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a proxy for}} {{the energy of the}} environment, with stormier waters leaving less articulated carcasses. However, the dominant force actually seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> predation, with scavengers more likely than rough waters to break up a fresh carcass before it is buried. Sediments cover smaller fossils faster so they <b>are</b> <b>likelier</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> fully articulated. However, erosion also tends to destroy smaller fossils more easily.|$|R
50|$|Although {{perceptive}} South Africans commonly regard Parktown prawns as desirable in gardens, {{they can}} be unwelcome visitors indoors, where they are seen as pests; the insects can jump actively and often eject offensive black fecal liquids when threatened. Accordingly, they frighten nervous persons and they may chew carpets and fabrics. They most often emerge into the open after rain during summer, which also is when they <b>are</b> <b>likeliest</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> indoors. Commonly they are most active at night.|$|R
40|$|In reality, {{footings}} <b>are</b> most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>founded</b> on multi-layered soils. The existing {{methods for}} predicting the bearing capacity of 4 -layer up to 10 -layer cohesive soil are inaccurate. This paper aims {{to develop a}} more accurate bearing capacity prediction method based on multiple regression methods and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), one type of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Predictions of bearing capacity from the developed multiple regression models and MLP in tractable equations form are obtained and compared with the value predicted using traditional methods.

5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E
5|$|In a Swiss {{study of}} the {{nominate}} subspecies, 76% of eggs hatched, and 58% of chicks fledged. Birds of the race A. s. blakistoni in the Tian Shan hatched 90% of their eggs, and hatchlings survived to fledging in 47% of the nests. In the latter study, early nests {{were more likely to}} fail because less plant cover made them more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> by predators. Neither the average lifespan nor the maximum age of survival are known.|$|E
5|$|Large fruitings of {{the fungus}} are often {{associated}} with damage to the host tree, such as that which occurs with burning. A field study conducted in Norway demonstrated that fruit bodies were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in areas that were heavily burned, compared to locations with light to moderate burning where the trees remained viable, or in clearcut areas. Fruiting was much denser in spruce forests—with up to 700–1000 fruitbodies per square meter—than in pine forests, where fruitbodies were sporadic. Fruitbodies grew by the millions in the year following the Yellowstone fires of 1988.|$|E
50|$|Huggle is a {{very small}} medieval village in Heby, Uppsala, Sweden. The village is lacking in a land {{taxation}} list from 1312, but is mentioned in writing in 1454, so it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>founded</b> in the meantime.|$|R

5|$|No {{discernible}} {{variation in}} size or appearance in green and golden bell frogs between different geographic areas is found. Fluctuations {{in size and}} appearance between different populations are outweighed by variations within the populations themselves. Females are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> away from breeding sites, while the opposite applies for males. Metamorphlings are divided in roughly equal numbers between males and females, while juvenile frogs are observed less often than their mature counterparts, although scientists are not sure whether {{this is due to}} lower abundance or increased reclusiveness.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} {{has nine}} or more subspecies which breed {{in different parts}} of its range in temperate Eurasia. This species is found in woodlands of all kinds, but where it overlaps with the short-toed treecreeper in western Europe it is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in coniferous forests or at higher altitudes. It nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, and favours introduced giant sequoia as nest sites where they are available. The female typically lays five or six pink-speckled white eggs in the lined nest, but eggs and chicks are vulnerable to attack by woodpeckers and mammals, including squirrels.|$|E
5|$|A common mushroom, Mycena nargan {{is found}} growing singly or in {{clusters}} {{on the underside}} of rotting wood in wet and shaded areas, and is especially partial to Eucalyptus and Pinus pinaster. Fruit bodies usually appear from April to June. The species has been recorded from Tasmania, Victoria and southeastern South Australia. The Australian Fungimap initiative has reported isolated collections in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, although the majority of sightings have been in Tasmania and Victoria. The fungus is saprobic, meaning it derives nutrients from dead or dying organic matter. A field study conducted in Tasmania showed that it is much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in mature eucalypt forest (defined as having grown at least 70 years before the last wildfire) than young, regenerating forest that had experienced clearfelling, burning, and sowing two to three years previously.|$|E

40|$|Social {{reciprocity}} {{may explain}} certain emerging psychological processes, which <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>founded</b> on dyadic relations. Although some indices and statistics have <b>been</b> proposed <b>to</b> measure and make statistical decisions regarding social reciprocity in groups, these <b>were</b> generally developed <b>to</b> identify association patterns {{rather than to}} quantify the discrepancies between what each individual addresses to his/her partners and what is received from them in return. Additionally, social researchers are not only interested in measuring groups {{at the global level}}, since dyadic and individual measurements are also necessary for a proper description of social interactions. This study is concerned with a new statistic for measuring social reciprocity at the global level and with decomposing it in order to identify those dyads and individuals which account for a significant part of asymmetry in social interactions. In addition to a set of indices some exact analytical results are derived and a way of making statistical decisions is proposed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} ecological conditions that influence {{shifts in the}} location of foundings of U. S. instrument manufacturers between 1978 and 1988. Consistent with past work, we find that instrument manufacturers <b>are</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>founded</b> in local communities that already have such organizations. Although this effect of local density contributes to sustaining the existing spatial distribution of entrepreneurial activity, we also find that local communities {{that do not have}} any instrument manufacturer {{at the beginning of the}} observation period but have organizations connected to instrument manufacturers by symbiotic relationships or commensalistic relationships <b>are</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience initial foundings. Furthermore, in local communities that already have instrument manufacturers, hierarchical relations among organizational populations within the local community affect the founding rate. Specifically, after controlling for the effect of local density, we find that the greater a community’s dominant population, the lower the founding rate of instrument manufacturers in the local community. Besides extending work on the spatial evolution of foundings, this paper contributes to integrating organizational ecology and network studies of markets and suggests new direction...|$|R
5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum ferrugineum {{is found}} mainly in {{coniferous}} woodland, often near pines, but occasionally with spruce. Fruit bodies have {{a preference for}} sandy soil {{with low levels of}} organic matter and nutrients, and grow singly or in clusters. They are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in older-growth forests. The fungus occurs in North America, including Mexico. It is widespread but generally uncommon throughout Europe, although there may be local areas where it is common. In Britain, H.ferrugineum is provisionally classified as endangered, and is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981; it was included as one of 14 species considered in the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan for stipitate hydnoid fungi (i.e., hydnoid fungi with a cap and stipe) in 2004. The fungus is protected in Montenegro. It has been collected in India and North Africa.|$|E
5|$|In North America, {{the fungus}} has been {{recorded}} in North Carolina, Tennessee, New York, Michigan, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, Virginia, and South Dakota. In Canada, {{it has been found}} in Ontario. Smith noted that collections from Michigan are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> on old hemlock knots lying in the soil, where it usually fruits singly; it tends to grow in clusters on logs and stumps. In Europe, it {{has been recorded}} from Britain, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, and Turkey. In the UK, the fungus is commonly found in Caledonian pine woods, and it is considered an indicator species for that habitat type.|$|E
50|$|M. mexicanus has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{have two}} stable nesting strategies: haplometrosis and pleometrosis. Haplometrosis {{refers to the}} single-foundress nesting {{strategy}}, while pleometrosis refers to a strategy involving multiple cofoundresses. It is interesting that both of these tactics are stable in M. mexicanus and it has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> that this <b>is</b> because each of these strategies is favorable in certain conditions, {{so this is an}} example of a context-dependent trait. Haplometric nests <b>are</b> more susceptible <b>to</b> greater mortality, and indeed up to 80% of haplometrotic nests fail within 20 days. However, haplometrosis has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more frequent in the winter and spring, while pleometrosis is more frequent during the fall. It has been proposed that larger females <b>are</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solitary foundresses in the spring, and group foundresses in the summer, which a preference not found in smaller females. Additionally, when the number of potential habitats is experimentally decreased in an area, then nests <b>are</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>founded</b> by multiple females, and the converse has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> hold true as well, indicating that these nesting tactics are context-dependent. Additionally, a female can switch between nesting tactics as an adult, suggesting that this trait is plastic.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom {{points and}} {{crossings}} using chaired bullhead rail would <b>be</b> referred <b>to</b> using a letter and number combination. The letter would define the length (and hence the radius) of the switch blades and the number would define {{the angle of the}} crossing (frog). Thus an A7 turnout would be very short and <b>likely</b> only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in tight places like dockyards whereas an E12 would <b>be</b> <b>found</b> as a fairly high speed turnout on a mainline.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and {{the advent of}} the Internet have facilitated the emergence and growth of collaborative strategies amongst small e-Businesses (Matlay & Westhead, 2005). In addition, during the last decade or so, team-led entrepreneurship has been identified as a highly profitable alternative to single founder entrepreneurship. Recent research suggests that growth oriented, small e-Businesses operating in international e-Markets <b>are</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>founded</b> and managed by teams of e-Entrepreneurs (Matlay & Westhead, 2007). In increasingly globalised and hyper-competitive markets, "virtual teams" of e-Entrepreneurs search, discover and exploit new entrepreneurial opportunities. This type of entrepreneurial team consists of geographically dispersed entrepreneurs who are led by common entrepreneurial interests and interact electronically in order to promote interdependent strategies and fulfil entrepreneurial goals. In this article, an illustrative longitudinal case study of a pan-European virtual team of 24 e-Entrepreneur members <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> evaluate emergent collaborative and competitive strategies in small e-Businesses that are lead and managed by members. Collaborative and competitive strategies of e-Businesses are identified and related outcomes are analysed.

5|$|Michael Shermer {{argued in}} Scientific American in October 2006 that {{evolution}} supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes {{and the rule}} of law. He goes on to suggest that evolution gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists. Careful analysis of the creationist charges that evolution has led to moral relativism and the Holocaust yields the conclusion that these charges appear to be highly suspect. Such analyses conclude that the origins of the Holocaust are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in historical Christian anti-Semitism than in evolution.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry {{the mimic}} shares signals {{similar to the}} model, but {{does not have the}} {{attribute}} that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (described in The Naturalist on the River Amazons) was pioneering in this field of study. Mimics are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> out (for example by predators) when in low proportion to their model. This phenomenon is called negative frequency dependent selection, and it applies in most forms of mimicry. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for a long time, and does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable where both the model and the mimic occur, and where the model is more abundant than the mimic. This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry, which is described next.|$|E

Teilo's foundation at Llandeilo may have superseded Ergyng in the mid-7th century or, as David Nash Ford suggests, the two may have remained the seats of independent, yet parallel, bishoprics, as late as the mid-9th century. Both had accepted the ways of the Roman Catholic Church in 777.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we seek to build on efforts to apply the {{insights}} of social learning theory to interpret patterns of continuity and change in the archaeological record. This literature suggests that stable and often highly arbitrary material culture traditions <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>founded</b> on our biologically-evolved capacity for imitation. However, it has recently been argued that the latter may <b>be</b> insufficient <b>to</b> explain the long-term maintenance of complex and difficult-to-master skills, such as those required to produce stone tools, pots, textiles and other cognitively opaque cultural forms. To ensure that these skills <b>are</b> accurately transferred <b>to</b> the next generation, adults must actively guide and control the learning activities of their children, a mode of transmission that can be labelled ‘pedagogy’. The importance of pedagogy has often been overlooked in the theoretical and empirical literature on craft learning, a fact that can probably <b>be</b> attributed <b>to</b> an unnecessarily narrow conception of teaching that equates it with explicit linguistic instruction. Using ethnographic data gathered from detailed case studies, we characterise pedagogy {{in the context of}} craft apprenticeships as involving the gradual scaffolding of skill in a novice through demonstration, intervention and collaboration. Although these processes cannot be directly observed in the archaeological record, they can sometimes be inferred through the detailed reconstruction of operational chains in past technologies. The evidence we present suggests that pedagogy has played an essential role in securing the faithful transmission of skills across generations, and should be regarded as the central mechanism through which long-term and stable material culture traditions are propagated and maintained...|$|R
