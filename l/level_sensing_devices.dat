A cutting mechanism macerates waste and grinds items that are not normally found in sewage, but may get flushed down the toilet. The pump has a level sensor either built into the pump, called “sensing bells,” or attached externally to the pump, called “floats.” (The <b>level</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>devices</b> vary among grinder pump manufacturers.)If the pump malfunctions and the waste level in the holding tank rises above a certain level, the alarm panel should alert the homeowner that the pump is experiencing problems. The alarm panel should have both a buzzer and an indicator light.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no obvious}} visual {{evidence}} of the linear features usually associated with farm fields in the land surrounding Chetro Ketl, but in 1929 aerial black-and-white images by Charles Lindbergh revealed {{what appeared to be}} a rectangular plot. In the early 1970s the National Park Service (NPS) developed a remote sensing program to further investigate the area using color video imagery. When enhanced and viewed in black-and-white, the video revealed a well-defined grid pattern within a larger rectangular section of land near Chetro Ketl. The NPS employed two types of ground <b>level</b> remote <b>sensing</b> <b>devices</b> to search for magnetic and soil anomalies in the alluvium of the canyon floor. A soil density study proved inconclusive, but a magnetometer identified a rectangular feature , roughly the same size as those seen in Lindbergh's aerial photographs. The NPS researchers proposed that water had deposited iron-bearing clays in the plots, with the center showing the strongest magnetic evidence. Subsequent comparisons with older data reinforced their conclusion. They determined that had the plots been under heavy alluvium they would not have been detected.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{challenges}} in robotics {{that need to}} be addressed in order to solve the meso, micro, and nano-scale manipulation and assembly problems that are becoming more and more important today. Traditionally, solutions for precision assembly have been highly customized and accomplished at the expense of system cost and complexity. More expensive sensors and actuators are used that drive up cost and reduce throughput. However, at smaller scales, often times sensors are either complex and expensive or non-existent. Furthermore, there is a lack of good contact interaction models at these scales making model-based approaches to control difficult. ^ The work presented here investigates ways to solve these new manipulation and assembly challenges at these small scales. The contributions include the following: First, a novel, flexible automation system for micro and meso-scale manipulation tasks has been designed and implementation. Second, the development of a methodology for meso-scale manipulation tasks along with experimental validation of this methodology has been realized. The third contribution is the design, fabrication, and testing of a novel, two-dimensional, μN <b>level</b> force <b>sensing</b> <b>device.</b> Finally, the last contribution is the application of flexible automation technologies for increased biotechnology process throughput, analysis, and automation and performance of single-cell manipulations for characterization studies. ...|$|R

40|$|Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) [1] {{promises}} tremendous gain {{in improving}} spectral efficiency. The main objective of OSA {{is to offer}} the ability of identifying and exploiting the under-utilised spectrum in an instantaneous manner in a wireless device, without any user intrusion. Hence, the initial requirement of any OSA device {{is the ability to}} perform spectrum sensing. Local narrow-band spectrum sensing has been quite well investigated in the literature. However, it is realised that existing schemes can hardly meet the requirements of a fast and accurate spectrum sensing particulariy in very low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) range without introducing high complexity to the system. Furthermore, increase in the spectrum utilisation calls for spectrum sensing techniques that adopt an architecture to simultaneously search over multiple frequency sub-bands at a time. However, the literature of sub-band spectrum sensing is rather limited at this time. The main contributions of this thesis is two-fold: First a clusterd-based differential energy detection for local sensing of multi- carrier based system is proposed. The proposed approach can form fast and reliable decision of spectrum availability even in very low SNR environment. The underlying initiative of the proposed scheme is applying order statistics on the clustered differential Energy Spectral Density (ESD) in order to exploit the channel frequency diversity inherent in high data-rate communications. Second contribution is three-fold: 1) re-defining the objective of the sub- band <b>level</b> spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>device</b> to a model estimator, 2) deriving the optimal model selection estimator for sub-band <b>level</b> spectrum <b>sensing</b> for fixed and variable number of users along with a sub-optimal solution based on Bayesian statistical modelling and 3) proposing a practical model selection estimator with relaxed sample size constraint and limited system knowledge for sub-band spectrum sensing applications in Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems. The result obtained showed that through exploitation of the channel frequency selectivity the performance of the stat-of-the-art spectrum sensing techniques can be significantly improved. Furthermore, by modelling the sub-band <b>level</b> spectrum <b>sensing</b> through model estimation allows for new spectrum sensing approach. It was proved both analytically and through simulations that the proposed approach have significantly extended to state-of-the-art spectrum sensing.
