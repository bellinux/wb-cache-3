50|$|Because {{of their}} calcified structure, coralline algae {{have a number}} of {{economic}} uses. The collection of unattached corallines (maërl) for use as soil conditioners dates to the 18th century. This is particularly significant in Britain and France, where more than 300,000 tonnes of Phymatolithon calcareum (Pallas) Adey & McKinnin and <b>Lithothamnion</b> corallioides are dredged annually. Some harvesting of maërl beds that span several thousand kilometres off the coast of Brazil takes place.

5000|$|It {{is defined}} as the cells above the [...] meristem; these are not {{involved}} in photosynthesis. In Phymatolithon, the epithallium is usually one cell thick, whereas in other genera, such as Pseudolithophyllum, multiple cells exist, with the thickness determined by the difference between their rate of production at the intercalary meristem, and the rate of shedding at the surface; thicknesses of 16 cells or more, spanning 100 µm, have been measured in a representative coralline (Clathromorphum). The thickness is variable within species; in <b>Lithothamnion,</b> a single cell thickness is the norm, but three- or four-cell thick regions are also common. The epithallus sometimes overlies the roof of conceptacles, which are exposed only when the overlying epithallus is eventually shed.|$|E
50|$|Dendropoma corallinaceus breeds between July and December. A single embryo is brooded in {{a capsule}} in the mantle cavity of the snail. When {{sufficiently}} mature, the protoconch crawls {{out of the}} tube and uses a sticky trail of mucus to avoid being swept away. It moves towards light and settles after between one and five days, whenever it finds a suitable position in which to anchor itself. About two days later it undergoes metamorphosis. It prefers to settle on the coralline alga <b>Lithothamnion</b> in which it can easily cut a groove with its radula. This helps it to attach itself firmly to the substrate and avoid being swept away by the waves. This worm snail is a suspension feeder. It secretes a mucus net which ensnares food particles from the surrounding water and is periodically wound up and swallowed by the snail. The nets of nearby snails overlap each other and coalesce. Parts may get hauled in by a snail {{other than the one}} that secreting that part.|$|E

50|$|The entire island {{including}} Murray Hill {{has been}} formed out of submarine mountain formations. It is conjectured {{to be an}} ancient atoll, with lime formation dominating the terrain, with phosphates of alumina and iron recorded on the hills. The entire island is geologically identified as an isolated limestone-capped volcanic island with hill formations rising to a height of 4.5 km above the sea floor. Geological formations recorded are mainly-basaltic volcanic rocks interspersed with tertiary limestones and occasional inter-bedded volcanics overlaid by phosphate-rich soils on the surface in some areas. Along with the highest elevations of Phosphate Hill and Flying Fish Cove, the rocks from Murray Hill summit are characterized as dolomitic limestones, containing between 34 and 41 percent carbonate of magnesia. Analyses of the rocks {{has shown that the}} fossils are mostly obliterated, though there are remains of foraminifera, <b>Lithothamnion,</b> and possibly coral. The small, brown spherules of phosphatic matter which occur on the hill in a bed of rock may be explained because of phosphatic fossilization of volcanic rock.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{documents}} species of coralline algae that form maerl and rhodoliths in Guadeloupe, Caribbean using an integrative systematic approach of combining molecular (COI- 5 P, psbA) and morphological/anatomical data. Maerl and rhodoliths {{were collected by}} SCUBA and dredging from six localities in Guadeloupe during the Karubenthos Expedition, which was coordinated by the Parc National de la Guadeloupe and the Muséum National d´Histoire Naturelle. Of the twelve maerl and rhodolith specimens collected and sequenced, eight specific entities were delimitated based on the analysis of molecular data: <b>Lithothamnion</b> cf. ruptile, five species of the genus <b>Lithothamnion,</b> one species of the genus Spongites, and the remaining one was either assigned to the genus Lithoporella or Mastophora. Morphological/anatomical data are presented {{for each of these}} species. Molecular analyses revealed that <b>Lithothamnion.</b> cf ruptile and other four species (<b>Lithothamnion</b> spp. 1 – 4) were resolved in a distinct lineage than the other <b>Lithothamnion</b> species examined. Nevertheless, these five species were provisionally remained in the genus <b>Lithothamnion</b> based on the presence of flared epithallial cells. Previously, only three species of <b>Lithothamnion</b> have been cited in the Caribbean. Till this study species belonging to the genus Spongites have not been hitherto reported for this region. The specimen identified as either Lithoporella or Mastophora shared anatomical features with both genera.

The species are from the Early Cretaceous, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene and Pleistocene rocks of southern and central Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Indian Ocean, Philippines, Pakistan and Galapagos and were attributed by Ishijima to <b>Lithothamnion</b> (as Lithothamnium), Mesophyllum, Lithophyllum and Archaeolithothamnion (as Archaeolithothamnium). With two exceptions, all species had to be reassigned to different genera or were of uncertain generic placement within particular subfamilies, families or orders. The type specimen of Lithophyllum oboraensis is retained in Lithophyllum and the type specimen of Mesophyllum izuensis is retained in Mesophyllum.

(= Archaeolithothamnion galapagosensis) possess features justifying their assignment to various genera within a particular family and subfamily. A specimen ascribed by Ishijima to Archaeolithothamnion galapagosensis (as Archaeolithothamnium) in the protologue of that species is a misidentified specimen of Sporolithon ptychoides Heydrich. The type specimens of Lithophyllum minoensis and Mesophyllum indicum belong to the Corallinaceae, subfamily Mastophoroideae but are of uncertain generic placement.

The 5 - 7 rosette cells surrounding each pore of the tetrasporangial conceptacle roof are larger than the normal epithallial cells and the whole structure (pore and rosette cells) lays in a depression below the conceptacle roof surface. The dioecius gametangial plants are described. The comparison of the reproductive anatomy of <b>Lithothamnion</b> superpositum Foslie 1899 and <b>Lithothamnion</b> crispatum Hauck 1878 shows that both species possess tetrasporangial conceptacle roofs that are pitted with depressions {{as a consequence of}} disintegration of uppermost cells in filaments surrounding pore canals.

Mice treated with LM showed reduced clinical signs of disease and mortality when compared with untreated mice. LM-treated mice had reduced tissue injury, less bacterial translocation, and decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL 2), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL 3) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL 5)). The polysaccharide-rich fraction derived from LM could inhibit leukocyte rolling and adhesion in intestinal venules, as assessed by intravital microscopy.
