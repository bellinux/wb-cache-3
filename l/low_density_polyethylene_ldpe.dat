50|$|A {{polyethylene}} tarpaulin ("polytarp") is not {{a traditional}} fabric, but rather, a laminate of woven and sheet material. The center is loosely woven from strips of polyethylene plastic, with sheets of the same material bonded to the surface. This creates a fabric-like material that resists stretching well in all directions and is waterproof. Sheets can be either of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (<b>LDPE)</b> or high density polyethylene (HDPE). When treated against ultraviolet light, these tarpaulins can last for years exposed to the elements, but non-UV treated material will quickly become brittle and lose strength and water resistance if exposed to sunlight.|$|E

During crosslinking, two reactions simultaneously occur in the copolymer, i. e. a reaction of the vinyl groups and combination crosslinking. After crosslinking with a low amount of peroxide, {{the majority of the}} crosslinks originate from reacted vinyl groups in the LDPE containing the higher number of vinyl groups, whereas the crosslinks in the reference LDPE originate from combination crosslinking, thus leading to different crosslinked structures for the two polymers. The melt temperature, crystallisation temperature, and degree of crystallinity were measured using a Differential Scanning Calorimeter. Thermal fractionation studies and morphology studies were also made. The Differential Scanning Calorimetry results show a decrease in those properties for both materials along with a concurrent change in the morphology when the crosslink density increased.

The melting behaviour of pure copolymers and their blends were investigated using {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) after applying stepwise isothermal crystallisation (&# 039;thermal fractionation&# 039;). Thermal fractionation separates polymers according to their branching densities and fractionated curves {{used to determine the}} short-chain branching distribution (SCB), crystallisation and miscibility of blends. When both polymers have similar unbranched segments, they may co-crystallise if they are miscible in the melt. The co-crystallisation is observed to occur in all sets of blends, however, the extent of co-crystallisation varies from blend to blend. The blends of metallocene-catalysed VLDPE 1 and LDPEs show significant deviation from the additivity rule indicating the greater co-crystallisation and hence melt miscibility at all compositions. The extent of co-crystallisation decreases for the VLDPE 1 blends containing long-chain branched VLDPE 2 and increases for Ziegler-Natta-catalysed VLDPE 3 -VLDPE 2 blends, as the VLDPE 2 content increases. DSC fractionated curves allow detailed examination of co-crystallisation and miscibility of blends that is also comparable to the results gained by temperature rising elution fractionation...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the impact of sample inhomogeneity on measurements of the linear elongational viscosity of two low-density polyethelenes is presented. A novel method of in-situ measurements of the diameter of samples under extension has recently been implemented to properly account for the sample non-uniformities during elongation. Two types of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> (<b>LDPE's)</b> have been investigated: Lupolen 1840 D and LPDE 1840 H. Whereas in the case of Lupolen 1840 H the Trouton relationship is verified, in the case of Lupolen 1840 D the deviations can be as large as 40 %, depending on the magnitude of the initial sample non-uniformity and the experimental conditions. Based on real time visualization of the sample, these deviations are associated with an inhomogeneous deformation of the specimen. Differences in the homogeneity of deformation between the H and D samples are explained by significantly different maximal retardation times. The experimental investigation is complemented by a simplified theoretical estimation of the error induced by the sample inhomogeneity in the case of measurements of elongational viscosities in the linear range.

Wrapped fruit and control fruit (without bagging) were kept at 12 °C and 90 % relative humidity (RH) for 30 days plus 5 days’ shelf life at 18 °C and 70 % RH. Caliber 3 LDPE film ensured that injected O 2 concentration remained more stable and increased CO 2 content during storage time than caliber 2 film. MAP treatment increased fruit shelf-life by delaying the ripening process. MAP drastically reduced fruit weight loss and increased ascorbic acid content compared to control. Negative correlation was found between fruit weight loss and fruit ascorbic acid content and O 2 concentration within the plastic film and fruit ascorbic acid content. By contrast, there was direct correlation between CO 2 content within MAP and the ascorbic acid content of fruit.

However, the interpretation of transport mechanisms and more generally of non-linear processes from current measurements alone is not straightforward. For this reason, space charge measurements, on the one hand, and models of charge transport encompassing charge generation, trapping and transport have been developed. The completeness and accuracy of a model can be assessed only if a substantial range of stress conditions, being field and temperature for the current topics, is available. The purpose of this communication is to enrich the investigation of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> - <b>LDPE</b> insulation material characteristic using conduction current measurement. Measurements were conducted on 250 μm thick LDPE samples, for DC fields in the range 2 to 50 kV/mm and for temperatures from 20 to 70 °C. Experimental data, i. e. transient current in charge/discharge and quasi-steady state currents are compared to the prediction of a bipolar transport model that has been developed over the last years and fitted to the case of LDPE. The deviation of model results is substantial, with essentially an overestimation of the non-linearity of the current-field dependence. These differences are discussed along with prospects from improving the model.
