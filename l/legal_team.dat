5|$|Beauchamp's uncle Jereboam {{assembled}} a <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> for his nephew that included former U.S. Senator John Pope. The grand jury convened in March and returned an indictment against Beauchamp for Sharp's murder. Giving Beauchamp {{the time he}} requested to gather witnesses, the court scheduled a special session in May specifically for his trial.|$|E
5|$|Because he had wrongly {{described}} significant evidence (including {{the car and}} DeSimone's clothes), {{police had}} dismissed his statement, filing it along with six other confessions to the crime. Hodgson's <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> was never made aware of its existence.|$|E

5|$|Kesselring's own {{trial began}} in Venice on 17 February 1947. The British Military Court was {{presided over by}} Major General Sir Edmund Hakewill-Smith, {{assisted}} by four lieutenant colonels. Colonel Richard C. Halse – who had already obtained {{the death penalty for}} von Mackensen and Kurt Mälzer – was the prosecutor. Kesselring's <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> was headed by Hans Laternser, a skilful German lawyer who specialised in Anglo-Saxon law, had represented several defendants at the Nuremberg Trials, and would later go on to represent Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein. Kesselring's ability to pay his <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> was hampered because his assets had been frozen by the Allies, but his legal costs were eventually met by friends in South America and relatives in Franconia.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, Croatia alleged {{before the}} International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the {{massacre}} in Voćin {{was part of}} a larger campaign of genocide targeting the Croat population of Slavonia. In 2015, the ICJ ruled that Serb forces had not committed genocide in Croatia, and stated that the Croatian <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> had failed to prove that any mass killing had taken place in Voćin.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of appeals, defense {{attorneys}} presented mitigating evidence of the troubled upbringing of Gardner, who had spent nearly his entire adult life in incarceration. His request for commutation of his death sentence was denied in 2010 after the families of his victims testified against him. Gardner's <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> took the case {{all the way to}} the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to intervene.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{corporate}} legal spend {{was considered}} a “black box” with limited predictability and transparency, {{making it difficult for}} corporate <b>legal</b> <b>teams</b> to parse differences of efficiency and cost among outside firms, or to benchmark firm performance against previously hired counsel.|$|R
5|$|In late October 2010, the Dutch court {{approved}} {{a request from}} Geert Wilders to have new judges appointed forcing the court to retry the case. On 7 February 2011, Wilders returned to the court room in order that his <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> could present evidence from Islamic experts which the court rejected in 2010, including Mohammed Bouyeri, who murdered film-maker Theo van Gogh, and Dutch academic Hans Jansen.|$|E
5|$|On January 29, Schenecker was {{admitted}} to Tampa General Hospital, but was released the next day. She was charged with two counts of first degree murder and indicted by grand jury on February 9. Seven days later she entered a plea of not guilty, with her <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> indicating they would pursue a defense {{on the grounds of}} insanity. Parker Schenecker divorced his wife in May 2011 and subsequently filed a civil lawsuit for wrongful deaths, following dispute over distribution of the family's assets.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Carter {{created a}} special White House {{task force to}} {{investigate}} the claims. Carter named retiring judge William B. Gunter, of the state Supreme Court of Georgia, to mediate the dispute. Archibald Coxa professor at Harvard and the former Watergate special prosecutorjoined the tribes' <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> pro bono. In response, Governor Longley hired Edward Bennett Williams, the named partner of Williams & Connolly, to represent the state. Three months of presentations to Judge Gunter ensued.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2012, de Lestrade {{released}} a sequel, [...] "The Staircase 2: The Last Chance", which premiered at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam.

50|$|Abu-Jamal's senior {{attorneys}} {{felt that}} Beverly was not credible, as no witnesses have testified to having seen Beverly at the scene, and advised Abu-Jamal against using Beverly {{to support his}} 1999 appeal. This decision later became a divisive issue among Abu-Jamal's <b>legal</b> <b>teams</b> and supporters.|$|R
5|$|Beshear and Abramson easily {{defeated}} Farmer and Williams, carrying 90 of Kentucky's 120 counties. Days later, the Lexington Herald-Leader {{reported that}} Farmer had placed his girlfriend in a non-merit agriculture department job on October 31, 2011. Williams {{confirmed that the}} woman was Farmer's girlfriend, but denied knowledge {{that she had been}} put on the state payroll. Farmer defended the hiring, saying his girlfriend was qualified for the job, which involved administrative and clerical tasks, and that his <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> had assured him that he had followed all appropriate hiring regulations. Farmer's successor, Republican James Comer, fired Farmer's girlfriend a day after being sworn into office.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{prosecution}} alleged bribery and witness tampering {{attempts by the}} Frank <b>legal</b> <b>team.</b> Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people {{inside and outside the}} courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Bradley moved to Louisville and resumed his legal practice. Shortly after Bradley left office, Goebel and his running mate, J. C. W. Beckham, {{challenged}} {{the results of}} the 1899 election in the General Assembly, per the state constitution. All the candidates for the state's minor offices contested as well. Bradley and his colleague Augustus Willson formed part of the <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> that represented the Republicans before the General Assembly and in court, where they challenged the legality of the Goebel Election Law and, later, the actions of the General Assembly's contest committee.|$|E

5000|$|Lastly, {{the authors}} criticized the FTC for being {{reluctant}} to [...] "go after" [...] big companies (due to fear of their powerful <b>legal</b> <b>teams,</b> or through direct corporate or legal pressure), noting {{that of the}} vast majority of companies involved in litigated cases were small companies.|$|R
50|$|Al Nuaimi and {{his firm}} {{assembled}} a <b>legal</b> defense <b>team</b> to represent more than 70 prisoners in Guantanamo Bay in 2002.

5|$|In 2013, Lex Wotton, {{as well as}} {{his wife}} Cecilia and Mother Agnes, filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Aboriginal people who lived on Palm Island against the State of Queensland and the Commissioner of the Police Service, alleging that the police had {{committed}} acts of unlawful racial discrimination in the investigation into Mulrunji's death in custody and in the subsequent police response to the unrest in the community. The Wottons' <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> included Lex Wotton's long-standing lawyer, Stewart Levitt of law firm Levitt Robinson Solicitors, as well as prominent anti-discrimination barrister Chris Ronalds SC, Aboriginal barrister Joshua Creamer, and Queensland barrister Shaneen Pointing.|$|E
5|$|In July 2004, Hamdan {{was charged}} with {{conspiracy}} to commit terrorism, and the Bush administration made arrangements to try him before a military commission, established by the Department of Defense under Military Commission Order No. 1 of March 21, 2002. He was assigned a defense counsel, LCDR Charles D. Swift from the Navy JAG, who with a <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> filed a petition for Hamdan in US District Court for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging {{the constitutionality of the}} military commission, and saying that it lacked the protections required under the Geneva Conventions and United States Uniform Code of Military Justice.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 1913, a {{grand jury}} convened to hear {{evidence}} for an indictment against Leo Frank {{for the murder of}} Mary Phagan. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, presented only enough information to obtain the indictment, assuring the jury that additional information would be provided during the trial. The next day, May 24, the jury voted for an indictment. Meanwhile, Frank's <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> suggested to the media that Jim Conley was the actual killer, and put pressure on another grand jury to indict him. The jury foreman, on his own authority, convened the jury on July 21; on Dorsey's advice, they decided not to indict Conley.|$|E

50|$|The rule also covers {{in-house}} corporate <b>legal</b> <b>teams</b> that conduct {{litigation and}} have rights of audience.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the relationship between witnesses testifying in the Special Court for Sierra Leone and their <b>legal</b> <b>teams.</b> Other research conducted with witnesses in international war crimes tribunals suggests that this relationship has {{a significant impact on the}} experience of such witnesses. A structured interview was administered to 171 witnesses who had testified in the Special Court for Sierra Leone. Witnesses generally felt their lawyers' attitude towards them was extremely good. Emotional support and good preparation for testifying seem to be particularly important predictors of witnesses' relationship with their lawyers, as does the level of respect they felt they received from court staff. However, communication between witnesses and their <b>legal</b> <b>teams</b> after the testimony is over did not have a significant impact on witnesses' evaluations of their lawyers' attitude towards them...|$|R
5|$|Smith said he {{understood}} this would irk the British, but {{insisted that he}} and his government were no longer willing to wait. He had repeatedly offered to respect the judgement of an impartial arbitration team, he reminded Johnston, but the British had shot this idea down each time. He therefore felt compelled to follow the advice given by his own <b>legal</b> <b>team,</b> which was that the appointment was legitimate. His government would not accept a lesser appointment in Lisbon than in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques. He dismissed Johnston's threat to expel the Rhodesian representatives in West Germany, Japan and America; relations with Portugal and South Africa were far more important, he said, as they were Rhodesia's two closest neighbours geographically.|$|E
5|$|The {{hearing was}} held at a {{temporary}} building near the Washington Monument housing offices of the AEC. It began on April 12, 1954, and lasted four weeks. The AEC was represented by Roger Robb, an experienced prosecutor in Washington, and Arthur Rolander, while Oppenheimer's <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> was headed by Lloyd K. Garrison, a prominent New York attorney. The chairman of the Personnel Security Board was Gordon Gray, president of the University of North Carolina. The {{other members of the}} hearing panel were Thomas Alfred Morgan, a retired industrialist, and Ward V. Evans, chairman of the chemistry department at Northwestern University.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{definitely}} {{prove to}} the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour. However, the maximum term the Magistrate could legally impose was three months, and in 1896 they were released at {{the order of the}} High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Henry Brougham Loch. The High Commissioner's <b>legal</b> <b>team</b> subsequently quashed the convictions altogether, saying that the evidence against Daniel and Wilson was not sufficiently conclusive. The existence of Lobengula's box of sovereigns was never proven either way, and the incident never explained beyond doubt.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we assume}} that {{providers}} and customers sign the Service Level Agreement (SLA) that enables the future use of the customer’s previous records of disks before starting the contract so that the provider can enforce the proactive data collection function on the customers. In addition, customers’ data might be present in a data center that is in a different country that has its own law regarding the ownership of that data. Nanda and Hansen pointed out the difficulties of multiple jurisdictions in their proposed Forensic-as-a-Service (FaaS) architecture [17], an infrastructure-level forensic support from cloud providers. The FaaS architecture includes a procedure of <b>legal</b> <b>teams</b> to fetch the data from different jurisdiction.
