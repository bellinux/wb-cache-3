40|$|Long term forest {{research}} {{sites in}} India, going by different names including Linear Tree Increment Plots, <b>Linear</b> Increment <b>Plots,</b> <b>Linear</b> <b>Sample</b> <b>Plots</b> and Permanent Preservation Plots, cover diverse plant communities and environmental conditions. Presently, {{some of these}} long-term observational studies are functional, some are disturbed and others have almost been lost. The accumulated data will become increasingly important {{in the context of}} environmental modelling and climate change, especially if the plots and data can be maintained and/or revived. This contribution presents the history and current state of forest research plots in India, including details of locations and re-measurements. We provide a brief introduction of the National Forest Inventory (NFI), Preservation Plots in natural forests, the 50 -ha Mudumalai Forest Dynamics Plot as part of the Centre for Tropical Forest Science and Smithsonian Institution Global Earth Observatories network (CTFS-SIGEO), and research plots established in plantations for tree growth studies and modelling. We also present some methodological details including assessment and analysis for two types of observational studies, the Tree Count Plots (TCP) and Tree Re-measurement Plots (TRP). Arguments are presented in favour of enumeration and analysis methods which are consistent with current approaches in forest ecological research. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Since its formation, the Forestry Commission has {{upheld a}} {{commitment}} {{to establish and maintain}} a network of permanent mensuration <b>sample</b> <b>plots.</b> The principal use of <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> data is for calibration of models of forest growth and yield, but <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> are ubiquitous in their applications and a wide range of research projects have depended on <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> as a key source of data. The objectives of this report are to provide an overview of the Forestry Commission <b>Sample</b> <b>Plot</b> Research programme, to summarise the data available from <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> records and to consider the potential applications of <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> data and the potential role of <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> in research into the carbon balance of forest ecosystems. In general, the pattern of <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> establishment has followed a strategy aimed at underpinning development and validation of yield models, with roughly equal numbers of plots representing the key and emerging tree species. The <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> network has provided, and continues to provide, a national reserve of periodic growth and yield data to support measurement, growth and yield studies.

40|$|A {{two-phase}} {{sampling design}} {{has been applied}} to forest inventory. First, a large number of fi rst phase <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> were defi ned with a square grid in a geographic coordinate system for two study areas of about 1800 and 4500 ha. The fi rst phase <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> were supplied by auxiliary data of Landsat TM and IRS- 1 C with principal component transformation for stratifi cation and drawing the second phase sample (fi eld sample). Proportional allocation was used to draw the second phase sample. The number of fi eld <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> in the two study areas was 300 and 380. The local estimates of fi ve continuous forest stand variables, mean diameter, mean height, age, basal area, and stem volume, were calculated for each of the fi rst phase <b>sample</b> <b>plots.</b> This was done separately by using one auxiliary data source at a time together with the fi eld sample information. However, if the fi rst phase <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> for which the stand variables were to be estimated was also a fi eld <b>sample</b> <b>plot,</b> the information of that fi eld <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> was eliminated according to the cross validation principle. This was because it was then possible to calculate mean square errors of estimates related to a specifi c auxiliary data source...|$|R
30|$|In {{the next}} step, a grid fishnet was created with cell size {{equal to the}} area of a single <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> (500  m 2) and {{overlaid}} on the study area. For each cell of the grid, the same SVs (as those for <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> presented in Table  1) were computed. Finally, starting from the focal <b>sample</b> <b>plots,</b> adjacent grids were spatially merged to each <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> only if (i) their values were inside earlier computed delineation thresholds for the given variant (dynamic, 5 %, 10 %, 20 %), and (ii) adjacent pixels that met the first assumption could create spatially constant polygons. We allowed that patches could overlap each other. After obtaining all layers representing HPs based on two SVs separately, spatial intersections of polygons representing HPs of both variables per each ground <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> were also created (p 95 [*]×[*]pFRAMe (Intersection)).|$|R

40|$|Earth surface {{systems are}} {{controlled}} {{by a combination of}} global and local factors, which cannot be understood without accounting for both the local and global components. The system dynamics cannot be recovered from the global or local controls alone. Ground forest inventory is able to accurately estimate forest carbon stocks at <b>sample</b> <b>plots,</b> but these <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> are too sparse to support the spatial simulation of carbon stocks with required accuracy. Satellite observation is an important source of global information for the simulation of carbon stocks. Satellite remote-sensing can supply spatially continuous information about the surface of forest carbon stocks, which is impossible from ground-based investigations, but their description has considerable uncertainty. In this paper, we validated the Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ), the Kriging method for spatial interpolation of ground <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> and a satellite-observation-based approach as well as an approach for fusing the ground <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> with satellite observations and an assimilation method for incorporating the ground <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> into LPJ. The validation results indicated that both the data fusion and data assimilation approaches reduced the uncertainty of estimating carbon stocks. The data fusion had the lowest uncertainty by using an existing method for high accuracy surface modeling to fuse the ground <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> with the satellite observations (HASM-SOA). The estimates produced with HASM-SOA were 26. 1 and 28. 4 % more accurate than the satellite-based approach and spatial interpolation of the <b>sample</b> <b>plots,</b> respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Utilization {{of remote}} sensing techniques, {{particularly}} LiDAR’s high resolution scanning {{could be an}} effective tool in describing forest structural features. The study aims to assess LiDAR’s capability in characterizing mangrove forest stand using the available LiDAR dataset in the Philippines. Characterization of the structural attributes between mangrove families is done through separability and variability analysis of the point density distribution. Point densities were grouped at interval of 10 % of the maximum height within the study area and <b>sample</b> <b>plots.</b> Each interval or Height at bincentile (HBj) was combined to produce a single 10 -band image and was subjected to classification. The classification results proved that Rhizophoraceae and Avicenniaceae are separable {{in terms of its}} point density distribution. General point density distribution curve (PDDC) of both mangrove families was established to discriminate <b>sample</b> <b>plots.</b> Maxima of each <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> were compared to the maxima of the established PDDC. Based on the separability test, eight and two out of the fifteen 5 x 5 m <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> were discriminated as Rhizophoraceae and Avicenniaceae, respectively.

30|$|There are 900 {{circular}} ground <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> with 12.62  m radius (500  m 2), systematically distributed {{over the}} study area in a regular grid pattern (350  m[*]×[*] 350  m).

30|$|Within each site, 30 center {{points were}} located along transects running {{perpendicular}} to the long axis of each site. Four circular <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> (0.89 m 2 each) were established at 90 ° angles 7.1 meters around each center point, two along each transect {{and the other two}} {{perpendicular to the}} transects. For each sampling year (1972, 1974, 1980, 2003, 2004), two <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> were randomly selected for sampling. Midsummer of each sampling year, the herbaceous stems within the selected <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> were identified to species, counted, clipped and dried to determine biomass production. The mean of the two <b>sampling</b> <b>plots</b> was used in the analyses. In the earlier published manuscripts (Oswald and Covington 1983, Oswald and Covington 1984), Analysis of Variance (p= 0.05) was used to test the effect of passage of time (1972 to 1980) and severity of burn on biomass production. The Student-Newman-Kuels Multiple Range test was used to test differences. The relatively large number of N’s within each site allowed for statistical analysis even though treatments (burn severities) were not replicated.|$|R
30|$|In this study, each <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> was a seed {{point for}} {{aggregation}} of adjacent cells, if their structural variables were similar. Since we had 900 samples we used all of them. If less {{number of samples}} is available {{they can be used}} as well. Decreasing the number of <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> may reduce only our possibility to map variability in the study area and limit number or range of homogenous patches. Nevertheless, even one <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> can be used to identify grid cells similar to that <b>sample</b> <b>plot,</b> so at least one stratum could be delineated through the whole area. Moreover, this study does not raise issues concerning optimization of the proposed method, where we could include some additional variables and analyze them both separately and together. In this study, we introduced another proposition of the look on the forest structure from the ALS perspective, as an identification trial of HPs, which might be used for different purposes (inter alia: for calibration and/or assessment of coarser resolution remote sensing data).|$|R
