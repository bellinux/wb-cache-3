The obtained sweet syrup was used as sugar replacement in three products (French - type bread, Cherry cake and Kunafah syrup). The sensory evaluation results showed that bread made with 25 % sugar replacement level was better than the control one. For (Cherry cake and Kunafah) {{there were no significant differences}} between the products made with 25 % sugar replacement level and the control samples. The bread dough mad with 25 % sugar replacement had a better rheological properties with regards to stability, rate of absorption and mechanical tolerance indication. The nutritional value of the newly developed product was improved with regards to high amount of protein content compared to control products. No microbial growth was detected in both control and new developed bread products during storage...|$|E

Out of the entire diet, Americans add sugar to beverages more so than any other product. Sugar-Sweetened beverages or sugary drinks are the leading source of added sugars in the American diet. Added sugars include syrups and other caloric sweeteners. Other examples of added sugars, especially ones that can be listed as an ingredient, include brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, glucose, high fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, <b>lactose,</b> malt <b>syrup,</b> maltose, molasses, raw sugar, sucrose, trehalose, and turbinado sugar. The added sugar content is associated with several health concerns like weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, dental implications, and gout. Naturally occurring sugars, {{such as those in}} fruit or milk, are not added sugars. Even though there are several beverages/drinks that have sugar in them, some beverages, such as milk, fruit juice, and diet drinks, fall into a [...] "gray" [...] area because of different contributions to health and weight gain is more complex. Sugar-sweetened beverages contain added sugars such as sucrose or fructose, often in large amounts, which contribute to the overall energy density of diets. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidance on free sugars. Based on the impact of free sugars intake and its effects on weight gain and dental issues the WHO has taken action on such problems. Free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Current evidence suggests that increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with weight gain. Reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages can also reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain in adults. [...] For a normal calorie diet, calories from added sugars should be less than 10 percent of the daily calorie limit. Eating habits that include a lesser amount of added sugars, that can be from reduced intake of sugary drinks, can be associated with reduced risk of CVD in adults, and moderate evidence indicates that these eating patterns are associated with reduced risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer in adults.|$|R
