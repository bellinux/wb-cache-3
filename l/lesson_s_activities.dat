Teachers {{are a key}} component of any F 2 S program, since their acceptance and support influences program implementation and sustainability. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine teacher practices, attitudes, and perceptions about the Decatur F 2 S Program. Methods: City Schools of Decatur teachers completed a questionnaire designed to obtain information concerning their practices, attitudes, and perceptions regarding the Decatur F 2 S Program. Participants indicated their level of agreement with 18 statements using a Likert scale rating, answered an open-ended question, and recorded both implemented and desired F 2 <b>S</b> <b>activities.</b> Cumulative frequencies were determined for all questionnaire items, and themes were extracted for the open-ended question. Results: Seventy percent of K – 12 teachers would like to see F 2 <b>S</b> <b>activities</b> implemented in their classroom, and 28 % of these teachers already implement some F 2 <b>S</b> <b>activity.</b> The majority of teachers had positive perceptions about the Decatur Farm to School Program’s impact on students, the local economy, and the environment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cathepsin S is {{a member}} of the family of {{cysteine}} lysosomal proteases preferentially expressed in macrophages and microglia and is active after prolonged incubation in neutral pH. Upon activation of macrophages by a number of inflammatory mediators, there is an increase in secreted cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>activity</b> accompanied by a decrease in cellular cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>activity</b> and protein content, as well as a decrease in cathepsin S mRNA. The decrease in cathepsin S mRNA and protein at the cellular level is in contrast to the response observed in some in vivo scenarios. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), two growth factors present during cell injury and inflammation but not known to activate macrophages and microglia, on the expression of cathepsin S, cathepsin B, and cathepsin L mRNAs in these cells, and on cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>activity.</b> We then tested the ability of cathepsin S to degrade myelin basic protein, and amyloid beta peptide at both acidic and neutral pH. RESULTS: Basic FGF and NGF treatment of macrophages and microglia significantly increased the levels of cathepsin S, B, and L mRNAs (2 - to 5 -fold). Basic FGF also increased cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>activity</b> intra- and extracellularly. Recombinant human cathepsin S was able to degrade myelin basic protein and monomeric and dimeric amyloid beta peptide at both acidic and neutral pH, as well as to process human amyloid precursor protein generating amyloidogenic fragments. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that bFGF and NGF may be the molecular signals that positively regulate the expression and activity of cysteine lysosomal proteases (cathepsin S in particular) in macrophages and microglia in vivo, and that there is an interplay between these factors and the activators of inflammation. Disruption of the balance between these two categories of signals may underlie the pathological changes that involve cysteine proteases. [URL] / 5 n 5 p 334. htm...|$|R
