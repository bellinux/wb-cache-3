40|$|Part 1 : Full PapersInternational audienceAccess control models {{generally}} {{distinguish between}} {{physical access control}} that mediates access to physical resources such as buildings, sections of buildings or individual rooms, and <b>logical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> that mediates access to logical objects such as information stored in files or databases. All <b>logical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> models make some, more or less implicit, assumptions about the physical access control model, e. g.  that servers are locked {{in a room with}} restricted access. However, problems arise when a logical object gets a physical representation, e. g.  when a file is displayed on a screen or printed, because the <b>logical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> model has no way to ensure, or even to monitor, that the physical access control policies are being enforced. Traditionally, physical access control policies are enforced by compartmentalization. Users are separated from other users and resources by placing them in different physical locations such as different offices in a building. Access {{from one to the other}} is impossible without passing a guard or a door lock, i. e., guards or distribution of keys/access-cards effectively enforce the physical access control policy. However, these mechanisms are generally coarse-grained, inflexible and expensive. In this paper, we propose a Sensor Enhanced Access Control (SEAC) model that extends existing <b>logical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> models with context-awareness. This allows the model to incorporate information about the physical environment and to explicitly define and enforce physical access control policies for logical objects that have physical representations. A prototype implementation of the SEAC model has been developed for the Unix platform. The prototype protects file data when displayed on a computer screen by managing the visibility of windows in the X Window System. Context-awareness is provided by a simple motion detection system build using cheap web-cameras. However, the system is designed so that the sensor component easily can be replaced, making it possible to deploy advanced sensor technologies...|$|E

40|$|Logical policy-based {{access control}} models are greatly {{expressive}} and thus provide the flexibility for administrators {{to represent a}} wide variety of authorization policies. Extensional access control models, on the other hand, utilize simple data structures to better enable a less trained and non-administrative workforce to participate in the day-to-day operations of the system. In this paper, we formally study a hybrid approach, tag-based authorization (TBA), which combines the ease of use of extensional systems while still maintaining a meaningful degree of the expressiveness of logical systems. TBA employs an extensional data structure to represent metadata tags associated with subjects and objects, as well as a logical language for defining the access control policy in terms of those tags. We formally define TBA and introduce variants that include tag ontologies and delegation. We evaluate the resulting system by comparing to well-known extensional and <b>logical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> models. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

40|$|With the {{globalization}} of our society we are increasingly engaged in transactions, both online and offline, with people we do not know. This has created a need for technologies based on reliability that allow individual identification and authentication {{in a way that}} cannot easily be abused.

40|$|Biometrics is an {{emerging}} {{field of research}} {{in recent years and}} has been devoted to the identification of individuals using one or more intrinsic physical or behavioral traits. Fingerprints are the prominent and widely acceptable biometric features compared to face, speech, iris, and other types of biometrics. Fingerprint characteristic or features are unique for everyone and which cannot change throughout the lifetime. Fingerprint biometrics is having applications in diverse fields like attendance system, criminology, mobile applications and <b>logical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> system. This is the purpose behind the popularity of fingerprints as the biometric identifier. The biometric image captured through mobile supportive devices like the mobile camera or USB Fingerprint contains low-quality images. In fingerprint recognition system the quality of the image plays a very important role while matching two fingerprints. Most of the fingerprint recognition systems result in poor matching due to impurity or noisy images. So there is high necessity and scope for image preprocessing and enhancement techniques in order {{to improve the quality of}} fingerprint image and to obtain high accuracy in the matching process.
