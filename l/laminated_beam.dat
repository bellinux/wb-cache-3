40|$|Predicting {{building}} {{damage arising}} from ground movements {{is an important}} aspect for buildings located in an urban environment. Possible approaches range from empirical estimates to detailed finite element calculations. In {{the first part of}} the paper, the main existing methods for predicting damage to buildings are briefly presented, and their potential and limitations discussed. The methods can be classified as strictly empirical, semi-empirical or detailed. The empirical methods include recommendations on the allowable settlement of structures. Early semi-empirical methods consider the building as an equivalent beam and identify the onset of damage by a threshold value of the ratio between the deflection of the equivalent beam and its length being exceeded. Another semi-empirical approach models the building as a <b>laminated</b> <b>beam.</b> It is still a simplified method, but it permits more realistic evaluations to be made. The finite element analyses allow an accurate assessment of the structural behaviour, by taking into account the structural properties; however, they require large amounts of time and computational effort and, despite the complexity of the modelling, they are still affected by the uncertainty of the soil-structure interaction. In order to evaluate the adequacy of the various models, the methods are applied to two case studies. In the first one, two semi-empirical methods are compared: the equivalent beam model and the <b>laminated</b> <b>beam</b> model. The comparison shows that the <b>laminated</b> <b>beam</b> model allows more characteristics of the structure to be taken into account and suggests the presence of damage in some situations that are not considered by the equivalent beam model. In the second case study, the response of an existing reinforced concrete frame structure damaged by differential settlements of the foundations is analyzed considering both the <b>laminated</b> <b>beam</b> model and the three-dimensional finite element approach. The <b>laminated</b> <b>beam</b> does not require a large amount of computational time and effort, and is able to identify the onset of cracking; however it cannot give information about the redistribution of the loads and the stress state in the structural elements. On the other hand, by using the finite element approach, even if a very demanding model is needed, it is possible to understand also the effects of the interaction that can lead the structural members to unsafe conditions...|$|E

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymer laminates {{are increasingly}} {{used in the}} aerospace and civil engineering fields. Identifying cracks in carbon fiber reinforced polymer <b>laminated</b> <b>beam</b> components is of considerable significance for ensuring the integrity and safety of the whole structures. With the development of high-resolution measurement technologies, mode-shape-based crack identification in such <b>laminated</b> <b>beam</b> components has become an active research focus. Despite its sensitivity to cracks, however, this method is susceptible to noise. To address this deficiency, this study proposes a new concept of multi-resolution modal Teager–Kaiser energy, which is the Teager–Kaiser energy of a mode shape represented in multi-resolution, for identifying cracks in carbon fiber reinforced polymer laminated beams. The efficacy of this concept is analytically demonstrated by identifying cracks in Timoshenko beams with general boundary conditions; and its applicability is validated by diagnosing cracks in a carbon fiber reinforced polymer <b>laminated</b> <b>beam,</b> whose mode shapes are precisely acquired via non-contact measurement using a scanning laser vibrometer.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of advanced composites {{materials in the}} field of structures have been known for many years. Theories for bending of multi-layer plates have been developed to predict the stresses that occur when these structures are subjected to transverse loads. It has been noted by several researchers that when laminated structures are loaded by transverse forces, interlaminar shear stresses are generated. The effects of these shear stresses can have a substantial effect upon the stress distribution within a laminated plate or beam. Little effort has been made to produce a simple elastic solution which includes the effects of the interlaminar shear stress. Another area that has been ignored by researchers has been the problem of the diffusion of contact stresses caused by rollers on laminated beams. No-one has investigated this problem to see if the theory produced by Hertz is still applicable. A simple elastic solution for the bending of shear stresses in a five layered <b>laminated</b> <b>beam</b> has been formulated. The theory includes the effects of the interlaminar shear stress. A two-dimensional photo-elastic model has been tested to provide experimental verification of this analysis. This simple elastic theory has then been developed further to predict the bending and shear stresses in a <b>laminated</b> <b>beam</b> composed {{of a large number of}} layers. The theory has also allowed for the laminae having different material properties.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{model of}} fiber {{reinforced}} composite <b>laminate</b> <b>beam</b> with sections of orthogonal shape is presented, in which the stresses due to simultaneously applied torsional and bending moments are found by an analytical solution. The technique followed is based on Sokolnikoff ’s approach {{in conjunction with the}} theory of anisotropic elasticity.

The evaluation of 3 -D stress distributions in beams with sections characterized by various aspect ratios reveals variations of stresses, which depend on the warping combined with flexure in these <b>laminate</b> composite <b>beams.</b> In addition, useful information gained from the study of variation of the elastic properties as well as torsional rigidity for fiber reinforced <b>laminate</b> <b>beams</b> leads to further knowledge for the profile of stress distribution allover the beam.

40|$|After {{structural}} {{fires are}} extinguished, presuming {{the structure is}} not a total loss, structural wood members can be inspected for residual properties. Through this research, we explored alternative methods aimed at keeping structurally compromised wood member’s in service when they would otherwise warrant replacement. For this study, we used 24 F-V 8 DF/DF glued laminated beams that had been loaded to their max capacity; both non-fire damaged and fire damaged. In situations where physical and mechanical changes occur, and the beam warrants individual replacement, a new restoration procedure {{could be used to}} salvage the member. Salvaging the member could mean to keep it in service on a temporary basis or it could mean on a permanent basis. It is thought that sufficient capacity can result from using a carbon fiber wrap as an external reinforcement. Factors that go into the replacement of structural members includes time, labor, and the potential to be very costly. It may not be an economical option. The carbon fiber wrap has the potential to provide a cost effective and non-invasive option in comparison to total member replacement. The overall goals of this study were to 1) investigate the feasibility of cost effectively restoring a compromised glued <b>laminated</b> <b>beam,</b> and allow the member to remain in service, 2) explore vendor recommendations and compare them with measured data, computer simulations, and hand calculations, 3) quantify the amount of strength and stiffness restored, and qualify a procedure to do so. With a resilient, easy to apply carbon fiber wrap that adheres well with the exterior wood fibers, an economical reinforcement method could lead to restoration rather than replacement of fire damaged and/or compromised structural members. With the carbon fiber wrap orientation presented in this research, there were many optimistic results. The results were found by comparing the fire damaged beam results to the test results from the original, undamaged glued <b>laminated</b> <b>beam.</b> Both were compared along with the carbon fiber wrapped fire damaged beam test results and the test results associated with the NDS tabulated design capacity for the glued <b>laminated</b> <b>beam.</b> Through computer modeling, industry collaboration, and laboratory experimentation, we were able to produce a carbon fiber wrap that restored the fire damaged glued <b>laminated</b> <b>beam</b> to a point in which it was deemed adequate to remain in service after warranting replacement. The results show that the carbon fiber wrap technique could provide enough strength (MOR) and stiffness (MOE) to restore the fire damaged glued <b>laminated</b> <b>beam</b> to a state in which it could remain in service.
