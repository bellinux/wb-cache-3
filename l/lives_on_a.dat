25|$|Part of Duffy's talent– besides her ear for {{ordinary}} eloquence, her gorgeous, powerful, throwaway lines, her subtlety– is her ventriloquism. Like {{the best of}} her novelist peers... she slides {{in and out of}} her characters' <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stream of possessions, aspirations, idioms and turns of phrase. However, she is also a time-traveller and a shape-shifter, gliding from Troy to Hollywood, galaxies to intestines, sloughed-off skin to department stores while other poets make heavy weather of one kiss, one kick, one letter... from verbal nuances to mind-expanding imaginative leaps, her words seem freshly plucked from the minds of non-poets– that is, she makes it look easy.|$|E
25|$|Some polls, {{such as the}} Gallup World Poll in 2007 {{revealed}} that significant numbers of Israelis, 20 percent, would ideally, {{if they had the}} opportunity, move permanently to another country. This was in the mid-range of desire to migrate and less than, for example, the residents of Denmark, Belgium, Mexico, Argentina, Italy, Poland, Hungary, South Korea and Chile. The 'push factor' bringing about migration is often reflected in quality of life perceptions. In terms of self ranked quality of life Israelis rate their own <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> scale numbered from zero at the bottom to ten at the top, Israelis' average rating in 2007 was 6.84, which is far higher than the 4 average for the world and compares with Denmark's 8, among the world's top.|$|E
25|$|Henry Bowman is the {{principal}} character, although the story begins in 1906, long before Bowman's birth on January 10, 1953. The story is told primarily from his perspective when {{he is in his}} early forties. Bowman grows up in the St. Louis, Missouri area, where much of the story takes place. He is a trained geologist, a self-taught expert marksman, a firearms, ammunition, and self-defense authority, and a pilot. Bowman <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rural acreage near the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area. There is an abandoned stone quarry on his land which Bowman uses for recreational shooting. Bowman, in the novel, enjoys owning performance automobiles and driving at high speed on interstate highways. In one part of the novel, he races his hot-rodded GMC truck against a rival Porsche, with Bowman winning, driving in excess of 140mph to win. Bowman also has several forged identities that he uses for various purposes in the novel. Bowman is a proficient skydiver.|$|E

Throughout the games, she is almost always depicted as chasing or attempting to find Sonic, and showing him endless displays of affection whenever she's successful (regardless {{of whether or not}} she has Sonic's consent).

[...] neither of which is very helpful). Lucie mounts a stile and spies some white cloths lying in the grass high on a hill behind the farm.

500|$|Literature scholar Tonia Payne {{has written}} that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] {{is an example of}} ecocriticism, wherein Le Guin critiques the idea that human beings are {{separate}} from their natural environment. The premise of the novella involves human beings who live their entire <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ship in interstellar space, and who therefore have to create a new reality for themselves, a notion also explored in Le Guin's short story [...] "Newton's Sleep". The inhabitants of Discovery become unable to relate to representations of Earth. Some, like Hsing and Luis, still try to understand Ti Chiu, keeping in mind their position {{as a part of a}} continuum of people supposed to colonize a new planet. For others, this new reality takes the form of the religious beliefs of the cult of Bliss. These beliefs are portrayed as an understandable attempt to adjust to the reality of spaceflight. A review by Publishers Weekly identified a similar theme, common to the other stories in the [...] "Birthday of the World" [...] collection, of characters coming to terms with the world they live in.|$|E
500|$|Cold Feets {{cast and}} crew were {{frequently}} praised for their depiction of real-life social issues on the series. When Cold Feet began, Christine Langan stated, [...] "The real challenge was to overcome the traditional view {{that many of the}} issues we cover—jealousy, guilt, money, sexual problems, parental death—are ordinary issues, hardy perennials and, as such, not interesting enough for drama." [...] The fourth episode of the first series was controversial due to its depiction of the characters freely discussing their sex lives; in the left-wing New Statesman, Andrew Billen praised it as a homage to La Ronde and, despite the sex-talk, being [...] "intricately constructed as a farce". The right-wing tabloid Daily Mails critic wrote that the episode [...] "veered a little too close last night towards the category of 'adult entertainment', with all its connotations of sleaze and smut" [...] and [...] "we found ourselves immersed in their sex <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> level of embarrassing intimacy which most people would share only with their doctor". A complaint was made by a viewer to the Independent Television Commission—the commercial television regulator—about the depiction of sex, but it was not upheld.|$|E
