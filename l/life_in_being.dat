[...] If B were to remarry to someone who was born after the devise, the new wife would not be a <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> {{at the time of the}} devise. [...] Similarly, any children born to B and his new wife would also not be lives in being at the time of the devise. [...] If B's new wife were to outlive him (making her his widow) and survive him by more than 21 years, then the interest to [...] "B's children then living" [...] would not vest until after the perpetuities period expired (21 years after the death of B, the only relevant <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> at the time of the devise), because only upon the death of the widow can one ascertain who are [...] "B's children then living." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alternately, if B is {{not married}} {{at the time of}} the devise and B were to get married afterwards, again the wife could not be a <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> since she is not {{identifiable}} {{at the time of the}} devise.

2500|$|The fertile octogenarian and {{the unborn}} widow are two legal fictions {{from the law}} of real {{property}} (and trusts) {{that can be used}} either to invoke the rule against perpetuities to make an interest in property void or, alternatively and much more frequently, to demonstrate the seemingly bizarre results that can occur {{as a result of the}} rule. [...] The rule itself, simply stated, makes a future interest in property void if it can be logically proven that there is some possibility of the interest not vesting or failing within 21 years after the end of a <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> at the time the interest is created.|$|E

2500|$|Note that {{changing}} the word [...] "issue" [...] to [...] "children" [...] makes the gift valid: Since {{the class of}} [...] "A's children" [...] is closed and completely cognizable {{at the time of}} A's death (plus a gestation period as allowed by the rule), A's children no longer have a vested remainder subject to open; upon A's death, they now have an indefeasibly vested remainder, which is outside the scope of the Rule against Perpetuities. On the contrary, the class of [...] "A's issue" [...] is subject to expand long after A's death, so their future interest remains that of a vested remainder subject to open, which is within the scope of the rule. [...] B cannot serve as the <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> for A's issue because B was not yet born, i.e., not [...] "a life in being," [...] {{at the time of the}} transfer. [...] Because her death could (as explained above) be more than 21 years after A's death, the result is that the gift to A's issue violates the rule because it is possible that the gift will vest more than 21 years after the end of all lives in being at the time the gift was created.|$|E
2500|$|The unborn widow poses {{a similar}} {{seemingly}} silly but logical problem. Suppose that property is left [...] "to A for life, then to his widow for life, then to A's issue." [...] Because the gift to A's widow cannot be resolved until A dies, {{the law will}} consider the possibility that, after the property is left to A, he marries {{a woman who was}} not born at the time the gift was made. For instance, it is possible that in 1950 the property is left to A, in 1955 a woman B is born, and in 1975 A and B marry each other (neither having issue at the time). Furthermore, it is possible that A will die, say in 1980, and his widow B will outlive him for more than 21 years. Suppose that she dies in 2005. [...] B was not a <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> {{at the time of the}} transfer, and the only remaining [...] "validating life" [...] under the rule against perpetuities is A, who has been dead for 25 years by this time. The gift to A's issue does not vest until his widow dies, and since that could theoretically happen more than 21 years after the death of all lives in being at the time of the transfer, the transfer to A's issue is invalid from the start.|$|E

But now that the poor child was shut up within the iron gates of the king of the mines, at the {{threshold}} of which lay the three-headed Cerberus, there seemed no possibility of her ever making her escape. The dismal Hecate, who loved to take the darkest view of things, told Ceres that she had better come with her to the cavern, and spend the rest of her <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> miserable. Ceres answered that Hecate was welcome to go back thither herself, but that, for her part, she would wander about the earth in quest of the entrance to King Pluto's dominions. And Hecate took her at her word, and hurried back to her beloved cave, frightening a great many little children with a glimpse of her dog's face, as she went.|$|E

60|$|It {{was hardly}} to be {{expected}} that her ladyship would find any relief in {{the society of the}} Marquis and Marchioness of Hampshire; for his lordship passed his <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> the President of scientific and literary societies, and was ready for anything from the Royal, if his turn ever arrived, to opening a Mechanics' Institute in his neighbouring town. Lady Hampshire was an invalid; but her ailment was one of those mysteries which still remained insoluble, although, in the most liberal manner, she delighted to afford her friends all the information in her power. Never was a votary endowed with a faith at once so lively and so capricious. Each year she believed in some new remedy, and announced herself on the eve of some miraculous cure. But the saint was scarcely canonised before his claims to beatitude were impugned. One year Lady Hampshire never quitted Leamington; another, she contrived to combine the infinitesimal doses of Hahnemann with the colossal distractions of the metropolis. Now her sole conversation was the water cure. Lady Hampshire was to begin immediately after her visit to Montacute, and she spoke in her sawney voice of factitious enthusiasm, as if she pitied the lot of all those who were not about to sleep in wet sheets.|$|E
6000|$|The {{immediate}} successors of Francis I. {{continued to}} visit Chambord; {{but it was}} neglected by Henry IV. and was never afterwards a favourite residence of any French king. Louis XIV. appeared there on several occasions, and the apparition was characteristically brilliant; but Chambord could not long detain a monarch {{who had gone to}} the expense of creating a Versailles ten miles from Paris. With Versailles, Fontainebleau, Saint-Germain and Saint-Cloud within easy reach of their capital, the later French sovereigns had little reason to take the air in the dreariest province of their kingdom. Chambord therefore suffered from royal indifference, though in the last century a use was found for its deserted halls. In 1725 it was occupied by the luckless Stanislaus Leczynski, who spent the greater part of his <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> elected King of Poland and being ousted from his throne, and who, at this time a refugee in France, had found a compensation for some of his misfortunes in marrying his daughter to Louis XV. He lived eight years at Chambord and filled up the moats of the castle. In 1748 it found an illustrious tenant in the person of Maurice de Saxe, the victor of Fontenoy, who, however, two years after he had taken possession of it, terminated a life which would have been longer had he been less determined to make it agreeable. The Revolution, of course, was not kind to Chambord. It despoiled it in so far as possible of every vestige of its royal origin, and swept like a whirlwind through apartments to which upwards of two centuries had contributed a treasure of decoration and furniture. In that wild blast these precious things were destroyed or for ever scattered. In 1791 an odd proposal was made to the French Government by a company of English Quakers, who had conceived the bold idea of establishing in the palace a manufacture of some peaceful commodity not to-day recorded. Napoleon allotted Chambord, as a [...] "dotation," [...] to one of his marshals, Berthier, for whose benefit it was converted, in Napoleonic fashion, into the so-called principality of Wagram. By the Princess of Wagram, the marshal's widow, it was, after the Restoration, sold to the trustees of a national subscription which had been established for the purpose of presenting it to the infant Duke of Bordeaux, then prospective King of France. The presentation was duly made; but the Comte de Chambord, who had changed his title in recognition of the gift, was despoiled of his property by the government of Louis Philippe. He appealed for redress to the tribunals of his country; and the consequence of his appeal was an interminable litigation, by which, however, finally, after the lapse of twenty-five years, he was established in his rights. In 1871 he paid his first visit to the domain which had been offered him half a century before, a term of which he had spent forty years in exile. It was from Chambord that he dated his famous letter of the 5th of July of that year--the letter, directed to his so-called subjects, in which he waves aloft the white flag of the Bourbons. This rare miscalculation--virtually an invitation to the French people to repudiate, as their national ensign, that immortal tricolour, the flag of the Revolution and the Empire, under which they have won the glory which of all glories has hitherto been dearest to them and which is associated with the most romantic, the most heroic, the epic, the consolatory, period of their history--this luckless manifesto, I say, appears to give the measure of the political wisdom of the excellent Henry V. The proposal should have had less simplicity or the people less irony.|$|E
