Following research carried out on French and other European railways, the modern pre-stressed concrete sleeper was developed.

40|$|Railway traffic {{continuously}} increasing, ballasted tracks {{need more}} efficient maintenance processes. Lines with <b>long</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> which {{are prone to}} buckling during heat waves require stabilisation before being fully operational. Stabilisation is performed either naturally using regular traffic at penalising lower speeds, dynamic stabilisation of sleepers or alternatively crib compaction. The objective {{of this paper is}} to apply the NSCD approach of DEM to simulate the processes of dynamic stabilisation and crib compaction as they are realised on site and compare their performance in terms of ballast compaction and lateral resistance. The results showed that NSCD is perfectly appropriate to simulate these maintenance processes and estimate their performance...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of concrete sleeper becomes very important due {{to increase in}} train speed and {{development of}} the <b>long</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails.</b> Due to this, it is necessary to increase the weight and the strength of the concrete sleepers to resist track buckling and reduce vibration in ballast. Modem high speed trains impart considerable amount of impact energy to the track and this also generates high frequency vibrations in the rails. Sleeper should be able to absorb the impact energy and damp vibrations to a considerable extent and transmit the balance safely to the ballast. At higher speed, the stress component of the Prestressed Concrete Sleeper developed on quasi-static response to dynamic force. This can lead to fairly high tensile stresses in sleepers and problem of concrete sleepers cracking. The investigation under the positive bending moment test will analyse the dynamic load of the Prestressed Concrete Sleeper. The report of this experimental project is to make an analysis of the experiment on the structural behaviour of the Prestressed Concrete Sleeper under 3, 000, 000 and 5, 000, 000 cycles of dynamic load...|$|E
40|$|The {{track is}} the {{infrastructure}} of the railway system. In addition to its construction cost, the maintenance cost constitutes {{an important part of}} the expenditure in railway management and operation. A train with a certain wheel load which runs at a certain speed imposes an external force on the track. The means to withstand against this force is provided by the strength of the track structure. The track structure forms a wheel running way, provide maintenance capacity for checking and restoring the deformation and deterioration of the track. For many years railway line were laid on wooden and metal sleepers. Due to the development of <b>long</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> and an increase in the train speed, it becomes necessary to increase the weight and strength of the sleepers to resist track buckling and reduce vibration in ballast. This experimental project is a preliminary study on dynamic testing of Prestressed Railway Concrete Sleepers (PCS). Two specimens were tested; one on the static loading and the other one on the dynamic loading with constant load, to simulate the actual loading condition from axle load of the train. From the experimental work; results of deflections versus load, deflection versus cycles (hours), stress versus strain, were plotted and location of cracks were shown...|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the work}} of {{maintaining}} the track was at the joints, especially as the stiff rails became dipped, and the joint sleepers took a hammering. Pre-war experiments with <b>long</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> lengths were built upon, and in the years from 1960 long rail lengths were installed, at first on hardwood sleepers but soon on concrete sleepers. For example, the first <b>long</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> (almost 1 mi) on the UK's East Coast Main Line was laid in 1957, just south of Carlton-on-Trent, resting on rubber pads to resist rail creep. In this pioneering stage, some catastrophic mistakes in detailed design were made, but from about 1968 continuous <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> became a reliable standard for universal installation on main and secondary routes. The form adopted used pre-stressed concrete sleepers and a 110A rail section - a slight improvement on the 109 rails previously used - the A was to distinguish it from the British Standard 110 lb/yd rail section, which was unsuitable. Rail fastenings eventually converged onto a proprietary spring clip made by the Pandrol company which was the exclusive form of fastening in Britain for about 30 years.|$|R

30|$|Continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> (CWRs) are an {{important}} technology in modern railway track structures. Nowadays, most new railways worldwide belong to super <b>long</b> continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> tracks. In addition, along with the rapid development of high-speed railways in recent years, new technologies in track structure {{have been widely used}} for ballastless tracks, large-sized welded turnouts, CWRs on long-span bridges, etc. As there is an additional longitudinal rail force caused by track-bridge interaction, it poses important challenges to preventing the expansion and breaking of CWRs, especially track buckling and breakage on long-span bridges which severely threat the track structures of high-speed railways based on ballastless tracks [1, 2, 3]. In high-temperature seasons, an excessively high longitudinal tension in rail bars may cause track buckling, lifting, rail-pad shifting, part damage and malfunction, etc. In low-temperature seasons, rail bars under an excessively high longitudinal tension are likely to cause track breakage. The accurate measurement of longitudinal rail stress and rail temperature is the key to scientific evaluation, management and maintenance of CWRs [4, 5].|$|R
40|$|The in-situ {{measurement}} of thermal stress in slender beams, or <b>long</b> continuous <b>welded</b> <b>rails,</b> may prevent structural anomalies. With this aim, we investigated the coupling dynamics between a beam and the highly nonlinear solitary waves propagating along a straight granular chain {{in contact with}} the beam. We hypothesized that these waves can be used to measure the stress of thermally loaded structures, or to infer the neutral temperature, i. e., the temperature at which this stress is null. We studied numerically and experimentally the mechanical interaction of one and two straight chains of spherical particles in contact with a prismatic beam that is subjected to heat. The results show that certain features of the waves are affected by the beamâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s stress. In the future, these findings may be used to develop a novel nondestructive evaluation technique for the prediction of neutral temperature and thermal buckling...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in trains velocity and {{the improvement of}} comfort on railways belong to both the improvement of vehicles performances and {{to the use of}} the <b>long</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> (LWR). The analysis of the thermal set-up of the track is fundamental for the sake of the railway transport network performances: it basically deals with the changes in spans and strains occurring daily after temperature ranges. This phenomenon is described by the free dilatation law for tracks without bonds and by the stopped dilatation law for completely constrained tracks. The thermal analysis of the LWR shows a cyclic soliciting phenomenon belonging to both the daily temperature ranges and to the effects of moving vehicles: from this point of view a repetition of strains which involves an appropriate fatigue verification of the railways can be identified. For this reason the authors propose a procedure based on the synergic application of the Woehler construction theory for the fatigue curves and of the Miner law of linear accumulation. Once the Woehler curves are found as function of the different stress state due to the thermal variations and to the moving vehicles passing, the comprehensive damage for both kinds of strains can be quantified by means of the Miner theory. For this purpose the authors propose the implementation of a calculation software which can automate the thermal lay-out analysis phase, performing the Woehler curve, the internal stresses computation and the damage analysis following Miner’s law. In conclusion, this research is an useful tool for an effective maintenance of the LWR, as it allows the monitoring of the stress state of tracks, especially during the last part of their life cycle, when the temperature range and the moving vehicles passage consequences are more severe...|$|R
2500|$|If not restrained, rails would {{lengthen}} in {{hot weather}} and shrink in cold weather. To provide this restraint, the rail is prevented from moving {{in relation to the}} sleeper by use of clips or anchors. Attention needs to be paid to compacting the ballast effectively, including under, between, and at the ends of the sleepers, to prevent the sleepers from moving. Anchors are more common for wooden sleepers, whereas most concrete or steel sleepers are fastened to the rail by special clips that resist longitudinal movement of the rail. There is no theoretical limit to how <b>long</b> a <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> can be. However, if longitudinal and lateral restraint are insufficient, the track could become distorted {{in hot weather}} and cause a derailment. Distortion due to heat expansion is known in North America as sun kink, and elsewhere as buckling. In extreme hot weather special inspections are required to monitor sections of track known to be problematic. In North American practice extreme temperature conditions will trigger slow orders to allow for crews to react to buckling or [...] "sun kinks" [...] if encountered.|$|R
