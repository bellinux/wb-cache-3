25|$|The Umnumzaan {{implements}} {{a version}} of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock. The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the Sebenza folding pocket knife. This lock employs a titanium <b>lock</b> <b>bar,</b> milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> comes in direct contact with the back of the blade, thus locking the blade in the open position. The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functionsthe ball acts as the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm as the knife assumes the open position. The ball also mates with a detent in the blade in the closed position to secure the blade from opening accidentally.|$|E

25|$|Linerlock {{mechanisms}} are most commonly composed of titanium alloy or steel. The linerlock's locking side liner is split {{from the top}} toward the bottom, similar to an automotive leaf spring (also called a <b>lock</b> <b>bar)</b> that butts up against the tang of the blade to prevent the blade from closing. In an interview with Blade in 1988, Walker stated, “This long leaf-spring effect cuts down on stress on the locking mechanism". As the lock on the original electrician's knife was mostly to hold a screwdriver blade open (the knife blade, itself was secured by a slip joint method), Walker's refinements prevented the knife blade from closing on the user's hand and converted it into a true lock.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before this}} generational change, a <b>Lock</b> <b>Bar</b> Stabilizer (or LBS) {{was added to}} prevent 'hyperextension' of the {{titanium}} <b>lock</b> <b>bar.</b> While this change is {{commonly referred to as}} part of the second generation Umnumzaan, there are a few models made in early-mid 2012 which have both the old pivot brushing and the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> stabilizer, although these are relatively rare.|$|E

2500|$|The Umnumzaan is {{a folding}} pocket knife {{manufactured}} by Chris Reeve Knives of Boise, Idaho, and designed by Chris Reeve. The name [...] "Umnumzaan" [...] {{is derived from}} the Zulu language, meaning [...] "Head of the family," [...] or [...] "Boss" [...] (colloq.), a tribute to Mr. Reeve's South Africa origins.The Umnumzaan was designed {{to meet the needs of}} operators seeking a heavy-duty folder capable of handling heavy use and even abuse. Building upon the Sebenza’s success, the Umnumzaan features: a stronger pivot joint, a thicker blade, a different blade grind with a reinforced tip, improved ergonomics, thicker titanium handles, a thicker titanium <b>lock</b> <b>bar,</b> a stronger ceramic ball detent system, a larger titanium spacer (sometimes called a “stand off”), a phosphor-bronze washer system designed to act as a ‘dry-sump’ to retain lubrication and keep dirt out, an oversized ambidextrous-thumb studs & extended <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> to aid operation when wearing gloves, a lanyard pivot joint that uses pivoting lanyard tie bars, and a deeply textured grip.|$|E

2500|$|Sebenza: [...] {{production}} 1991–present. [...] Folding knife, {{introducing a}} stronger {{variation of the}} Walker linerlock called the Sebenza Integral Lock, also {{commonly known as the}} framelock. [...] The Sebenza is a utility knife with titanium handles and was originally introduced with an ATS-34 stainless steel blade, followed by BG-42 and as of this writing, CPM S35VN steel. [...] The Sebenza comes in two sizes, with blade lengths of 75mm/2.94" [...] (Small Sebenza) and 92mm/3.625" [...] (Large Sebenza). There are currently 3 different models out, in chronological order they are the regular, classic, and current 21 model. The major difference is between the regular and classic/21 model. The regular has scalloping and a smaller <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> access cut out. The classic is very similar to the 21 (being its predecessor), with the main difference being the classic stamp on the lock side of the knife as well as having a rounded <b>lock</b> <b>bar.</b> They offer inlays ranging from micarta to wood to even ivory on the classic and 21 models. Even though the regular has been discontinued for a few years, they still offer it annually with different inlays every year.|$|E
50|$|The {{lack of a}} <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> on many Weaver-type {{accessories}} also lends {{to another}} alignment issue: Canting. Though this problem is not common {{it can be very}} problematic especially with scopes. Because scopes need to be mounted to a rifle in perfect parallel to the barrel and to ensure the cross hairs sit exactly where a bullet will go (POI), a small variation of even ¼ of one degree can cause massive problems at longer ranges. The <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> holds the mount in a perfect 90 degree to the rail system where as a non-locking bar system can cant to the left or right. This canting (sometimes called jamming of surfaces) is caused by not matching the clamping surface perfectly to the rail. When tightened down, stress exerted on the base can cause the scope to be off from the POI by as much as several feet at 100-200 yards and gets progressively worse the farther out the range goes. Lower grade materials used in manufacturing of scope bases, inconsistent design tolerances from one manufacturer to another and other factors can cause twisting stress and cause the mount to move out of parallel with the rifle barrel. The <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> system allows for even stress to be distributed and prevent canting of the scope mount.|$|R
50|$|The Lock Back Safety mechanism, also {{invented by}} Ron Lake, {{is similar in}} {{function}} to the LAWKS mechanism. It is a lockback folder with a switch that can prevent the <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> from being depressed. Inside the handle {{there is a small}} rod with a flange near the butt of the handle. The other end is connected to a switch near the pivot end. When the switch is pulled back (away from the pivot) the lock functions as a regular lockback. When the switch is closed the flange on the rod slides under tip of the <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> at the butt end. This prevents the depression of the bar and the blade from unlocking. When the knife is closed the system functions the same way to lock it closed or allow it to open.|$|R
5000|$|Three signalmen {{were present}} in the signalbox, the enquiry found that one of them had pulled the wrong lever; he had {{intended}} to set the points for the incoming train but instead set the points ahead of the Scarborough. <b>Locking</b> <b>bars</b> should have prevented these points from being changed as the signal ahead of the Scarborough was set to clear. Unfortunately one of the other signalmen was setting the signals behind the Scarborough train to danger, in contravention of the rules this was done whilst the train was still passing. This therefore disengaged the <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> on the points for a few seconds before the Scarborough train reached it, allowing them to be changed by the application of the wrong lever. A combination of these two failings led to the disaster.|$|R
2500|$|Inkosi: Production 2015–present. [...] Known as the [...] "Chief" [...] in Zulu, the Inkosi {{features}} a large hollow grind, twin over sized washers, a strengthened pivot and sturdy lock up. While challenging {{the standards of}} the Integral Lock®, the Inkosi uses a ceramic ball as an interface for the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> to the blade tang for a consistent lock-up. The washer diameter is wider than the blade securing zero sideways play. With larger lubrication holes there is even less surface area of friction. Finally, the large hollow grind provides a shallow radius, for improved strength, making it half way between a flat grind and our standard hollow grind.|$|E
2500|$|The Sebenza is {{a folding}} pocket knife {{manufactured}} by Chris Reeve Knives of Boise, Idaho. [...] It is constructed with {{a stainless steel}} blade and titanium handle. [...] Its handle functions as the lock mechanism similar in concept to the Walker linerlock differing in that the handle itself forms the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> which holds the blade open. [...] This mechanism was invented by Chris Reeve, and is called the Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L). [...] It is also {{commonly referred to as}} the Framelock, {{and is one of the}} most widely implemented locking systems in the folding knife industry, where lock strength and reliability is a product requirement. [...] The name Sebenza is derived from the Zulu word meaning [...] "Work," [...] a tribute to Mr. Reeve's South African origins.|$|E
