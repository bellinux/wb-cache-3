25|$|Settlements in {{the region}} of Rapperswil date back at least 5000 years. Atop the Lindenhof hill {{overlooking}} a former small village (Endingen), Rapperswil Castle was built around 1220 by the Counts of Rapperswil and is first mentioned in 1229. The town was founded when the nobility of Rapperswil moved from Altendorf across the lake to Rapperswil. The town was soon acquired by the Habsburg family who, in 1358/60, built the wooden bridge across the upper Lake Zürich. Later, the town bought itself free, and ending Old Zürich War made an alliance with the Swiss Confederation. Because of its strategic location along important infrastructure the town grew rich because of flourishing trade. This allowed a certain degree of freedom which was ended with the formation of Swiss cantons by Napoleon. Rapperswil was at first part of the Helvetic canton of Linth. After 1803's Act of Mediation, it joined the canton of St. Gallen. The <b>locational</b> <b>advantage</b> of the place attracted the national Circus Knie who built its headquarters in Rapperswil in 1919. The circus is now also responsible for the Knie's Kinderzoo and the Circus Museum.|$|E

For the case of Hungary, the analysis is carried out {{on the basis of}} eight detailed company case studies (this number is expected to increase to ten). The majority of these is vertical FDI (close to 100 % of export/sales ratio), and two companies represent a confluential case of vertical and horizontal (domestic market oriented) FDI, where sales to the domestic market are also important, though not dominating. The paper’s main aim is to make an attempt at contributing to filling some gaps in the literature, in terms of analysing <b>locational</b> <b>advantages</b> for vertical FDI in services, specifically in business services. It shows that <b>locational</b> <b>advantages,</b> taken into consideration by vertical and horizontal FDI differ from each other to a great extent.

40|$|The study {{assesses the}} {{employment}} dynamics of LAU 1 regions in Czechia (Czech Republic) {{in the period}} 2001 - 2011 using the territorial approach. It is operationalised {{on the basis of}} typological regions. Regions are differentiated fi rstly by their rurality according to the OECD methodology and the development of non-agricultural employment is used as the second differentiating characteristic. This refl ects the regional differentiation based on the character of regional employment development potential. The specifi cs of rural regions are highlighted. Employment dynamics are assessed {{in the light of the}} process of employment restructuring both in its territorial and sectoral characteristics. The results illustrate employment in the service sector to be a viable driver of employment development regardless the degree of rurality but in absolute effects conditioned by its value. Furthermore, employment development is conditioned by the sectoral structure of regional employment. Components of employment development are identifi ed by application of shift-share analysis. The strength of the competitive effect describing the existence of <b>locational</b> <b>advantages</b> for specifi c sectors is further relativised to calculate its relevance for employment change. In conclusion, the existence of <b>locational</b> <b>advantages</b> has only a minor impact in terms of its relative size on employment change that would normally be expected. Therefore, either more precise regional differentiation is needed or more disaggregated groups of sectors should be used...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the dynamics of}} industrial development in the areas where Thailand borders with neighbouring countries. It argues that the <b>locational</b> <b>advantages</b> approach 'one that focuses on social and economic connections in border towns, government investments, policy measures {{and the role of}} export-oriented multinational companies' is not necessarily an appropriate approach. An investigation is conducted to find out to what extent the <b>locational</b> <b>advantages</b> approach applies to Thai border towns. An assessment of the government role in promoting and managing industrial development has also been undertaken to identify the success of this industrial decentralisation scheme. Other factors that contribute to industrial development are also examined. 	The thesis uses a comparative case study approach, comparing sponsored and non-sponsored towns, and presents four case studies of border towns in Thailand, bordering Myanmar and Laos. This research method provides a better assessment than an internal assessment of government programmes would. The results show that the dynamics of industrial development in Thai border towns is better explained by the production network approach emphasising the embeddedness of small and medium sized local manufacturing industries. The entrepreneurship and social networks of entrepreneurs promote the emergence and growth of industrial development. Horizontal industrial relationships promote flexible operations and compensate for limited access and resources in border towns. In addition, a border location does not by itself stimulate economic link with the neighbouring country because negative perception and regulatory barriers to the crossing of borders hinder mutual cooperation. Due to the discrepancy between government assumptions programmes and the dynamics of industrial development, the survey shows that the impacts of government investments on industrial development are marginal. The thesis concludes that the applicability of the <b>locational</b> <b>advantages</b> approach for industrial development in Thai border towns is limited and that the policy of the government and international agencies should be diverse and should consider other approaches such as a production network approach. Similarly, government programmes should accommodate the needs of small and medium sized manufacturing industries. The role of local government and the private sectors in minimising barriers to the crossing of borders should also be considered...|$|R

By the early 70's, local real estate developers, keeping in mind the <b>locational</b> <b>advantage</b> of the area, started developing the area by deforesting the remaining jungles and acquiring the farmlands from the villagers of Pasonda and Bhopura. Streets were laid, and other civic amenities like sanitation, drainage, electricity etc. were taken care of and numerous plots of varying sizes were sold off. Until, the late nineties, almost all the plots had landed {{in the hands of}} small and big builder-promoters, who promptly constructed an apartment building on every plot, thus over-burdening the infrastructure greatly. This, until the close of the last decade, caused a lot of infrastructural problems right from frequent load shedding to water-scarcity, etc. but those were teething problems every new establishment faces, and now they are beginning to get sorted out as is also the case in other neighbouring localities.|$|E

Any paper mill uses huge amounts of water and is normally located close to a river. However, in this case it is located far from the nearest river, primarily because of its <b>locational</b> <b>advantage</b> near the highway. It draws a huge amount of underground water and environmentalists worry that this may lead to a drop in the underground water table level in the long run. The discharge of poisonous gases such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide was a cause of major concern for the neighboring people.

The strife between the factory management and the locals ("Krishna Tissue Dushon Protirodh Committee") is still happening.|$|E

50|$|Georgists have {{observed}} that privately created wealth is socialized via the tax system (e.g., through income and sales tax), while socially created wealth in land values are privatized {{in the price of}} land titles and bank mortgages. The opposite would be the case if land rents replaced taxes on labor as the main source of public revenue; socially created wealth would become available for use by the community, while the fruits of labor would remain private. According to Georgists, a land value tax can be considered a user fee instead of a tax, since it is related to the market value of socially created <b>locational</b> <b>advantage,</b> the privilege to exclude others from locations. Assets consisting of commodified privilege can be considered as wealth since they have exchange value, similar to taxi medallions. A land value tax, charging fees for exclusive use of land, as a means of raising public revenue is also a progressive tax tending to reduce economic inequality, since it applies entirely to ownership of valuable land, which is correlated with income, and there is generally no means by which landlords can shift the tax burden onto tenants or laborers.|$|E
