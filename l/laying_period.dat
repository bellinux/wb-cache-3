5|$|Extra-pair {{copulation}} with neighbouring birds {{has been}} recorded and may be a reason for adult males {{to stay close to}} the female before and during the egg <b>laying</b> <b>period.</b> Females may sometimes associate with two males and all three help in raising the brood. The typical clutch consists of two eggs which are incubated in turns by both parents. The eggs are brick red with the broad end covered more densely with blotches of red, brown, and black. The parents begin incubating soon after the first egg is laid leading to asynchronous hatching. The first egg hatches after about 42 days. The second chick may hatch three to five days later and a longer delay increases the likelihood that it will die of starvation. In cliffs where the nests are located close to each other, young birds have been known to clamber over to neighbouring nests to obtain food. In the Spanish population, young fledge and leave the nest after 90 to 110 days. Fledged birds continue to remain dependent on their parents for at least a month.|$|E
5|$|The first egg {{is often}} laid when the nest {{is little more}} than a pad of grass, and a further egg is laid on each {{subsequent}} day. Both sexes incubate the eggs, which start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended <b>laying</b> <b>period.</b> The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to six weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood, but the corn crake usually does. Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.|$|E
500|$|Breeding {{behavior}} commences with a courtship chase {{with the}} female running in a crouch, pursued by the male, who adopts a more upright stance and has his neck outstretched. The female may stop and lower her head and tail to allow copulation; this takes just a few seconds, but may be repeated several times in an hour. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves, sometimes with a loose canopy, built in a depression and hidden under a grass tussock or small bush; it may be on dry ground or slightly raised above standing water, or occasionally floating. The nest is about [...] across with the internal cup [...] deep, and [...] wide. The clutch size is from 3 to 11 pink-coloured eggs; the first is often laid when the nest {{is little more than}} a pad of grass, and a further egg is laid on each subsequent day.

40|$|The {{effects of}} light {{intensity}} during rearing and beak trimming and dietary fiber sources on {{the incidence of}} cannibalism were investigated with 2, 880 ISA Brown hens.

At 15 wk of age, all birds were transferred to laying cages with five birds per cage. At 17 wk of age, four diets containing different concentrations of dietary fiber were offered: a commercial (wheat) diet, high insoluble fiber (millrun) diet, high soluble fiber (barley) diet, and high soluble fiber diet plus enzyme.

50|$|In penduline tits (Remiz pendulinus), uniparental care is dominant, {{and either}} sex {{is capable of}} {{desertion}} during the egg <b>laying</b> <b>period.</b> Typically, females care 50-70% of the time, males care 5-20% of the time, and both parents desert 30-40% of the time, condemning the offspring to death. In this system, males build elaborate nests and usually desert once these nests have been filled with the females' eggs. As a result, in response, females have adopted two counter-adaptive behaviors that function to deceive the male regarding the clutch's progress. Females conceal their eggs by burying them and aggressively attack males who approach the nest during the egg <b>laying</b> <b>period.</b> Indeed, studies have shown a high correlation between length of time a male stays before deserting and number of days a female keeps her eggs buried. This relationship suggests that egg burial has evolved as an adaptive female behavior that attempts to control information males use {{to decide whether or}} not they should desert.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Six {{lines of}} Japanese quail {{were derived from}} a single {{foundation}} population. Four of the lines were {{selected on the basis}} of family mean three week body weight, two were unselected and all lines were randomly mated. Quail were housed in wire batteries during the brooding, rearing and <b>laying</b> <b>periods.</b> During the brooding period, hover temperature and floor space per chick were similar from line to line. For the rearing and <b>laying</b> <b>periods,</b> floor space per chick was approximately the same from line to line. During an outbreak of ulcerative enteritis (diagnosed on the basis of gross and histopathology) in generation 31 and again in generation 34, mortality ranged from zero for males of one control line to approximately 50 percent for females of one selected line. Analysis of variance showed that incidence of mortality differed significantly among lines and between sexes. Mortality was generally higher in selected than in control lines and in females than in males. It is suggested that susceptibility to ulcerative enteritis in quail may be a polygenically inherited trait and that the inbreeding which accompanied selection for body size may have made some loci homozygous for susceptibility alleles. ULCERATIVE enteritis was first ob-served in quail and termed "quail dis-ease " (Morse, 1907). The etiological agent was identified as an anaerobic gram positive spore forming bacillus (Peckham, 1959) and has been designated Clostridium colinum (Berkhoff et al., 1974). Ulcerative enteritis is ahighly infectious disease (Peckham, 1972). Captive and wild avian species in which the disease has been reported include certain species of pheasants, grouse, partridge, tur-keys and quail (Buss et al., 1958).

[...] Vent pecking is associated with indicators of stress, e.g. fluctuating asymmetry, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio, and tonic immobility duration.

[...] Housing design can influence vent pecking. Mortality caused by cannibalism was reduced when hens had sufficient room to perch all facing the feed trough, thus giving their perch-mates little opportunity to peck at the vent region [...] and increased pecking activity and cannibalistic behaviour can occur due to inadequate height of the perches. [...] Larger group sizes lead to increases in vent pecking suggesting that social learning plays a role.|$|E

50|$|Experiments by Ando and Hartley (1982) and Simmons and Thomas (2004) {{show that}} there is a {{trade-off}} between wing morphology and reproductive ability. The macropterous individuals have an overall lower fecundity, or fertility, than the long-winged individuals. The length of a female depends on the extent of abdominal swelling due to the amount of eggs the individual is holding. The macropterous females were shorter in length than the long-winged morphs and therefore do not carry as many eggs. The number of eggs within the ovaries is the same between the two phenotypes; however, the number of eggs in production at any given time is significantly lower in extra long-winged individuals. Lowered fecundity in macropterous females is largely {{due to the fact that}} the pre-oviposition, the period between the emergence of an adult female and the start of her egg <b>laying</b> <b>period,</b> for these individuals is more than twice that of the long-winged morphs. Another cause is the lower oviposition rate that emacropterous females experience during the first half of the egg-laying period which never allows them to catch up to the normal egg laying rate. The delay in maturation and lower egg production reduces the amount of extra weight on the insect allowing it to be capable of longer flight.|$|E

After eggs are laid, it is strictly uniparental incubation and offspring care; however, either parent may take the role of caregiver.
