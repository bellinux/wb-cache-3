50|$|An {{attempt by}} the Air Ministry {{to take over the}} Perry Oaks sewage sludge works to fit in the top left corner of a ∇ layout of three runways caused furious exchanges with Middlesex County Council, who had to resist, as that would need first {{building}} somewhere else to treat the sewage sludge handled there, and building new <b>connecting</b> <b>sewers,</b> all in wartime.|$|R
50|$|In 1961, Brisbane was a {{city with}} no town planning, many unpaved streets, limited water supply and few areas with sewers—relying instead on {{outhouses}} or septic tanks. Through the 1960s Jones successfully led the council to develop a town plan, seal roads, improve drainage and <b>connect</b> <b>sewers</b> {{to most of the}} city. The city council, under his stewardship, purchased city properties to build underground car parks, which were then topped with public parks and gardens.|$|R

Together they found cost-cutting ways to fix some problems. For example, new sewers were laid 4 feet deep and in footpaths, rather than 6 feet deep and under roads. In the short term, [...] "pocket" [...] or local sewerage treatment plants were established around the city in various suburbs to avoid the expense of developing a major treatment plants and major <b>connecting</b> <b>sewers.</b>|$|R

25|$|Concerning sewerage, out of 1,896 systems, 1,873 were {{separate}} sewer systems (between sanitary sewers and stormwater sewers) and only 23 were combined sewer systems. In 2002 about 75 {{million people were}} <b>connected</b> to <b>sewers</b> and 35 million people had their waste water treated through small-scale waste water treatment devices called jōkasōs. They are common in areas not <b>connected</b> to <b>sewers,</b> but also exist in areas <b>connected</b> to <b>sewers.</b> There is even a specific jōkasō law that regulates their construction, installation, inspection and desludging. Jōkasōs use different technologies and serve different sizes of buildings from single-family homes to high-rise buildings, public or commercial buildings. Treated water can be easily reused for various purposes such as toilet flushing, watering gardens or car washing. Sludge from jōkasōs {{can be used as}} fertilizer. The government has a program to subsidize the installation of jōkasōs. It has been attempted to transfer the technology to China and Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|Concerning sanitation, 29% of {{the urban}} {{population}} are <b>connected</b> to <b>sewers</b> and 30% are served by septic tanks or improved household-level latrines. While these figures are low, they are actually {{higher than the average}} access in Sub-Saharan Africa.|$|R

25|$|Around AD 100, direct {{connections}} {{of homes}} to sewers began, and the Romans completed {{most of the}} sewer system infrastructure. Sewers were laid throughout the city, serving public and some private latrines, and also served as dumping grounds for homes not directly <b>connected</b> to a <b>sewer.</b> It was mostly the wealthy whose homes were <b>connected</b> to the <b>sewers,</b> through outlets that ran under {{an extension of the}} latrine.|$|R
25|$|Concerning sanitation, {{while most}} of the {{population}} is served by sewers, according to one source about 12 million people (18%) out of 65 are served by on-site sanitation systems such as septic tanks. The above-mentioned inventory by the Ministry of Agriculture notes that out of 40m inhabitants of rural areas – 25m permanent and 15m seasonal inhabitants – 21m are <b>connected</b> to a <b>sewer</b> system, 10.6m should be connected and 9.6m cannot be connected. The total of those not <b>connected</b> to <b>sewers</b> (20.2 million) is higher because it includes seasonal inhabitants. The government intends to increase the coverage to the sewer networks in rural areas, in particular in ecologically vulnerable zones.|$|R
25|$|Access to {{safe water}} and {{adequate}} sanitation in Germany is universal. More than 99 percent of users {{are connected to}} a public water supply system.

High phosphorus levels in the lake remain problematic.|$|R
50|$|Simplified {{sewerage}} is {{most widely}} used in Brazil. It is estimated that in Brazil some 5 million people in over 200 towns and cities are served with simplified sewerage - or condominial sewerage.

40|$|Vortex drop shafts {{are widely}} used in {{practice}} to <b>connect</b> <b>sewer</b> mains characterized by large elevation difference. These structures conventionally include three key elements: intake structure, vertical shaft and outlet structure, also named dissipation chamber. The latter has not received much attention {{as compared to the}} first two parts, and only few experimental investigations are currently available from the literature (Viparelli, 1950; Kellenberger, 1988). Actually some rules of thumb are available as design criteria (ATV, 1998; Hager, 1999), but no systematic hydraulic investigation is available so far. The aim of the present study is to present preliminary results of an experimental campaign conducted at the Department of Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering, University of Naples, Italy. The physical model of a vortex drop shaft allowed the Authors to investigate the main hydraulic features of the dissipation chamber, in order to characterize the performance of various types of outlet structures...|$|R

25|$|In many {{suburban}} {{and rural areas}} households are not <b>connected</b> to <b>sewers,</b> and they rather use on-site sewage facilities or decentralised treatment if they are connected to piped water and use flush toilets. They discharge their wastewater into septic tanks or other types of on-site sanitation systems (e.g. Sequencing batch reactors or constructed wetlands). On-site systems include drain fields, which require significant area of land. This makes septic systems unsuitable for most cities.|$|R
50|$|In 1846, the Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act {{was passed}} to {{identify}} whether {{the transmission of}} Cholera is by air or by water. The bill was used to encourage the owner to clean their dwelling and <b>connect</b> them to <b>sewers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adequate {{sanitation}} {{is typically}} {{in the form}} of septic tanks, as there is no central sewerage system, except for Abuja and some areas of Lagos. A 2006 study estimated that only 1% of Lagos households were <b>connected</b> to general <b>sewers.</b>|$|R
25|$|His {{system was}} adopted in private houses, in rural districts, in {{military}} camps, in many hospitals, and {{extensively in the}} British Raj.

50|$|The {{catalyst}} {{for the expansion of}} the city limits was a desire by Long Lake's neighbors {{to take advantage of the}} city's decision to install a sewer system. Those areas that wanted to be <b>connected</b> to city <b>sewer</b> were annexed by the city.|$|R
50|$|In 2002 96% of all urban {{households}} were <b>connected</b> to a <b>sewer</b> system. Nearly half (46%) {{of rural}} house connections {{were connected to}} a pipe sewerage system in 2002. In 2002 about 30% of the rural households were connected to a pit latrine.|$|R
25|$|Compared {{to flush}} toilets <b>connected</b> to <b>sewer</b> systems and {{wastewater}} treatment plants, UDDTs are usually less expensive. However, to enable accurate comparisons of costs, {{this needs to}} be assessed on a case-by-case basis because the sewer system and treatment plant also transports and treats greywater whereas the UDDT does not. This means that the two systems provide a different level of service to the user. An example calculation for such a cost comparison exists for the case of Lima, Peru.|$|R
