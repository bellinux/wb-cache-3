50|$|Anti-slip steel grating {{is a type}} of bar grating. Steel bar grating is {{manufactured}} in a variety of methods. Welded bar grating consists of <b>load</b> <b>bars</b> electrically fuse welded to cross bars. Pressure-locked bar grating, or swaged grating, is where steel rods are forced through and locked in <b>load</b> <b>bars.</b> Riveted bar grating is where the <b>load</b> <b>bars</b> are riveted to the cross bars. There are wide varieties of trade names for each type manufactured.|$|E
50|$|Pultruded FRP grating {{consists}} of continuous glass strands encased in resin and {{wrapped in a}} surfacing veil which protects the fibers and allows resin to saturate the outermost part of the bar as well as penetrate between the glass fibers. This ensures a smooth and corrosion-resistant surface, with a higher glass/resin ratio than molded products. The individual bars are then assembled using cross bars and epoxy to mechanically join the <b>load</b> <b>bars.</b> Pultruded grating has unidirectional strength, with its much higher glass content resulting in a greater span capability than molded products. This product is usually specified in applications requiring larger spans or heavier loading.|$|E

Baird of Video Game News Radio, international friend of the site Nick Hodges, and Jason Murphy, formerly of the LEOG podcast. The hosts struggled for the first few weeks to solidify a format and title, eventually landing on [...] "Let's Play This". However, due to Co-host 3000 and fans complaints that it was too similar to [...] "Let's Do This", a call was put out to the fans {{to come up with a}} new name. After a lengthy suggestion period, the name [...] "The Loading Bar" [...] was chosen, both for its reference to the aggravating loading times most gamers are familiar with, and for its alcoholic connotations [...] "loaded" [...] and [...] "bar". The show often features community members as [...] "fan experts" [...] on video game titles, and it is the only other podcast on the site that has accompanying video reviews as well. Unlike the film reviews, which are created in a cartoon style, the video game reviews are created in a pixel art style, similar to a 16-bit console game.

40|$|Students of {{elementary}} school still have difficulties to {{understand the concept of}} percentages. Therefore, this study aims to figure out how teacher can support students to understand the concept of percentages: 1) students show an awareness that percentages are related to something; 2) students are able to compute the part of a whole while the percentage is given; 3) students are able to compute a whole if its part and its percentage is given. The study was conducted before students learned percentages formally in class, and then they only have their pre-requisite knowledge about fractions and their own initial knowledge of percentages they found from their surroundings. Based on those aims, we use Design Research as a method. We develop a set of instructional activities which is exploring students’ initial knowledge of percentages. Besides, contextual situation based on Realistic Mathematics (RME) approach which are <b>loading</b> <b>bar</b> on a game, voting results, road repair, and discount problems was used to {{contribute to the development of}} students’ understanding of percentages.

40|$|Pressure locked {{gratings}} {{have many}} uses, both {{on land and}} at sea. This is mainly due to {{the high degree of}} flexibility in dimensions and load bearing capacity. Despite the many uses in our surroundings, the term pressure locked grating is unknown to many. This term refers {{to the way in which}} the most important connection in pressure locked gratings is manufactured. Pressure locked gratings are galvanized and/or coated to prevent corrosion, galvanization is almost always used. This thesis is primarily focused on the behavior of galvanized pressure locked gratings. A pressure locked grating is made up of three type of bars: <b>load</b> bearing <b>bars,</b> cross bars and support bars. The connections between the <b>load</b> bearing <b>bars</b> and the cross bars are realized by pressing the cross bar into premade notch in the <b>load</b> bearing <b>bar.</b> The bars will deform plastically, which results in a connection based only on friction. This connection is called a pressure locked connection. The <b>load</b> bearing <b>bars</b> serve primarily for load transfer in one direction. The pressure locked connection weakens the <b>load</b> bearing <b>bars.</b> The cross bars redistribute a local load over the <b>load</b> bearing <b>bars</b> outside of the loading area and reduce the buckling length of the individual <b>load</b> bearing <b>bar.</b> The support bars are spot-welded to both the load bearing and cross bars. Pressure locked gratings are calculated according to RAL-GZ- 638, a standard published by the Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung e. V. In this standard, pressure locked gratings are calculated on the basis of linear elasticity theory. A calculation according to the EN 1993 - 1 - 1 is not possible because it is not suited for pressure locked gratings. The main objective of this thesis is to determine if a calculation based on the plasticity theory is possible for pressure locked gratings. Through the application of this theory the design strength can be greatly increased, which has a large economic potential. This research is divided up into four parts that are stated below. 9 ̆ 5 Analytical study 9 ̆ 5 Experimental study 9 ̆ 5 FEM validation 9 ̆ 5 Parametric study The vast diversity in size and properties and the complex functioning of the pressure locked connection make pressure locked gratings a difficult product to research. The pressure locked connection also has a big influence on the strength and stiffness. In this galvanizing has a big influence. The analytical study shows that pressure locked gratings fail through: local lateral torsional buckling of one of the <b>load</b> bearing <b>bars,</b> global lateral torsional buckling for the entire pressure locked grating or by a mechanism due to a plastic hinge in de <b>load</b> bearing <b>bars.</b> To research the behavior, numerical models were developed in the FEM-package ABAQUS. To determine the accuracy of these models, experiments were carried out on a number of pressure locked grating geometries. The results of the tests were compared with FEM simulations which made it possible to validate the FEM-models. The validation has taken place on the basis of four test series. Three test series focused on failure mechanisms, namely: collapse due to a mechanism as a result of plastic hinges in the <b>load</b> bearing <b>bars,</b> test series 1 A, collapse due to local lateral torsional buckling, test series 2 A and collapse due to global lateral torsional buckling of the entire pressure locked grating, test series 2 B. The last test series, test series 1 B, is aimed at examining the structural behavior of a common used pressure locked grating. After this validation it is possible to make FEM-models for a large number of different geometries. The behavior of these geometries can then be analyzed. The validation shows that failure mode and failure load are correctly determined by the FEM models. There is however a notable difference between the stiffness of the FEM-model and the stiffness of the test specimens. This difference is likely the result of the influence of the pressure locked connection between the load bearing and cross bars. The research shows that all aforementioned failure modes play a role depending on the dimensions of <b>load</b> bearing <b>bars</b> and cross bars. For relatively thick-set <b>load</b> bearing <b>bars</b> pressure locked gratings fail due to a mechanism as the result of plastic hinges in the <b>load</b> bearing <b>bars.</b> For slender <b>load</b> bearing <b>bars</b> pressure locked gratings fail as a result of instabilities. With the aid of FEM models, it is possible to estimate the extent in which the plastic capacity is present in actually produced pressure locked gratings. This analysis shows that in 72...|$|R

2500|$|As in {{the case}} of an axially <b>loaded</b> <b>bar,</b> in {{practice}} the shear stress may not be uniformly distributed over the layer; so, as before, the ratio F/A will only be an average ("nominal", [...] "engineering") stress. [...] However, that average is often sufficient for practical purposes. [...] Shear stress is observed also when a cylindrical bar such as a shaft is subjected to opposite torques at its ends. [...] In that case, the shear stress on each cross-section is parallel to the cross-section, but oriented tangentially relative to the axis, and increases with distance from the axis. Significant shear stress occurs in the middle plate (the [...] "web") of I-beams under bending loads, due to the web constraining the end plates ("flanges").|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the fatigue strength of {{a new type of}} all metal sandwich panel structure, designed and furnished by Western Engineering Associates of Los Angeles. This structure consisted basically of a new type of embossed core attached by spot welding to one or more smooth sheets of the same metal. Specimens tested were all of the single core, single skin type. Metal used was 24 ST aluminum alloy of 0. 032 inch thickness. This construction affords high structural rigidity for its weight. Two patterns of the embossed core were tested. One of the specimens had its core embossed with a triangular pattern, the other with a square pattern. The specimens were tested by utilizing them as simply supported beams, loaded in the center by a sinusoidally varying load of constant maximum magnitude. This load was applied by means of <b>loading</b> <b>bars</b> one {{on the top of the}} specimen, the other on the bottom. These bars had flat, one inch wide surfaces, contacting the specimen. To prevent the sharp edges of the bars from causing local failures of the specimens, a layer of one-eighth inch thick koroseal was used between the bars and the specimen. Specimens tested had a length between end supports of 16. 7 inches. Their width was 9 inches. The loading obtained was a combination of bending and shear. The shear stress was of such a low magnitude, however, that it could be neglected. Failure of the specimens was deemed as occurring at the time the first crack appeared. A method was devised for crack detection that consisted of laying down a conducting strip over a thin insulating layer in a network fashion, covering all saddle points of the core in the central area, since previous testing had disclosed the fact that failure occurred at these points first. Any crack in one of these saddles caused a break in the conducting strip which changed the bias on the controlling electronic tube to a cut off value. This tube was part of an Eccles-Jordan Trigger circuit which with associated tubes allowed current flow through a thyratron relay circuit opening the starting circuit of the testing machine, causing it to stop. The data shows that for the specimens oriented in a normal fashion, that is, with one of the sides of the square or triangle of the core parallel to the <b>loading</b> <b>bar,</b> which was the situation for most of the tests, the square pattern is vastly superior to the triangular one, as regards fatigue strength. For specimens oriented in this way the square pattern withstood a bending moment of 13. 45 inch pounds per inch of width; whereas the triangular pattern withstood only 9. 28. Two tests conducted with the square core having the sides of the squares at an angle of forty-five degrees to the <b>loading</b> <b>bars</b> gave results about midway between. However, the effective EI for this configuration was considerably reduced, and consequently actual failure stress was probably about equal to that for the ease where the sides were parallel to the <b>loading</b> <b>bar.</b> The triangular pattern was actually much worse than the curve shows. At the higher loads cracks occurred with very few cycles of loading. Automatic cut-off feature was not in use for these tests. In service it is highly possible that overloads of short duration might cause small cracks which would become focal points of fatigue failure, thus reducing the fatigue strength well below the design point. This weakness of the triangular pattern arises from the fact that smooth fillets or saddles, joining depressed and elevated portions of the core, are harder to obtain in this pattern than in the square one. Wrinkles and tool marks were present in almost every one of the triangular specimens tested...|$|R
