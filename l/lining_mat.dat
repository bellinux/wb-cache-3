Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and oste- ogenic activity were evaluated using Alizarin red and the von Kossa staining and analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Results: The n-HA/CS mixture significantly promoted cell growth in comparison to pure calcium sulfate (CS). Moreover, addition of rhBMP 2 to CS (P= 0. 02) and also mixing CS with n-HA led to further increase in extracellular calcium production and ALP activity (P= 0. 03). Conclusion: This in vitro study indicates that a scaffold material in combination with an osteoinductive material is effective for bone matrix formation. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prostatic androgen-repressed message- 1 (PARM- 1) {{has been}} cloned from the prostate. The {{transcript}} of the PARM- 1 gene is overexpressed during regression of the prostate after androgen withdrawal. The regulation of PARM- 1 by androgens is limited to this organ. We have studied the effects of PARM- 1 overexpression in malignant prostate cells. METHODS: The PARM- 1 cDNA was introduced into the rat cancer cell <b>line</b> <b>MAT</b> LyLu along with a doxycycline-dependent regulator. RESULTS: Maximal expression of PARM- 1 (fivefold induction) was achieved by incubating the cells with 2 microM doxycycline for 48 hr. A study investigating the effect of PARM- 1 overexpression on the transcription of 588 genes {{has shown that the}} TLP 1 gene (encoding rat telomerase protein component 1) was the most up-regulated (fourfold). In addition, a dose-dependent increase in telomerase activity was observed in cells overexpressing PARM- 1. In vivo, the androgen-deprived prostate showed an increased TLP 1 level and increased telomerase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Increased telomerase activity is often associated with the immortalisation of cancer cell lines, particularly prostatic ones. This could mean that PARM- 1 is involved, via increased telomerase activity, in a survival program enabling certain prostatic cells to resist apoptosis, thus conferring a selective advantage to pre-cancerous or cancerous cells.

40|$|During the {{evolution}} of sex, different sexual conflicts arise. Sexual conflicts reduce fitness of the opposite sex. That is why several mechanisms have evolved to resolve them, which leads to rapid and unpredictable co-evolution {{of male and female}} traits involved in reproduction. This rapid co-evolution of male and female reproductive traits driven by sexual conflict can further lead to reproductive isolation resulting in speciation.             I used the hermaphroditic fungus Neurospora crassa, which has two mating types, as a model organism. Mating types are proxy to sex, because both are needed for sexual reproduction, but they are not limited to either sex role. However by using male pheromone knock-out lines, I created an evolutionary setup, where either mating type is forced to adapt to its restricted sex role. After 21 sexual generations of adaptive co-evolution, I tested if mating types had adapted to the assigned sex by measuring fitness (production of sexual spores called ascospores). I used three evolutionary setups (lines) : Δccg 4 <b>lines,</b> where <b>mat</b> A is female and mat a is adapted to the male role, Δmfa 1 <b>lines,</b> where conversely <b>mat</b> A is adapted to the male role and mat a is female, and wild-type lines used as controls, where both mating types have maintained and adapted to both sex roles. And discovered one Δccg 4 line, which indeed adapted to the newly assigned sex roles. At generation 15 and 21 I obtained mixed results for the presence of sexual conflict by correlating male and female fitness in hermaphroditic partner mat a in this line, however I found a sexual conflict also in the asexual growth, where male role is associated with increased, but female role with decreased mycelium growth rate. This work will further allow to study genomic mechanisms underlying this adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Urokinase (uPA), {{a member}} of the serine {{protease}} family, and its cell surface receptor (uPAR) have been implicated in promoting the progression of various human malignancies including hormone dependent malignancies such as breast and prostate cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating uPA production in breast and prostate cancer progression are poorly understood. In the current studies, we have examined the role of uPAR in breast cancer progression by developing a homologous model of uPAR overexpression by a rat breast cancer cell <b>line</b> <b>Mat</b> B III. Overexpression of uPAR resulted in increased breast cancer growth, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Development of this syngeneic breast cancer model allowed me to examine the ability of the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen (TAM) and a synthetic active site inhibitor of uPA, 4 -iodo benzo[b]thiophene- 2 -carboxamidine (B- 428), to prevent breast cancer progression. TAM and B- 428 treatment alone or in combination effectively prevented breast tumor growth, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Morever, TAM and B- 428 treatments caused a decrease in uPAR gene expression and protein production. These results underscore the utility of anti-proteolytic agents (B- 428) in addition to standard hormone therapy (TAM) in advanced breast cancer patients where the uPA/uPAR system {{plays a key role in}} tumor progression. Regulation of uPA production by androgens in prostate cancer was then examined in the androgen insensitive PC- 3 cells transfected with the functional human androgen receptor cDNA (PC- 3 T). Androgens down regulate uPA gene expression and protein production in androgen sensitive PC- 3 T cells. Furthermore, restoration of androgen responsiveness in PC- 3 T cells caused a dramatic decrease in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Due to the ability of sex steroids to inhibit uPA gene expression, I have also examined the correlation between hormone sensitivity and uPA expression in several hormone responsive (HR) and hormone insensitive (HI) breast and prostate cancer cell lines. uPA mRNA was expressed only in the highly invasive, HI breast (MDA- 231) and prostate (PC- 3) cell lines. Failure of uPA mRNA expression in the minimally invasive, HR breast (MCF- 7) and prostate (LnCAP) cells was due to transcriptional suppression of uPA gene. Southern blot analysis us...|$|R

40|$|Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) - 10 {{promotes}} the proliferation and survival of murine hepatoblasts during {{early stages of}} hepatogenesis through a Wnt-b-catenin dependent pathway. To determine the mechanism by which this occurs, we expanded primary culture of hepatoblasts enriched for progenitor markers CD 133 and CD 49 f from embryonic day (E) 12. 5 fetal liver and an established tumor initiating stem cell <b>line</b> from <b>Mat</b> 1 a 2 / 2 livers in media conditioned with recombinant (r) FGF 10 or rFGF 7. FGF Receptor (R) activation resulted in the downstream activation of MAPK, PI 3 K-AKT, and b-catenin pathways, as well as cellular proliferation. Additionally, increased levels of nuclear b-catenin phosphorylated at Serine- 552 in cultured primary hepatoblasts, Mat 1 a 2 / 2 cells, and also in ex vivo embryonic liver explants indicate AKT-dependent activation of b-catenin downstream of FGFR activation; conversely, the addition of AKT inhibitor Ly 294002 completely abrogated b-catenin activation. FGFR activation-induced cell proliferation and survival were also inhibited by the compound ICG- 001, a small molecule inhibitor of b-catenin-CREB Binding Protein (CBP) in hepatoblasts, further indicating a CBP-dependent regulatory mechanism of b-catenin activity.
