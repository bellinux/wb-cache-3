Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the social <b>learning</b> <b>theory</b> of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E

In this chapter, we explore what role <b>learning</b> <b>theories</b> could play in software engineering education. We propose that <b>learning</b> <b>theories</b> can move the field of software engineering education forward by helping us to categorize, design, evaluate, and communicate about software engineering educational approaches. We demonstrate this by: (1) surveying a set of relevant <b>learning</b> <b>theories,</b> (2) presenting a categorization of common software engineering educational approaches in terms of <b>learning</b> <b>theories,</b> and (3) using one such approach (SimSE) as a case study to explore how <b>learning</b> <b>theories</b> can be used to improve existing approaches, design new approaches, and structure and guide the evaluation of an approach...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{validate}} the claim that neural networks appear to have much in common with the behavioristic view of learning. Neural networks are, according to Rumelhart & McClelland (1986), not behavioristic because of their explicit concern with the problem of internal representation and "mental" processing. The claim that neural networks are behavioristic has epistemological implications. Neural network <b>learning</b> <b>theories,</b> hereunder supervised and unsupervised learning, are compared to psychological <b>learning</b> <b>theories</b> in the two epistemological doctrines: empiricism and rationalism. The results indicate that neural networks exhibit interesting features of self-organization, implicit clustering of inner representation, and plasticity.

25|$|According to {{the social}} <b>learning</b> <b>theory</b> (more {{recently}} expanded as social cognitive theory), behavioural change is determined by environmental, personal, and behavioural elements. Each factor affects each of the others. For example, in congruence {{with the principles of}} self-efficacy, an individual's thoughts affect their behaviour and an individual's characteristics elicit certain responses from the social environment. Likewise, an individual's environment affects the development of personal characteristics as well as the person's behavior, and an individual's behaviour may change their environment as well as the way the individual thinks or feels. Social <b>learning</b> <b>theory</b> focuses on the reciprocal interactions between these factors, which are hypothesised to determine behavioral change.|$|E
