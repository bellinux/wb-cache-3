40|$|Potential {{bioaerosol}} infection risk {{associated with}} toilet flushing has not been sufficiently addressed {{in the design of}} residential washroom exhaust system. This study evaluates the performance of exhaust ventilation for residential washrooms in terms of air change rate, washroom size, washroom geometry, and locations of door louver, exhaust and water closet. Three bioaerosol species namely Escherichia coli (ATCC 10536), Serratia marcescens (ATCC 6911), and Cladosporium cladosporioides (ATCC 16022) are included in the simulations. By shortening the distance between the locations of exhaust and emission source (i. e. water closet), the fractional counts of bioaerosol particles exhausted can be increased. An increased air change rate and a <b>louvered</b> <b>door</b> can also improve the exhaust ventilation performance, yet with a longer time to steady state. This study should provide a useful source of reference for washroom exhaust designers to minimize bioaerosol infection risk. Practical application: This paper shows for residential washroom with an exhaust fan installed, the ventilation performance can be improved by an increased air change rate, and by shortening the distance between the locations of exhaust and emission source.

50|$|Balconies The {{balconies}} at Dakota Crescent {{are very}} unusual and {{different from the}} modern HDB flats’ balconies - one can easily see many of the balconies at Dakota Crescent having metal grills and brightly painted <b>louvered</b> <b>doors,</b> which are breathable. It is said that the balconies were painted visually different by the residents themselves, who were afraid of getting lost, {{so that they can}} recognize their houses at a glance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{exterior}} of the synagogue is covered in polychrome, rough-cast brick. [...] Classical entablature and galvanized iron cornice top the building. The building sits on a raised basement and the three doorways into the sanctuary are reached {{by a set of}} concrete steps. Inset panels of the Star of David and the tablets of the Ten Commandments inscribed in Hebrew are located above the doors. The interior is two-stories tall with a balcony, which had been reduced in size during the 1960s renovation. The congregation has seven Torahs, two of which were saved in the 1930 fire. The Ark is composed of dark wood paneling and classical pilasters. <b>Louvered</b> <b>doors</b> lead to the cabinet where its scrolls are kept.|$|R
50|$|A {{boutique}} hotel, {{it contains}} 24 lavish suites, encircling a central courtyard {{and is designed}} {{with a mixture of}} traditional Lao furnishings and modern. The suites range in size from 70 to 120 square metres and include eight suites, four pool suites, eight Khan pool suites, two Mekong pool suites and two Amantaka pool suites. The suites are accessed through <b>louvered</b> <b>doors</b> from the courtyard. All of the rooms have a king-sized bed centre of the suites beneath a traditional high ceiling. The rooms are painted in white and have mahogany or dark wood furnishings and windows. The rooms are reported to be between US$700 and US$1,400 a night, the most expensive being the Amantaka pool suites ($1400) followed by the Mekong pool suites ($1200).|$|R
50|$|The Victory Gardens, which date to World War II, abut {{the park}} to the {{apartment}} building’s western property line. The War brought many changes. The basement storeroom was cleared {{to make room for}} an air raid shelter and tenants donated carpets, furniture, and canned goods to fix it up. After the War, a self-service elevator was installed and many changes have continued to occur over the years, but the buildings old charm survives. Most of the cabana doors are still intact and date back to the 1930s when architect Mihran Mesrobian designed the building. Although every apartment today has air conditioning units, there are <b>louvered</b> <b>doors,</b> which are screen-like, allowing ventilation to the halls and between apartments. Today the site of the Victory Gardens has been reconstructed to accommodate the grounds parking lot.|$|R
50|$|The López Residence (Residencia López) is a {{historic}} house in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. Built in 1914, this one-story, Neoclassical structure is architecturally significant as a typical urban residence for a well-to-do Puerto Rican family in the early 20th century, and {{as one of the}} most important remaining works by architect Manuel Gómez Tejera. Notable architectural elements of the house include its five slender, octagonal Corinthian columns, recessed ceiling panels on the balcony, ornate cast-iron balcony ornamentation, native ceramic tile floors, rooftop balcony, four <b>louvered</b> wooden <b>doors</b> with scrollwork frames facing the street, and filigreed interior arches supported by turned and octagonal columns. It faces the 1925 District Courthouse across Progreso Street, forming {{a historic}} Neoclassical set.|$|R
2500|$|Aft of the nav {{station on}} the port side {{at the base of the}} {{companionway}} is the head. A <b>louvered</b> teak bi-fold <b>door</b> provides access to the space. Built as a complete molded head unit with full headroom and good ventilation, it includes a vanity sink, marine head, an abundance of mirrored storage cabinets, and a large separate stall shower with a Plexiglas door and dividing partition. [...] Hot and cold pressurized water system and electric shower sump pump complete the systems.|$|R
5000|$|The control hut {{is made of}} {{concrete}} 12" [...] (30.5mm) thick and is approximately 19' by 22' (5.8m by 6.7m). It stands close to the park edge at Boggy Creek, aligned southwest-northeast. The rectangular plan is divided into even quarters with three enclosed rooms and an open entry courtyard in the southwest quarter. There are two doorways off the open courtyard, protected by a freestanding blast wall. The door to the northwest opens into a fully enclosed room (former workshop and store) which connects to a room to the northeast (former indicator loop room). The storeroom contains an uninstalled <b>louvered</b> timber <b>door,</b> leant up against the wall. The indicator loop room has a single narrow unglazed observation window at eye height on the northeast corner. This narrow opening is sheltered by an external cantilevered tapered concrete hood.|$|R
50|$|The vernacular {{building}} is a simple two-story log house. The rear portion of the home features a two-story frame ell extending from the center. The facade has three windows {{on the first floor}} and five windows on the second. All of the facade windows feature <b>louvered</b> blinds. <b>Doors</b> are located on the western and eastern ends of the home's facade with a simple porch attached to the western entrance. The original portion of the home includes the three bays on the eastern end. A chimney was attached to the western end of the original portion before the later extension. The chimney was incorporated into the building and the smokestack is now only visible above the roof ridge. The gable roof is covered with standing seam sheet metal with box cornices at the eaves. Most of the exterior walls are covered with weatherboards with the remaining sections covered with asbestos shingles. The underpinning of the home is made of fieldstone.|$|R
50|$|Paul Zammit died in 1959, family sources attesting to {{the fact}} that he had {{achieved}} great success in business and engaged in much community work while being unable to write or read English and being only a tentative speaker of it. Ten years later Paulina transferred Floriana and the adjacent Spanish Mission flats to their son Salvatore and his wife Jean. She died in December 1979. Salvatore Zammit and his family lived in Floriana until 1981. In March 1982 the house and the adjacent flats passed out of the Zammit family and were converted into the Floriana Guesthouse and Hotel, offering a total of 24 guest rooms. Alterations to the house included the conversion of the upper floor into self-contained flats, and reconfiguration of the two downstairs flats into three. It is likely that at this time the semicircular hole was cut in the northern timber-panelled wall of the central entrance foyer to create a reception window, and timber <b>louvered</b> sliding <b>doors</b> were installed on the southern side of the entrance foyer.|$|R
