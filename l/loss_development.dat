500|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Nine began {{development}} in 2001, following staff discussions {{about how to}} make an online Shin Megami Tensei game. It was the first Megami Tensei title for Xbox, and the first to fully utilize 3D graphics. Established Megami Tensei staff worked on the project, such as producer Kouji Okada and demon designer Kazuma Kaneko. Newcomers to the project included character designer Yasuomi Umetsu, and composers Masaki Kurokawa and Takahiro Ogata. While Nine was originally planned as an online game, it was split into single-player and online versions; the latter was cancelled following development difficulties. The single-player release met with mixed reception from critics, and sold below Atlus' estimates; its commercial failure coupled with development costs contributed to a financial <b>loss.</b> <b>Development</b> of the online version continued as a port for Microsoft Windows, which would eventually become [...]|$|E

50|$|The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method uses both past <b>loss</b> <b>development</b> {{as well as}} an {{independently}} derived prior {{estimate of}} ultimate expected losses.|$|E
50|$|The chain-ladder method, {{also known}} as the {{development}} method, assumes that past experience is an indicator of future experience. <b>Loss</b> <b>development</b> patterns in the past are used to estimate how claim amounts will increase (or decrease) in the future.|$|E
40|$|The new {{approach}} to the beam losses monitoring system (BLMS) creation is proposed.

5000|$|Marine mammals: include whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, sea lions, walruses, sea otter, marine otter, manatees, dugong and {{the polar}} bear. Major threats include {{entanglement}} in ghost nets, targeted harvesting, noise pollution from military and seismic sonar, and boat strikes. Other threats are water pollution, habitat <b>loss</b> from coastal <b>development,</b> <b>loss</b> of food sources {{due to the}} collapse of fisheries, and climate change.|$|R

50|$|Age-to-age factors, {{also called}} <b>loss</b> <b>development</b> factors (LDFs) or link ratios, {{represent}} {{the ratio of}} loss amounts from one valuation date to another, and {{they are intended to}} capture growth patterns of losses over time. These factors are used to project where the ultimate amount losses will settle.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Loss</b> <b>development</b> factors or LDFs {{are used}} in {{insurance}} pricing and reserving to adjust claims to their projected ultimate level. Insurance claims, especially in long-tailed lines such as liability insurance, are often not paid out immediately. Claims adjusters set initial case reserves for claims; however, it is often impossible to predict immediately what the final amount of an insurance claim will be, due to uncertainty around defense costs, settlement amounts, and trial outcomes (in addition to several other factors). <b>Loss</b> <b>development</b> factors are used by actuaries, underwriters, and other insurance professionals to [...] "develop" [...] claim amounts to their estimated final value. Ultimate loss amounts are necessary for determining an insurance company's carried reserves. They are also useful for determining adequate insurance premiums, when loss experience {{is used as a}} rating factor ...|$|E
50|$|The chain-ladder {{technique}} is only accurate when patterns of <b>loss</b> <b>development</b> {{in the past}} can be assumed {{to continue in the}} future. In contrast to other loss reserving methods such as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, it relies only on past experience to arrive at an incurred but not reported claims estimate.|$|E

50|$|Therizinosaurs are {{generally}} accepted to be omnivorous or herbivorous, showing herbivorous features like elongated necks, reduced skull size, broadening of the pelvis cavity, reduced bite force, reduced skull musculature, anterior tooth <b>loss,</b> <b>development</b> of a rhamphotheca, and a downturned anterior {{portion of the}} dentary, {{all of which are}} present, or presumed to be present in Segnosaurus. However, there has been no complexity in tooth morphology, which is found in many other herbivorous groups. A few of the dental modifications include increased symmetry in Erlikosaurus, enlargement of denticles in Segnosaurus, with the only previously known unique tooth morphologies being the cusped, incisiform anterior teeth of Falcarius and the outwards convex teeth of Jianchangosaurus.|$|E

50|$|Shrimp in the {{transitional}} phase show randomly distributed, melanized (brownish/black) lesions within of the cuticle of the cepahlothorax and tail region. These foci are {{the sites of}} acute lesions which have progressed onto subsequent stages of hemocytic inflammation, cuticular epithelium regeneration and healing and which might be secondarily infected with bacteria. These foci are negative for TSV by in situ hybridization (ISH) using a TSV-specific cDNA probe. Histologically, these shrimp present focal active acute lesions and the onset of lymphoid organ spheroids (<b>LOSs)</b> <b>development.</b> By ISH with TSV-specific probes, a diffuse positive signal can be observed {{within the walls of}} the lymphoid organ of normal appearance with or without focal probe signals within developing LOSs. These shrimp will be lethargic and anorexic, possibly because of the redirection of their energy and metabolic resources toward wound repair and recovery. If the shrimp undergo another successful moult following {{the transitional}} phase, they will cast off the melanized lesions and enter the chronic phase.|$|E

40|$|Traditional loss reserving {{techniques}} calculate loss reserve variability {{as if it}} {{were based}} on a single factor. These approaches all measure the variability in historical <b>loss</b> <b>development</b> patterns and use the derived measures to determine a distribution of <b>loss</b> <b>development</b> factors and to calculate loss reserve ranges, in essence limiting the calculated variability to what occurred during the experience period. However, there are multiple factors that impact the variability of <b>loss</b> <b>development.</b> These factors impact <b>loss</b> <b>development</b> in different directions – by calendar year, by accident year and by development year. A small trend change in one direction is likely to produce <b>loss</b> <b>development</b> patterns in aggregate that are significantly different from the historical patterns. A one-factor approach fails to model the impact of the multiple factors individually, potentially giving highly inaccurate loss reserve range estimates. The increasingly popular use of statistical modeling techniques in loss reserving provides tools to analyze and project <b>loss</b> <b>development</b> patterns in these three directions more accurately. However, in order to calculate loss reserve variability, the statistical features of the modeling framework have to be preserved, which in turns limits the calculated variability to what occurred during the experienc...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} a simple {{context in which}} we can quantify the impact of the payment schedule on paid <b>loss</b> <b>development.</b> To isolate the effect of the payment schedule, we restrict to the special case when all claims have the same incurred loss. We consider three simple periodic payment schedules: (1) a uniform payment schedule (2) an escalated (discounted) payment schedule and (3) a schedule that allows a single, fixedproportional adjustment to the payment amount. The paper defines a mathematical model for paid <b>loss</b> <b>development</b> and presents numeric examples to illustrate the sensitivity of paid <b>loss</b> <b>development</b> to the different schedules. It is apparent that the payment schedule influences paid <b>loss</b> <b>development.</b> In general a faster (slower) schedule will make losses develop faster (slower). While the direct nature of that relationship is apparent, it is not so apparent how to quantify it. This paper quantifies it in some very particular cases. Let S(t) denote a survival function on the fme interval (0,b). 2 Weregard S(t) asa distribution of closure times and let F(t) = 1 - S(t) be the corresponding cumulative distribution function [CDF].

40|$|In {{this paper}} 3 D {{numerical}} simulations of turbulent incompressible flows are validated against experimental {{data from the}} linear low pressure turbine/outlet guide vane (LPT/OGV) cascade at Chalmers in Sweden. The validation focuses on the secondary flow-fields and <b>loss</b> <b>developments</b> downstream of a highly loaded OGV. The numerical simulations are performed for the same inlet conditions as in the test-facility with engine-like properties in terms of Reynolds number, boundary-layer thickness and inlet flow angles with the goal to validate how accurately and reliably the secondary flow fields and losses for both on- and off-design conditions can be predicted for OGV’s. Results from three different turbulence models as implemented in FLUENT, k-epsilon Realizable, k-omega-SST and the RSM are validated against detailed measurements.
