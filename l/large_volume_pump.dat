40|$|The project {{involve the}} {{research}} and development of a pulsatile, complex or continuous flow in biological and non-biological systems implantable heart assist pump. Specifically as a 20 % cardiac assist for persons from congestive heart failure and other cardiac abnormalities. The pulsatile cardiac assist pump would provide upto 20 % of the blood pumping process from the venous supply to the arterial supply. Current pumps are largely complete bypass <b>pumps</b> or <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>pumps</b> that produce significant long term blood cell damage resulting in thrombosis. Most are not pulsatile which offers a significant physiological advantage. The pump under development is designed to prevent thrombosis by utilizing a unique geometry and pumping actuation mechanism. As part of the research we first used COSMOL simulation to aid in the design and blood flow dynamics. From these results we have designed a working prototype that can be configured in a number of geometries or stages. This design utilizes biocompatible material, Polyethylene oxide (PEO), which minimized protein interaction with the interior pumping surface. Shape memory alloy actuators compress the pumping chamber. Shape memory alloy actuators also actuate compression of the ingoing sphincter valve and outgoing sphincter valves. Pumping motion can be analyzed by accelerometers to provide optimized feedback and pump motion control. Zoned compression may allow optimal compression for blood flow. This type of pumping system biomimics actual heart compression and pulsation while the sphincter like valves minimizes thrombosis causing turbulent. A second actuation method may be employed utilizing pneumatic cuffs that inflate and compress the pump body and sphincter valves. The pump has a minimum of one hundred twenty mmHg pressure capabilities at fifty to one hundred and fifty beats per minute or in coordination with the compression and decompression rate of the heart as measured by blood pressure sensors or direct heart electro cardiac sensing. A cluster of pumps each independently controlled may be packaged for sequence or sequential actuation providing complex pumping and flow patterns or continuous pumping flow. Further the pumps may be independently actuated in a tandem configuration. As such the pump provides a broad field of use including but not limited to arterial to arterial pumping, drug delivery, physiological fluidic maintenance, intravenous delivery, pressure maintenance and drug manufacturing where low turbulence flow is required and any pulsatile, complex flow pattern or continuous flow pattern is required...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of subsurface arsenic (As) removal (SAR) is to extract anoxic groundwater, aerate it and re-inject it. Oxygen in the injected water reacts with iron in the resident groundwater to form hydrous ferric oxide (HFO). Dissolved As sorbs onto the HFO, {{which allows for}} the extraction of groundwater with lower As concentrations. SAR was applied at a rural location in Bangladesh (As in groundwater = 200 μg/L) to study the effect of different operational parameters on SAR performance, including repeated injection and extraction of an equal <b>volume,</b> lower <b>pumping</b> rate, and intermittent <b>pumping.</b> <b>Larger</b> injection <b>volume,</b> lower <b>pumping</b> rate, and intermittent pumping all had positive effects on As removal indicating that As adsorption is kinetically limited. Repeated injection–extraction of an equal volume improved As removal efficiency by providing more HFO for sorption. After injection of 1, 000 L, a maximum of 3, 000 L of ‘safe’ water, {{as defined by the}} Bangladesh national standard for As (< 50 μg/L), was extracted, of which 2, 000 L can be used as drinking water and the remainder is used for re-injection. Under this setup, the estimated cost for 1, 000 L of As-safe drinking water is US$ 2. 00, which means that SAR is a viable mitigation option for rural areas...|$|R

40|$|Highest Honors in PhysicsEnclosed {{microfluidic}} devices provide excellent {{systems for}} the study of biological processes such as cell-cell, paracrine, and autocrine signaling systems. By minimizing the fluid volume within the chambers, microfluidic devices diminish the dilution of secreted products which makes the detection of the secreted products a more straightforward task. A major design problem associated with the construction of microfluidic devices for biological research is the need to provide well-controlled fluidic transportation for cells, the nutrients that the cells need, and waste removal. Most precision syringe pumps which can accurately provide low flow rates are expensive and constitute a barrier to experiment design. Electroosmotic pumps could potentially provide a valuable alternative as a low <b>volume</b> flow rate <b>pumping</b> system for many types of microfluidic devices. We have developed a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic device that incorporates both electroosmotic flow and pressure driven flow. The device is designed to increase the relative strength of the electroosmotic flow (EOF) component of the total flow through the use of an array of small <b>volume</b> parallel <b>pumping</b> channels which provide higher passive resistance to pressure driven flow than a <b>larger</b> <b>volume</b> single-channel EOF <b>pump.</b> Using a novel microfluidic instrumentation device which we call the "Micro Programmable Object Navigation Gadget" (µ-PONG), we investigate how different properties and geometries of the device affect the EOF rate. Â  In addition, we demonstrate that fluid flow driven by a small hydraulic pressure head can be completely canceled by an user initiated EOF in the pumping channels which are incorporated into a microfluidic device. The ability to modulate the flow and to create "stop flow" conditions in microfluidic devices is also important for biological research.

SPT 140 is a 4. 5 -kW thruster developed under a joint agreement between AFRL, Atlantic Research Corp, and Space Systems/Loral, and was manufactured by the Fakal Experimental Design Bureau of Russia.

40|$|Pico-plankton and nano-plankton are {{generally}} thought {{to represent a}} negligible {{fraction of the total}} particulate organic carbon (POC) export flux in oligotrophic gyres due to their small size, slow individual sinking rates, and tight grazer control that leads to high rates of recycling in the euphotic zone. Based upon recent inverse modeling and network analysis however, it has been hypothesized that pico-plankton, including the cyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, and nano-plankton contribute significantly to POC export, via formation and gravitational settling of aggregates and/or consumption of those aggregates by mesozooplankton, in proportion to their contribution to net primary production. This study presents total suspended particulate (> 0. 7 μm) and particle size-fractionated (10 – 20 μm, 20 – 53 μm, > 53 μm) pigment concentrations from within and below the euphotic zone in the oligotrophic subtropical North Atlantic, collected using Niskin bottles and <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> in-situ <b>pumps,</b> respectively. Results show the indicator pigments for Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus and nano-eukaryotes are; (1) found at depths down to 500 m, and; (2) essentially constant, relative to the sum of all indicator pigments, across particle size fractions ranging from 10 μm to > 53 μm. Based upon the presence of chlorophyll precursor and degradation pigments, and that in situ pumps do not effectively sample fecal pellets, it is concluded that these pigments were redistributed to deeper waters on larger, more rapidly sinking aggregates likely by gravitational settling and/or convective mixing. Using available pigment and ancillary data from these cruises, these Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus and nano-plankton derived aggregates are estimated to contribute 2 – 13 % (5 &plusmn; 4 %), 1 – 20 % (5 &plusmn; 7 %), and 6 – 43 % (23 &plusmn; 14 %) of the total sediment trap POC flux measured on the same cruises, respectively. Furthermore, nano-eukaryotes contribute equally to POC export and autotrophic biomass, while cyanobacteria contributions to POC export are one-tenth of their contribution to autotrophic biomass. These field observations provide direct evidence that pico- and nano-plankton represent a significant contribution to the total POC export via formation of aggregates in this oligotrophic ocean gyre. We suggest that aggregate formation and fate should be included in ecosystem models, particularly as oligotrophic regions are hypothesized to expand in areal extent with warming and increased stratification in the future...|$|R

The heart {{has the ability to}} displace <b>large</b> systolic <b>volumes</b> at a low rate and relatively low pressure, with large ventricular fillings (high ventricular compliance), whereas it is incapable effacing increased afterloads.

On the basis of this morphodynamic approach, we suggest that the icefish may illustrate how a certain feature (i. e., an architectural cardiac design) common to the suborder and to most teleosts, and apparently with ''irrelevant'' properties, can become useful for a specialized purpose (i. e., <b>volume</b> <b>pump</b> design); and how, in contrast, the internal machinery construction. because of structural and ultrastructural constraints, may pre;ent these stenothermal sedentary teleosts from conquering niches requiring more active locomotory habits...|$|R
