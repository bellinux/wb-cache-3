5|$|The plot follows four characters, Karen, Rick, Luke, and Rachel, as {{they arrive}} in the lounge of an airport bar, as they {{interact}} with one another, and as they cope with chaos that erupts as cataclysmic events occur. The story addresses their motivations and perceptions, {{as well as their}} thoughts on certain themes. There are several minor characters and a fifth main character, Player One, who retells the events that the four main characters experience but from the perspective of an outside observer, <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> exploring a video game environment.|$|E

25|$|Instances of {{ambiguity}} {{can be classified}} as local or global ambiguities. A sentence is globally ambiguous if it has two distinct interpretations. Examples are sentences <b>like</b> <b>Someone</b> shot the servant of the actress {{who was on the}} balcony (was it the servant or the actress who was on the balcony?) or The cop chased the criminal with a fast car (did the cop or the criminal have a fast car?). Comprehenders may have a preferential interpretation for either of these cases, but syntactically and semantically, neither of the possible interpretations can be ruled out.|$|E

25|$|In {{a report}} of the same match, Spanish {{newspaper}} El Mundo said: Bale combines the height and build of an 800-metre runner like Steve Ovett with the acceleration and directness of a rugby winger like Bryan Habana. And, when he gets to the byline, he delivers curling crosses like a Brazilian. Big words? Yes, but that's what Bale is like – easily the greatest sensation in the opening month and a half of the Champions League. Ask Maicon what he thinks after the two exhibitions Bale turned in against Inter. Yesterday he left Maicon for dead and then a wily old fox like Lúcio was left in his wake <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> trying to follow the vapour trail of an aeroplane. Three goals and two assists – against the European champions. His performances have been stunning.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} one of her singing {{promotions}} for Where Love Has Gone that Vega was discovered by Bong Carreon, who then offered {{her to be a}} recording artist for the then newly formed Emerald Recording Company owned by Carreon and his then wife, the famous Filipina singer Imelda Papin. Her debut single Somewhere In My Past, composed by Mon Del Rosario, was a major hit which became a certified gold record in only its first few weeks of release and would prove to be her most enduring hit and the one song she would be most identified with. The single’s success prompted Bong Carreon and Imelda Papin to launch Vega as a full-time solo artist by coming up with the latter’s 1985 debut album First Love, which included Somewhere In My Past and produced her further hit songs <b>like</b> <b>Someone</b> Special, The Memory Will Remain, and the title track itself.|$|E
500|$|During a track-by-track {{analysis}} bassist Guy Berryman {{admitted that}} the song takes [...] "a bit of inspiration" [...] from Jimmy Cliff's 1969 song [...] "Many Rivers to Cross".

In cases where someone has no internal reason to do what others see as the right thing, they cannot be blamed for failing to do it, because internal reasons are the only reasons, and blame, Williams wrote, [...] "involves treating the person who is blamed <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> who had a reason {{to do the right thing}} but did not do it." ...|$|E

We need a strong character actor who can play hyper-competent. <b>Like</b> <b>someone</b> in a John Frankenheimer movie". Actor Luke Goss was cast in the role after episode writer Akiva Goldsman personally called his house and asked him to join the show.

500|$|Although Lennon and Spector {{disagreed}} {{over the}} bass sound, Lennon was [...] "ecstatic" [...] about the producer's work on [...] "Instant Karma", author Peter Doggett writes. White's drums assumed {{the role of}} a lead instrument, positioned prominently in the mix, of which Spector biographer Richard Williams would write in 1972: [...] "No Beatles record had ever possessed such a unique sound; Spector had used echo to make the drums reverberate <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> slapping a wet fish on a marble slab, and the voices sounded hollow and decayed." [...] Spector wanted to add a string section to the track in Los Angeles, but Lennon insisted that the recording was complete.|$|E
500|$|Damon did {{the voice}} of Spirit in the {{animated}} movie Spirit Stallion of the Cimmaron (2002) and later played a conjoined twin in Stuck on You (2003), which received a 60% Rotten Tomatoes score and mixed critical reception. He played a fictionalized version of Wilhelm Grimm alongside Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam's fantasy adventure The Brothers Grimm (2005), which was a critically panned commercial failure; The Washington Post concluded, [...] "Damon, constantly flashing his newscaster's teeth and flaunting a fake, 'Masterpiece Theatre' dialect, comes across <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> who got lost {{on the way to}} an audition for a high school production of The Pirates of Penzance."

[...] "I opened the door and it was <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> sucked the air and the life out of Berea", he said. [...] "He was a major presence for the organization.

500|$|Reaction to the decision, {{and to the}} {{protracted}} {{nature of}} the case itself, was widespread and negative. Five-time Giro winner Eddy Merckx expressed surprise at the result and disappointment that it could further sully the sport's image, saying [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> wants to kill cycling." [...] Since-ousted race director Angelo Zomegnan called the decision to strip the Giro championship [...] "nonsense," [...] noting that Contador was permitted to ride {{at the time and}} there were no irregularities of any kind during the race. His successor Michele Acquarone was also upset by the decision, believing that damage had been done to the Giro and noting that RCS Sport would need to commission a new trophy to award to Scarponi.|$|E
500|$|Olivero's quest in the {{underground}} world is written as a reversal of Plato's allegory of the cave as described in his Republic. In Plato's allegory, prisoners confined in a cave and condemned to stare at a blank wall, with only the light from a flickering fire behind them, see just the shadows of what is real; the philosopher, on the other hand, is <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> released from the cave, {{able to see the}} true form of what is casting the shadows. Read turns the idea on its head; when Siloēn left her subterranean world she left behind the Platonic [...] "eternal forms", and Olivero has to follow her back to her [...] "cave" [...] to discover the [...] "divine essence of things".|$|E
500|$|Spacey said Meek was [...] "not a hired writer" [...] on Beyond the Sea.

[...] "He bought my material and then acted like I didn't exist," [...] Meek explained.

5000|$|Eagles' biographer Marc Eliot {{would also}} state that [...] "New Kid in Town" [...] captures [...] "a precise and {{spectacular}} moment immediately familiar to any guy who's ever felt the pain, jealousy, insecurity, rage and heartbreak {{of the moment}} he discovers his girlfriend <b>likes</b> <b>someone</b> better and has moved on." [...] He also suggests that it captures a more abstract theme of [...] "the fickle nature of both the muse and the masses." ...|$|R
5000|$|She cancels {{the wedding}} {{arrangement}} {{as she does}} not know it that Ah Meng is her bethrothed. However, while on a basketball training trip, she falls into a lake so Ah Meng jumps in to save her. She drops her contact lens in the water and recognizes that it was Ah Meng who saved her before. She also knew about this because Ah Meng was missing a button on his jacket that Meidi had picked up when he saved her the first time. She becomes attached to him and tries to impress him with her Japanese, as she is fluent in it, only to find that he doesn't care. She later picks up a moonstone ring that Ah Meng bought for Qi Yue's birthday and knows that he <b>likes</b> <b>someone</b> else. Ah Meng's friends hint to her that Ah Meng <b>likes</b> <b>someone</b> else, supposedly the [...] "moon" [...] as [...] "moon" [...] in Chinese is a homophone of [...] "Yue" [...] from [...] "Qi Yue". Meidi finally figures it out, but does not reveal to Qi Yue and Ah Meng until Qi Yue confesses. Meidi then says she gives her 'blessing' to Big Sister and Ah Meng.|$|R

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to the episode's subplot involving Kelly and Ryan {{was largely}} positive. McNutt called Novak's acting [...] "some of [...] best {{work in a}} long time". He called the plots conclusion [...] "the sort of screwed up situation that The Office does well". White wrote that [...] "If it weren't for [...] story ... I might have written this clumsy episode off entirely." [...] Forcella enjoyed the plot, praising the ending {{due to the fact}} that it concluded with [...] "boos and hisses". However, he was confused with the casting, noting that [...] "why bring Sendhil Ramamurthy in for one scene? ... He seems more <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> you bring in for a multi-episode arc." [...] Hyatt lauded the scenes, and wrote [...] "the Ryan-Kelly stuff I give a 10/10." ...|$|E
500|$|After the game, Gary Anderson was {{described}} as [...] "inconsolable." [...] Although the Vikings still led by seven points at the time, his missed kick had a demoralizing effect on the team. ESPN contributor Ben Goessling noted [...] "how swiftly it pulled the bottom {{out from under a}} team that had an air of inevitability about it to that point." [...] Writing for the website Sporting News, Jeff Diamond, the Vikings' general manager in 1998, observed that, [...] "Our team played the rest of the game as if it was in shock that our automatic kicker had missed at the most critical time." [...] Randle concurred, describing his reaction to the kick as, [...] "I was standing there <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> just punched me in my stomach, and was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The show's writers did {{not worry}} too much about {{perfecting}} Scorpio's lines because they knew Brooks would rewrite or ad lib new ones. Entire parts of Scorpio's dialogue, such as his hammock speech, are Brooks's lines and not the writers'. Dan Castellaneta described how, after he prepared something for Homer to say in response to Brooks's new Scorpio lines, Brooks would deliver totally different lines in the next take. Josh Weinstein said Homer's reactions are exactly <b>like</b> <b>someone</b> talking to Albert Brooks. In all, his recordings amounted to over two hours in length. Brooks voiced the character Russ Cargill in The Simpsons Movie and for [...] "about a week", he was to reprise the role of Scorpio, but the staff felt that creating a new character was a better idea.|$|E
