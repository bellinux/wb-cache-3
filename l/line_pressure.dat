25|$|When {{the engine}} {{operator}} applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve, the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate, reducing the train <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and in turn}} triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder. When the engine operator releases the brake, the locomotive brake valve portal to atmosphere is closed, allowing the train line to be recharged by the compressor of the locomotive.

25|$|The {{emergency}} {{portion of}} each triple valve is activated by the extremely rapid rate of reduction of train <b>line</b> <b>pressure.</b> Due {{to the length}} of trains and the small diameter of the train line, the rate of reduction is high near the front of the train (in the case of an engine operator-initiated emergency application) or near the break in the train line (in the case of the train line coming apart). Farther away from the source of the emergency application, the rate of reduction can be reduced to the point where triple valves will not detect the application as an emergency reduction. To prevent this, each triple valve's emergency portion contains an auxiliary vent port, which, when activated by an emergency application, also locally vents the train line's pressure directly to atmosphere. This serves to propagate the emergency application rapidly along {{the entire length of the}} train.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the train}} brakes are applied during normal operations, the engine {{operator}} makes a [...] "service application" [...] or a [...] "service rate reduction”, {{which means that}} the train <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> reduces at a controlled rate. It takes several seconds for the train <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> to reduce and consequently takes several seconds for the brakes to apply throughout the train. In the event the train needs to make an emergency stop, the engine operator can make an [...] "emergency application," [...] which immediately and rapidly vents all of the train <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> to atmosphere, resulting in a rapid application of the train's brakes. An emergency application also results when the train line comes apart or otherwise fails, as all air will also be immediately vented to atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, an {{emergency}} application brings in an additional component of each car's air brake system: the emergency portion. The triple valve {{is divided into}} two portions: the service portion, which contains the mechanism used during brake applications made during service reductions, and the emergency portion, which senses the immediate, rapid release of train <b>line</b> <b>pressure.</b> In addition, each car's air brake reservoir {{is divided into two}} portions—the service portion and the emergency portion—and is known as the [...] "dual-compartment reservoir”. Normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service portion to the brake cylinder, while emergency applications cause the triple valve to direct all air in both the service portion and the emergency portion of the dual-compartment reservoir to the brake cylinder, resulting in a 20–30% stronger application.|$|E

Additionally, an unconnected [...] spur known as the South Vernon extension, which ran from Hamburg to McAfee, was completed in 1871 and allowed access to an iron ore mine {{at the base of the}} Pochuck mountain range via trackage rights on the New Jersey Midland Railway.

Rodes's Confederate troops made one final push to capture the stone bridge about 6 p.m., but most of the Union troops were already headed toward Baltimore.

In particular the three acoustic signals associated with a line leak. The system is portable ({approx} 30 lbs) and is designed for <b>line</b> <b>pressures</b> up to 1000 psi. It has become apparent that cataloging of the various background acoustic signals in natural gas transmission line is very important if a system to identify leak signals is to be developed. The low-pressure (0 - 200 psig) laboratory test phase has been completed and a number of field trials have been conducted. Before the cataloging phase could begin, a few problems identified in field trials identified had to be corrected such as: (1) Decreased microphone sensitivity at <b>line</b> <b>pressures</b> above 250 psig. (2) The inability to deal with large data sets collected when cataloging the variety of signals in a transmission line. (3) The lack of an available online acoustic calibration system.
