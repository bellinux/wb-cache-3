5|$|All {{his adult}} life, Pflueger {{maintained}} his residence at his childhood home on Guerrero Street. When entertaining downtown <b>late</b> <b>into</b> the evening, {{he was known}} to spend an occasional night at the Olympic Club. Pflueger drove a green Cadillac convertible and was often seen with his steady lady friend on his arm. Pflueger never married and left no children. His brother Milton, fifteen years younger, had been working with the firm since the 1930s and, at Tim's death, Milton reorganized and headed the company, doing business as Milton T. Pflueger, Architect.|$|E
5|$|Garran {{joked that}} the long work of the {{drafting}} committee breached the Factory Acts, the group (primarily Barton, Richard O'Connor, John Downer and Garran) often working <b>late</b> <b>into</b> the night preparing drafts for the convention to consider and debate the next morning. On the evening before the convention's last day, Barton {{had gone to bed}} exhausted in the small hours, Garran and Charles Gavan Duffy finishing the final schedule of amendments at breakfast time. The convention concluded successfully, approving a final draft which would ultimately, aside from a small amendment arranged at the last minute in London, become the Constitution of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Edward and the barons {{remained}} high, and the earls {{opposed to}} the King kept their personal armies mobilised <b>late</b> <b>into</b> 1311. By now Edward had become estranged from his cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, who held the earldoms of Lancaster, Leicester, Lincoln, Salisbury and Derby, with an income of around £11,000 a year from his lands, almost double that of the next wealthiest baron. Backed by the earls of Arundel, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Warwick, Lancaster led a powerful faction in England, {{but he was not}} personally interested in practical administration, nor was he a particularly imaginative or effective politician.|$|E

Palaeontologists believe it would have eaten plants such as mosses, ferns, horsetails, cycads, and conifers or fruits.

5|$|WKU {{opened the}} third quarter on offense, and three plays later Jakes threw an {{interception}} to Deion Belue that was returned to the Hilltoppers' 25-yard line. Two plays after a face mask penalty brought {{the ball to the}} 12-yard line, McCarron connected with Norwood for a 12-yard touchdown reception and a 28–0 lead. The teams again traded punts <b>late</b> <b>into</b> the fourth quarter when Kenyan Drake scored on a 32-yard run to cap a 12-play, 81-yard drive that made the final score 35–0.|$|E

York were further relegated to the National League North {{for the first time}} in 2016–17; however, they ended the season with a 3–2 win over Macclesfield Town at Wembley Stadium in the 2017 FA Trophy Final.|$|E
5|$|Charles re-signed for Ebbsfleet {{after joining}} on loan for 2008–09 on 21 June.

He finished the season with 44 appearances and was named Ebbsfleet's Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Chrisye {{stopped playing}} {{altogether}} until the Nasutions {{invited him to}} rejoin Gipsy for their new project with Guruh, who offered Chrisye several songs {{in which he would}} be lead singer, with lyrics written especially for him. Overcoming his depression, he joined the group as they practised at Guruh's house in Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta. The band often rehearsed <b>late</b> <b>into</b> the night; the indie project mixed Western rock and Balinese gamelan and was produced collaboratively. Recording took place in mid-1975, with only four songs completed in the first several months. It was released to critical acclaim in 1976, with a production of 5000copies. The success of Guruh Gipsy convinced Chrisye that he could sing as a soloist.|$|E

5|$|Crime {{continued}} to be a problem at the Anacostia Station <b>late</b> <b>into</b> {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. Assaults and shootings were more frequent at the station than at any other station in the transit system. There were 32 robberies at the station in 2007. Although Anacostia was one of the 10 Metro stations with the highest crime rate in 2007 (and the only such station on the list inside the District of Columbia), no auto thefts or auto break-ins were reported at the station that year. To help deter crime, Metro installed outdoor security cameras at all 10 high-crime Metrorail stations in July 2008. In September 2008, Metro Transit Police stepped up their visibility and presence at all stations with high student ridership, including Anacostia.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{started with}} Landells in 1840. His duties {{included}} delivering proofs of drawings {{to be approved}} by artists such as Edward Dalziel, or authors such as Charles Dickens. A year later, Landells launched Punch magazine, and as early as 1842 had Evans illustrate covers for the new publication. Evans worked and became friends with Myles Birket Foster, John Greenaway and George Dalziel. Foster and Evans became lifelong friends. When Landells received a commission from the Illustrated London News to provide illustrations of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, he sent Evans and Foster to Balmoral to make sketches, which Evans engraved. Toward the end of his apprenticeship, the demands of the Illustrated London News caused Evans to work <b>late</b> <b>into</b> the night and return early in the morning.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a member}} of the Washington Light Infantry, a local Washington, D.C. militia, and played in many of their amateur {{baseball}} games throughout his life. When not playing, he tended to his bar. Noted for being a genial, friendly individual, he was quick to make friends, and was a fan-favorite in his hometown of Washington, D.C. Kinslow was a heavy drinker however, which caused him to miss games and team movements on occasion. <b>Late</b> <b>into</b> his career, these alcohol issues were much less tolerated, eventually hastening his exit from the game. He died at the age of 35, after a year-long battle with tuberculosis.|$|E

5|$|In 1849, the North British Railway {{opened a}} line from Edinburgh through Midlothian as far as Hawick in the Scottish Borders; a further {{extension}} in 1862 brought the line to Carlisle in England. The line, known as the Waverley Route after the novels {{of the same name}} by Sir Walter Scott whose stories were set in the surrounding countryside, was controversially closed in January 1969 following the recommendation for its closure in the 1963 Beeching Report as an unremunerative line. According to information released by the Ministry of Transport, the potential savings to British Railways from the line's closure were at least £536,000. In addition, an estimated grant of £700,000 would have been required to maintain a full service on the line. The last passenger train over the Waverley Route was the Edinburgh- sleeper on 5 January 1969 worked by Class 45 D60 Lytham St Anne's which arrived two hours <b>late</b> <b>into</b> Carlisle due to anti-closure protesters blocking the line.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} their largest league crowd in three years, United hosted the Los Angeles Galaxy on 9 April. In their {{previous}} meeting, the United took a lead midway in the second half, before Galaxy captain, Landon Donovan scored two goals {{late in the game}} to give the Galaxy a 2–1 win. The match piqued interest across the region, as a crowd of 26,222 turned up for the game, United's largest league match crowd in over three years. The game itself ended in a 1–1 draw, with the Galaxy scoring the first goal, a Mike Magee header off of a David Beckham corner in the 12th minute. United equalized <b>late</b> <b>into</b> match, in the second minute of stoppage time, thanks to a Charlie Davies penalty kick, his fourth in MLS league play and his fifth with D.C. United.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 {{that many of the}} participants were just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, he was coming into a project quite <b>late</b> <b>into</b> development and then leaving before post-production, and he wanted to see a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.|$|E
