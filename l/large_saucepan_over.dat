6000|$|... 'Oh, PLEASE {{mind what}} you're doing!' cried Alice, {{jumping up and}} down in an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.|$|R
50|$|For {{volumetric}} objects (e.g. pillow, blanket, sleeping bag, rug), boiling in a <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> {{for more}} than 10 minutes represents a reliable method. In this manner, the lethal temperatures propagate with certainty deep inside the object, which {{is not necessarily the}} case of a washing machine cleaning cycle.|$|R
5000|$|Add cup {{of coconut}} milk and 2 {{cup of water}} in a <b>saucepan</b> <b>over</b> medium heat then add the palm sugar and ¼ {{teaspoon}} of salt, stir until dissolved. Add the black beans to boil in the coconut sauce. Lower the heat and simmer until the sauce darkens. Remove from heat.|$|R
60|$|The men who officiated as cooks--and who, by agreement, {{had been}} {{released}} from all night duty in consideration of their regularly undertaking that occupation--now brought in a <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> full of soup; and each man went up with his canteen, and received his portion, returning to his bed upon the straw to eat it.|$|R
5000|$|Steam {{sticky rice}} for 25-30 minutes. Simmer the coconut milk in the <b>saucepan</b> <b>over</b> low heat then add ¼ cup {{of sugar and}} ¼ {{teaspoon}} of salt. Stir until sugar and salt are dissolved and remove from heat. Add the rice in cooked coconut sauce, stir the mixture and cover for 30 minutes.|$|R
60|$|Two kitchen chairs, and a round table, and an {{attenuated}} old poker and tongs were, however, gathered {{round the}} fire-place, as was a <b>saucepan</b> <b>over</b> a feeble sputtering fire. There {{was a bit}} of cheese and bread, and a tin candlestick on the table, and a little black porter in a pint-pot.|$|R
50|$|Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 13 by 9 in baking pan. In a <b>large</b> <b>saucepan,</b> combine 1 {{cup white}} sugar, 2 cups {{firmly packed brown}} sugar, 2 cups water, 1 cup shortening, 4 cups {{seedless}} raisins, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cloves, and 2 tsp salt. Boil together for 3 minutes, then cool.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} to local recipes for its preparation but basically {{the meat and}} rind are boiled with salt, then minced and mixed with finely ground green cabbage. Fresh blood is added together with breadcrumbs and the mixture is put into intestine casings. The sausages are then boiled for 15 minutes in a <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> until cooked.|$|R
6000|$|Two kitchen chairs, and a round table, and an {{attenuated}} old [...] poker and tongs, were, however, gathered {{round the}} fireplace, [...] as was a <b>saucepan</b> <b>over</b> a feeble, sputtering fire. There was a [...] bit of cheese and bread and a tin candlestick on the table, [...] {{and a little}} black porter in a pint pot.|$|R
50|$|The dish {{is a basic}} white stew {{made with}} a few simple {{ingredients}}: skirts, kidneys, onions, thyme, salt, white pepper, water, and potatoes. All the ingredients are placed in a <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> of boiling water and slowly simmered for about two hours. At the end of cooking, if necessary, a little cornflour (cornstarch) mixed as a slurry with a little water can be stirred in as thickening.|$|R
60|$|Nicholas shook hands, {{kissed his}} old pupils all round, intrusted a large parcel of toys to the {{guardianship}} of Morleena, {{bowed to the}} doctor and the married ladies, and inquired after Mrs Kenwigs in a tone of interest, which went to the very {{heart and soul of the}} nurse, who had come in to warm some mysterious compound, in a little <b>saucepan</b> <b>over</b> the fire.|$|R
5000|$|After {{soaking the}} ribs are steamed {{over a little}} water in a <b>large</b> <b>{{saucepan}}.</b> A layer of twigs from the birch tree may {{be placed in the}} bottom of the saucepan instead of a metal steamer. The name pinnekjøtt (literally: stick meat) is disputed. It may refer to the birch twigs of the cooking process, but the word 'pinne' is in dialectal Norwegian also used in reference to single ribs - akin to [...] "rib sticks", a dialectal expression in English.|$|R
60|$|Entering {{one morning}} after the {{delivery}} of a telegram which had cost him a pretty long walk, Phil proceeded to the boys' hall, and took his seat {{at the end of}} the row of boys who were awaiting their turn to be called for mercurial duty. Observing a very small telegraph-boy in a scullery off the hall, engaged in some mysterious operations with a <b>large</b> <b>saucepan,</b> from which volumes of steam proceeded, he went towards him. By that time Phil had become pretty well acquainted with the faces of his comrades, but this boy he had not previously met with. The lad was stooping over a sink, and carefully holding in the contents of the pan with its lid, while he strained off the boiling water.|$|R
60|$|The {{kitchen was}} full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops. On the hob a <b>large</b> black <b>saucepan</b> steamed slowly. Mrs. Morel took a panchion, a great bowl of thick red earth, {{streamed}} a heap of white sugar into the bottom, and then, straining herself to the weight, was pouring in the liquor.|$|R
50|$|A bread-like dish {{similar to}} the calentita. Sharing its Italian origins, it is a {{descendant}} of the Genoese dish with the same name. Unlike calentita the ingredients are first simmered in a <b>saucepan</b> for <b>over</b> an hour, stirring constantly, to form a paste which is then left to set. When the polenta-like dough is set, it is cut into small strips and fried in olive oil.|$|R
6000|$|Behind {{the corps}} {{followed}} the cart; loaded with the stores of the corps, {{a considerable amount}} of ammunition, two or three cases of gun cotton for blowing up bridges, several small barrels of powder, a large quantity of fine iron wire, three or four crowbars, bags of coffee and rice, and a keg of brandy, four kettles and as many <b>large</b> <b>saucepans,</b> together with all sorts of odds and ends. By the side of the horse walked Tim Doyle; dressed in the uniform of the corps, but without the equipments, and with a long blouse worn over his tunic. He was, in fact, already enrolled as {{an active member of the}} corps. This was done, in the first place, at his own earnest request; and upon the plea that thus only could he escape the chance of being seized as a spy, whenever he might for a moment be separated from the corps; and also that, unless he had a uniform like the rest, how could he take any vacancy in the ranks, even when it should occur? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of a Megaera as {{you know}} that creature, sir, and impetuous! If {{everything}} is not handy, if that poor girl is not like clockwork with the sauces, and herbs, and things, if a <b>saucepan</b> boils <b>over,</b> or a ham falls into the fire, if the girl treads on the tail {{of one of the}} cats--and the woman keeps a dozen--then she flies at her with anything that comes handy.' ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Charley, I {{wonder what}} could have {{made me think of}} him in {{connection}} with heroes; his lovableness, I suppose--certainly not his heroic qualities. I can recall his boyish face now (it was always a boyish face), the tears streaming down it as he sat in the schoolyard beside a bucket, in which he was drowning three white mice and a tame rat. I sat down opposite and cried too, while helping him to hold a <b>saucepan</b> lid <b>over</b> the poor little creatures, and thus there sprang up a friendship between us, which grew.|$|R
60|$|The men's {{weapons were}} {{fastened}} round {{one of the}} poles {{to keep them from}} the damp night air. Ostik had at once set to work on landing, leaving the Houssas to pitch the tent. A fire was soon blazing and a kettle and <b>saucepans</b> suspended <b>over</b> it. Rice was served out to the men, with the addition of some salt meat, of which sufficient had been purchased from the captain of the brig to last throughout the journey in the canoe. The men were all in high spirits at this addition to their fare, which was more than had been bargained for, and their songs rose merrily round the fire in the night air.|$|R
50|$|Juan {{has lost}} Tanto so El Nombre helps him and Mama to find him, the bear {{from the first}} episode tries to boil a <b>saucepan</b> of water <b>over</b> a fire but its bottom is missing, a magician turns her volunteer's watch and keys into an alarm clock and one big key, and two burglars named Bob and Bert break into a sweet shop and eat all the sweets but grow too fat to escape through the window so they get caught by a {{policeman}} named PC Nabb; from this point onwards, El Nombre also returned to one sketch per episode (except for in Episodes 21 and 26).|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Disability and Rehabilitation [© Informa Healthcare]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] The aim of the pilot study was to provide information about the design and use of saucepan handles to enable clinicians and designers to specify and provide products that are more appropriate for use by people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The objectives were: to evaluate aspects of new handle design for saucepans in terms of their ease of use for people with RA; document hand grip strength and configuration (grip patterns); record relevant anthropometric data to aid the development of new designs and perform an assessment of lifting techniques used in conjunction with perceived optimum handle configuration. Method/Results: Observation and video footage show that subjects continued to use familiar, but damaging, ways of lifting the saucepan even after extensive joint protection training by occupational therapists. Grip strengths recorded using a sphygmomanometer were similar to those found by other studies. The anthropometric measurements taken from the sample group were found to be within available anthropometric surveys of able-bodied people. However, hand length within the sample group with RA was longer than the equivalent in surveys of able-bodied subjects. Conclusions: Subjects preferred the narrower handles with some surface texture to the larger and more rounded tapered handles. <b>Large</b> handled <b>saucepans</b> were found not to be viable due to the constraints of UK cooking hob sizes and existing British Standards relating to saucepan specification...|$|R
60|$|Oh {{that you}} had been at Clarence Terrace on Nina's birthday! Good God, how we missed you, talked of you, drank your health, and {{wondered}} what you were doing! Perhaps you are Falkland enough (I swear I suspect you of it) to feel rather sore--just a little bit, you know, the merest trifle in the world--on hearing that Mrs. Macready looked brilliant, blooming, young, and handsome, and that she danced a country dance with the writer hereof (Acres to your Falkland) in a thorough spirit of becoming good humour and enjoyment. Now you don't like to be told that? Nor do you quite like to hear that Forster and I conjured bravely; that a plum-pudding was produced from an empty <b>saucepan,</b> held <b>over</b> a blazing fire kindled in Stanfield's hat without damage to the lining; that a box of bran was changed into a live guinea-pig, which ran between my godchild's feet, and {{was the cause of}} such a shrill uproar and clapping of hands that you might have heard it (and I daresay did) in America; that three half-crowns being taken from Major Burns and put into a tumbler-glass before his eyes, did then and there give jingling answers to the questions asked of them by me, and knew where you were and what you were doing, to the unspeakable admiration of the whole assembly. Neither do you quite like to be told {{that we are going to}} do it again next Saturday, with the addition of demoniacal dresses from the masquerade shop; nor that Mrs. Macready, for her gallant bearing always, and her best sort of best affection, is the best creature I know. Never mind; no man shall gag me, and those are my opinions.|$|R
60|$|At {{the hour}} I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the terrace, where, with the lapse of the season, the {{afternoon}} sun was now agreeable; and we sat there together while, before us, at a distance, but within call if we wished, the children strolled to and fro {{in one of their}} most manageable moods. They moved slowly, in unison, below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. Mrs. Grose watched them with positive placidity; then I caught the suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me a view {{of the back of the}} tapestry. I had made her a receptacle of lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my superiority--my accomplishments and my function--in her patience under my pain. She offered her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch's broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out a <b>large</b> clean <b>saucepan.</b> This had become thoroughly her attitude by the time that, in my recital of the events of the night, I reached the point of what Miles had said to me when, after seeing him, at such a monstrous hour, almost on the very spot where he happened now to be, I had gone down to bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a concentrated need of not alarming the house, rather that method than a signal more resonant. I had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which, after I had got him into the house, the boy met my final articulate challenge. As soon as I appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he had come to me as straight as possible; on which I had taken his hand without a word and led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase where Quint had so hungrily hovered for him, along the lobby where I had listened and trembled, and so to his forsaken room.|$|R
