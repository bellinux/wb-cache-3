5000|$|Benjamin Huntsman was a clockmaker {{in search}} <b>of</b> a better <b>steel</b> for clock springs. In Handsworth near Sheffield, he began {{producing}} steel in 1740 {{after years of}} experimenting in secret. Huntsman's system used a coke-fired furnace capable of reaching 1,600 Â°C, into which up to twelve clay crucibles, each capable of holding about 15 kg of iron, were placed. When the crucibles or [...] "pots" [...] were white-hot, they were charged with <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> blister <b>steel,</b> an alloy <b>of</b> iron and carbon produced by the cementation process, and a flux to help remove impurities. The pots were removed after about 3 hours in the furnace, impurities {{in the form of}} slag skimmed off, and the molten steel poured into moulds to end up as cast ingots. Complete melting <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> produced a highly uniform crystal structure upon cooling, which gave the metal increased tensile strength and hardness compared to other steels being made at the time.|$|R

50|$|Pattern welding {{developed}} {{out of the}} necessarily {{complex process}} of making blades that were both hard and tough from the erratic and unsuitable output from early iron smelting in bloomeries. The bloomery does not generate temperatures high enough to melt iron and steel, but instead reduces the iron oxide ore into particles of pure iron, which then weld into a mass of sponge iron, consisting <b>of</b> <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> impurities in a matrix of relatively pure iron, which is too soft {{to make a good}} blade. Carburizing thin iron bars or plates forms a layer of harder, high carbon steel on the surface, and early bladesmiths would forge these bars or plates together to form relatively homogeneous bars <b>of</b> <b>steel.</b> This laminating process, in which different types <b>of</b> <b>steels</b> together produces patterns that {{can be seen in the}} surface of the finished blade, forms the basis for pattern welding.|$|R

Coincidentialism is the view that the statue and the <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> clay are two objects located at the same place. The <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> clay should be distinguished from the statue because they have different persistence conditions. The lump would not survive the loss of a very small part of clay, but the statue would. The statue would not survive being squashed into a ball, but the <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> clay would.|$|R

The Crimora deposit is about 500 feet wide, 200 feet deep, and half a mile long and consists of clay with scattered <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> manganese ore.

50|$|Juggling knives are {{constructed}} with a blade <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> or sheet aluminium several millimeters thick and a wooden or composite handle such as found on juggling clubs. The blades are often scimitar shaped with a bevelled 'cutting' edge, {{and the other}} edges are rolled to prevent injury. The other common blade shape is an elongated diamond with all edges and the point rolled or otherwise made safe. While this makes knife juggling much safer than popularly assumed, knives can still cause severe trauma injuries to the head and body when falling from a height. Because of this, the juggling <b>of</b> large <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> metal should only be attempted by competent club jugglers who understand the risks.|$|R

The metal was run from the furnace into shallow iron troughs similar to the old refiners' boxes, and the cakes thus formed, when cold and broken up, showed large and beautifully bright facets and crystals specked with minute spots of uncombined carbon. It was called, from its brightness, 'spiegel glanz' or spiegel eisen, i.e., looking-glass iron. Practically its analysis was: Iron, 86â¦25; manganese, 8â¦50; and carbon, 5â¦25; making a total of 100â¦00." ...|$|R

It assesses the usefulness <b>of</b> the <b>Lump</b> <b>of</b> Learning model in the face of accumulating evidence. The axioms <b>of</b> the <b>Lump</b> <b>of</b> Learning model have shaped research priorities in this literature, but many of those axioms do not have a clear empirical basis. Future research proceeding from established facts would set different priorities, and would devote more attention to measuring the effects of migration on skilled-migrant households, rigorously estimating human capital externalities, gathering microdata beyond censuses, and carefully considering optimal policy 9 Ì 6 among others.
