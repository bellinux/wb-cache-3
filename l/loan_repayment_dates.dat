40|$|Entrepreneurial and {{business}} skills are generally considered key to microbusiness success, hence to Microfinance Institution (MFI) clients’ <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> as well. However, empirical evidence is largely lacking, and where present, it is inconclusive {{on the importance}} of these skills for microfinance success. The present paper uses objective MFI <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> data to empirically test whether <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> rates positively correlate with self-evaluations on entrepreneurial {{and business}} skills of loan clients. A survey was conducted among 235 loan clients of uniCredit — an MFI in Ghana. We establish that MFI clients’ self-evaluation of their entrepreneurial and business skills are not related to their <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> rates. However, we observe that women repay their loans better than do male microbusiness entrepreneurs, and <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> was also better for those entrepreneurs with more than 15 years of business experience...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the objective of analyzing the association of group, lender, and socio-economic factors with group <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> performance of the beneficiaries of DECSI operating in the manufacturing sector as group owned MSEs. Primary data was collected from 34 selected group leaders of the group owned MSEs borrowers by using structured questionnaire and depth-interview. Chi-square test employed to analyze the association of group related factors, lender related factors, and socio-economic related factor with group <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> performance. The statistical test revealed that self initiation, peer pressure, suitable <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> period, training, and external shocks have statistically significant association with <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> performance of the group borrowers; whereas homogeneity, internal and regulation, loan size, and loan supervision are found to have statistically insignificant association with group <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> performance, though they make difference on <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> performance of the group borrowers. Therefore, to improve the <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> performance of the group borrowers, DECSI, among others, should consider the statistically significant factors while offering group loan; and should focus on the repayment challenges which are stated by the borrowers (market linkage and loan supervision), and take corrective actions. Finally, further research on similar area is suggested by considering factors that need solution such as experience of group borrowers in the sector, group size, and lack of land; besides similar study may be conducted i...|$|R

Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} identify and analyze the factors that influence group <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> performance of the clients of DECSI operating in the service sector as group owned MSEs. This study applied descriptive and explanatory research approach, cross-sectional primary data, stratified sampling techniques, and finally employed binary logistic regression model to identify and analyze the impact of each independent variable on the <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> performance. A total of eleven explanatory variables were included in the binary logit regression model test.

40|$|Many {{microcredit}} {{programs have}} been created in the United States {{in the past decade}} that replicate design features of their counterparts in the third world. Yet few systematic studies have been carried out to examine what determines these programs' <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> performance. We attempt to fill this gap by studying the determinants of <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> for four of the oldest group-based microcredit programs in the US. Our findings suggest that these programs are faced with a set of social and institutional environments that are both similar to and different from those faced by their third-world counterparts. On the one hand we find that higher levels of education and proximity to the lending agency increase the chances of <b>loan</b> <b>repayment.</b> Low transaction costs for accessing loans and high borrower-costs in the event of default also enhance <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> performance. On the other hand key variables such as gender and homogeneity of borrowers are not significantly related to <b>loan</b> <b>repayment.</b> We conclude by examining the implications of these findings for program design in the US.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to look in to {{microenterprise}} <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> in Addis Ababa particularly to Arada Sub-city. <b>Loan</b> <b>repayment</b> has paramount importance for most developing countries, because lack of financial resources is usually regarded as a major obstacle to the development of such countries. In Addition good repayment performance is an important measure for the success of microfinance institution and micro enterprises. Hence, it is advisable to credit schemes initiatives to make more attention to investigate factors that affect <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> performance which enables the problem to reach millions of poor. According to the findings, educational level, supervision, available of other source of credit and monthly repayment period are found to be positively related to repaying loan in full in a loan period of one year. Loan diversion and loan size has a negative relation. Hence, factors that enhance and hinder <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> performance should be considered by Arada Sub-city and Credit and Saving Office in designing a more effective <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> mechanism for its borrowers...|$|R

Empirical evidence is, however, largely lacking and where present, not consistent. The present paper introduces objective data on <b>loan</b> <b>repayments</b> and examines whether loan client training and monitoring improve <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> rates. We conducted a two-step longitudinal survey. We collected baseline data on 229 uniCredit Ghana Limited MFI loan client files. One and half years later, after having introduced training and monitoring interventions, follow-up data on the same loan clients were collected. Results showed that training interventions fail to improve <b>loan</b> <b>repayment</b> rates. Strikingly, client monitoring does improve repayment rates, irrespective of the clients’ educational level, business experience or gender. These results suggest that MFI's may significantly improve repayment rates should they consistently monitor their loan clients. </p...|$|R
