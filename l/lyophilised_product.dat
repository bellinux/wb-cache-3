40|$|A solid {{dosage form}} for {{multiple}} use {{was developed for}} parenteral administration of diacetylmorphine in a clinical trial on co-prescription of heroin to heroin addicts. A 300 -mg/mL diacetylmorphine hydrochloride solution was lyophilised as 10 -mL aliquots in 30 -mL glass vials, to be reconstituted to 150 mg/mL with water for injection before use. Addition of bulking agents for improvement of the cake structure of the <b>lyophilised</b> <b>product</b> appeared unnecessary. Stability studies indicated good stability of the <b>lyophilised</b> <b>product</b> under prescribed storage conditions (25 degreesC, 60 % relative humidity) and under more extreme conditions (40 degreesC, 75 % relative humidity).

40|$|The basic {{requirement}} for probiotic bacteria {{to be able}} to exert expected positive effects is to be alivetherefore, appropriate quantification methodsare crucial. Due to disadvantages of conventional microbiological methods, the bacterial quantification based on the nucleic acid detection is increasingly used. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the possibilityto use propidium monoazide (PMA) in combination with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method or LIVE/DEAD BacLight viability kit in combination with flow cytometry (FCM) for determination of probiotic bacteria in a <b>lyophilised</b> <b>product</b> containing Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5 and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB- 12. In addition, the viability of probiotic bacteria in <b>lyophilised</b> <b>product</b> during 3 months storage was investigated. In the product, the results of real-time PCR quantification of PMA-treated cells did not differ significantly from those of non-treated cells, which indicate that most of the bacterial cells retained the membrane integrity although they have lost the culturability. The results obtained by FCM analysis were comparable with those by PMA real-time PCR. In conclusion, the PMA real-time PCR and FCM determination of the viability of probiotic bacteria could complement the plate count method which considers only the culturable part of the population...|$|E
40|$|Probiotics are {{extensively}} used {{in animal}} nutrition to improve feed conversion parameters, {{to boost the}} immune response and ultimately to improve animal health and welfare. The aim of our study was to obtain a <b>lyophilised</b> <b>product</b> for use as supplement in poultry feeding and to determine the optimal concentration required for inclusion in feed. In our experiment we have used the following human isolated probiotic bacteria: Lactococcus lactis CMGB 31, Lactobacillus paracasei CMGB 18, Lactococcus lactis CMGB 33, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CMGB 34 and Lactococcus lactis CMGB 32. The strains were preserved by freezing at - 80 ºC. After lyophilisation, using skimmed milk and MRS mixture as preservative and MRS broth as growth media the recorded concentration was of 1 · 109 CFU/g lyophilized product. This product can now be used as probiotic supplement in poultry feed at a concentration of 1 g/kg feed...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} that nanoparticles (NP), obtained by ionotropic cross linking of reduced-MW chitosan (rCh) derivatives with reduced-MW hyaluronan (rHA), could be profitable vehicles for oral administration of beneficial doses of antioxidant constituents of red grape seeds extracts (GSE). NP have previously shown aptitude for internalisation by endothelial progenitor cells. Here they were seen by a fluorescence microscope migrating across excised rat intestine from mucosal to serosal side and permeating from the donor to the acceptor compartment of an Ussing chamber while carrying significant (15 - 20 %) steadily associated fractions of initial antioxidant load. Freshly prepared NP dispersions were stabilised by lyophilisation. The NP dispersions were regenerated from the <b>lyophilised</b> <b>products</b> by adding water under gentle stirring. Lyophilisation-regeneration caused a significant NP size increase yet particles did not grow beyond the upper size limit of particles able to cross the intestinal barrier (500 nm) ...|$|R

30|$|The four {{purified}} protein bands: P 1, P 2, P 3 and P 4 were excised {{from the}} gel {{and placed in}} separate eppendroff tubes prewashed with 500 μl 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/ 60 % acetonitrile (HPLC grade). 250 μl freshly prepared 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (1 : 1, v/v) {{was added to the}} tubes kept at 37 °C for 30 minutes with occasional vortexing to destain the gel pieces. The solution was discarded carefully and 250 μl 20 Mm ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (1 : 1, v/v) was added for further destaining. Next, the gel pieces were immersed in 500 μl acetonitrile for 15 minutes till they shrank and became white in colour. The acetonitrile was pipetted out and gel pieces were air dried at room temperature for 10 minutes. The dried gel pieces were reswollen in 20 μl 25 ng/μl trypsin (mass spectrometry grade, Sigma Aldrich, USA). Initially, trypsin digestion was done at 4 °C for 2 hours followed by overnight digestion at 37 °C. If the trypsin solution dried up, 2 to 3 drops of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added. The trypsin digested protein solutions were taken in fresh tubes and lyophilised for 1 hour. The <b>lyophilised</b> <b>product</b> was dissolved in 5 μl 30 % acetonitrile with 0.1 % TFA. 4.5 μl of the concentrated peptide solutions were spotted on the target plate with 4.5 μl CHCA matrix solution.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{generate}} further characterisation {{data for the}} <b>lyophilised</b> <b>product</b> Erwinia chrysanthemi L-asparaginase, reconstituted drug product (DP; marketed as Erwinase or Erwinaze) was analysed for subvisible (2 – 10 μm) particulate content using both the light obscuration (LO) method and the newer flow-imaging microscopy (FIM) technique. No correlation of subvisible particulate counts exists between FIM and LO nor do the counts correlate with activity at both release and on stability. The subvisible particulate content of lyophilised Erwinia L-asparaginase appears to be consistent and stable over time and in line with other parenteral biopharmaceutical products. The majority (ca. 75 %) of subvisible particulates in L-asparaginase DP were {{at the low end}} of the measurement range by FIM (2 – 4 μm). In this size range, FIM was unable to definitively classify the particulates as either protein or non-protein. More sensitive measurement techniques would be needed to classify the particulates in lyophilised L-asparaginase into type (protein and non-protein), so the LO technique has been chosen for on-going DP analyses. E. chrysanthemi L-asparaginase has a lower rate of hypersensitivity compared with native Escherichia coli preparations, but a subset of patients develop hypersensitivity to the Erwinia enzyme. A DP lot that had subvisible particulate counts on the upper end of the measurement range by both LO and FIM had the same incidence of allergic hypersensitivity in clinical experience as lots at all levels of observed subvisible particulate content, suggesting that the presence of L-asparaginase subvisible particulates is not important with respect to allergic response.

40|$|In this {{research}} agenda on the acute and critical care management of trauma patients, we {{concentrate on the}} major factors leading to death, namely haemorrhage and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In haemostasis biology, the results of randomised controlled trials {{have led to the}} therapeutic focus moving away from the augmentation of coagulation factors (such as recombinant factor VIIa) and towards fibrinogen supplementation and administration of antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid. Novel diagnostic techniques need to be evaluated to determine whether an individualised precision approach is superior to current empirical practice. The timing and efficacy of platelet transfusions remain in question, while new blood products need to be developed and evaluated, including whole blood variants, <b>lyophilised</b> <b>products</b> and novel red cell storage modalities. The current cornerstones of TBI management are intracranial pressure control, maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure and avoidance of secondary insults (such as hypotension, hypoxaemia, hyperglycaemia and pyrexia). Therapeutic hypothermia and decompressive craniectomy are controversial therapies. Further research into these strategies should focus on identifying which subgroups of patients may benefit from these interventions. Prediction of the long-term outcome early after TBI remains challenging. Early magnetic resonance imaging has recently been evaluated for predicting the long-term outcome in mild and severe TBI. Novel biomarkers may also help in outcome prediction and may predict chronic neurological symptoms. For trauma in general, rehabilitation is complex and multidimensional, and the optimal timing for commencement of rehabilitation needs investigation. We propose priority areas for clinical trials in the next 10  years...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{makes an}} {{original}} {{contribution to the}} field of formulation development by providing new experimental data and insights into the effect of processing and formulation conditions on the quality of lyophilised biopharmaceuticals. The quality attributes of <b>lyophilised</b> <b>products</b> include: a quick reconstitution time, product elegance and protein stability, which are known to be affected by processing and formulation parameters. However, choice of formulation excipients or processing conditions often relies on previous experience rather than mechanistic insight. The motivation of this thesis was therefore to provide a greater understanding of how process variables andexcipient choice affect these quality attributes. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were used as model proteins to investigate formulation conditions, which included the excipient, the lyophilisation cooling profile and duration of the annealing step. BSA was also used as a model protein to explore the effects of sucrose and arginine as lyoprotectants. Unique to this study was the investigation of arginine salts as lyoprotectants, wherein the counterions were dicarboxylic acids with increasing chain length. Two key results regarding quality attributes were observed. Firstly, characterisation of the lyophilised structure established that there was an optimal annealing time, beyond which there was an increase in primary drying time, batch heterogeneity and variable moisture content. Secondly, a relationship was found between decreasing dicarboxylic acid chain length and improved protein stability. To explain these findings, two mechanisms are proposed that account for ice crystal growth during annealing and the observed changes in protein stability at the molecular level. Significantly, this research provides insights for future formulation development studies...|$|R
40|$|Resveratrol antimycotoxigenic {{activity}} was tested against Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium gramin-earum in corn. Both trans-resveratrol and RES VIN ® (a commercial <b>lyophilised</b> polyphenolic <b>product</b> {{obtained from the}} skins of red wine grapes, which contains a 10. 015 % resveratrol) were tested for their efficacy to control mycotoxins accumulation in corn. In particular, their effects were tested against fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) and zearalenone (ZEA) accumulation in naturally contaminated corn with addi-tional inocula of toxinogenic isolates of either F. verticillioides or F. graminearum. ZEA accumulation was reduced by 80 % in F. graminearum inoculated samples, while no inhibition of FB 1 accumulation was observed {{in any of the}} treatments tested. Resveratrol has previously shown to have antifungal properties against certain fungal species. Thus, studies are needed using higher resveratrol concentrations in order to achieve wider antimycotoxigenic effect as reported in in vitro studies. Trans-resveratrol and RES VIN ® had similar effects in the experiment carried out, suggesting that the use of the sub product of the wine industry could be a good alternative to synthetic resveratrol.

40|$|Decoctions and {{infusions of}} Rhoicissus tridentata subsp. cuneifolia (Vitaceae) roots and Hgnotubers {{are widely used}} as {{traditional}} medicine by South African women during pregnancy and childbirth. Pharmacological studies using isolated rat uterus and ileum were done {{to determine whether there}} is any pharmacological grounding {{for the use of the}} remedies to induce labour. Initial studies showed a large variation in the contractile activity of the extracts, so investigations were done to determine whether the contractile activity varied according to the season in which plant material was harvested, the location in which the plant grew, or the length of storage of harvested plant material. Plant material harvested from Umlazi (KwaZulu-Natal) and the Suikerbos Nature Reserve (Gauteng) was used for studies on the mechanism of contractile activity. Seasonal variation was investigated by harvested three plants from Suikerbosrand for two years at approximately three monthly intervals. The distributional effect was done using material harvested from around South Africa. Material from Suikerbosrand was stored for either three months or a year to determine whether storage altered the contractile activity. After each harvesting, the different parts of the plants were separated, dried, milled and boiled for approximately an hour. The solutions were allowed to settle overnight at 4 °C, after which the supernatant was siphoned off, then frozen and lyophilised. All <b>lyophilised</b> end <b>products</b> were kept frozen until use. Oestrogenized virgin Sprague-Dawley rats euthanazed with CO 2.

40|$|Boron {{neutron capture}} therapy (BNCT) is a {{radiotherapy}} based cancer treatment requiring {{the availability of}} a low energy thermal neutron beam and a boron containing drug. These requirements limit BNCT availability with the latter pharmaceutical issue related to the extremely short shelf-life and clinical acceptability of the current fructose based L-boronpheylalanine (BPA) formulation. Resolution of the formulation issues would remove this factor and therefore the stability of an alternative mannitol BPA formulation has been investigated. A mannitol BPA solution formulation was prepared and either lyophilised or stored as a solution at varying temperatures. After suitable periods the formulation was analysed by HPLC for BPA and degradation <b>products.</b> <b>Lyophilised</b> and solution mannitol BPA formulations exhibited a temperature and time dependent loss of BPA with concomitant increases in degradation products. Autoclaving the solution induced and accelerated degradation. A solution or lyophilised mannitol BPA formulation has a shelf-life of between one and four years respectively, a marked improvement over the current fructose formulation. Due to temperature dependent degradation the formulation cannot be terminally sterilised by autoclaving. The enhanced stability of the mannitol formulation removes the requirement for extemporaneous aseptic preparation of BPA just prior to treatment and eliminates one of the issues complicating the delivery of BNCT...|$|R
