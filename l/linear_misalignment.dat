40|$|As space {{vehicles}} and structures become {{larger and more}} complex, the development of systems to assist humans in assembling, operating, maintaining, and performing space rescue or retrieval of these vehicles and structures becomes increasingly important. With the diversity of international spacecraft, both manned and unmanned, planned to be in orbit in the future, a set of guidelines for berthing and docking subsystems is mandatory if servicing, resupply, and retrieval is to become practical on an international level. Successful interaction between these space systems and ground and/or space-based humans requires standardized and effective operational interface designs, {{particularly with respect to}} space grasping/berthing/docking interface mechanisms. This paper defines the spacecraft mechanical interfaces necessary to create a standard dynamic envelope for joining two free-flying spacecraft in a 'hard' berth or dock with each other in space. A review was made of past space flights and dynamics simulations dating back to 1962 to obtain necessary parameters and their values for successful manually controlled and autonomous spacecraft docking/berthing. The various spacecraft docking/berthing mechanisms and concepts are illustrated along with their dynamic capture and impact tolerances including maximum contact velocity along the approach axis and in the y-z plane; capture <b>linear</b> <b>misalignment</b> tolerances; and maximum capture roll, pitch, and yaw angles. From this data sets of recommended guidelines parameters were developed for autonomous and manual impact docking tolerances, non-impact grasping/berthing tolerances (end effectors), berthing contact conditions, and alignment tolerances after rigidizing. Also, detailed requirements were developed for mechanical design interface features, as well as latching, unlatching, and separation tolerances. This data was drafted {{in the form of a}} proposed ANSI Standard guideline, reviewed, and added to by members of the committee representing several spacecraft manufacturers, NASA, and the USAF, and a consensus was reached...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{the demand}} for high speed {{wireless}} multimedia services has grown to an unprecedented level. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) optical wireless communication (OWC) can be an excellent supplemental technology to radio frequency (RF) links to achieve high transmission rates. MIMO OWC {{has the potential for}} many applications including secure data communications, mobile advertisements, data exchange in dense high-contention scenarios, and in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). One form of MIMO OWC is a pixelated imaging system which transmits information via a series of pixelated image frames. Such systems have the potential to provide high transmission rates by exploiting spatial diversity at a large scale. For pixelated OWC, a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen or a pixelated grid of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{can be used as a}} transmitter, while a camera or an imaging lens along with an array of photodiodes can be used as a receiver. In order to be resilient to spatial distortions, pixelated systems can encode data using spatial orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (spatial OFDM) which is an extension of the concept of conventional OFDM to the 2 -D spatial domain. Spatial DC biased optical OFDM (SDCO-OFDM) has been described in the literature for pixelated systems. Due to the attractive features mentioned above, spatial OFDM based pixelated systems can be promising candidates for next-generation OWC. However, the technology is still in its infancy and faces a number of challenges including power constraints, <b>linear</b> <b>misalignment</b> error, defocus blur and illumination fall-off known as vignetting. In this research, a novel modulation technique termed spatial asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (SACO-OFDM) is presented for pixelated OWC. Misalignment, defocus, and vignetting are then modelled and their effects on spatial OFDM are analysed. Different signal processing techniques are applied to reduce the effects of these impairments. The joint impact of misalignment, defocus and vignetting on SACO-OFDM and SDCO-OFDM are then presented analytically and through simulations. The optimum choice of DC bias for SDCO-OFDM for a pixelated system is also presented. For the cases considered and for a given data rate, the proposed SACO-OFDM is shown to be more optically power- efficient than the existing SDCO-OFDM...|$|E
40|$|In <b>linear</b> accelerators, <b>misalignments</b> of {{the machine}} {{elements}} can cause considerable emittance growth due to wake fields, dispersion and other effects. Hence, tight limits are imposed on machine tolerances, design parameters and methods of machine operation. In order to simulate the beam dynamics in linacs, the tracking code L has been developed. Including both single- and multi-bunch effects, the behaviour of the beam in the machine can be simulated and adjustments on parameters {{of the machine}} elements up to complete correction techniques and operation procedures can be applied. Utilization {{of the program is}} facilitated by a graphical user interface.

40|$|Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography are noninvasive MRI methods, {{providing}} an insight on microscopic structural information of anisotropic tissues in vivo. The {{success of this}} technique stems on a watchful choice of imaging parameters and post-acquisition reconstruction. In the present work, we {{have focused on the}} problem of residual <b>linear</b> image <b>misalignment</b> in the DTI data and its effects on the parameters of the diffusion tensor and fiber tracking in human brain. We demonstrate substantial sensitivity of the reconstructed diffusion tensor and fiber tractography on increasing amplitude of artificially induced random image misalignment in the DTI. We show that already a submillimeter image misalignment in the DTI is an important source of error, which may potentially mask pathological presentations of the diseases and may partially explain variations in the results obtained from the DTI. Finally, we evaluated four implementations of image registrations and demonstrate their variable performance. This further supports the fact that a robust image registration must be performed to ensure reliable and reproducible diffusion tensor mapping and reconstruction of white matter (WM) fibers.

40|$|Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of {{long-term}} disability in the United States, affecting over 795, 000 people annually. In order to regain motor function of the upper body, patients are usually treated by regular sessions with a dedicated physical therapist. A cost-effective wearable upper body orthotics system that can be used at home to empower both the patients and physical therapists is described. The system is composed of a thin, compliant, lightweight, cost-effective soft orthotic device with an integrated cable actuation system that is worn over the upper body, an embedded limb position sensing system, an electric actuator package and controller. The proposed device is robust to misalignments that may occur during actuation of the compliant brace or when putting on the system. Through simulations and experimental evaluation, it was demonstrated i) that the soft orthotic cable-driven shoulder brace can be successfully actuated without the production of off-axis torques in the presence of misalignments and ii) that the proposed model can identify <b>linear</b> and angular <b>misalignments</b> online...|$|R
40|$|Misalignment {{is one of}} {{the most}} common sources of trouble of {{rotating}} machinery when rigid couplings connect the shafts. Ideal alignment of the shafts is difficult to be obtained and rotors may present angular and/or parallel misalignment (defined also as radial misalignment or offset). During a complete shaft revolution, a periodical change of the bearings load occurs in hyperstatic shaft-lines, if coupling misalignment between the shafts is excessive. If the rotating machine is equipped with fluid-film journal bearings, the change of the loads on the bearing causes also the variation of their instantaneous dynamic characteristics, i. e. damping and stiffness, and the complete system cannot be considered any longer as <b>linear.</b> Despite <b>misalignment</b> is often observed in the practice, there are relatively few studies about this phenomenon in literature and their results are sometimes conflicting. The authors aim at modeling accurately this phenomenon, for the first time in this paper, and giving pertinent diagnostic information. The proposed method is suitable for every type of shaft-line supported by journal bearings. A finite element model is used for the hyperstatic shaft-line, while bearing characteristics are calculated by integrating Reynolds equation as a function of the instantaneous load acting on the bearings, caused also by the coupling misalignment. The results obtained by applying the proposed method are shown by means of the simulation, in the time domain, of the dynamical response of a hyperstatic shaft-line. Nonlinear effects are highlighted and the spectral components of the system response are analyzed, in order to give diagnostic information about the signature of this type of fault...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of <b>linear</b> and angular <b>misalignments</b> on static contact {{parameters}} in a gear pair, taken at various points during the gear meshing cycle. The parameters of interest include {{the degree to which}} the load is shared among the teeth in contact (load sharing ratio (LSR)), the reaction forces at the gear centres and the static transmission error (STE), which can be thought of as the energy stored in the system. The LSR and STE are frequently used in vibratory models of gearboxes to model the coupling between gears and have considerable effects on the system response. In the current work, these parameters are calculated through the analysis of a 3 D spur gear model in the finite element package ABAQUS (TM), where a gear pair is subjected to a known torque at various rotational positions to include regions of single and double tooth contact. It is shown that the introduction of misalignment usually has an effect on the system; however, substantial axial and yaw misalignment are required before non-negligible forces develop. It is also shown that pitch misalignment is the most influential with regard to the reaction moments and transmission error, whereas radial misalignment is more influential in the decomposition of the normal contact force into vertical and horizontal forces...|$|R
40|$|We combine some newly {{developed}} panel co-integration techniques and common factor analysis {{to analyze the}} behavior of the real exchange rate (RER) in a sample of 64 developing countries. We study the dynamic of the RER with its economic fundamentals: productivity, the terms of trade, openness, and government spending. We derive a number of common factors that explain the dynamic of the RER in our sample. We find that while some fundamentals such as productivity, terms of trade, and openness are strongly related to these common factors in low-income countries, no such link is found for the middle-income countries. We also derive the misalignment indices, which seem to reproduce recent episodes of overvaluation and undervaluation in a number of countries.

Using alternative nonlinear models, our results support mean reversion and asymmetric adjustment dynamics.

In particular, the average cumulative sum of deviations during periods when exchange rates are below forecasts is twice that of the sum during periods of over-appreciation, and is larger for developing than for advanced countries.

40|$|Unbalance and {{misalignment}} are {{the major}} causes of vibration in rotating machinery, yet only limited {{research has been conducted}} on misalignment. The literature reports that misalignment results in an increase in the vibration at a frequency corresponding to two times the rotating speed (2 x responses). The research on misalignment conducted so far has modeled the rotor as two coupled shafts supported on linear and non <b>linear</b> bearings, while <b>misalignment</b> is at the coupler. The results reported to date are inconsistent and the vibration response of a misaligned rotor system is not clearly understood. This dissertation presents a study on the effects of a single shaft misalignment on the dynamic response of a rotor-shaft system. A rotor system supported on two rigid bearings with unbalance and misalignment is modeled using the energy method, and Lagrange formulation is used to establish the equations of motion. The misalignment is modeled through introduction of pre-load and nonlinear shaft stiffness in the direction of pre-load. The model is validated by comparing the natural frequencies predicted using the simulation to the rotor system eigenvalue and the forced response from the simulation is verified using finite element method. A response due to perfectly aligned case is compared with those for parallel and angular misalignments of various magnitudes. Simulations are carried out for a speed range of 0 to 10, 000 rpm, and the response of the rotor at the 2 x is carefully examined to establish the effects of various misalignment and non-linear parameters on the response. Experiments are conducted using a rig test to compare with analytically predicted trends. Various gas turbine engine data gathered from the field are also used to confirm the vibration pattern predicted by the simulations. The simulated results are finally used to develop an expert system that can identify unbalance and misalignment in a rotor system. The expert system is developed using Neural Network. Two types of Neural Networks are explored, the back-propagation and the Logicon Projection Network. Finally, both networks are modified, trained and tested using simulation data. The Logicon projection network showed superior performance during training, and was chosen over the back-propagation network. The developed expert system is tested using field test data of gas turbine engines to demonstrate its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of optical imaging systems relies on control of aberrations that can arise from limitations in the design, manufacture, or alignment. This dissertation addresses {{the form of}} aberrations that occur for misaligned reflective systems, such as telescopes. The relationship between a characteristic set of field-dependent aberrations and the misalignments that cause them is systematically explored. A comprehensive technique that quantifies field performance for a 5 -mirror system is given, using Monte Carlo analysis to provide confidence levels of image quality as functions of manufacturing and alignment errors. This analysis {{is an example of}} the "forward problem"— determining optical {{performance of}} a system if the errors are assumed. The inverse problem — determining the state of alignment based on measurements of performance — is more difficult. The solution to the inverse problem for a multiple mirror system requires an understanding of the complex coupling between many degrees of freedom (tilt, decenter, despace, shape error) of the optical elements and field-dependent aberrations. This work builds on previous treatment of field dependent optical aberrations from Tessieres, Thompson, Shack, Buchroeder and others. A basis set of field-dependent aberrations orthogonal over both field and pupil are developed here and used to describe systems with misaligned and misshapen optics. This description allows complete representation of high order and non-linear effects. The functional form of aberrations that are characteristic of mirror tilt, shift, and deformation show some useful patterns that provide insight to the fundamental effects of misalignment. The use of singular value decomposition to create orthogonal combinations of the field dependent aberrations provides a powerful tool for evaluating a system and for estimating the state of alignment using wavefront measurements. The following optical systems are evaluated to investigate the <b>linear</b> coupling between <b>misalignment</b> and the resulting field dependent aberrations:* 2 -mirror telescopes, evaluating well-understood effects for an axisymmetric system and developing the relationships for an unobscured system. * 4 -mirror correctors for a spherical primary telescope. The tools and methods are applied to reflective optical systems for astronomical telescopes, but the methods are general and can be useful for any optical imaging system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe aim of {{the modern}} {{radiotherapy}} {{is to get a}} homogenous dose distribution in PTV, which is obtained by using for example physical or dynamic wedges. The using of a physical wedge has provided such isodose distributions but their use resulted in detrimental dosimetric consequences, for example beam hardening effects and practical consequences of filter handling or possible <b>misalignment.</b> <b>Linear</b> accelerators are now equipped with collimator jaws systems and controlled by modern computers and it is possible to generate wedge shaped isodose distributions dynamically. Because of a more comfortable use of a dynamic wedge, there are alternatives to the standard physical wedge. During the treatment, different segments of the treatment field can be exposed to the primary beam at different intervals of time. This process of shrinking the field while modulating the collimator jaw velocity and dose rate creates the desired wedge-shaped isodose gradient across the treatment field. Dynamic wedges can replace physical wedges but they need more precise dosimetry and quality control procedures. AimThe aim {{of this study was to}} perform a multienergetic verification of dynamic wedge angles using the multichannel detector PTW LA 48 linear array. Material and methodsThe measurements of angle value of dynamic wedges were performed for Clinac 2300 C/D accelerators (Varian). The accelerator was equipped with the EDW option for 6 MV and 15 MV photon beams. In this case, 7 wedge angle values were used: 10 °, 15 °, 20 °, 25 °, 30 °, 45 ° and 60 °. The dynamic wedges are realized by continuous movement of one collimator jaw. The field size is gradually reduced until the collimator is almost completely closed or the field increases, while the beam is on. The measurements were divided in two steps: in the first step, the dynamic wedges were verified with the recommended values and in the second step there the planned and measured angles of dynamic wedges were compared. Measurements were made by means of LA 48 linear array of ionization chambers (PTW). The results of the measurements were compared with the reference profile produced by the treatment planning system ECLIPSE 8. 5 (Varian). ResultsThe results showed differences between measured and calculated angle of dynamic wedges. The differences were observed for both energies in the case of a small angle value. For energies 6 MV and 15 MV, almost all percentage difference between the measured and calculated profile was lower than 5 %. The biggest difference was observed in the first step of measurements when the angle of Dynamic Wedge was verified. The comparison between the planned and measured angle value of Dynamic Wedge showed the difference between 0. 1 % and 4. 5 %. The difference for 6 MV for the angle value of 10 ° in orientation IN was 1. 1 % and for energy 15 MV in the same case the difference was 3. 8 %. Thinner wedges exhibit less difference. ConclusionIt is necessary to provide comprehensive quality control procedure for enhanced dynamic wedges. Verification measurements should be an obligatory procedure in the recommendation for the testing of medical accelerators. These results are the preliminary results to provide measurements in other Polish Cancer Centres...|$|R
