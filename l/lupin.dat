5|$|Arsène <b>Lupin</b> III, the {{grandson}} of the fictional gentleman thief, Arsène <b>Lupin,</b> is considered the world's greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of his desired items. His right-hand man and closest ally is Daisuke Jigen, an expert marksman who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. Although <b>Lupin</b> and Jigen frequently work as a two-man team, they are often joined by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, or Fujiko Mine, a femme fatale and Lupin's love interest. Although Fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits Lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. <b>Lupin</b> and his gang are constantly chased by Inspector Koichi Zenigata of the ICPO, who has made it his life's work to arrest them, pursuing <b>Lupin</b> across the globe.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, an {{animated}} television series called <b>Lupin</b> VIII was planned as a French-Japanese co-production, featuring {{the descendants of}} <b>Lupin,</b> Goemon, Jigen, and Zenigata, but was never completed. Created by DiC Animation, with Rintaro directing, and character designs by Shingo Araki; two scripts were written, and one episode was fully animated with a music and sound effects track, but the voice-overs were never recorded. It {{has been suggested that}} the project was stopped due to Leblanc's estate wanting a large amount of money for use of the <b>Lupin</b> name. The single episode was later included in the 2012 <b>Lupin</b> III Master File box set.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the feeding value of white <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus albus) and triticale for Nicholas Large White turkeys using a corn-soybean meal type diet as a control. Diets were formulated to have equal amounts of specified nutrients per unit of meta-bolizable energy. Growth of male turkeys 0 to 3 weeks of age {{was similar to the}} control group when 15 % white <b>lupins</b> were included in the diet. When white <b>lupins</b> were included at 30, 45, or 60 % of the diet, growth was significantly depressed to 94, 89, or 85 % of control, respectively. When triticale replaced corn there was a 6 % increase in growth, which was nearly significant. Growth of female turkeys 8 to 12 weeks of age fed diets where white <b>lupins</b> supplied 20 % of supplemental (soybean) protein was similar to turkeys fed control diets. When white <b>lupins</b> pro-vided 30, 40, or 100 % of supplemental protein, gains were 94, 95, or 85 % of control, respectively (significant depressions). True metabolizable energy values for white <b>lupins</b> and triticale were 2641 and 3306 kcal/kg, respectively. Amino acid profiles for white <b>lupins</b> and triticale are given.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to optimise the yield percentage of blue <b>lupins</b> in mixed cropping systems. Field experiments were conducted at two locations in Northern Germany (Institute of Organic Farming near Hamburg and Institute of Plant and Soil Science at Braunschweig). Two types of blue <b>lupins,</b> the determinate and branched type were cultivated together with spring barley, spring wheat or fodder peas in different seeding ratios (SR) : 50 % : 50 %, 62, 5 % : 37, 5 % and 75 % : 25 % of the respective pure cropping seeding rate. We present data on total grain yield, yield of blue <b>lupins,</b> yield percentage of blue <b>lupins,</b> protein content, and protein yield. Total grain yield decreased with increasing SR of blue <b>lupins</b> whereas, in contrast, the yield of blue <b>lupins,</b> protein content and protein yield increased. This shows the low competitive ability of blue <b>lupins</b> against the mixed cropping partners, particularly cereals. Therefore, the yield percentage of blue <b>lupins</b> in mixed cropping with cereals did not reach more than 25 %. From the view of plant production and the purpose of animal nutrition the percentage of grain legumes should be higher and comparable to those of other crop mixtures like peas with spring barley or beans with oat...|$|R

5|$|Seven {{theatrical}} animated films {{based on}} <b>Lupin</b> III {{have been created}} by TMS Entertainment. The first animated feature film adaptation of the series was titled simply <b>Lupin</b> III (later known as <b>Lupin</b> III: <b>Lupin</b> vs. the Clone), directed by Sōji Yoshikawa and released in Japanese theaters on December 16, 1978. Hayao Miyazaki directed the next feature film, The Castle of Cagliostro, which was released in Japanese theaters on December 15, 1979.|$|E
5|$|Since 1997 {{a number}} of manga series have been created by several artists and {{released}} in several Futabasha magazines. On August 27, 2004, Futabasha launched <b>Lupin</b> III Official Magazine, a quarterly publication of <b>Lupin</b> III manga by various authors.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>lupins</b> contain certain {{secondary}} compounds, including isoflavones {{and toxic}} alkaloids, such as lupinine and sparteine. With early detection, {{these can be}} removed through processing, although <b>lupins</b> containing these elements are not usually selected for food-grade products.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown similar water use for <b>lupins</b> [Lupinus angustifolius L.) and wheat {Triticum aestivum L.), despite a {{considerably}} smaller root system in <b>lupins.</b> A field study and an experiment under controlled conditions using pressure-flux relationships were conducted to examine whether higher hydraulic conductances {{were responsible for the}} greater water uptake per unit root length in <b>lupins.</b> In the field experi-ment, the flux of water and differences in water poten-tial through the soil-plant system were measured for both species and used to calculate the hydraulic con-ductance through the plant and through the root and shoot. The hydraulic conductance for the whole plant was 3 - 5 times greater in <b>lupins</b> than in wheat. This relative difference between the species was similar when plant hydraulic conductance was expressed per unit of root length. This occurred despite the differ-ence in midday water potential between soil and leaves, being consistently greater in wheat (— 1. 0 MPa) than in <b>lupins</b> (- 0. 7 MPa). When the total plant con-ductance was separated into its components, the combined soil and root conductance and the shoot conductance were 2 and 6 times greater, respectively, in <b>lupins</b> than in wheat. In the experiment under con-trolled conditions, hydraulic conductance for the entire root system was determined using a pressure chamber. The specific root hydraulic conductances were 4 times greater in <b>lupins</b> than in wheat. The results from both field and controlled conditions experiments suggest that the greater water uptake per unit root length in <b>lupins</b> compared to wheat results from appreciably larger root and shoot hydraulic conductances...|$|R
40|$|Besides other legumes <b>lupins</b> {{belong to}} the local protein crops usuable as feeding stuff in ecologic farming. Therefore an {{important}} breeding aim is to provide <b>lupins</b> with high and stable protein content. A non-destructive analysis using near infrared transmittance spectroscopy was developed for determination of protein in single seeds of <b>lupins.</b> Calibration and validation equations were calculated {{on the basis of}} 300 single seeds of 3 blue <b>lupins</b> (‘Azuro’, ‘Bolivio’, ‘Boregine’) growing at 3 ecological locations. The estimation of protein content was possible in a range of 15 - 44 % protein with a coefficient of determination (r²) of 0, 907 and a standard error of prediction (SEP) of 1, 86 %. The equation was applied to evaluate the protein content of single seeds in single plants of <b>lupins.</b> So the prediction of protein content is possible at early breeding stage and the investigated seeds can further used for the sowings...|$|R

50|$|Sages believe <b>lupins</b> to be {{a result}} of {{crossbreeding}} between humans and gnolls. They are intelligent and productive craftsmen and are friendly towards most races. In the Mystara campaign settings <b>Lupins</b> are most commonly found on the Savage Coast.|$|R
40|$|The {{growth and}} carcase {{characteristics}} of South Suffolk x Merino ewe lambs, grazed on mature crops of either faba beans, field peas, or <b>lupins</b> were evaluated. Lambs grazing faba beans grew significantly (P< 0. 05) faster (220 g/head/day) than lambs grazing field peas (186 g/day), {{which in turn}} grew faster than lambs grazing <b>lupins</b> (166 g/day). These differences in growth rate {{were also reflected in}} significant (P< 0. 05) differences in carcase weight. Carcases from lambs grazing <b>lupins</b> had whiter fat than those from lambs grazing faba beans or field peas (P< 0. 05) but there were no differences in either meat colour or GR tissue depth. The gross margin from grazing lambs on <b>lupins</b> was greater than grazing lambs on either field peas or faba beans.

40|$|Sweet white <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus albus) and a {{high protein}} variety of soyabeans, AC Proteus (HPSB), were roasted in an {{electric}} roaster at 300 degrees C for 1, 2, 3 or 4 min. Raw and roasted samples were analysed for total nitrogen, acid detergent insoluble N and protease insoluble N, and available rumen by-pass protein (RBP) was determined. In situ degradability of DM and N was determined using Dacron bags in the rumen of 3 ruminally cannulated dry cows. Soyabean meal {{was used as a}} control treatment. Roasting did not affect the total N content of <b>lupins</b> (4. 9 %) and HPSB (7. 3 %), but increased linearly (P< 0. 02) the protease insoluble N content of both. As roasting time increased the acid detergent insoluble N content of <b>lupins</b> (4. 7, 5. 1, 6. 7 and 7. 9 % at 1, 2, 3 and 4 min roasting, respectively) and HPSB (4. 9, 6. 3, 6. 6 and 7. 2 % at 1, 2, 3 and 4 min roasting, respectively) increased. Available RBP in roasted HPSB increased as roasting time increased (27. 6, 33. 8, 41. 2 and 43. 3 % at 1, 2, 3 and 4 min roasting, respectively); however, roasting time did not affect RBP of roasted <b>lupins</b> (20. 6 %). Soyabean meal had a lower RBP percentage than roasted <b>lupins</b> or HPSB. Roasting reduced (P< 0. 01) effective degradation of DM and N in roasted <b>lupins</b> and HPSB at a calculated outflow rate in the rumen of 0. 06 h/day.

40|$|RONO: 00 Narrow {{leaf and}} yellow <b>lupins</b> have {{significant}} potential {{with respect to}} ruminant, poultry and aquaculture supply chains in the UK. Their protein and oil content is such that they have considerable promise as part of livestock diets together with other advantages as arable break crops. However, the current area of these <b>lupins</b> grown in the UK is very small with major problems of low and very variable yields, late maturity and intolerance of alkaline soils. This in turn {{means that there is}} little supply of <b>lupins</b> into feed formulations. We have shown that improvements in these traits is possible, after only two generations of selection, although further germplasm improvement is required before these species can {{play a major role in}} UK agriculture. Similarly, the potential for <b>lupins</b> to replace soya in ruminant diets has been shown in short term studies. There is a need to extend these studies and to focus on the effects of using <b>lupins</b> in ruminant diets over longer time periods and the use of new technologies, such as crimping to allow for earlier harvesting dates, and the use of new technologies, - to enhance palatability and inclusion rates not only for ruminants but also poultry and fish. At the same time further work on weed control is needed to develop an agronomic 'package' to make the most of narrow leafed and yellow <b>lupins</b> in the UK...|$|R
