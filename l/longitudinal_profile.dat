Results show that there exists a loss and compensatory mechanism of sediment transport in response to riverbed incision, which is an important factor driving this type of river systems towards a state of equilibrium. After deepening, riverbed sediments consume more erosive energy and sustain high gradient channels, leading to special <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles.</b> River discharge and riverbed sediment are the dominant elements controlling the formation of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles.</b> After introducing a dimensionless parameter derived from river discharge and riverbed sediment, the channel gradient and the new dimensionless parameter shows a good linear relationship...|$|R

40|$|Surveyor images, {{cross-sectional}} and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles</b> {{of channels}} and valleys were analyzed in Xanthe Terra on Mars. Concave and convex <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles</b> were observed at Bahram and Tyras Valles, respectively, while no general trend was visible at other valleys. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles</b> also {{showed signs of}} knickpoints and some short reaches with increasing elevation in the flow direction. The cross-sectional profiles of Tyras Valles show more V-shaped of upper and U-shaped of lower reaches, but the great variety of profiles of other channels suggests a complex relationship with the regional lithology/topography. Also at Tyras Valles the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles</b> could be divided into {{upper and lower sections}} that probably formed at different periods under different conditions. The largest observed valleys contain small, previously unnoticed inner channels. There is no correlation between the shape of cross-sectional profiles and the direction of curvature of the valley’s long axis (left/right or straight), as is found in riverbeds on the Earth, suggesting that the analyzed depressions are probably valleys and not dry riverbeds, but substantial wind-blown sedimentary infill could have modified their shape too.

40|$|Abstract. We have {{performed}} a vertical analysis of drainage basins on Mars that were computationally extracted from DEMs {{based on the}} MOLA data. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>profiles</b> of main streams are calculated and the slope-area relation is established for 20 basins coming from assorted martian locations. An identical analysis is done for 19 terrestrial river basins. Our results show that, in comparison to terrestrial basins, martian basins have more linear <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles,</b> more frequent existence of knickpoints, predominance of asymmetric location of the main stream in the basin, and smaller values of concavity exponent. This suggests a limited role for surface runoff on the global scale. However, two basins extracted from the slopes of martian volcanoes show a strong similarity to terrestrial basins, indicating a possible local role for the process of surface runoff...|$|R
