50|$|Longitudinal {{dihedral}} is {{a comparatively}} obscure term {{related to the}} pitch axis of an airplane. It is the angle between the zero <b>lift</b> <b>axis</b> of the wing and horizontal tail. Longitudinal dihedral can influence the nature of controllability about the pitch axis {{and the nature of}} an aircraft's phugoid-mode oscillation.|$|E
50|$|Longitudinal {{dihedral}} {{can also}} mean the angle between the zero <b>lift</b> <b>axis</b> {{of the wing}} and tail instead of between the root chords of the two surfaces. This is the more meaningful usage because the directions of zero-lift are pertinent to longitudinal trim and stability while the directions of the root chords are not.|$|E
50|$|In aerodynamics, {{angle of}} attack {{specifies}} the angle between the chord line of the wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined. Often, the chord line of {{the root of the}} wing is chosen as the reference line. Another choice is to use a horizontal line on the fuselage as the reference line (and also as the longitudinal axis). Some authors do not use an arbitrary chord line, but use the zero <b>lift</b> <b>axis,</b> whereby zero {{angle of attack}} corresponds to zero coefficient of lift by definition.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} for the precise grinding of crankshaft pin is presented. In which, noncircular following strategy is investigated {{based on the}} motion model consists of horizontal feeding <b>axis,</b> additional <b>lifting</b> <b>axis</b> for wheel frame, and the active rotary axis for workpiece. The straight line relationship of wheel center, pin center and grinding point is ensured by the synchronism between standard arc interpolation motion of wheel frame and eccentric circular motion of pin section. Comparing with traditional tangential point tracing scheme, both constant grinding line-speed and simple control algorithm are fulfilled simultaneously. The negative effect of perpendicular deviation introduced by <b>lifting</b> <b>axis</b> is kinematically analyzed {{as well as the}} dynamic response error of servo system, and solving methods are carried out accordingly. By computer simulation and experimental test, the reported noncircular following strategy emerges good characteristics in the manufacturing of crankshaft, such as a strong adaptability for wheel wearing, simple motion control and high roundness precision...|$|R

40|$|A {{monocoque}} {{box beam}} {{consisting of a}} 24 S-T aluminum-alloy sheet reinforced by four bulkheads and by longitudinal stringers and corner posts was subjected to bending loads as follows: pure bending about the <b>lift</b> <b>axis,</b> cantilever bending about the <b>lift</b> <b>axis,</b> and pure bending about both lift and drag axis. Longitudinal strains were measured for loads up to a load at which permanent set became measurable. The loads were sufficient to produce buckling of the sheet between stringers on the compression side of the box. The only noticeable effect of this buckling was a small increase in extreme-fiber strain on the compression side. The measured strains and measured deflections differed less than 10 percent from those computed from the simple beam theory after taking account of the effective width of the buckled sheet. The effect of the bulkheads {{on the distribution of}} stringer strain was negligible...|$|E

The booms enlarged the Meillerwagen footprint to stabilise it during erection of the rocket, and provided a means of adjusting the Meillerwagen transverse level. The booms deployed outward and forward of the <b>lifting</b> frame trunnion <b>axis</b> to prevent it toppling forward or to either side.|$|R
40|$|Let L be a link in an {{thickened}} annulus. We {{specify the}} embedding of this annulus {{in the three}} sphere, and consider its complement {{thought of as the}} axis to L. In the right circumstances this <b>axis</b> <b>lifts</b> to a null-homologous knot in the double branched cover of the three sphere, branched over the embedded copy of L. This paper shows that the knot Floer homology of this lift, with mod 2 coefficients, can be computed from a spectral sequence starting at a type of Khovanov homology already described by Asaeda, Przytycki, and Sikora. We extend the known results about this type of Khovanov homology, and use it to provide a very simple explanation of the case when L is alternating for the obvious projection.

40|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>lift</b> driven {{vertical}} <b>axis</b> turbine {{which can be used}} for capturing energy from tidal streams. These are the straight bladed “Darrieus-type” and the helically shaped “Gorlov-type”. The Darrieus-type turbine can suffer from vibrations in the shaft due to torque variations, known as “torque ripple”. Gorlov-type turbines ought to reduce this problem but suffer from variations in force distribution along the length of turbine blade. The double multiple streamtube model (a blade element momentum model), with the Gormont-Berg adaptation for dynamic stall, is used to analyse the blade forces and shaft torques. The results show the extent to which torque ripple or variable blade force is effected by various other design choices, such as blade thickness, blade camber or turbine solidity. From these some of the requisite turbine characteristics are derived...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary results {{obtained}} {{for a new}} configuration lift based vertical-axis wind turbine are shown. The turbine rotor is a cross flow fan type made with high curvature aerodynamic profiles. A reduced scale model of the turbine rotor has been designed and preliminary tested at the Department of Aerospace Engineering of the University of Pisa (rotor diameter = 250 mm, rotor height = 210 mm). The reduced scale model shows an efficiency of about 18 %. The rotor is of a self-starting type. Two-dimensional CFD analyses have been performed applying both the Moving Reference Frame and the Moving Mesh conditions to the grid which surrounds the rotor blades (Fluent® Rel. 6. 3 and STAR-CCM+® Rel. 6. 04 have been used). Noticeable scale effects have been found numerically, so, the efficiency of a full scale <b>lift</b> based vertical <b>axis</b> multi-blades optimized wind turbine {{is expected to be}} comparable with lift based horizontal-axis wind turbine...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} {{mammalian}} physiology, {{such as those}} affecting reproduction, hibernation and metabolism, are controlled by pituitary hormones released in response to annual environmental changes. In temperate zones, the primary environmental cue driving seasonal reproductive cycles is the change in daylength (photoperiod), encoded by the pattern of melatonin secretion from the pineal gland. However, although reproduction relies on hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) output, and most cells producing reproductive hormones are in the pars distalis (PD) of the pituitary, melatonin receptors are localized in the pars tuberalis (PT), a physically and functionally separate part of the gland. How melatonin in the PT controls the PD is not understood. Here we show that melatonin time-dependently acts on its receptors in the PT to alter splicing of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Outside the breeding season, angiogenic VEGF-A stimulates vessel growth in the infundibulum, aiding vascular communication between the PT, PD and brain. This also acts on VEGFR 2 expressed in PD prolactin-producing cells known to impair gonadotrophin secretion. In contrast, in the breeding season, melatonin releases anti-angiogenic VEGF-Axxxb from the PT, inhibiting infundibular angiogenesis and diminishing lactotroph VEGFR 2 expression, <b>lifting</b> reproductive <b>axis</b> repression in response to shorter day lengths. The time-dependent, melatonin-induced differential expression of VEGF-A isoforms culminates in alterations in gonadotroph function opposite to those of lactotrophs, with up-regulation and down-regulation of gonadotropin gene expression during the breeding and non-breeding season, respectively. These results provide a novel mechanism by which melatonin can control pituitary function in a seasonal manner...|$|R
40|$|Vertical axis {{wind turbine}} {{concepts}} are particularly attractive for the urban environment {{for various reasons}} including adaptability to varying wind directions. On the other hand, these types of turbines suffer from various disadvantages including prohibitive costs. In this paper, we present an innovative concept of a Self Adjusting <b>Lift</b> Type Vertical <b>Axis</b> Wind Turbine (SATVAWT) being developed by the a consortium of local academia and industry. Although the project {{is still in its}} infancy some insight of the design is presented, particularly the aerodynamic and structural aspects of the blades which are being optimised for highest possible efficiency. Some results from numerical analysis tools are also presented. To provide easy start up, the turbine blades are at first retracted. Due to the accelerating motion, momentum is conserved by means of an increase in the polar moment of inertia about the axis of rotation. This causes the turbine blades to flex. In this position, advanced aerodynamic calculations using vortex methods have shown that the turbine should operate at a higher efficiency for the rated condition. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tools have also been used to assess the structural feasibility of the turbine. The preliminary results presented here are encouraging and will form the basis for further computational and experimental analysis. Bajada New Energy Ltd., CD Power Saving Co.
