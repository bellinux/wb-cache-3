40|$|Women {{are gaining}} {{increased}} access to small military cockpits. This shift has stimulated {{the search for}} practical urine containment and disposal methods for female aircrew. There are no external urine collection devices (UCD) for women that are comfortable, convenient, and leak free. We describe a prototype UCD that begins to meet this need. Materials used to make custom aviator masks were adapted to mold a perineal mask. First, a perineal cast (negative) was {{used to make a}} <b>mold</b> (<b>positive).</b> Next, a perineal mask made of wax was formed to fit the <b>positive</b> <b>mold.</b> Finally, a soft, pliable perineal mask was fabricated using the wax model as a guide. The prototype was tested for comfort, fit, and leakage. In the sitting position, less than 5 cc of urine leakage occurred with each 600 cc of urine collected. Comfort was mostly satisfactory, but ambulation was limited and the outlet design could lead to kinking and obstruction. We concluded that a perineal mask may serve as a comfortable and functional external UCD acceptable for use by females in confined environments. Changes are needed to improve comfort, fit, and urine drainage. Integration into cockpits, pressure suits, chemical defense gear, and environments where access to relief facilities is restricted is planned...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Multiple {{studies have}} linked fungal {{exposure}} to asthma, but {{the link to}} severe asthma is controversial. We studied the relationship between asthma severity and immediate type hypersensitivity to mold (fungal) and non-mold allergens in 181 asthmatic subjects. Methods We recruited asthma patients aged 16 to 60 years at a University hospital and a nearby General Practice. Patients were categorized according to the lifetime number of hospital admissions for asthma (82 never admitted, 53 one admission, 46 multiple admissions). All subjects had allergy skin prick tests performed for 5 mold allergens (Aspergillus, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Penicillium and Candida) and 4 other common inhalant allergens (D. pteronyssinus, Grass Pollen, Cat and Dog). Results Skin reactivity to all allergens was commonest in the group with multiple admissions. This trend was strongest for mold allergens and dog allergen and weakest for D. pteronyssinus. 76 % of patients with multiple admissions {{had at least one}} <b>positive</b> <b>mold</b> skin test compared with 16 %- 19 % of other asthma patients; (Chi squared p Conclusion These findings support previous suggestions that mold sensitization may be associated with severe asthma attacks requiring hospital admission. </p...|$|R

However, fabricating these structures by a nanoimprinting method invites problems like collapse, dislocation, and defects.

40|$|CLINICAL {{research}} {{on the subject of}} club-bing of the digits has been handicapped by the lack of a reliable method for quantita-tion of clubbing. The present report de-scribes an accurate method for describing the degree of clubbing in man and illustrates its use in detecting small changes in the de-gree of clubbing with time. Methods The aim of the method was to reproduce the contour of a digit by an accurate cast. Impres-sions for the casts of the fingers were made with an irreversible hydrocolloid material (Jeltrate). * The chief ingredient of this material is the potas-sium salt of alginic acid, a material extracted from the leaves of marine kelp. When water is added, the alginate forms an insoluble, gelatinous salt with calcium. The time required for setting is approximately 3 minutes and is adjusted by the presence of an inhibitor, sodium phosphate, which preferentially reacts xvith the calcium. When the inhibitor is used up, the calcium forms the insoluble calcium alginate gel. To provide the material with good mixing characteristics and a proper impression consistency, an inert filler, diatomaceous earth, is added. A complex fluoride is also added to prevent the impression material from inhibiting the setting of the stone when it is poured into the impression to make the <b>positive</b> <b>mold.</b> The alginate impression material will re-produce a line 0. 0015 inches in width. 1 If the impression is kept moist and used without delay, there will be a change of less than 0. 05 % in the linear dimension. 1 The dental stone Hydroset,t a hemihydrate of calcium sulfate, was used fo...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{prosthetic}} socket fabrication is a laborious {{and time}} consuming process that involves physical measurements, plaster wrapping of the stump, plaster casting for <b>positive</b> <b>mold</b> preparation, and a thermoforming process. During the mold preparation stage, significant modifications are performed subjectively {{based on the}} prosthetist 2 ̆ 7 s experience to transmit an optimum load to the residual limb through the socket. Rapid Prototyping techniques have advanced rapidly during the recent decades emerging as a computer aided socket design alternative which promises a potential reduction in the fabrication time, and a more systematic design approach. In addition, 3 -D scanning provides accurate and fast virtual replica of the stump which can be imported in CAD environments. Within 3 -D CAD software, prosthetists are able to perform modifications precisely and store files indefinitely. This work examines the potential use of ZCorp 3 -D printers to directly manufacture the thermoforming mold required for prosthetic socket manufacture. This work analyses the performance of Rapid Tooling molds for thermoformed socket based on three main parameters: pneumatic permeability, flexural strength and wear rate. The traditional material for mold casting, Plaster of Paris, is compared to materials used for three dimensional printing by Zcorp printers: zp 130 and zp 140 untreated as well as using them with custom and novel post treatments. To obtain the flexural strength of the different materials, three point bend tests were performed in a universal test machine using ASTM Standard D 790 - 03 requirements. In addition, pneumatic permeability tests were performed to cylindrical specimens of the different materials following ASTM Standard D 6539 - 00. Thermoforming tests confirm that Zcorp 3 -D printed parts can serve as effective molds for thermoforming of prosthetic socket...|$|R
