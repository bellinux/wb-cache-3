5|$|In 1552, <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> {{published}} A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies. This book, {{written a}} decade earlier {{and sent to the}} attention of then-prince Philip II of Spain, contained accounts of the abuses committed by some Spaniards against Native Americans during the early stages of colonization. In 1555 his old Franciscan adversary Toribio de Benavente Motolinia wrote a letter in which he described <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> as an ignorant, arrogant troublemaker. Benavente described indignantly how <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> had once denied baptism to an aging Indian who had walked many leagues to receive it, only on the grounds that he did not believe that the man had received sufficient doctrinal instruction. This letter, which reinvoked the old conflict over the requirements for the sacrament of baptism between the two orders, was intended to bring <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> in disfavour. However, it did not succeed.|$|E

Briones, looking out for his own interests, delayed his return. At this point, Las Casas' fleet was caught in a sudden storm and wrecked upon the Honduran coast, killing some of Las Casas' men. The survivors were captured by Olid.|$|E
5|$|Three Hieronymite friars, Luis de Figueroa, Bernardino de Manzanedo and Alonso de Santo Domingo, were {{selected}} as commissioners {{to take over}} the authority of the Indies. <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> had a considerable part in selecting them and writing the instructions under which their new government would be instated, largely based on Las Casas's memorial. <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> himself was granted the official title of Protector of the Indians, and given a yearly salary of one hundred pesos. In this new office <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> was expected to serve as an advisor to the new governors with regard to Indian issues, to speak the case of the Indians in court and send reports back to Spain. <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> and the commissioners traveled to Santo Domingo on separate ships, and <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> arrived two weeks later than the Hieronimytes. During this time the Hieronimytes had time to form a more pragmatic view of the situation than the one advocated by Las Casas; their position was precarious as every encomendero on the Islands was fiercely against any attempts to curtail their use of native labour. Consequently, the commissioners were unable to take any radical steps towards improving the situation of the natives. They did revoke some encomiendas from Spaniards, especially those who were living in Spain and not on the islands themselves; they even repossessed the encomienda of Fonseca, the Bishop of Burgos. They also carried out an inquiry into the Indian question at which all the encomenderos asserted that the Indians were quite incapable of living freely without their supervision. <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> was disappointed and infuriated. When he accused the Hieronymites of being complicit in kidnapping Indians, the relationship between <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> and the commissioners broke down. <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> had become a hated figure by Spaniards all over the Islands, and he had to seek refuge in the Dominican monastery. The Dominicans had been the first to indict the encomenderos, and they continued to chastise them and refuse the absolution of confession to slave owners, and even stated that priests who took their confession were committing a mortal sin. In May 1517, <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> was forced to travel back to Spain to denounce to the regent the failure of the Hieronymite reforms. Only after <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> had left did the Hieronymites begin to congregate Indians into towns similar to what <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> had wanted.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in Puerto Rico, in January 1521, he {{received}} the terrible news that the Dominican convent at Chiribichi had been sacked by Indians, and that the Spaniards of the islands had launched a punitive expedition, led by Gonzalo de Ocampo, into {{the very heart of}} the territory that <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> wanted to colonize peacefully. The Indians had been provoked to attack the settlement of the monks because of the repeated slave raids by Spaniards operating from Cubagua. As Ocampo's ships began returning with slaves from the land <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> had been granted, he went to Hispaniola to complain to the Audiencia. After several months of negotiations <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> set sail alone; the peasants he had brought had deserted, and he arrived in his colony already ravaged by Spaniards.|$|E
5|$|Olid treated González and <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> more as honoured guests than as prisoners. Pedro de Briones' {{abandonment}} of Honduras {{resulted in a}} significant weakening of Olid's forces. <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> and González Dávila took advantage of this opportunity, and of Olid's excessive trust in his prisoners, to attack Olid and escape from their confinement. Once free, they expected support from Briones. Seizing their opportunity, González and <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> set upon Olid one evening and seriously wounded him. Olid managed to escape and hid in an Indian hut, but he was quickly found, and subjected to a rapid trial. Olid was executed by having his throat cut in the plaza at Naco. After the death of Olid, Spanish relations with the natives of Naco deteriorated notably. The Indians were increasingly unwilling to provide the Spanish with food and other supplies, {{and most of the}} Spanish abandoned the settlement and either returned to Mexico or resettled in other parts of Honduras. A court in Mexico subsequently condemned <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> and González Dávila for their execution of Olid, but neither was ever punished.|$|E

As the British empire rose to power and hostilities between the British and Spanish began, the British used <b>Las</b> <b>Casas's</b> accounts of Spanish cruelty as a political tool making it part of the foundation of what Spanish nationalists have called the Black Legend, the tendency of historians to slander Spain for its imperial past, while looking mildly at the same undertakings by others such as the British.|$|R

5|$|With his father, <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> {{immigrated to}} the island of Hispaniola in 1502 on the {{expedition}} of Nicolás de Ovando. <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> became a hacendado and slave owner, receiving {{a piece of land}} in the province of Cibao.

5|$|Dominican friar Bartolomé de <b>las</b> <b>Casas</b> {{arrived in}} the colony of Guatemala in 1537 and {{immediately}} campaigned to replace violent military conquest with peaceful missionary work. <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> offered to achieve the conquest of the Land of War through the preaching of the Catholic faith. It was the Dominicans who promoted {{the use of the}} name Verapaz instead of the Land of War. Because {{of the fact that the}} land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area should Las Casas' strategy succeed. <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> and a group of Dominican friars established themselves in Rabinal, Sacapulas and Cobán, and managed to convert several native chiefs using a strategy of teaching Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the atrocities that <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> described were exaggerated or even invented, {{but this is not}} generally considered likely as <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> was far from the only person to be deeply worried about abuse and mistreatment of the Indians. The Dominican friars Antonio de Montesinos and Pedro de Córdoba had reported extensive violence already {{in the first decade of}} the conquest of the Indies, and throughout the conquest of the Americas there were reports of abuse of the natives by friars and priests and ordinary citizens, and many massacres of indigenous people were reported in full by those who perpetrated them. Even some of Las Casas's enemies, such as Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, reported many gruesome atrocities committed against the Indians by the colonizers. All in all, modern historians tend to disregard the numerical figures given by <b>Las</b> <b>Casas,</b> but maintain that the general picture he presented of an intensely violent and abusive conquest did represent reality.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the stated}} {{purposes}} for writing the account was <b>Las</b> <b>Casas's</b> fear of Spain coming under divine punishment and {{his concern for}} {{the souls of the}} native peoples. The account {{was one of the first}} attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict the unfair treatment that the indigenous people endured during the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Greater Antilles, particularly the island of Hispaniola. <b>Las</b> <b>Casas's</b> point of view can be described as being heavily against some of the Spanish methods of colonization, which, as he described them, inflicted great losses on the indigenous occupants of the islands. His account was largely responsible for the adoption of the New Laws of 1542, which abolished native slavery for the first time in European colonial history and led to the Valladolid debate.|$|R

5|$|Bartolomé de <b>las</b> <b>Casas</b> spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de <b>las</b> <b>Casas</b> {{was born}} in Seville in 1484, on 11 November. For centuries, Las Casas's birthdate was {{believed}} to be 1474; however, in the 1970s, scholars conducting archival work demonstrated this to be an error, after uncovering in the Archivo General de Indias records of a contemporary lawsuit that demonstrated he was born a decade later than had been supposed. Subsequent biographers and authors have generally accepted and reflected this revision. His father, Pedro de <b>las</b> <b>Casas,</b> a merchant, descended from one of the families that had migrated from France to found the town of Seville; his family also spelled the name Casaus. According to one biographer, his family were of converso heritage, although others refer to them as ancient Christians who migrated from France. Following the testimony of Las Casas's biographer Antonio de Remesal, tradition has it that <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> studied a licentiate at Salamanca, but this is never mentioned in Las Casas's own writings.

5|$|Following a {{suggestion}} {{by his friend}} and mentor Pedro de Córdoba, <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> petitioned a land grant {{to be allowed to}} establish a settlement in northern Venezuela at Cumaná. Founded in 1515, there was already a small Franciscan monastery in Spain, Cumana Mexico, and a Dominican one at Chiribichi, but the monks there were being harassed by Spaniards operating slave raids from the nearby Island of Cubagua. In order to make the proposal palatable to the King, <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> had to incorporate the prospect of profits for the royal treasury. He suggested fortifying the northern coast of Venezuela, establishing ten royal forts to protect the Indians and starting up a system of trade in gold and pearls. All the Indian slaves of the New World should be brought to live in these towns and become tribute paying subjects to the King. In order to secure the grant <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> had to go through a long fight in court against Bishop Fonseca and his supporters Gonzalo de Oviedo and Bishop Quevedo of Tierra Firme. Las Casas's supporters were Diego Columbus and the new chancellor Gattinara. Las Casas's enemies slandered him to the King, accusing him of planning to escape with the money to Genoa or Rome. In 1520 Las Casas's concession was finally granted, but it was a much smaller grant than he had initially proposed; he was also denied the possibilities of extracting gold and pearls, which made it difficult for him to find investors for the venture. <b>Las</b> <b>Casas</b> committed himself to producing 15,000 ducats of annual revenue, increasing to 60,000 after ten years, and to erecting three Christian towns of at least 40 settlers each. Some privileges were also granted to the initial 50 shareholders in Las Casas's scheme. The King also promised not to give any encomienda grants in Las Casas's area. That said, finding fifty men willing to invest 200 ducats each and three years of unpaid work proved impossible for <b>Las</b> <b>Casas.</b> In the end, he ended up leaving in November 1520 with just a small group of peasants, paying for the venture with money borrowed from his brother in-law.|$|E

The Dominicans were the first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population. Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives as they saw fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Ciudad de San Cristóbal, {{the capital}} of the Mexican state of Chiapas, was renamed San Cristóbal de <b>Las</b> <b>Casas,</b> in honor of its first bishop.

In the Catholic Church, the Dominicans introduced his cause for canonization in 1976. In 2002 the Church began the process for his beatification.|$|E
