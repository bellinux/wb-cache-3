500|$|Many social facts, however, have no {{material}} form. Even the most [...] "individualistic" [...] or [...] "subjective" [...] phenomena, such as love, freedom or suicide, would be regarded by Durkheim as objective social facts. Individuals composing society do not directly cause suicide: suicide, {{as a social}} fact, exists independently in society, and is caused by other social facts (such as rules governing behavior and group attachment), whether an individual <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> or not. Whether a person [...] "leaves" [...] a society does not alter {{the fact that this}} society will still contain suicides. Suicide, like other immaterial social facts, exists independently of the will of an individual, cannot be eliminated, and is as influential – coercive – as physical laws such as gravity. Sociology's task thus consists of discovering the qualities and characteristics of such social facts, which can be discovered through a quantitative or experimental approach (Durkheim extensively relied on statistics).|$|E

Kevin Apaza, writing for Direct Lyrics labelled the single [...] "fresh and funky", confessing that he <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> better than its predecessors [...] "1.000.000" [...] (2012) and [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] (2011). Furthermore, Apaza foreseed [...] "Lemonade" [...] as a club hit with the help of [...] "a few killer remixes". MTV declared the song as being [...] "catchy", while stating that [...] "you'd be hard-pressed to turn down a glass of what Stan’s serving this summer".

500|$|Despite the record's darker themes, many {{lyrics are}} more flippant and sexual {{than those from}} the band's {{previous}} work. This reflects the group's revisiting some of the Dadaist characters and stage antics they dabbled with in the late 1970s as teenagers but abandoned for more literal themes in the 1980s. While the band had previously been opposed to materialism, they examined and flirted with this value on the album and the Zoo TV Tour. The title and lyrics of [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing" [...] are [...] "reflective of the times [...] were living in, when people were no longer looking for the truth, [...] were all looking for instant gratification". [...] "Trashy" [...] and [...] "throwaway" [...] were among the band's buzzwords during recording, leading to many tracks in this vein. The chorus of [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] features the pop lyrical cliché [...] "baby, baby, baby", juxtaposed against the dark lyrics in the verses. Bono wrote the lyrics to [...] "The Fly" [...] in character as the song's eponymous persona by composing a sequence of aphorisms.

500|$|In 1979, the {{committees}} began the redistribution {{of land in}} the Jefara plain, continuing through 1981. In May 1980, measures to redistribute and equalize wealth were implemented; anyone with over 1000 dinar in their bank account saw that extra money expropriated. The following year, the GPC announced that the government would take control of all import, export and distribution functions, with state supermarkets replacing privately owned businesses; this led to a decline in the availability of consumer goods {{and the development of a}} thriving black market. Gaddafi was also frustrated by the slow pace of social reform on women's issues, and in 1979 launched a Revolutionary Women's Formation to replace the more gradualist Libyan General Women's Federation. In 1978 he had established a Women's Military Academy in Tripoli, encouraging all women to enlist for training. The measure was hugely controversial, and voted down by the GPC in February 1983. Gaddafi remained adamant, and when it was again voted down by the GPC in March 1984, he refused to abide by the decision, declaring that [...] "he who opposes the training and emancipation of women is an agent of imperialism, whether he <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> or not." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou soon {{discovers that}} her fellow Black expatriates [...] "share similar delusions" [...] {{and that their}} {{feelings}} towards Ghana and its people are not reciprocated. [...] Lupton states, [...] "Angelou's alliance with the African-American community often focuses on their indignation over the Ghanaians' refusal to fully welcome them". [...] Angelou uses the parallel demonstration to King's 1963 March on Washington to demonstrate both her and her fellow expatriates' tenuous relationship with Africa and her desire for full citizenship and assimilation, an [...] "unattainable goal that falls outside of her desire for assimilation" [...] and something she can never acquire in Ghana. [...] Not only is Angelou a Black American, whether she <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> or not, [...] "she is a Black American in exile". [...] Houston A. Baker, Jr., in his review of Traveling Shoes, states that Angelou is unable to experience a connection with what Angelou calls the [...] "soul" [...] of Africa, and that Angelou speculates that only the American Black, forcibly displaced and taken from the home of her ancestors, can truly understand [...] "that home {{is the place where}} one is created".|$|E

500|$|Several days later, still humming Lurleen's song, Homer {{drives to}} her mobile home {{to ask for}} a copy.

At home, Marge asks Homer about Lurleen; he claims that she is just a waitress who is turning into a music superstar. Marge does not approve that he is seeing her, as she fears that something more will come of the relationship. Homer becomes Lurleen's manager, and to fit with the role, she buys him an expensive white cowboy suit which he wears at home. Marge is annoyed, and asks if he is having an affair. He denies it, and says whether Marge <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> or not, he is going to help Lurleen become a country music star. The whole family gathers at the recording studio with Lurleen to record more of her songs.

500|$|Acton's book {{is divided}} into {{chapters}} with brief, often single word titles such as [...] "Fish". In a marked departure from eighteenth century English cookery books like Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery, these are written as connected wholes. The chapter on fish begins with an essay on how to choose fish for freshness; there follows some {{advice on how to}} bake fish, and on the kinds of fat best used for frying fish. Suitable pans are illustrated. The recipes follow; these too are written as stories rather than simply as instructions. Where appropriate, recipes end with a list of ingredients, as well as the cooking time, in marked change from eighteenth century practice. Recipes are grouped, in the case of fish by species, and they form a connected story. Acton adds comments where she sees fit, indicating anything from when the food is in season to where a recipe came from, and how much she <b>likes</b> <b>it.</b> For example, she begins her account of the John Dory with a recipe which is more of an introductory essay than a set of instructions, though given the simplicity of the recipe, it says all that a cook would need to know on the matter: ...|$|E

In the end, the town decides not to spend any money on a new mural and simply renames the old one [...] "The Diversity Express". The parks department is nevertheless proud of their work, which they hang in their conference room; Ron also hangs Mark's sketch in his office.|$|E
