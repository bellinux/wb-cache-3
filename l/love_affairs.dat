40|$|Literature is the {{expression}} of art that uses a beautiful language. It deals with feeling, ideas, ambition, imagination, and some problems that happen in our life. Therefore, reading a novel means reading the life of society. It opens up our mind into deep image of human life. Because of this reason, the writer takes the novel {{as the object of}} the study. In this study, the problem is focused on dr. John Christow’s <b>love</b> <b>affair</b> as the main character in Agatha Chriestie’s novel “The Hollow”. The purpose of the study is to find out the answer of the problems: why dr. John Christow has <b>love</b> <b>affair</b> with Henrietta, what the effects of dr. John Christow’s <b>love</b> <b>affair</b> on himself are, what the effects of dr. John Christow’s <b>love</b> <b>affair</b> on his family are.

John Christow’s of <b>love</b> <b>affair</b> in Agatha Christie’s novel “The Hollow” were as follows. The first reason of dr. John Chriostow’s <b>love</b> <b>affair</b> was a need. He needed someone to share and discuss his problems together about everything, especially about the problems in his work. Sweet memory also became the reason of Christow’s <b>love</b> <b>affair.</b> The other reason of Christow’s <b>love</b> <b>affair</b> was that there was a gap in his relation that made him unable to enjoy his life with his wife. Furthermore, Christow’s <b>love</b> <b>affair</b> brought some effects on himself. First, he was easy to get angry. Second, his productivity decreased. The last, and the most important effect of his <b>love</b> <b>affair,</b> he was killed by his wife because of his <b>love</b> <b>affair.</b> In addition the effect of Christow’s <b>love</b> <b>affair</b> on his family was that his children became inattentive to him and his wife was depressed because she was very jealous.

Over the next few years he had numerous <b>love</b> <b>affairs,</b> and was prevented from a love marriage with one Esther Raizel because his own dubious reputation compounded the taint of his mother's divorce.

5|$|Kidnapping is also {{a common}} theme in such folklore.

The fear of this is so great among {{people who live in the}} Amazon river area that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water-bodies alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, although in fact, the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.|$|E

Sullivan was a frequent visitor at the Scott Russell home in the mid-1860s, and by 1865 the affair was in full bloom. Rachel's parents did not approve of a possible union with a young composer with uncertain financial prospects, but the two continued to see each other covertly. At some point in 1868, Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with Rachel's sister Louise (1841–1878). Both relationships had ceased by early 1869.|$|E
5|$|Heian {{culture and}} court life reached a peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having <b>love</b> <b>affairs,</b> writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Walton's {{relationship}} with the Sitwells became less close. He had <b>love</b> <b>affairs</b> and new friendships that drew him out of their orbit. His first long affair was with Imma von Doernberg, the young widow of a German baron. She and Walton met in the late 1920s and they were together until 1934, when she left him. His later affair with Alice, Viscountess Wimborne (born 1880), which lasted from 1934 until her death in April 1948, caused a wider breach between Walton and the Sitwells, as she disliked {{them as much as}} they disliked her. By the 1930s, Walton was earning enough from composing to allow him financial independence for the first time. A legacy from a musical benefactress in 1931 further enhanced his finances, and in 1934 he left the Sitwells' house and bought a house in Belgravia.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the public}} blamed Ernest for Sellis's death.

Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had {{played a part in}} the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke {{to the fact that he}} did not conduct <b>love</b> <b>affairs</b> in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} rolling waves and shots of palm tree-lined roads, and gulls. A posse of skateboarders are also pictured in this scene. At first, the clip appears to {{function}} in small, romantic gestures, reminiscent {{to that of a}} fashion magazine advertisement. The singer is pictured in two visually different <b>love</b> <b>affairs.</b> In the first, Del Rey is shown clinging to a younger, long-haired blond, leather-clad man on a beach, where she narcotically flits around the Pacific Ocean shorefront, and splashes in its waves with him. At the 1:20 mark, the song and its visuals simultaneously switch up, with the singer being pictured donning diamond jewelry, sitting alongside a more mature and svengali-type man who wears sunglasses, as a chauffeured convertible barrels forward in slow motion. Del Rey's love interest in this segment recalls age disparity in sexual relationships, producer Robert Evans, and Scott Weiland. In another scene, the two are depicted nuzzling and smoking {{in the back seat of}} the car. Del Rey depicts a woozy and solemn persona in these segments, while the pair caress each other under passing streetlights. The clip then returns to the scene of Del Rey and her younger love interest on the beach. The aforementioned segments are intercut with scenes that appear to be shot on a low-quality camcorder.|$|E
