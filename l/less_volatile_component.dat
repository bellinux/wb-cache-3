40|$|Organic {{compounds}} {{represent a}} significant fraction of submicrometer atmospheric aerosol mass. Even {{if most of}} these compounds are semi-volatile in atmospheric concentrations, the ambient organic aerosol volatility is quite uncertain. The most common volatility measurement method relies {{on the use of}} a thermodenuder (TD). The aerosol passes through a heated tube where its more <b>volatile</b> <b>components</b> evaporate, leaving the <b>less</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>components</b> behind in the particulate phase. The typical result of a thermodenuder measurement is the mass fraction remaining (MFR), which depends, among other factors, on the organic aerosol (OA) vaporization enthalpy and the accommodation coefficient. We use a new method combining forward modeling, introduction of "experimental" error, and inverse modeling with error minimization for the interpretation of TD measurements. The OA volatility distribution, its effective vaporization enthalpy, the mass accommodation coefficient and the corresponding uncertainty ranges are calculated. Our results indicate that existing TD-based approaches quite often cannot estimate reliably the OA volatility distribution, leading to large uncertainties, since there are many different combinations of the three properties that can lead to similar thermograms. We propose an improved experimental approach combining TD and isothermal dilution measurements.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to characterise {{particle}} emissions from pellets stoves and modern and old-type residential wood stoves. The mass concentration of particulate material in the hot flue gas was 19 e 82 mg/MJ, roughly the same for wood stoves and pellets stoves, but the old-type wood stoves tended to emit even higher quantities. Furthermore, during combustion of wood logs the considerably higher emission of organic gaseous carbon indicates an additional contribution to the emission from secondarily formed condensable organic particles. The particle mass emitted was dominated by fine particles (< 1 mm) in all cases. The fine particle maximum was displaced towards larger size during inefficient combustion, e. g. during the start-up phase.

40|$|A {{study of}} primary and {{secondary}} treated liquid petroleum wastes in a pilot sieve tray column has been undertaken. The literature related {{to this type of}} extractor and the relevant phenomena of droplet break-up and coalescence, drop size and drop mass transfer have been reviewed. The method of treatment in local refineries has been investigated and it is observed that the {{primary and secondary}} processes are quite efficient, but the tertiary process leaves some of the oil in he effluent and this is why the treated water is not recycled and reused. The treated waste/oil water is pumped into ponds for evaporation leaving the oil and other <b>less</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>components</b> as a residue which {{have a negative impact on}} the environment. The system of oil in water is not a normal solute-solvent system, and to make it so the mixture has been emulsified with a surfactant producing a partially water miscible emulsion. Experiments were carried out with nonmass transfer to determine the operating column hydrodynamics such as flooding. At 85 % of flooding, mass transfer experiments were performed and the effects of drop size, drop size distribution and dispersed phase holdup volume at variable agitation speeds on the column performance have been investigated. The concentration profile has been measured and the overall experimental mass transfer coefficients were calculated from the mean driving force using Simpson's rule. It is observed that drop size, drop size distribution and mass transfer coefficients were strongly dependent on the speed of agitation. As the oil droplets were composed of emulsified oil in water and the oil itself is completely immiscible in water, the direction of mass transfer was from the emulsified droplets to the dispersed phase. This condition coupled with high solubility of oil in n-hexane made the extraction process very efficient and an almost oil-free water could be obtained and recycled...|$|R
40|$|A {{recent study}} {{demonstrated}} that diesel particles in urban air undergo evaporative shrinkage when advected to a cleaner atmosphere (Harrison et al., 2016). We explore, in a structured and systematic way, {{the sensitivity of}} nucleation-mode diesel particles to changes in particle composition and saturation vapour pressure. We use a multi-component aerosol microphysics model based on surrogate molecule (C 16 -C 32 n-alkane) volatilities. For standard atmospheric conditions (298  K, 1013. 25  hPa), and over timescales (ca. 100  s) relevant for dispersion on the neighbourhood scale (up to 1  km), {{the choice of a}} particular vapour pressure dataset changes the range of compounds that are appreciably volatile by 2 – 6 carbon numbers. The nucleation-mode peak diameter, after 100  s of model runtime, is sensitive to the vapour pressure parameterisations for particles with compositions centred on surrogate molecules between C 22 H 46 and C 24 H 50. The vapour pressures of components in this range are therefore critical for the modelling of nucleation-mode aerosol dynamics on the neighbourhood scale and need to be better constrained. Laboratory studies have shown this carbon number fraction to derive predominantly from engine lubricating oil. The accuracy of vapour pressure data for other (more and <b>less</b> <b>volatile)</b> <b>components</b> from laboratory experiments, is less critical. The influence of a core of involatile material is also considered. The new findings of this study may also be used to identify the Semi-Volatile Organic Compound (SVOC) compositions that play dominating roles in the evaporative shrinkage of the nucleation mode observed in field measurements (e. g. Dall’Osto et al., 2011). As well as reconciling model and observations, identifying the most significant vapour pressure regime for nucleation-mode dynamics offers a way to improve the computing efficiency of urban aerosol models by adopting simplified schemes for those less important components: e. g., an equilibrium scheme for low-carbon-number components and a linear scheme for high-carbon-number components...|$|R

This paper gives an overview of the measurements done and presents parameters specifically useful for aerosol yield calculations. The ozonolysis reaction, selected oxidation products and subsequent aerosol formation were followed using several analytical techniques for both gas and condensed phase characterisation. The effective densities of the SOA were determined by comparing mass and volume size distributions to (1. 25 +/- 0. 10) g cm(- 3) for alpha-pinene and (1. 3 +/- 0. 2) g cm(- 3) for limonene. The detailed aerosol dynamics code COSIMA-SOA proved to be essential for a comprehensive evaluation of the experimental results and for providing parameterisations directly applicable within atmospheric models. The COSIMA-assisted analysis succeeded to reproduce the observed time evolutions of SOA total mass, number and size distributions by adjusting the following properties of two oxidation product proxies: individual yield parameters (alpha(i)), partitioning coefficients (K-i), vapour pressures (p(i)) and effective accommodation coefficients (gamma(i)). For these properties temperature dependences were derived and parameterised. Vapour pressures and partitioning coefficients followed classical Clausius-Clapeyron temperature dependences. From this relationship enthalpies of vaporisation were derived for the two more and <b>less</b> <b>volatile</b> product proxies of alpha-pinene: (59 +/- 8) kJ mol(- 1) and (24 +/- 9) kJ mol(- 1), and limonene: (55 +/- 14) kJ mol(- 1) and (25 +/- 12) kJ mol(- 1). The more <b>volatile</b> proxy <b>components</b> had a notably low enthalpy of vaporisation while the <b>less</b> <b>volatile</b> proxy <b>components</b> gave enthalpies of vaporisation comparable with those of typical products from alpha-pinene oxidation, e. g. pinonaldehyde and pinonic acid...|$|R
