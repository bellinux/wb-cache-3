[...] The focus on the new show was on children from disadvantaged backgrounds, but Cooney and the show's creators recognized that in order to achieve the kind of success they wanted, it had to be equally accessible to children of all socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. [...] At the same time, they wanted to make the show so appealing to inner-city children that it would help them <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> children with more educational opportunities.

Smethurst thought the decision to cast a Geordie was [...] "odd" [...] and wrote that it harked back to the days when the show would cast lots of Scottish and Irish actors, irritating the audience.

500|$|There {{were many}} {{different}} versions of the Catholic story, but all followed the same basic structure. All had Edgardo quickly and fervently embracing Christianity and trying to <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible about it. Most described a dramatic scene of Edgardo wondering at a painting of the Virgin Mary in sorrow, either in Rome or during the journey from Bologna. [...] Agostini, the policeman who had escorted him to Rome, reported that the boy had at first stubbornly refused to enter a church with him for mass, but displayed an apparently miraculous transformation when he did. A common theme was that Edgardo had become a kind of prodigy—according to an eyewitness account published in the Catholic L'armonia della religione colla civiltà, he had learned the catechism perfectly within a few days, [...] "blesse the servant who baptised him," [...] and declared that he wanted to convert all Jews to Christianity. The most influential pro-Church article on Mortara was an account published in the Jesuit periodical La Civiltà Cattolica in November 1858, and subsequently reprinted or quoted in Catholic papers across Europe. This story had the child begging the rector of the Catechumens not to send him back but to let him grow up in a Christian home, and initiated what became a central plank of the pro-Church narrative—that Edgardo had a new family, namely the Catholic Church itself. The article quoted Edgardo as saying: [...] "I am baptised; I am baptised and my father is the Pope." ...|$|E
500|$|Walt Disney {{strongly}} encouraged Costa to {{work closely}} with Davis while he animated Aurora so that she could <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible about her character and familiarize herself with [...] "all aspects of her." [...] Drawing Aurora to resemble her voice actress, Davis incorporated Costa's habit of gesturing with her hands while speaking and singing into the character's design, and defended the singer's performance when it was incorrectly referred to a voice-over by a fan, explaining that Costa's voice was [...] "the ocean of sound upon which we animated." [...] Davis and Costa eventually became close friends. Actress and dancer Helene Stanley served as the live-action model for Aurora, providing visual reference for the animators. The performer was recruited due to the high degree of realism required to animate Aurora. Stanley's costume was designed by costume designer Alice Estes at the behest of Davis, then a student of the animator at Chouinard Art Institute. To compliment the [...] "tapestry pattern" [...] of the film's backgrounds, Estes agreed to design the dress to [...] "move like [...] was animated." [...] Estes and Davis eventually got married. Meanwhile, British actress Audrey Hepburn served as Oreb's inspiration for Aurora's body type, from whom they borrowed the princess' [...] "elegant, slender features". The studio disagreed about whether Aurora's gown should be pink or blue, a conflict that was written into the film {{in the form of an}} argument between Flora and Merryweather. Aurora has a total of only 18 minutes of screen time.|$|E

But while Torah-faithful Jews reject the blind worship of science, we do not regard science as an enemy."

2500|$|Wu Zetian {{was born}} into a rich family. She had {{servants}} at her disposal to perform routine tasks for her, so there were not many domestic jobs that Wu would ever have to learn. Because of this, Wu was encouraged by her father to read books and pursue her education. He made sure that his daughter was well-educated, a trait that was not common among women, much less encouraged by their fathers. Wu {{did not seem to be}} the type of child who would want to sit quietly and do needlework or sip tea all day. So Wu read and learned about many different topics such as politics and other governmental affairs, writing, literature, and music. Wu grew and continued to <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> she could, with her father backing her every step of the way. At age fourteen, she was taken to be an imperial concubine (lesser wife) of Emperor Taizong of Tang. It was there that she became a type of secretary. This opportunity allowed her to continue to pursue her education. She was given the title of cairen, title for one of the consorts with the fifth rank in Tang's nine-rank system for imperial officials, nobles, and consorts. When she was summoned to the palace, her mother, the Lady Yang, wept bitterly when saying farewell to her, but she responded, [...] "How do you know that it is not my fortune to meet the Son of Heaven?" [...] Lady Yang reportedly then understood her ambitions, and therefore stopped crying.|$|E

2500|$|As he {{appeared}} to be an ardent Nazi, Sorge was welcome at the German Embassy. One Japanese journalist who knew Sorge described him [...] in 1935 as [...] "a typical, swashbuckling, arrogant Nazi...quick-tempered, hard-drinking". As the Japan correspondent for the Frankfurter Zeitung, Sorge developed a network of sources about Japanese politics, and soon German diplomats, including the ambassador Herbert von Dirksen came to depend upon Sorge as a source of intelligence about the fractious and secretive world of Japanese politics. The Japanese values of honne and tatame (the former literally means [...] "true sound", roughly [...] "as things are" [...] while the latter literally means [...] "façade" [...] or roughly [...] "as things appear"), namely the tendency of Japanese people to hide their real feelings and profess to believe in things that they do not, made deciphering Japan's politics especially difficult. That Sorge was fluent in Japanese further enhanced his status as a Japanologist. Sorge was very interested in Asian history and culture, especially those of China and Japan, and when sober tried to <b>learn</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he could. During this time, Sorge befriended General Eugen Ott, the German military attache to Japan while seducing his wife Helma. As military attache, Ott sent reports back to Berlin containing his assessments of the Imperial Japanese Army, which Frau Ott copied and passed on to Sorge, who in his turn passed them on to Moscow (through it should be noted Frau Ott believed Sorge was merely working for the Nazi Party). As the Japanese Army had been trained by a German military mission in the 19th century, German influence on the Japanese Army was strong, and Ott had good contacts with Japanese officers.|$|E
