Postulating that women may develop an empathy-based ethic with a different, but not <b>lower</b> <b>structure</b> than that Kohlberg had described, Gilligan wrote In a Different Voice, a book that founded a new movement of care-based ethics that initially found strong resonance among feminists and later achieved wider recognition.|$|E
5000|$|Low {{electrical}} resistance: Improving device conductivity {{increases the}} rectified power output. But {{there are other}} impacts of resistance on device performance. Ideal impedance matching between the antenna and diode enhances rectified power. <b>Lowering</b> <b>structure</b> resistances also increases the diode cutoff frequency, which in turn enhances the effective bandwidth of rectified frequencies of light. The current attempt to use calcium in the top layer results in high resistance due to the calcium oxidizing rapidly.|$|R
40|$|Decentralization is the {{allocation}} of power between central and <b>lower</b> levels <b>structures</b> of the government. The dimensions {{and the extent to}} which powers are transferred from one level to another vary across countries depending on the goal a country wishes to achieve. But one of the common aspects included in the transfer of powers to the <b>lower</b> level <b>structures</b> is financial decentralization. The reason is clear. It makes no sense to transfer power to the <b>lower</b> level <b>structures</b> without finance to execute own decisions. Transfer of financial powers to <b>lower</b> level <b>structures</b> and creating an alignment that support efficient and effective operation of each structure, has often been one of the major challenges in the implementation of decentralization model of government. Tanzania has been one of the victims in this situation. In view of various government reports, since independent in 1961, the several attempt tried by the government to transfer powers to the <b>lower</b> level <b>structures</b> led to either little or no success. The adoption of Decentralization by Devolution (D by D) in 2000 could be considered as the government attempt to correct the existed bottlenecks that led to the failure in the previous initiatives to decentralise. This paper attempts to answer the question: ‘is financial decentralisation realised under the DbyD, and what are the factors that contribute or hamper the financial decentralisation? The paper is based on the research findings presented in Mbogela (2009). The report consisted of descriptive presentation o...|$|R

50|$|Later archeological {{excavations}} indicate {{there was}} once a surface shrine that marked the entrance to the Hypogeum, with its subsequent destruction likely shielding the <b>lower</b> <b>structure</b> from discovery for thousands of years. The underground structure may have originated from a natural cave, expanded over time by cutting directly into the rock with crude tools including antlers, flint, chert and obsidian. Burial chambers in the upper level of the Hypogeum date from the early phases of the Maltese Temple Period, with lower chambers dating from later. The site may have first been used as early as 4000 BC, and was likely used until around 2500 BC, based on pottery sample analysis and examination of human remains.|$|E

30|$|Such a view, if {{found to}} be true, would be a benefit to the theory, as supervenience {{as a means of}} linking higher and <b>lower</b> <b>structures</b> has {{received}} wide-spread discussion since its introduction in philosophical ethics (Hare 1952). Since then, the application of the notion in the philosophy of mind has led to formal accounts of the relationship being proposed (c.f. McLaughlin and Bennett 2014 for a recent review). However, an examination of the properties of supervenience will show that it does not map well onto accounts of stratification.|$|R
50|$|From 1925 to 1929, {{the gate}} was {{reassembled}} in the recently expanded museum from over 750 tons of fragments. However, the fragments did not constitute {{the entirety of}} the gate, and fill material had {{to be used in the}} reconstruction. Reconstruction began by assembling the middle-floor entablature and placing the second story columns on top, followed by reconstructing the pediments. A base and ground floor were then inserted below. Brick and cement reinforced with steel supplemented the few remains of the <b>lower</b> <b>structure.</b> Original column fragments were bored out, leaving a thickness of 3 to 4 cm, and filled with steel and mortar. In the 1920s and 1930s, the museum was criticized for portraying its monuments as originals when they consisted significantly of non-original material.|$|E
5000|$|Georgian medieval {{churches have}} a {{distinct}} character, though related to Armenian and Byzantine architecture, typically combining a conical dome raised {{high on a}} drum over a rectangular or cross-shaped <b>lower</b> <b>structure.</b> Often known as the [...] "Georgian cross-dome style," [...] this style of architecture developed in Georgia during the 9th century. Before that, most Georgian churches were basilicas. One distinguishing feature of Georgian ecclesiastical architecture, one which {{can be traced back}} to a high emphasis on individualism in Georgian culture, is reflected in the allocation of space inside the churches. Other examples of Georgian ecclesiastic architecture can be found overseas, in Bulgaria (Bachkovo Monastery built in 1083 by Georgian military commander Grigorii Bakuriani), in Greece (Iviron monastery built by Georgians in the 10th century) and in Jerusalem (Monastery of the Cross built by Georgians in the 9th century).|$|E
50|$|The {{active zone}} or {{synaptic}} active zone {{is a term}} first used by Couteaux and Pecot-Dechavassinein in 1970 to define the site of neurotransmitter release. Two neurons make near contact through structures called synapses allowing them {{to communicate with each}} other. As shown in the diagram on the right, a synapse consists of the presynaptic bouton of one neuron which stores vesicles containing neurotransmitter (uppermost in the picture), and a second, postsynaptic neuron which bears receptors for the neurotransmitter (at the bottom), together with a gap between the two called the synaptic cleft (with synaptic adhesion molecules, SAMs, holding the two together). When an action potential reaches the presynaptic bouton, the contents of the vesicles are released into the synaptic cleft and the released neurotransmitter travels across the cleft to the postsynaptic neuron (the <b>lower</b> <b>structure</b> in the picture) and activates the receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.|$|E
