6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} {{anything}} like it," [...] said our guest propitiatingly. [...] "And now, gentlemen, if you'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Linghurst, I promise you you won't hear another word from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes. It was iniquitous. They {{corrupted}} him thoroughly, {{the poor}} old boy. Oh! why wouldn't he <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him? But now I shall {{know how to}} grapple with this." ...|$|E
6000|$|JOY. [Breathlessly.] Oh, Mother, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{home with}} you now at once---- MRS. GWYN. [Her face hardening.] Why? What on earth---- ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{interrupted}} him. [...] "I wish {{to speak}} to you, Mr. Mavering, and tell you that--I'm very tired, and I'm {{going back to the}} hotel. I must ask you to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're right," [...] he said, [...] "and I'm wrong, as usual. I'm {{wasting time}} and {{distressing}} you to no purpose. What folly {{to ask you}} to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back!</b> Suppose you had said yes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now I {{have told}} you,' said the boy, 'will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my old man? If {{he has not}} stayed with that woman from Kulu, I am afraid he will die.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, any way,' said Mary, 'either he will {{be given}} back, or {{he will be}} saved this. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him, please.' Then at the door, putting {{her hand to her}} head--'Who is here?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet you {{understand}} nothing. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> what passed {{a few weeks}} ago, and I will make it all clear to you. Believe me that what I say is the absolute and exact truth.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I didn't {{think of}} that;' {{and she stood}} up, and unfastened her hooks. 'Perhaps Dr. May would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> now!' as a {{mountain}} of mohair and scarlet petticoat remained on the floor, upborne by an over-grown steel mouse-trap.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would like}} to know, Allan," [...] he said, [...] "that I shall not bring an aching heart with me to your wedding day? If you will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{for a moment to}} the past, I think I can satisfy you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Creech, I'm {{afraid he}} won't. You'd better give <b>me</b> up. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> I'll never tell. I don't blame you. I think you're square. My dad is.... But, oh, don't make ME suffer! You used to--to care for me, when I was little." ...|$|R
60|$|If I {{have not}} made this plain enough to any of you, my friends, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the simple, {{practical}} explanation of it which God Himself has given us in those two words--father and child.|$|E
6000|$|And Pau Amma said, 'I am ashamed! Give me back my hard {{shell and}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Pusat Tasek, and I will only stir out {{once a day}} and once a night to get my food.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} only prevail on him to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Limmeridge {{for a little while}} and stay there quietly with you, Marian, I could be almost as happy again as I was before I was married!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid, Bwana," [...] {{said the}} girl. [...] "In thy douar they will beat me as did The Sheik, my father. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> into the jungle. There Korak will find me. He would not think {{to look for}} me in the douar of a white man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{have taken}} the King's shilling, but perhaps if you came for <b>me</b> they would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with you. I was a fool when I did it. I don't {{want to be in}} the army. My dear mother, I am nothing but a trouble to you. But if you get me out of this, I promise I will have more sense and consideration. [...] .'" ...|$|R
6000|$|When Ashford {{presented}} {{himself at the}} door, the young lady was upon her hands and knees, searching {{the bottom of the}} coach. [...] "Oh, dear! I've lost something. I must have dropped it on the road," [...] she said breathlessly, with pink cheeks. [...] "You must positively wait and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and find it. I won't be long. You know there's 'no hurry.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh,' {{said the}} Priest, 'if {{you are an}} angel from heaven do let me out and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> earth again, for no place was ever so bad as this--the little fiends nip me so with their tongs.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my recital of {{what passed}} between us three. A strange {{lethargic}} calm {{seemed to have}} fallen upon Paul. He turned to me without even a single trace of the passion which had lit up his face a few moments before.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Dr. May {{has been}} so kind and so patient with me, I shall never forget it. Even when I scalded his fingers with {{bringing}} him that boiling water--but I always do wrong when he is there--and now he won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Leonard.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The nearer Wetherford came to {{the actual}} meeting with his wife the more he shook. At last he stopped in the road. [...] "I don't believe I can do it," [...] he declared. [...] "I'll be like a ghost to her. What's the use of it? She'll only be worried by my story. I reckon I'd better keep dark to everybody. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> I'm plum scared cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} is, {{and that there}} would be temptation; but {{there is a great deal}} to help one to keep right. And, oh! to have one's work in real good to Christ's poor, or in missions, instead of in all these outside silly {{nonsensical}} diversions that one doubts about all the time. If you would only <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with dear Sister Beata and Sister Elfleda as a probationer!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No! not a moment. Is {{there any}} hope in {{appealing}} to the lawyer whom Mr. Linley has employed? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with you to London. I will persuade him to exert his influence--I will go {{down on my knees}} to him--I will never leave him till I have won him over to my side--I will take Kitty with me; he shall see us both, and pity us, and help us!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never," [...] he answered, passionately {{clasping}} at her hand. [...] "Call {{yourself by}} what name you will, I love you. If {{you are in}} trouble, let me help. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house with you, and we will face it together, whatever it may be. Come!" ...|$|E
60|$|And he sobbed {{again and}} said: 'Mother, my {{suffering}} {{is greater than}} I can bear. Give me thy forgiveness, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the forest.' And the beggar-woman {{put her hand on}} his head, and said to him, 'Rise,' and the leper put his hand on his head, and said to him, 'Rise,' also.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, O gentle King, is the {{pleasure}} of God accomplished according to His command that you should come to Rheims and receive the crown that belongeth of right to you, and unto none other. My work which was given me to do is finished; give me your peace, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my mother, who is poor and old, and has need of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wrote some verses {{which one}} of the girls copied. Miss Hill found them and raised the roof. She kept us all in after school. She let some of the girls off. But she {{expelled}} Rose and sent me home. Then she called on mama. I don't know what she said, but mama didn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> I've had a hateful old tutor for a month. In the fall I'm going to private school." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Thomas, I am {{very much}} obliged {{to you for}} your kindness," [...] said Hamel, getting up suddenly. [...] "As {{it is a long}} way over to Drumcaller I think I will make a start. I know my way down the Glen and should be sure to miss it by any other route. Perhaps you'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> as I came." [...] Sir Thomas offered him the loan of a horse, but this was refused, and Hamel started on his return journey across the lake.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no! no! please!" [...] said Mrs. Bunker, {{springing}} {{up with an}} imploring feminine gesture; [...] "I am expecting my husband. He may be coming back at any moment; I must be there to see him FIRST! Please <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> sir, with your men; put me anywhere ashore between them and those men that are coming. Lock me up; keep me a prisoner in my own home; do anything else if you think I am deceiving you; but don't keep me here to miss him when he comes!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And when papa is here, what help {{will there}} be then? He will not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the islands,--with my boy. For myself I might die, or {{get out of his}} way anywhere. I can see that. Priscilla Stanbury is right when she says that no woman should trust herself to any man. Disgraced! That I should live to be told by my husband that I had disgraced him,--by a lover!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm not! Let us not deceive {{ourselves}} any longer. The {{change of}} climate {{has not done}} me good. We waited too long. It has all been a mistake. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Chester--I'm afraid to die out here. I can't {{bear the thought of}} being buried in this soil. It's so bleak and lonely and alien. I {{want to go back to}} the sweet, kindly hills--perhaps I can reconcile myself to death there--to sink into the earth on this plain is too dreadful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' {{says the}} king to the elder {{of the two}} princes, 'go up to the smith's forge, take my best coaches, and bring home the bridegroom.' He did not like doing this, he was so proud, {{but he could not}} refuse. When he came to the forge he saw the prince {{standing}} at the door, and beckoned him over to the coach. 'Are you the fellow,' says he, 'that made these crowns?' 'Yes,' says the other. 'Then,' says he, 'maybe you'd give yourself a brushing, and get into that coach; the king wants to see you. I pity the princess.' The young prince got into the carriage, and while they were on the way he opened the snuff-box, and out walked Seven Inches, and stood on his thigh. 'Well,' says he, 'what trouble is on you now?' 'Master,' says the other, 'please <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my forge, and let this carriage be filled with paving stones.' No sooner said than done. The prince was sitting in his forge, and the horses wondered what was after happening to the carriage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{can read}} and write," [...] Roger said; [...] "but I cannot say that I love these things. I doubt me that I am not fitter for the plow {{than for a}} trade. But my Aunt Marjory was forever going on about my coming to London, and {{entering}} the shop of Master Nicholas Fleming, and as it seemed {{an easy thing to}} sell yards of silks and velvets, I did not stand against her wishes, especially as she promised that if in a year's time I did not like the life, she would ask Master Nicholas to cancel my indentures, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> again to the farm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well! I {{came because}} I {{wanted to be}} useful, and if you won't <b>let</b> <b>me,</b> I'll <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> Then Jake {{and one of the}} boys would have to <b>go</b> down with <b>me</b> to the railroad. That would be awkward, wouldn't it?" ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} your conference “Creativity and Innovation in Education: Fiji’s Future” for 2012 is {{critically}} important and one that reflects new thinking that needs to go into making future education policies in Fiji. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> briefly <b>go</b> <b>back</b> into history before I delve into the issue of creativity and innovation in education {{and what that means}} for the future of Fiji...|$|R
