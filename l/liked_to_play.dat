Richardson reported that he enjoyed working with Jude and Jessica Croft-Lane, the young actors who played Lucas and Leah. He reported that Jude was camera shy and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with camera equipment during filming and that he told Croft-Lane that his name was actually Ste. Richardson concluded the storyline was different and he felt it gave him a chance to showcase his acting abilities.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{was born}} in Bagan Serai, Perak, to a Malaysian Chinese family.

Attracting the attention of a local coach, the coach asked Lee's father if he could take him as a student. After receiving his father's consent, the coach began to train Lee after school. Discovered by Misbun Sidek, he was drafted into the national squad when he was seventeen years old.|$|E

She and her ladies often took lunch on the grass outside and sketched, while Albert and the men went deer stalking. Rain and midges could, however, force them indoors. The gillies often were able to catch large numbers of trout from the loch which made for fine meals, and dances were held with servants and gillies joining in. There was a piano that Victoria <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> particularly playing duets with her youngest daughter Beatrice.|$|E
25|$|The film {{cemented}} {{a strong}} {{personal and professional}} connection between Bogart and Huston. Bogart admired and somewhat envied Huston for his skill as a writer. Though a poor student, Bogart was a lifelong reader. He could quote Plato, Pope, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and over a thousand lines of Shakespeare. He subscribed to the Harvard Law Review. He admired writers, {{and some of his}} best friends were screenwriters, including Louis Bromfield, Nathaniel Benchley, and Nunnally Johnson. Bogart enjoyed intense, provocative conversation and stiff drinks, as did Huston. Both were rebellious and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> childish pranks. Huston was reported to be easily bored during production, and admired Bogart (also bored easily off camera) not just for his acting talent but for his intense concentration on the set.|$|E
25|$|In {{desperate need}} of money, Anger wrote a book titled Hollywood Babylon in which he {{collected}} together gossip regarding celebrities, some of which he claims he had been told. This included claiming (with no corroboration or citing of sources) that Rudolph Valentino <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a sexually submissive role to dominant women, that Walt Disney was a drug user, addicted to opiates (reflected {{in the character of}} Goofy, who's perpetually stoned on cannabis), as well as describing the nature of the deaths of Peg Entwistle and Lupe Vélez. The work was not published in the United States initially, and it was first released by the French publisher Jean Jacques Pauvert. A pirated (and incomplete) version was first published in the U.S. in 1965, with the official American version not being published until 1974. Now with some financial backing from the publication of Hollywood Babylon, his next film project was The Story of O; essentially a piece of erotica featuring a heterosexual couple engaged in sadomasochistic sexual activities, although it refrained from showing any explicit sexual images.|$|E

25|$|In January 1969, McLain was {{selected}} as the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year. He created more disruption when he was named as the starting pitcher for the American League in the 1969 All-Star Game in Washington, DC, but missed the start of the game because of a dental appointment in Detroit. The appointment was scheduled for Wednesday the 23rd, the day after the All-Star game, but because of a rainout on the scheduled date, the game was played on the 23rd. McLain was a nonconformist and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> by his own rules. He had learned to fly and purchased an airplane. Having kept his dental appointment, he then flew himself to Washington, arriving at the game during the second inning. He pitched in the fourth inning, but by then the National League had already built a 9-2 lead. McLain created more dissension when he clashed with Tigers' manager Mayo Smith over the latter's role in the firing of Johnny Sain as the team's pitching coach. Despite the troubles, McLain had another productive season in 1969, winning 24 games and a second consecutive Cy Young Award, tying with Baltimore's Mike Cuellar, marking the first time two players had shared the award. It was the last award of his major league career.|$|E
25|$|The MCC chose {{a number}} of all-rounders for their team, but none of real quality. The balding and bespectacled Paul Gibb had a sensational tour of South Africa before in 1938–39, when he hit 473 runs (59.12) and two centuries, but in Australia {{was found to have}} a {{weakness}} against leg-spin and failed. He was chosen for the First Test ahead of Godfrey Evans because of his batting ability, but Evans proved to be a decent batsman, a perky, attacking player who tried to take a run off every ball, but in the Fourth Test he went for a record 95 minutes before scoring while Compton made a century at the other end. At 28 Jack Ikin was one of the younger English players on the tour and apart from five first class matches in 1938 and 1939 he was a post-war player. Not noted for his footwork or strokeplay he was a gritty left-hander who was picked even though he only made one century for Lancashire in 1946. He was popular in Australia as he was a Tobruk Rat who had fought alongside the Australian 9th Division in North Africa. Norman Yardley was a sensible player who <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> his strokes on the leg-side and though he never made a Test century was a good man in a crisis. James Langridge, Peter Smith and Bill Voce were bowlers who regularly made runs and even centuries for their counties, but Doug Wright's only hundred had become before the war and afterwards was relegated {{to the bottom of the}} batting order. Alec Bedser was a tailender who was capable of hitting a few runs on occasion and Dick Pollard's lack of batting ability was cited as one of the reasons why he was not picked for a Test in the series.|$|E

500|$|In Rolling With the Stones, Bill Wyman said: [...] "On 3 August {{we worked}} on 'Good Time Woman' and when I arrived the {{following}} day I found Mick Taylor playing bass. I hung around until 3am then left." [...] In the liner notes to , Richards stated, [...] "I remember writing the riff upstairs in the very elegant front room, and we took it downstairs the same evening and we cut it." [...] Jagger said of the lyrics, [...] "It's weird where your lyric things come from. On Tumbling Dice, I {{sat down with the}} house keeper and talked to her about gambling.

500|$|The cover {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from contemporary critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the cover [...] "a useless remake, {{which seems to}} exist solely for its video". Spence D. of IGN said that the lyrics fit perfectly with Spears's relationship with the media at the time. He also added, [...] "As for her interpretation, it's an interesting chameleonic diversion that comes off like a mash-up between vintage Prince-styled production, Cameo swagger, and Madonna sultriness, but never seems to capture the gloss and glory {{of any of the}} aforementioned influences". Christy Lemire of msnbc.com called it [...] "utterly unnecessary". Louis Pattison of the New Musical Express commented that [...] "judging by the fuck-you sentiments" [...] of the cover, Spears <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the role of [...] " [...] pop brat careering off the rails". Sarah Hepola of Salon.com wrote in an article about contemporary teen idols that the cover [...] "became an anthem for teen-idol rebellion". American director Quentin Tarantino included the song in a playlist that inspired him during production of his 2009 film Inglourious Basterds.|$|E
500|$|The war {{correspondent}} Pyotr Molchanov, who had frequently met Shanina at the front, {{described her}} as a person of unusual will with a genuine, bright nature.

She typified her own character as {{like that of the}} Romantic poet, painter and writer Mikhail Lermontov, deciding, like him, to act as she saw fit. Shanina dressed modestly and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> volleyball.

Shanina had a straightforward character and valued courage and the absence of egotism in people. She once told a story when [...] "about half a hundred frenzied fascists with wild cries" [...] attacked a trench accommodating twelve female snipers, including Shanina: [...] "Some fell from our well-aimed bullets, some we finished with our bayonets, grenades, shovels, and some we took prisoners, having restrained their arms." ...|$|E

500|$|Brown was {{regarded}} as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He had an upright stance and was known for his trademark leg glancing and placement of the ball. He hooked occasionally and scored the majority of his off-side runs with the cut shot. Johnnie Moyes said that [...] "even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults". Moyes felt that Brown's superior record on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. At Australian grounds, impatient spectators who disliked Brown's cautious batting frequently heckled him, blaming Brown for delaying Bradman's arrival to the crease. [...] Moyes felt that the more serene English gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hastening to placate impatient spectators. [...] "A placid chap was Brown, and he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic." [...] Moyes said that Brown was [...] "always cool and thoughtful, he preferred finesse to force". The English journalist Neville Cardus commented [...] "His cricket is perpetually keeping an appointment leisurely with moments to spare. Does the bat have an engagement this over with a half-volley? Very well, then, put it down in the book. We'll be there for it. Plenty of time." [...] Bradman also noted Brown's ability to quickly get into position to play the ball, writing [...] "One hallmark of good batting is that the player appears to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Bill Brown was an outstanding case of one who never seemed to be in a hurry for any stroke." [...] Ray Robinson said that Brown was [...] "the most serene batsman I ever saw play for Australia". Robinson said that [...] "for artistry, Brown's leg-glancing could be mentioned in the same breath as Archie Jackson's". Brown's placid nature extended to his observations of modern cricket—he disliked the emotional displays made by contemporary players.|$|E
500|$|Sunshine offered open fields, and {{the three}} Miller boys quickly took a liking to sport during their childhood, playing Australian rules {{football}} in winter and cricket in summer. Their father had played cricket for Warracknabeal, winning a premiership in the local league in 1900. Les taught the boys {{to play with a}} side-on stance and underlined the importance of orthodox batting technique, reminding his sons to maintain a high leading elbow when hitting the ball. They were taught to rely on a solid defence, concentration, and self-control in the mould of the leading Victorian and Australian Test batsman of the era, Bill Ponsford. Miller began his schooling in Sunshine, where he quickly became known for his diminutive height; {{he was one of the}} smallest children in the school. At the age of seven, Miller moved to the inner-eastern middle-class Melbourne suburb of Elsternwick, where his parents had purchased a two-storey house with a spacious garden that allowed the children to play sport. By this time, his elder brothers had given him the derisive nickname Weedy. Miller's small size and age deficit meant that he conceded a strength advantage to his brothers in backyard cricket matches. This forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, which held him in good stead for his future career. Whenever Miller managed to dismiss his brothers and earn himself some batting time, he typically played with a straight bat in a watchful manner, as it was difficult for him to remove his brothers, meaning that his opportunities with the bat were rare. Miller and his friends would loiter outside Ponsford's home, just [...] away, in the hope of catching a glimpse of their hero.Perry, p. 13. Like Miller in his backyard, Ponsford was known for his powers of concentration and was the first person to score two quadruple centuries in first-class cricket.Perry, p. 14. Miller often practised for hours by himself; he put a tennis ball inside a stocking, before suspending it from a clothes line and hitting it back and forth. Indoors, Miller developed a lifelong love of classical music through a cousin who <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Mozart. He played flute in the Elsternwick school band but could not read music.|$|E
