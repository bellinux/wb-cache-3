If we have just two variables {{and they have the}} same sample variance and are positively correlated, then the PCA will entail a rotation by 45° and the [...] "loadings" [...] for the two variables with respect to the principal component will be equal. But if we multiply all values of the first variable by 100, then the first principal component will be almost the same as that variable, with a small contribution from the other variable, whereas the second component will be almost aligned with the second original variable. This means that whenever the different variables have different units (like temperature and mass), PCA is a somewhat arbitrary method of analysis. (Different results would be obtained if one used Fahrenheit rather than Celsius for example.) Note that Pearson's original paper was entitled [...] "On <b>Lines</b> and Planes <b>of</b> <b>Closest</b> <b>Fit</b> to Systems <b>of</b> Points in Space" [...] - [...] "in space" [...] implies physical Euclidean space where such concerns do not arise. One way of making the PCA less arbitrary is to use variables scaled so as to have unit variance, by standardizing the data and hence use the autocorrelation matrix instead of the autocovariance matrix as a basis for PCA. However, this compresses (or expands) the fluctuations in all dimensions of the signal space to unit variance.|$|R

In this article, we utilize the latest results on the general distribution of likelihood ratio statistic in this methodology and propose several distribution free {{root mean square error}} of approximation (RMSEA) tests for evaluating the hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>close</b> <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> misspecified models. Simulation studies show that three of these tests have robust and desirable performance in spite of severe nonnormality across the examples when sample size is as large as 300.

30|$|For CFA in {{the current}} study {{multiple}} fit indices were used to assess model fit, i.e. χ 2, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Root Mean Square of Approximation (RMSEA) and p <b>of</b> <b>Close</b> <b>Fit</b> (PClose), and their standard cutoff recommendations were employed (Hu and Bentler 1999). In general, a non-significant χ 2 (p >  0.05) suggests good model fit, as it indicates that the model does not differ significantly from the observed data. The value greater than 0.95 for a CFI and a RMSEA value of 0.05 or less suggest good fit. PClose greater than 0.05 is recommended, as a PClose value less than 0.05 suggests that RMSEA is significantly greater than its suggested cutoff of 0.05.|$|R

40|$|In many physical, statistical, {{biological}} and other investigations {{it is desirable}} to approximate a system of points by objects of lower dimension and/or complexity. For this purpose, Karl Pearson invented principal component analysis in 1901 and found 'lines and planes <b>of</b> <b>closest</b> <b>fit</b> to system <b>of</b> points'. The famous k-means algorithm solves the approximation problem too, but by finite sets instead <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> and planes. This chapter gives a brief practical introduction into the methods of construction of general principal objects, i. e. objects embedded in the 'middle' of the multidimensional data set. As a basis, the unifying framework of mean squared distance approximation of finite datasets is selected. Principal graphs and manifolds are constructed as generalisations of principal components and k-means principal points. For this purpose, the family of expectation/maximisation algorithms with nearest generalisations is presented. Construction of principal graphs with controlled complexity {{is based on the}} graph grammar approach. Comment: 36 pages, 6 figures, minor correction...|$|R

40|$|To {{obtain a}} better {{understanding}} of the associations among Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), adult attachment patterns, impulsivity, and aggressiveness, we tested four competing models of these relationships: a) BPD is associated with the personality traits of impulsivity and aggressiveness, but adult attachment patterns predict neither BPD nor impulsive/aggressive features; b) adult attachment patterns are significant predictors of BPD but not of impulsive/aggressive traits, although these traits correlate with BPD; c) adult attachment patterns are significant predictors of impulsive and aggressive traits, which in turn predict BPD; and d) adult attachment patterns significantly predict both BPD and impulsive/aggressive traits. We assessed 466 consecutively admitted outpatients using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (V. 2. 0), the Attachment Style Questionnaire, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale- 11, and the Aggression Questionnaire. Maximum likelihood structural equation modeling of the covariance matrix showed that model (c) was the best fitting model (chi(2) (21) = 31. 67, p >. 05, RMSEA =. 023, test <b>of</b> <b>close</b> <b>fit</b> p >. 85).
