5|$|The {{building}} of the railways in the early 1840s introduced new employment opportunities for people {{in places such as}} Stockport and Manchester, as well as an influx of people coming to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area.</b> In the mid-19th century, one of the earliest shops was opened in the Smithy Green area, selling groceries, sweets and other provisions. As people settled in the area, more shops were opened and new houses were built, many of which still stand. During the early 20th century Cheadle Hulme experienced a rapid growth in population, mostly due to an influx of people from Manchester and other large towns and cities coming to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> and it gradually became more suburban. In the 1930s more houses were built around the Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, Gill Bent Road, Hulme Hall Road and Cheadle Road areas, and new roads replaced old farms. In the 1960s the Hursthead estate was built on land that was once Hursthead Farm. By 2009 the only farm remaining was Leather's Farm on Ladybridge Road.|$|E

5|$|The volcano and the {{surrounding}} Goat Rocks Wilderness, established in 1964, are named after the numerous mountain goats which <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area.</b> The variable climate of the wilderness area supports a host of wildlife, including marmots, pikas, deer, and elk. Various peaks within the wilderness can be climbed or scrambled, and other activities such as hiking are permitted. The area is rife with minerals and resources, including coal, cobalt, copper, and base metals.|$|E
5|$|Carletonomys {{was found}} in {{association}} with remains of several other animals, including fishes, chelid turtles, frogs, birds, armadillos, and several rodents, including Reithrodon auritus, the coypu (Myocastor), both of which still <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> the extinct echimyid Dicolpomys, and unidentified caviids and octodontids. C.cailoi probably lived in a wetland habitat under relatively warm and moist climatic conditions. Although the limited material known permits few inferences as to the animal's natural history, it likely fed on hard plant material, as do related, morphologically similar extant species.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the history}} of Canada, {{heraldry}} in the country has incorporated aboriginal and First Nations symbols and elements. The Coat of Arms of Nunavut, for example, includes elements such as an inukshuk, a qulliq, and an igloo, all of which are references to the Inuit peoples who <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> while the arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority include ravens, a First Nations symbol of creation and transformation. In addition, some Canadians choose to bear their arms on a roundel rather than a shield, a reference to a drumhead; an example is the coat of arms of Nunavut.|$|E

5|$|The Great Basin, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Plateau {{converge}} at Zion and the Kolob canyons.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 13th century, the Omiš {{branch of}} the Kačić family was {{involved}} in the politics of more powerful authorities. Their local hereditary oligarchy disappeared, but the Kačićs probably continued to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area.</b> The war with Venice at {{the end of the}} 1270s and the beginning of the 1280s led to their loss of Omiš in favor of princes from the Šubić noble family. The Omiš Kačićs are mentioned for the last time in 1294, when the Venetians wrote to Dubrovnik residents seeking compensation from Dubrovnik authorities who had failed to send an armed ship against Omiš pirates. It is not known whether Ivan, son of Matej Kačić, mentioned in Dubrovnik 1285, was related to the Omišani Kačićs. After that, Kačićs are no longer mentioned.|$|E
5|$|Human {{habitation}} on the Santa Ana River {{dates back}} 9,000 to 12,000 years ago, {{close to the}} early stages of the Holocene period. The first Native Americans to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> were nomadic tribes that traveled from place to place, grazing animals on fertile grasslands and gathering fruits and seeds for food. The ancestors of these early people originated from the Shoshone and Uto-Aztecan people of the northwestern United States. Eventually, the human population of the watershed reached a peak of about 15,000. About 8,000 years ago, the climate experienced a change becoming more arid and the originally nomadic tribes began to stay in individual places longer, becoming semi-nomadic. However, they did not establish agriculture, nor did they raise animals or live in villages. Like many Native American tribes in California, acorns were a staple food of many of the inland valley people. People closer to the ocean often fished and hunted small animals, often from tide pools and coastal stream areas, for food.|$|E

Black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, cougars, and black bears are the most common of the 63 species of mammals found in the watershed. Fishers and American martens have also been spotted. The gray wolf and the vulnerable grizzly bear once lived in the watershed, but are now considered extirpated.

5|$|Within Antananarivo, the {{territory}} of the Andriamboninolona, designated generations before by King Andrianjaka, included the neighborhood of Ambatomasina (east of Andohalo) and extended from Ambohitantely eastward to Ambatolampy and north to the principal road that led to Ambavahadimasina. The neighborhoods reserved in Antananarivo for the Andriandranando, also decreed by Andrianjaka, laid to the northeast of Andohalo and extended from Ambavahadimasina in the west to Ambohimanoro in the east, and from the road to Ambavahadimasina northward to Ambatonandriankoto. King Andriamasinavalona decreed that within the capital city, the Zanaralambo would <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> delimited by Ambohitsoa to the southwest, Ambodivoanonoka to the east, and Andohalokely in the north. Outside the capital, each group had its designated villages. The Andriamboninolona lived in Ambohitromby, Fieferana, Ambohipiainana and Ambohitriniandriana. The Andriandranando lived in Soamanandrarina, Betsizaraina, Ambohibe, Ihadiambola and Akadindramamy. Finally, the Zanaralambo inhabited Lazaina, Ambatofotsy and Masindray.|$|E
