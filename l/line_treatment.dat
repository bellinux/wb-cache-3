5|$|Clonazepam, a {{benzodiazepine}} is used {{to treat}} many forms of parasomnia. Rapid eye movement behavior disorder responds well to low doses of clonazepam.

5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} first <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{perform an}} empirical, single-centre, {{retrospective}} and secondary cost of illness (COI) study of advanced ovarian carcinoma (AOC) in Italy. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, {{health care and}} non-health care resource consumption data concerning {{a convenience sample of}} subsequent patients in 1 st <b>line</b> of <b>treatment</b> (100 patients), 2 nd <b>line</b> of <b>treatment</b> A (surgery + chemotherapy; 30 patients) and 2 nd <b>line</b> of <b>treatment</b> B (chemotherapy only; 20 patients) were obtained from a database created in 2011 by the Obstetrics and Ginecology Unit at Campus Biomedico teaching hospital, Rome. Patients were followed-up for 2 years. Resources were valued according to the above mentioned database and literature, following the societal viewpoint. Costs are expressed in Euro (€) 2014 and reported as mean and standard deviation (SD). RESULTS: One-year COI for 1 st <b>line</b> of <b>treatment</b> reaches € 44, 999. 7 (SD: € 28, 757. 3), € 55, 410. 8 (SD: € 32, 454. 6) and € 46, 895. 6 (SD: € 28, 407. 4) for 2 nd <b>line</b> of <b>treatment</b> A and B, respectively. Regardless the <b>line</b> of <b>treatment,</b> COI is mainly driven by cost borne by patient and her family. Due to the high costs of relapse the mean COI per patient after 2 years from the diagnosis of AOC equals € 81, 869. 4 (SD: € 30, 660. 9), or 182 % of the COI for the 1 st <b>line</b> of <b>treatment.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Despite some limitations, our results show that increasing progression-free survival could well reduce the COI for AOC in Italy...|$|R

5000|$|Because mood {{disorders}} {{can interfere}} with the vestibular compensation and adaptive plasticity, it suggested to address any co-occurring anxiety disorder and/or depression. Severe anxiety episodes are usually addressed by short-term benzodiazapine therapy. Long-term use of benzodiazapines such as diazapam, however, is not recommended due to the tolerance issues. SSRIs and SSNRIs are {{among a number of}} first <b>line</b> <b>treatments</b> for anxiety or depression.|$|R
25|$|The World Federation of Biological Psychiatry {{recommends}} pregabalin as one {{of several}} first line agents {{for the treatment of}} generalized anxiety disorder, but recommends other agents such as SSRIs as first <b>line</b> <b>treatment</b> for obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. It appears to have anxiolytic effects similar to benzodiazepines with less risk of dependence.|$|E

40|$|Erection is a haemodynamic {{event that}} {{involves}} {{the central nervous system}} and local factors and is the recurrent or persistent inability to achieve and or maintain an erection to allow satisfactory intercourse. The ED is a disease of great social impact: it is estimated that in Italy, 11 - 13 % of men, or about 3 million are affected in part by ED. Main risk factors are: age, education level, anxiety, reactive depression, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure; disorders (hepatic failure, chronic renal failure, obesity, dyslipidemia); hormonal disorders (hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, hypo/hyperthyroidism); neuropathies (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, degenerative diseases); urologic surgery, colorectal and vascular. Regarding therapy first and most important form of treatment for a patient suffering from erectile dysfunction is to identify and possibly modify or remove all hazardous conditions for sexual health.

50|$|The first <b>line</b> <b>treatments</b> are {{diazepam}} and a non-selective beta blocker; other antihypertensive drugs {{may also}} be used. It {{is important to note}} that not all benzodiazepines and beta blockers are safe to use in an adrenergic storm; for instance, alprazolam and propranolol; alprazolam weakly agonizes dopamine receptors and causes catecholamine release while propranolol mildly promotes some catecholamine release - each worsening the condition.|$|R
