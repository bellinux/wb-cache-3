25|$|Initial trials {{revealed}} {{a lack of}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>control,</b> and the single-acting ailerons caused problems when taxying downwind, so the two prototype were fitted with lengths of bungee cord attached to control horns on the upper aileron surface to return the aileron to the neutral position. This only produced a marginal improvement, so ailerons were then added to the lower wings, these being fitted to all the aircraft built apart from the two prototypes.

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{adopted an}} atypical tail-first configuration; this approach {{had the effect}} of greatly reducing trim-drag while also generating increased lift at slower speeds. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>control</b> was provided by the nose-mounted tail plane via trailing edge elevators, lateral control was enacted by ailerons located on the wing's trailing edge, and directional control was achieved by a conventional rudder. All four of the primary flight control surfaces were actutated by a quadruple-redundant electro-hydraulic control unit, designed by Boulton Paul. Fly-by-wire electrical controls and automatic control systems were also to be employed on the type. The undercarriage, designed by Dowty Group, used an arrangement of a single centre-fuselage main unit complete with four wheels, a nose unit with two wheels, and a pair of outriggers located on the engine nacelles.|$|E
40|$|Objective. Various studies {{highlight}} {{cognitive impairments}} in cancer patients. This paper proposes {{a review of}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>controlled</b> studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions aiming to reduce these cognitive impairments. Method. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>controlled</b> studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions aiming to reduce cognitive impairments in adult cancer patients and published between 1993 and 2013 were identified, {{with the exception of}} studies that implied patients suffering from CNS tumor or metastasis. Results. Pharmacological interventions (n = 11) suggested the positive impact of modafinil on memory and executive functions. Non-pharmacological interventions (n = 10) suggested the positive impact of cognitive revalidation and stimulation programs, psycho-education and meditation on several memory, attentional and executive objective as well as subjective functions. Nonpharmacological interventions show more significant cognitive benefits than pharmacological interventions. Conclusion. Some <b>longitudinal</b> <b>controlled</b> studies support the usefulness of interventions aiming to reduce cognitive impairments in cancer patients. Further studies should evaluate the effectiveness of programs combining technics aiming to reduce cognitive impairments and psychotherapeutic technics aiming to support patients' coping with illness.

25|$|In 1960, Maurice Brennan joined Folland as {{its chief}} {{engineer}} and director; due to Brennan's experience of variable-geometry wings, figures within Hawker Siddeley were keen {{to encourage the}} application of this expertise to the firm's designs. Under Brennan's direction, a variable geometry wing {{was applied to the}} basic Gnat 5 design to produce a pair of layouts – one tailless and one using with a conventional tail – for a multipurpose fighter/strike/trainer, designated as the Fo. 147. The design used a unique mechanism to sweep the wings; this mechanism used a combination of tracks set upon the fuselage sides, the centerline, and {{on the underside of the}} wings, and was actuated by hydraulically-driven ball screws positioned at the inner ends of the wings. The wings could be swept from 20 degrees to 70 degrees; at the 70 degree position, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>control</b> was maintained by wing tip-mounted elevons, while this was provided by a retractable canard arrangement when swept at the 20 degree position, using full auto-stabilisation. By providing trimming functionality via the canard, the necessity of a large tailplane was eliminated, which was present on alternative designs that did not feature the canard configuration.|$|E

[...] The Clerget was longer than the Smith Static, however, which meant that the aircraft could not be rigged to be stable both at full power and with power off, with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>control</b> being lost at below 63mph (101km/h).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The European Lacidipine Study of Atherosclerosis (ELSA) was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, {{multinational}} interventional trial using B-mode ultrasound {{measurement of}} carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in 2259 hypertensive individuals. ELSA showed that 4 -year treatment with the calcium antagonist, lacidipine, significantly slowed down progression of carotid atherosclerosis {{as compared with}} treatment with the beta-blocker, atenolol. OBJECTIVE: To report data on cross-sectional and <b>longitudinal</b> quality <b>control</b> of the ultrasound measurements implemented throughout ELSA. METHODS: Patients underwent scans at baseline and at each annual visit. All endpoints were measured while the study was in progress (initial measurements). In addition to the cross-sectional quality <b>control</b> procedures, a <b>longitudinal</b> quality <b>control</b> procedure of re-reading 250 baseline scans at yearly intervals was implemented, to control possible reader drift. After the study had been completed, the primary endpoint was measured again under the same condition of cross-sectional quality control. RESULTS: Cross-sectional quality control data showed high reliability for all endpoints at all time points except for single maximum IMT (T-max) and internal carotid IMT. Within-reader reliability was constantly better than between-reader reliability but, for the primary endpoint, between-reader reliability remained excellent. Initial and <b>longitudinal</b> quality <b>control</b> measurements showed a time trend toward lower IMT values. After application of a correction factor calculated from <b>longitudinal</b> quality <b>control,</b> all initial measurements no longer decreased with time, and the corrected IMT measurements were reasonably similar to those made after completion of the study. CONCLUSION: For long-term epidemiological studies and clinical trials, both cross-sectional and <b>longitudinal</b> quality <b>control</b> are critical to the reliability of measurements. In order to evaluate the absolute change in IMT and interpret study results without bias, both must be implemented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Increasing {{highway traffic}} {{congestion}} {{and real estate}} costs that limit the building of new highways has brought about {{a renewed interest in}} an Automated Highway System (AHS) where the vehicle steering task (“lateral control”) and the braking/throttle tasks (“longitudinal control”) are taken over by computers to increase the throughput of existing highways. Since safety {{plays a key role in}} the development of an AHS, fault-tolerant control is vital. In this paper, we develop a robust <b>longitudinal</b> sliding-mode <b>control</b> algorithm and prove that this control algorithm is stable for a certain class of faults. In addition, we show that intervehicle spacing errors will not become amplified along the AHS in the event of a loss of lead vehicle information.
