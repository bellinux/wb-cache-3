40|$|Over {{the past}} couple of decades several {{endeavours}} have been made to develop <b>lixiviants</b> with the intention of replacing cyanide in gold leaching. In 1980 's these endeavours were largely economically driven, due to cyanide shortages at that time.

It is often argued that the high acute toxicity of cyanide alone makes it worthwhile considering to replace it completely by less toxic alternative <b>lixiviants.</b> This has led to having to consider more criteria in the choice of any alternative <b>lixiviants,</b> which have often not been taken into account in the past.

Some problems with this alternative process include the high consumption of thiosulfate, and the lack of a suitable recovery technique, since Au(S2O3)23&minus; does not adsorb to activated carbon, which is the standard technique used in gold cyanidation to separate the gold complex from the ore slurry.|$|E
50|$|Cyanide {{should be}} {{strictly}} controlled on mine sites, and proper management requires that certain precautions {{be taken to}} limit worker exposure and to prevent chemical solutions containing cyanide from entering the environment. The most-used process of removing gold from ore is through leaching. In the leaching process, sodium cyanide is dissolved in water where, under mildly oxidizing conditions, it dissolves the gold contained in the crushed gold ore. The resultant gold-bearing solution is called 'pregnant solution.' Either zinc metal or activated carbon is then added to the pregnant solution to recover the gold by removing it from the solution. There are two main leaching methods for gold extraction using cyanide. The first is 'heap' leaching in which the dilute cyanide solution is sprayed on large piles or heaps of coarse gold ore. The solution percolates through the pile dissolving the gold and the pregnant solution is then collected. This method is mainly used for ore with lower concentrations of gold. The other method is 'vat' leaching in which the process is similar but the gold ore is finely ground and leaching {{takes place in a}} tank or vat. Vat leaching is used mainly for ores with higher concentrations of gold due to the cost of milling the ore to a very small particle size. Alternative <b>lixiviant</b> (leaching) chemicals to cyanide (for example thiourea, sodium bromide) have been investigated for many years, but they are generally less effective and/or economical than cyanide, and they also present environmental risks that can be greater than cyanide. Because cyanide is toxic if not properly handled, its use is highly regulated in most countries.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{interest}} in non-cyanide <b>lixiviants</b> for leaching gold from ores/concentrates and recyclable waste material {{one of the main}} challenges in testing novel <b>lixiviants</b> is the slow reaction of gold dissolution which generally takes long hours of experimentation and high cost. The increased interest in naturally occurring nanoparticulate gold component in ore deposits and exploration samples also encourages research in this area. Gold nanoparticles in aqueous medium exhibit strong characteristic absorption peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum due to the Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The very large surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles leads to fast dissolution kinetics. These two properties allow chloride leaching of gold to be conveniently studied by the use of UV–Visible spectroscopy of gold nanoparticles produced in the laboratory. However, the method of production also controls the properties of gold nanoparticles. In this study, nine methods were used for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles using different reagents as reductants and stabilizers: D-glucose, trisodium citrate, sodium borohydride, ascorbic acid, heparin, hydrazine sulfate, monosodium glutamate, gelatine, starch (both with and without ethylene glycol), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and tannic acid. The UV–Visible spectra and the dissolution rates per unit surface area of nanoparticles in NaOCl/NaCl solutions are compared to show similar leaching behaviour between nano-gold and massive gold which encourages further studies with other non-cyanide gold <b>lixiviants...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} the various aspects of {{quantifying}} in-situ leaching (ISL) of copper in porphyry rock through numerical modelling. The first part involves a detailed review of physical and chemical processes {{that are expected to}} affect the leaching rate of copper. For this purpose, chalcopyrite was selected as representative leachable copper sulphide. Three alteration phases of hypogene copper deposits and supergene enriched porphyry rock have the highest potential to be economical ore bodies. Various <b>lixiviant</b> systems are discussed of which hydrochloric acid (HCL) was selected to be most suitable leaching agent for the purpose of the initial development of a modelling framework. Transport of the injected <b>lixiviant</b> relies on sufficiently permeable fractures, due the naturally low permeability of crystalline rock. Fracture stimulation is considered essential to establish a connected fracture network which would also develop an increased reaction surface area between the <b>lixiviant</b> and the target mineral. The second part of the study integrates all relevant hydrodynamic and chemical processes and parameters into a reactive transport modelling framework. A range of conceptual modelling scenarios were developed and translated into illustrative numerical models. The considered cases were guided by the analysis of mineral maps that were developed from high resolution chemical analyses of samples for porphyry rock deposits. Simulations were performed at the cm-scale under consideration of physical and chemical heterogeneity. The impact of a hydraulic fracture was considered in which predominant solute transport occurs through advection. In contrast solute migration in the adjacent matrix was controlled by diffusion. Model variants were defined to investigate the sensitivity of copper extraction rates to selected physical parameters, such as different orientation of the hydraulic fracture in relation to the vein and porosity variations according porosity measurements on similar samples. In other scenarios the reaction network was varied by the addition of secondary minerals and the composition of the <b>lixiviant</b> and/or groundwater solution was varied. The orientation of the hydraulic fracture, the pH of the leaching solution and porosity variations showed to be most important factors for the copper extraction rate.

Petrographic and geochemical analyses showed that both Mn (IV, III) oxides and calcite were dissolved. The abundance of dissolved Ca caused precipitation of gypsum. Acid consumption by calcite dissolution caused a rise in pH that caused the SO/S species to shift to S 032 -(sulfIte), which hindered reductive dissolution of Mn oxide.

The study examines the influence of varying the leaching protocol on the rate of release of U, Th, Y and REEs. Leaching protocols were designed to simulate a range of heap/in situ stope leaching scenarios. Protocol variants included flushing frequency, leachate recycle, nutrient (9 K salts) addition and ferric sulphate addition to cells. Maximum extractions over 52 weeks were: 58 % U, 50 % Th, 36 % Y and 45 % of the REEs; observed in cells flushed fortnightly with a ferric sulphate <b>lixiviant</b> (0. 5 g/l, pH 3. 5). Flushing with tap water once monthly resulted in second highest observed extractions (57 % U, 6 % Th, 27 % Y, 37 % REEs) {{with the exception of}} Th, where the lower release was due to insufficiently low pH for Th mobilisation. Pourbaix plots indicate that redox potentials within the leaching system were buffered by coffinite dissolution. The high redox potentials, acidic pH and elevated sulphate concentrations required for metals dissolution were found to be a consequence of (a) direct addition of ferric sulphate as a <b>lixiviant</b> or (b) in situ generation of acidity and ferric sulphate via microbially-mediated oxidation of accessory pyrite. Generation and maintenance of acidic sulphate-rich interstitial water appear to control the dissolution of Th, Y and REEs in addition to U. The presented data highlight that significant U, Th, Y and REEs can be mobilised from rock materials by the addition of a ferric sulphate <b>lixiviant,</b> furthermore periodic flushing with water alone is sufficient to achieve similar release of U, Y and REEs where accessory pyrite is available in the reacting system. These findings have significant implications for recovery of valuable elements from low grade and marginal ores or materials previously considered as wastes...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{research}} interest on non-cyanide gold <b>lixiviants</b> {{over the past}} three decades all the non-cyanide gold processes are still at the developmental stages with limited understanding on solution and pulp chemistry in some cases. This is partly associated with: 1. the difficulties in measuring reliable equilibrium data for various gold(I/III) complexes with non-cyanide ligands; 2. the lack of knowledge on mixed-ligand complexes; and 3. different kinetic stabilities of gold(I) complexes with respect to disproportionation. This paper presents reliable equilibrium data for complex formation, dissolution, precipitation, hydrolysis and disproportionation reactions of gold(I/III) compounds with a range of non-cyanide ligands: S 2 -, HS -, S 2 O 3 2 -, SO 3 2 -, SCN -, SC(NH 2) 2, OH -, NH 3, Cl -. Solubility of gold(III) compounds with non-cyanide ligands follows the order: Cl - > NH 3 > OH -.

40|$|Thesis (Masters Degree (Chemical Engineering)) - Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1996 With the {{increasing}} awareness ofpreserving the environment, {{the need for}} other <b>lixiviants</b> in leaching processes has escalated. The investigation for <b>lixiviants,</b> especially for gold, has entailed mostly the halogen group. From halogens, iodine forms the most stable gold complex. The aim ofthis {{study was to investigate}} the adsorption characteristics of gold-iodide onto a coconut shell based activated carbon. In {{the first part of this}} study, the factors influencing the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium were investigated. Mixing experiments and interruption tests indicated clearly that the principal adsorption mechanism is by first order film diffusion. When the initial gold concentration was changed, the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium decrease viith an increase in gold concentration. This is due to the shielding effect by the adsorbed gold as it is partly reduced on the carbon surface. The concentration of iodide increased the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium. The increase in concentration of iodine leads to an increase in concentration ofthe principal oxidising agent, tri-iodide, thereby decreasing the adsorption parameters as the gold gets redissolved from the carbon surface. Furthermore, iodine and trio-iodide adsorbs competitively, thereby decreasing the rate ofadsorption ofthe gold complex. This is further iterated by experiments where the carbon was pre-treated v. ith a iodine/iodide solution. In acidic solutions, none, or a minimal amount ofthe gold is red 11 ced on the carbon surface, adsorption is only in the complex form, while in a alkaline solution, the gold is partly adsorbed and partly reduced.

Maximum rates of reaction ranged from 3 to 10 (mmol/d) /L (column) for coal waste and 0. 4 (mmol/d) /L (column) for coal. Reaction was 30 to SO pct complete, probably due to precipitation of product salts (e. g., jarosites), which impede transport of oxidant through the coal. An absorption-desorption model of solids leaching, which considers the role of heterogeneous porosity in solids leaching, was used to describe time-dependent leaching rates...|$|R
40|$|To {{overcome}} {{the challenges of}} mineral CO 2 sequestration, Innovation Concepts B. V. is developing a unique proprietary gravity pressure vessel (GPV) reactor technology and has focussed on generating reaction products of high economic value. The GPV provides intense process conditions through hydrostatic pressurization and heat exchange integration that harvests exothermic reaction energy, thereby reducing energy demand of conventional reactor designs, in addition to offering other benefits. In this paper, a perspective {{on the status of}} this technology and outlook for the future is provided. To date, laboratory-scale tests of the envisioned process have been performed in a tubular “rocking autoclave” reactor. The mineral of choice has been olivine [~Mg 1. 6 Fe 2 + 0. 4 (SiO 4) + ppm Ni/Cr], although asbestos, steel slags, and oil shale residues are also under investigation. The effect of several process parameters on reaction extent and product properties has been tested: CO 2 pressure, temperature, residence time, additives (buffers, <b>lixiviants,</b> chelators, oxidizers), solids loading, and mixing rate. The products (carbonates, amorphous silica, and chromite) have been physically separated (based on size, density, and magnetic properties), characterized (for chemistry, mineralogy, and morphology), and tested in intended applications (as pozzolanic carbon-negative building material). Economically, it is found that product value is the main driver for mineral carbonation, rather than, or in addition to, the sequestered CO 2. The approach of using a GPV and focusing on valuable reaction products could thus make CO 2 mineralization a feasible and sustainable industrial process...|$|R
