5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma {{can not be ruled}} out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E

He was a star at Crystal City High School, where he scored 3,068 points in his scholastic career, was twice named All-American, and was elected to the Missouri Association of Student Councils. He received 75 college scholarship offers, although he applied to only five schools and only scored a 485 out of 800 on the Verbal portion of the SAT, which—despite being <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top third of all test takers that year—normally would have caused selective schools like Princeton University to reject him.|$|E

5|$|Early {{research}} on the galactic habitable zone, including the 2001 paper by Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward, did not demarcate any specific boundaries, merely stating that the zone was an annulus encompassing a region of the galaxy that was both enriched with metals and spared from excessive radiation, and that habitability would be more <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> galaxy's thin disk. However, later research conducted in 2004 by Lineweaver and colleagues did create boundaries for this annulus, {{in the case of}} the Milky Way ranging from 4 kpc to 10 kpc from the galactic center.|$|E

5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second World War, due to the {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, The decision was made to raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training. During this time the 6th Battalion was called up for a number of periods of continuous service in order to bolster their readiness and undertook garrison duties in Australia. In 1944, however, {{the decision was made to}} disband the unit, as the Australian government sought to reallocate resources to the economy and began the demobilisation process early. Later, in January 1945, the battalion's parent unit, the 2nd Brigade was also disbanded.|$|E

5|$|Complete {{independence}} from British rule was granted on 10 December 1963, with the ZNP/ZPPP coalition as the governing body. The government requested a defence agreement from the United Kingdom, {{asking for a}} battalion of British troops to be stationed on the island for internal security duties, but this was rejected as it was deemed inappropriate for British troops {{to be involved in}} the maintenance of law and order so soon after independence. Much of the cabinet which was seeking closer ties with Egypt (ruled by the radical, anti-Western nationalist Nasser) did not want British troops in Zanzibar anyway. British intelligence reports predicted that a civil disturbance, accompanied by increasing communist activity, was <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future and that the arrival of British troops might cause the situation to deteriorate further. However, many foreign nationals remained on the island, including 130 Britons who were direct employees of the Zanzibar government.|$|E
5|$|Plantinga's {{version of}} the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his natural theology. Rather than attempt to show the {{existence}} of God as <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil. Theologian Alister McGrath has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga {{did not attempt to}} demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford {{served in}} the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories until Alberta became a {{province}} in 1905. During his tenure, he was elected deputy speaker and sat on standing committees for libraries, municipal law, and education. His legislative efforts included successful attempts to extend {{the boundaries of the}} Town of Strathcona and to empower it to borrow for construction of public works. He was considered a possible member of Haultain's executive council, <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post of Commissioner of Public Works, but the post instead went to George Bulyea. He joined many of his fellow MLAs in continuing to advocate for provincial status, finding that the limitations on a territory's means to raise revenue prevented the Northwest Territories from meeting its obligations.|$|E

5|$|The Pembroke is {{the more}} popular breed of dog, with the Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{appearing}} on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. There are several physical {{differences between the two}} types according to the breed standards: the Cardigan is larger overall, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used. With regards to their health, according to a 2004 survey, they both had similar lifespans, although kidney or urethral conditions are more <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pembrokes. Furthermore, Pembroke Corgis {{were more likely to have}} eye problems than the Cardigan breed. Welsh Corgis have a strong association with Queen Elizabeth II, who has personally owned more than 30 dogs, either Pembrokes or Corgi/Dachshund crosses.|$|E
5|$|The {{author of}} the Bhikshuka Upanishad is unknown, as is its date of composition. It was {{probably}} composed in the late medieval to modern era, most <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 14th or 15th century. The text has ancient roots, as its contents are identical in key details to chapter 4 of the Ashrama Upanishad, which is dated to about the 3rd century CE. Both texts mention four types of mendicants with nearly identical life styles. The two texts have a few minor differences. The much older Ashrama Upanishad, for example, mentions that each type aspires to know their self (Atman) for liberation, while the Bhikshuka specifies that they seek this liberation through a yogic path.|$|E
5|$|The log-on message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a log-on message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that they were sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel exhaustion was <b>likely.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame-out, the aircraft's ram air turbine would deploy, providing power to various instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the fuel starvation scenario.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} Welsh monarch during Ímar's reign was Gruffudd ap Llywelyn (died 1063/1064). One of the latter's main rivals was Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, King of Gwynedd (died 1039), {{a man who}} {{had killed}} Gruffudd's father in 1023, and thenceforth ruled Gwynedd until his own demise in 1039. Gruffudd himself may have been responsible for Iago's slaying, and certainly succeeded to the kingship of Gwynedd after his death. It was <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of Iago's fall and this resulting regime change that the latter's son, Cynan (fl. 1064), fled overseas and sought refuge in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|One {{striking}} {{example of}} multilingualism {{as well as}} multiculturalism in the Empire is a 2nd-century epitaph for a woman named Regina, discovered in 1878 near the Roman fort at South Shields, northeast England. The inscription is written in Latin and Palmyrene Aramaic, the language of Regina's husband, Barates, who has been identified with a standardbearer (vexillarius) of that name from Palmyra, Syria. He was most <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military stationed along Hadrian's Wall. The Latin, however, is constructed grammatically {{in the manner of}} Greek honorific inscriptions typical of Palmyra, suggesting that Barates was bilingual in Aramaic and Greek, and added Latin as a third language. The Latin portion is larger and longer, and provides most of the information. The Palmyrene is carved in a fluid cursive script, and conveys only the name of Regina and an expression of grief. Since few people in Britain could have read Palmyrene, its use may be Barates' personal statement of his identity and emotions. A fourth linguistic element is the name Regina, which can be either Latin or Celtic. Such names seem often to have been chosen for their deliberate duality. Regina herself is identified as from the British Catuvellauni, a people whose civitas capital was Verulamium, but the Gallo-Brittonic spelling Catuallauna (feminine) is used in the Latin inscription.|$|E
5|$|The inner ward {{was created}} during Richard the Lionheart's reign, when a moat was dug {{to the west}} of the {{innermost}} ward, effectively doubling the castle's size. HenryIII created the ward's east and north walls, and the ward's dimensions remain to this day. Most of Henry's work survives, and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt. Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers, the innermost ward's wall also serves as a curtain wall for the inner ward. The main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a gatehouse, most <b>likely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower. The inner ward's western curtain wall was rebuilt by EdwardI. The 13th-century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large-scale use of brick as a building material in Britain, since the 5th-century departure of the Romans. The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13towers that stud the curtain wall. Anti-clockwise from the south-west corner they are: Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, Martin, Constable, Broad Arrow, Salt, Lanthorn, Wakefield, and the Bloody Tower. While these towers provided positions from which flanking fire could be deployed against a potential enemy, they also contained accommodation. As its name suggests, Bell Tower housed a belfry, its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack. The royal bow-maker, responsible for making longbows, crossbows, catapults, and other siege and hand weapons, had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower. A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the Tower at night.|$|E
