5|$|In {{building}} the pipeline, engineers faced {{a wide range}} of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme cold and the difficult, isolated terrain. The construction of the pipeline {{was one of the first}} <b>large-scale</b> <b>projects</b> to deal with problems caused by permafrost, and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with the frozen ground. The project attracted tens of thousands of workers to Alaska, causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean Greeks {{were also}} pioneers {{in the field}} of engineering, {{launching}} <b>large-scale</b> <b>projects</b> unmatched in Europe until the Roman period, such as fortifications, bridges, culverts, aqueducts, dams and roads suitable for wheeled traffic. They also made several architectural innovations, such as the relieving triangle. They were also responsible for transmitting a wide range of arts and crafts, especially of Minoan origin. The Mycenaean civilization was in general more advanced compared to the Late Bronze Age cultures of the rest of Europe. Several Mycenaean attributes and achievements were borrowed or held in high regard in later periods; so, it would be no exaggeration to consider Mycenaean Greece as a cradle of civilization.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{utilization}} of <b>large-scale</b> group <b>projects</b> in early computer science courses has been readily accepted in academia. In {{these types of}} projects, students are given a specific portion of a large programming problem to design and develop. Ultimately, the consolidation {{of all of the}} independent student projects integrates to form the solution for the <b>large-scale</b> <b>project.</b> Although many studies report on the experience of executing a semester-long course of this nature, course experience at Georgetown University, Washington, DC, shows the benefits of embedding a <b>large-scale</b> <b>project</b> that comprises just a segment of the course (three to four weeks). The success of these types of courses requires an effective process for creating the specific <b>large-scale</b> <b>project.</b> In this paper, an effective process for <b>large-scale</b> group <b>project</b> course development is applied to the second computer science course at Georgetown University...|$|R

5|$|The Port of New York and New Jersey {{comprised}} {{the main point}} of embarkation for U.S. troops and supplies sent to Europe during World War I, via the New York Port of Embarkation. The congestion at the port led experts to realize {{the need for a}} port authority to supervise the extremely complex system of bridges, highways, subways, and port facilities in the New York-New Jersey area. The solution was the 1921 creation of the Port Authority {{under the supervision of the}} governors of the two states. By issuing its own bonds, it was financially independent of either state; the bonds were paid off from tolls and fees, not from taxes. It became one of the major agencies of the metropolitan area for <b>large-scale</b> <b>projects.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1920s, {{the role of the}} Catholic Church grew. This was {{encouraged}} by the Belgian government, since the priests knew the country well and facilitated its administration. Many Rwandans (including elite Tutsi) converted, since Catholicism was an increasing prerequisite for social advancement. King Musinga refused to convert, and in 1931 he was deposed by the Belgian administration; his eldest son, Mutara III Rudahigwa, succeeded him and eventually became Rwanda's first Christian king. During the 1930s the Belgians introduced <b>large-scale</b> <b>projects</b> in education, health, public works and agricultural supervision, including new crops and agricultural techniques to improve food supply. Though Rwanda was modernised the Tutsis remained in power, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised and subject to large-scale forced labour. In 1935 Belgium introduced identity cards, labelling an individual as Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. Although wealthy Hutu had previously been able to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards ended further social mobility.|$|E
5|$|Jordan aims {{to benefit}} from its large uranium {{reserves}} with two nuclear plants, 1000 MW each, scheduled for completion in 2025. Natural gas was discovered in Jordan in 1987. The estimated size of the reserve discovered was about 230 billion cubic feet, a modest quantity compared with its other Arab neighbours. The Risha field, in the eastern desert beside the Iraqi border, produces nearly 35 million cubic feet of gas a day, which is sent to a nearby power plant to produce a minimal amount of Jordan's electricity needs. Jordan receives 330 days of sunshine per year, and wind speeds reach over 7m/s in the mountainous areas. King Abdullah inaugurated several <b>large-scale</b> <b>projects</b> like the 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm and the 53 MW Shams Ma'an Power Plant in the 2010s. In May 2017, {{it was announced that}} more than 200 MW of solar energy projects had been completed. The government has set a target to satisfy 20% of Jordan's electrical consumption with renewable resources by 2020, a total of around 1800 MW.|$|E
