This note introduces an inspection delay time, measured in units produced after an inspection is made until results are known. If the inspection delay is negligible, then the problem reduces essentially to two separate lot sizing problems: the classical EOQ lot sizing problem and an <b>inspection</b> <b>lot</b> sizing problem. If the delay is great, then only one inspection should be made and the lot size is as given by Porteus, and Rosenblatt and Lee.

30|$|From TableÂ  3, it can {{be noted}} that the {{existing}} sampling plan under the classical statistics method provides the determined values at all specified parameters. On the other hand, the proposed plan under the neutrosophic interval method provides the probabilities in the interval. For an example, when n[*]=[*] 5, the lot acceptance probability is 0.1632, the probability of indeterminacy (i.e., neither an acceptance not a reject) is 0.6333. It means, that when a <b>lot</b> of <b>inspection</b> with n[*]=[*] 5 and c[*]=[*] 0 is applied for the <b>inspection</b> of the <b>lot,</b> there is 63 % chance that an experimenter is undecided about the lot sentencing. By comparing both sampling plans, we note that the plan under the classical statistics only has the decision of acceptance or rejection of the lot. The existing plan does not provide any information about the indeterminacy. So, the proposed sampling under the neutrosophic statistics is more effective and adequate under the uncertainty environment and this conclusion coincides with [21].|$|R

40|$|In most {{deterministic}} and stochastic inventory models {{encountered in}} the literature, the optimal policy is determined {{on the basis of}} the assumption that lead-time is a given parameter.

In this paper, we study a stochastic inventory continuous review system with lead-time depending on lot size and setup time. We assume that the lead-time can be expressed as the product of productive time and a given nonproductive factor that reflects the portion of the lead-time such as waiting and moving times. For general demand distributions, the resulting mathematical model is too complex to be solved analytically. For such distributions, we developed an Awesim simulation model for the continuous review system with lot size and lead-time interaction. This simulation model is interfaced with an optimization procedure based on a proposed partial enumeration method to search for the least-cost lot size and reorder point.

40|$|A {{total of}} 982 {{individuals}} distributed in 11 lots belonging to 10 fish species from three Atlantic FAO fishing areas were sampled and examined {{to detect the}} presence of anisakid larvae in fish muscle. After hazard identification by genetic sequencing and exposure assessment by anatomic extent and demographic characterization of in-fection, all data were fitted for each fish species to a new proposed scoring schema of parasite prediction. In {{the absence of a}} criterion standard method for inspection and precise definition of the quantum satis for parasites in contaminated fish <b>lots,</b> the <b>inspection</b> rating scheme called SADE (Site of infection, Assurance of quality, De-mography, Epidemiology) may help fish industries to precisely handle and to evaluate the likely outcome of infected fish lots after being diagnosed. For this purpose, a supporting flow diagram for decision was defined and suggested. This new performance assessment tool has the aim of staging fish lots, thus helping in planning manufacture, commercial, and research decisions during self-management programs. This novel scoring system provides an improved inspection format by implementing the occurrence stratification for parasites to guide Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) programs for the uniform exchange of information among fish industries, administration and researchers, thus facilitating standardization and communication. In the future, this scoring version could be validated (in terms of classification and wording) for similar overall predictive purposes in other muscular parasites infecting seafood products...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author proposes to {{determine}} some general relationships linking the functions that express {{the effectiveness of}} a sampling plan in lot acceptance sampling. The result is obtained through the introduction of a function which provides the expected number of units, to be drawn from a lot of given quality, with reference to accepted lots only. This function, together with the OC function, appears in the expression of the ASN, ATI and AOQ functions, which provide the economic design of a sampling plan. In addition, the author defines two functions by introducing some costs per unit of the inspection, substitution and utilization of defective items. The first one expresses the producer's expected gain from the application of a sampling plan to replace one hundred per cent <b>inspection</b> of <b>lots,</b> the second one expresses the consumer's expected gain from the application of a sampling plan to replace the acceptance of <b>lots</b> without <b>inspection.</b> For whichever type of sampling plan, single, double, multiple or sequential, it is sufficient to determine the form of the first function mentioned in the opening paragraph and the OC function, to express the remaining functions. Some examples are provided to clarify the proposed procedure. Of particular importance is the application in the case of sequential sampling plans where, through the use of some results related to random walks with two absorbing barriers, it is possible to obtain approximate expressions of all the above functions...|$|R

A procedure to accept, reject, screen or scrap the entire lot based on the values of the decision points is developed.

40|$|Existing {{structures}} are deteriorating. The deterioration depends on many factors, including workmanship, {{and therefore it}} is difficult to predict the exact deteriorating in time. By inspections it is possible to measure the deterioration and create a model with statistics and curve-fitting. Because of the high consequences C of failure of hydraulic structures, {{it is important to keep}} the probability of failure PF low. This follows from the definition of risk: Risk = PF?C Here is PF not the true probability of failure, because this is unknown, but it represents our perception about the probability of failure. The probability of failure consists of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties about the resistance of and the load on the construction. The epistemic uncertainties can be reduced by inspections, so we will be more certain about the reliability, without changing the structure physically. A low probability of failure for existing structures can be realized by inspections and maintenance. With the inspection results one can determine the condition of the structure and the necessity for maintenance. But what determines the necessity for inspection? This is an interesting question when the inspections are destructive or very costly. When it comes to relatively cheap inspections, this will also play an important role, if they have to be executed a great number of times. Especially if a <b>lot</b> of unnecessary <b>inspections</b> are executed. With the pre-posterior Bayesian analysis one can determine value of certain types and numbers of inspections beforehand. By weighing the value of inspection against the inspection costs, it is possible to develop an optimal inspection strategy. The method above is applied to the reinforcement bars in a concrete plate of a bridge. The effective diameter of the reinforcement bar is uncertain due to the presence of corrosion. Therefore the strength of the reinforcement bar is uncertain. With the present conditions the risk can be to such a degree, that it is cost efficient to inspect and/or maintain the bridge. The effective diameter can be determined by a destructive and expensive method, of which a number of n can be executed. The total costs exist of the inspections costs and the expected maintenance costs belonging to a number of n inspections. The optimal number of inspections n follows from the minimization of the total costs. Because the inspection results are unknown beforehand, these results are treated as random variables, according to prior knowledge (the deterioration model). Then the cost optimal decision is chosen belonging to a number of inspections n. This is possible because we know that the diameter of the reinforcement bar is uncertain, and that this uncertainty can be reduced by inspections.
