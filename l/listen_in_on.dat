5|$|Wildebeest {{can also}} <b>listen</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the alarm calls of other species, {{and by doing}} so can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types of calls had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The alarm calls were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{lost its}} second preseason game, played against the Baltimore Colts in 100-degree heat in Toledo, Ohio. Browns placekicker Lou Groza opened the scoring with an 18-yard field {{goal in the}} first quarter, and a {{touchdown}} by fullback Ollie Cline later in the period put the Browns up 10–0. Baltimore responded {{in the second quarter}} with a touchdown pass by quarterback Y. A. Tittle to receiver Jake Leicht. Cline ran for another touchdown soon thereafter, however, once more giving the Browns a 10-point lead. Colts receiver Lamar Davis caught a 25-yard touchdown pass {{at the end of the}} second quarter. Cleveland led 17–14 at halftime. Neither team scored again until the fourth quarter, when Baltimore's Bus Mertes ran for a 38-yard touchdown and secured the 21–17 win. A number of Cleveland players suffered injuries during the game. Graham hurt his hand, Motley strained his back and end Dante Lavelli suffered a broken leg. Lavelli's injury sidelined him for the first seven games of the regular season. During the game, Baltimore players Hub Bechtol and Lew Mayne, a former Brown, tapped a phone line that went from Cleveland's press box to its sideline. This allowed the Colts to <b>listen</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> coaches' conversations and anticipate the Browns' play-calling.|$|E

25|$|In {{the plans}} for an attack on Norway {{presented}} on 29 February 1940 to Hitler by General von Falkenhorst, Arendal {{was one of the}} Norwegian towns and cities to be captured in the initial invasion wave. Like the port town of Egersund, which was also to be seized, Arendal had a land station for one of the two undersea telegraph cables between Norway and the United Kingdom. The Germans set out to cut the cable to the United Kingdom, as well as securing the telegraph cables to Denmark and Cuxhaven in Germany. Arendal was also important as a telegraph junction for the southern parts of Norway, with German personnel tasked to <b>listen</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Norwegian communications.
