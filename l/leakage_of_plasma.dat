50|$|At {{the onset}} of an infection, burn, or other injuries, these cells undergo {{activation}} (one of the PRRs recognize a PAMP or DAMP) and release inflammatory mediators responsible for the clinical signs of inflammation. Vasodilation and its resulting increased blood flow causes the redness (rubor) and increased heat (calor). Increased permeability of the blood vessels results in an exudation (<b>leakage)</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasma</b> proteins and fluid into the tissue (edema), which manifests itself as swelling (tumor). Some of the released mediators such as bradykinin increase the sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia, dolor). The mediator molecules also alter the blood vessels to permit the migration of leukocytes, mainly neutrophils and macrophages, outside of the blood vessels (extravasation) into the tissue. The neutrophils migrate along a chemotactic gradient created by the local cells to reach the site of injury. The loss of function (functio laesa) is probably {{the result of a}} neurological reflex in response to pain.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIncreased {{vascular}} permeability is a {{key feature}} of inflammatory conditions. In severe infections, <b>leakage</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasma</b> from the vasculature induces a life-threatening hypotension. Streptococcus pyogenes, a major human bacterial pathogen, causes a toxic shock syndrome (STSS) characterized by excessive plasma leakage and multi-organ failure. Here we find that M protein, released from the streptococcal surface, forms complexes with fibrinogen, which by binding to β 2 integrins of neutrophils, activate these cells. As a result, neutrophils release heparin binding protein, an inflammatory mediator inducing vascular leakage. In mice, injection of M protein or subcutaneous infection with S. pyogenes causes severe pulmonary damage characterized by <b>leakage</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasma</b> and blood cells. These lesions were prevented by treatment with a β 2 integrin antagonist. In addition, M protein/fibrinogen complexes were identified in tissue biopsies from a patient with necrotizing fasciitis and STSS, further underlining the pathogenic significance of such complexes in severe streptococcal infections...|$|E

40|$|Mechanisms {{underlying}} airway hyperresponsiveness are not {{yet fully}} elucidated. One of the manifestations of airway inflammation is <b>leakage</b> <b>of</b> diverse <b>plasma</b> proteins into the airway lumen. They include fibrinogen and thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to form fibrin, {{a major component of}} thrombi. Fibrin inactivates surfactant. Surfactant on the airway surface maintains airway patency by lowering surface tension. In this study, immunohistochemically detected fibrin was seen along the luminal surface of distal airways in a patient who died of status asthmaticus and in mice with induced allergic airway inflammation. In addition, we observed altered airway fibrinolytic system protein balance consistent with promotion of fibrin deposition in mice with allergic airway inflammation. The airways of mice were exposed to aerosolized fibrinogen, thrombin, or to fibrinogen followed by thrombin. Only fibrinogen followed by thrombin resulted in airway hyperresponsiveness compared with controls. An aerosolized fibrinolytic agent, tissue-type plasminogen activator, significantly diminished airway hyperresponsiveness in mice with allergic airway inflammation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that <b>leakage</b> <b>of</b> fibrinogen and thrombin and their accumulation on the airway surface can contribute to the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness...|$|R

Different strategies have been developed in the last decades to overcome endosomal accumulation and subsequent lysosomal degradation of targeted protein-based drugs.

30|$|Sepsis, {{as well as}} burns, causes transcapillary <b>leakage</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasma,</b> {{reducing}} the circulating plasma volume [16, 17]. As discussed above, experimental {{studies have shown that}} vitamin C reduces local oedema and <b>leakage</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasma</b> markers. However, these findings do not necessarily reflect a decrease in plasma volume loss, and so far, no study has specifically investigated the effect of vitamin C treatment on plasma volume. In the present study, we therefore tested the hypothesis that vitamin C would reduce the loss of plasma volume in the early stage of sepsis. Treatment was initiated 3 h after induction of sepsis, a more clinically relevant time point than used in most studies found in the current literature, where treatment was started either before or closely after injury (e.g. sepsis, burns). Different dose regimes have been used in previous studies. Beneficial effects on microcirculation have been shown with low-dose treatment [1, 2], but it seems that higher doses are needed to counteract microvascular leakage. We chose to compare two different treatment regimes, both previously shown to be effective to prevent capillary leakage - one with a small bolus dose followed by a continuous infusion [9, 10] and one with a high bolus dose as single treatment [4, 6]. A sham group that underwent the same surgical procedure, but received no treatment, was also included in the study.|$|E
40|$|The fall in {{pulmonary}} compliance in mice {{with radiation}} pneumonitis {{is associated with}} increased microvascular <b>leakage</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasma</b> proteins into the alveolar spaces and increased surfactant phospholipids in the lung and alveolar fluid.

Survival in irradiated animals that received corticosteroids was markedly better {{during the period of}} corticosteroid administration than that of irradiated animals that received no corticosteroids. The development of abnormalities in pulmonary mechanics and alveolar fluid surface tension appeared to be inhibited in the irradiated animals receiving corticosteroids as compared with irradiated animals not receiving corticosteroids. The increased microvascular protein leakage seen in the lungs of irradiated mice was not significantly different in the corticosteroid-treated group. However, corticosteroid adminstration was associated with a marked increase in the amount of phosphatidyl choline that could be recovered from the alveolar spaces by lavage, over and above the increase resulting from irradiation, and {{a significant increase in the}} incorporation of [14 C]palmitate into phosphatidyl choline by lung slices.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Posterior {{reversible}} encephalopathy {{syndrome is}} a clinical and radiological entity. The most accepted theory of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome {{is a loss}} of autoregulation in cerebral blood flow with a subsequent increase in vascular permeability and <b>leakage</b> <b>of</b> blood <b>plasma</b> and erythrocytes, producing vasogenic edema. In infection-associated posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, a clinical pattern consistent with systemic inflammatory response syndrome develops. Parainfluenza virus has not {{been reported in the}} medical literature to be associated with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Case presentation We report herein the case of a 54 -year-old Caucasian woman with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome associated with parainfluenza virus infection who presented with generalized headache, blurring of vision, new-onset seizure and flu-like symptoms. Conclusion Infection-associated posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome as well as hypertension-associated posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome favor the contribution of endothelial dysfunction to the pathophysiology of this clinicoradiological syndrome. In view of the reversible nature of this clinical entity, it is important that all physicians are well aware of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in patients presenting with headache and seizure activity.

The membrane potential of BICR/M 1 R-k cells was varied between &# 8722; 25 mV and &# 8722; 90 mV by changing the bicarbonate concentration in the medium or by voltage clamping. To avoid any interference by the inserted electrodes with the fluorescence measurement of the cytoplasm, the cells were fused by polyethyleneglycol to form giant cells (homokaryons).
