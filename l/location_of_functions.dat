40|$|This {{document}} presents {{views on}} the long-term development of land use and spatial structure in Finland. In the future, especially globalisation and economic development based on know-how, but increasingly also the ageing {{of the population and}} the climate change {{will have an impact on}} the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> and activities. Since decisions on land use and spatial structure have long-time effects, they should be given a sustainable direction so as to support competitiveness, ecological sustainability and the well-being of the citizens. For Finland to be successful in the global economy, the spatial structures should be linked to developments in Europe and the adjacent areas. Advantage should be taken of the opportunities offered by the Baltic Sea, and the emergence of cross-border development zones should be promoted. A polycentric spatial structure will support the strengths of each region and the utilisation of advantages in location and existing structures. Improved accessibility requires inputs, but these should be environmentally safe. Finnish regions have a particular strength in their varied environments, which provide an excellent framework for high-quality living environments, more extensive tourism, and the utilisation of natural resources...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a decision-theoretic approach to user modeling in the context of automatic interface customization. The modeling aspects of this work are grounded in artificial intelligence (AI), while the empirical methodology is grounded in human-computer interaction (HCI). The publications produced as part of this thesis have focused mostly on developing new models that are populated and tested with real user data. As such, the contributions of this thesis lie in the intersection of AI and HCI. 1. 1 The Problem of Intelligent Customization Intelligent software customization has become increasingly important as users are faced with larger, more complex applications. For a variety of reasons, software must be tailored to specific individuals and circumstances [12]. For example, adaptive interfaces are critical as different users may require different functionality from multi-purpose software [1], prefer different modes of interaction, or use software on a variety of hardware devices [4]. Because of this complexity, online and automated help systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in helping users identify and master different software functions [6]. Such systems should ideally adapt the help they provide and the decision to interrupt [5] to account for specific user preferences. In this thesis, we focus on intelligent interface customization where the attributes of software functionality (e. g., <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions,</b> presentation features of widgets, ability to ask question...|$|E

This modification improves unsupervised word segmentation on the standard Bernstein- Ratner (1987) corpus of child-directed English by more than 4 % token f-score compared to a model identical except that it does not special-case "function words, setting a new state-of-the-art of 92. 4 % token f-score. Our function word model assumes that function words appear at the left periphery, and while this is true of languages such as English, it is not true universally. We show that a learner can use Bayesian model selection to determine the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> words in their language, even though the input to the model only consists of unsegmented sequences of phones.

40|$|AbstractCarcinogenic {{activity}} of many {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) is mainly attributed to their respective diol epoxides, which can be classified as either bay or fjord region depending upon the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the epoxide <b>function.</b> The Pi class human glutathione (GSH) transferase (hGSTP 1 - 1), which is polymorphic in humans with respect to amino acid residues in positions 104 (isoleucine or valine) and/or 113 (alanine or valine), {{plays an important role}} in the detoxification of PAH-diol epoxides. Here, we report that the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the epoxide <b>function</b> determines specificity <b>of</b> allelic variants of hGSTP 1 - 1 toward racemic anti-diol epoxide isomers of benzo[c]chrysene (B[c]C). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of V 104,A 113 (VA) and V 104,V 113 (VV) variants of hGSTP 1 - 1 was approximately 2. 3 - and 1. 7 -fold higher, respectively, than that of the I 104,A 113 (IA) isoform toward bay region isomer (±) -anti-B[c]C- 1, 2 -diol- 3, 4 -epoxide. On the other hand, the IA variant was approximately 1. 6 - and 3. 5 -fold more efficient than VA and VV isoforms, respectively, in catalyzing the GSH conjugation of fjord region isomer (±) -anti-B[c]C- 9, 10 -diol- 11, 12 -epoxide.

40|$|Abstract—In {{conventional}} elastography, strain {{is estimated}} from the gradient of the displacement (time-delay) estimates. The displacement estimates involve estimating the peak <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the cross-correlation <b>function</b> between matching pre- and post-compression A-lines. Bias errors in estimating the peak <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the cross-correlation <b>function,</b> amplified by the gradient operation on the displacement estimates (needed for the computation of the strain), {{could result in}} values of elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (SNRe) that exceed the theoretical upper bounds, thereby hindering a consistent interpretation of this parameter. These algorithmic errors have not been {{accounted for by the}} theory. We propose the use of the measured correlation coefficients in the theoretical SNRe expressions to estimate the SNRe, rather than computing them directly from the elastograms. This methodology results in values of SNRe that are lower than the theoretical upper bounds, thereby avoiding the problems associated with computing SNRe directly from the elastograms. Using simulated models of uniformly elastic phantoms, a proof of principle of such an SNRe measure is shown. (E-mail...|$|R
