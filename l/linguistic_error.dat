50|$|Since {{the tribes}} are listed {{only in the}} context of being {{neighbours}} to the Heruli in the latter's former homeland, historian Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen thought it to be a <b>linguistic</b> <b>error</b> to interpret Rodulf as king of the tribes mentioned, instead holding that Rodulf should actually be read as king of the Heruli, as part of the greater context. Assuming that Rodulf had ruled all the tribes mentioned, historian Axel Kristinsson has speculated {{that it could have been}} natural for Rodulf to seek out some of his kinsmen, namely the southern Rugians who had joined the Ostrogoths as the Rogii sub-tribe after their kingdom was destroyed in 487. Historian A. H. Merrills, on the other hand, has proposed the possibility that placing Rodulf's origin with the Scandinavian tribes could have been politically motivated. Since Theodoric sought to expand his connections in the north at the time, his support of a northern exile would have given him significant benefits.|$|E

40|$|Translating is a {{complicated}} task as it involves two different languages with two different systems. To produce a good translation product a translator should have good translation competence. Translation competence consists of several sub-competencies, among which is the linguistic mastery of the two languages.

It would also be important to know whether students make self-repairs more in <b>linguistic</b> <b>error</b> category or in contextual category in their speech. The researcher {{would like to get}} information in regard of self-repair kind that occurs within students’ speaking performance of Spoken English class of UIN Sunan Ampel. The researcher would also know the availability of corrective feedback from the lecturer, to ensure that language correction comes from initiation of the students and also helped by the lecturer’s guidance. In order to find the answer of these matters, the researcher conducts a study in regard with students’ self-repairs and lecturer’s corrective feedback in Spoken English class. The study is done in qualitative method to ensure the richness of the data. The research subject is one Spoken English Class of UIN Sunan Ampel Surabaya in 2016 - 2017 academic years, taking both the students and the lecturer as the research subject. There are total 29 individual speaking and 5 feedback sessions records collected to be analyzed in this study. The result in regard with students’ percentage of self-repairs kind shows that in term of frequency, error repair has the frequency of 65, 2 %, Appropriateness repair is 22, 2 %, and different information repair is 12, 6 %. While in term of availability within every students, D-repairs occurred in 13 of 29 students’ presentations (44, 8 %), A-repairs were done by 21 students’ in their presentations (72, 4 %), while E-repairs occur in 28 of 29 presentations (96, 5 %). It shows that the percentage shows that error repair has the most occurrences within students. Then, the data on lecturer’s feedback sessions shows that among 5 feedback sessions, 3 of them contain corrective feedback. From those lecturer’s feedbacks, {{there are two types of}} lecturer’s corrective feedback among six types available in the class: explicit correction and elicitation. In the corrective feedbacks, the lecturer mostly corrects students’ pronunciation and grammatical errors.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the temporal organization of lexical repair in spontaneous Dutch speech. It assesses the extent to which offset-to-repair duration and repair tempo can be predicted on the basis of offset timing, reparandum tempo and measures of the informativeness of the crucial lexical items in the repair. Specifically, we address the expectations that repairs that are initiated relatively early are produced relatively fast throughout, and that relatively highly informative repairs are produced relatively slowly. For informativeness, we implement measures based on repair semantics, lexical frequency counts and cloze probabilities. Our results highlight differences between factual and <b>linguistic</b> <b>error</b> repairs, which have not been consistently distinguished in previous studies, and provide some evidence to support the notion that repairs that are initiated relatively early are produced relatively fast. They confirm that lexical frequency counts are rough measures of contextual predictability at best, and reveal very few significant effects of our informativeness measures on the temporal organization of lexical self-repair. Moreover, although we can confirm that most repairs have a repair portion that is fast relative to its reparandum, this cannot be attributed to the relative informativeness of the two portions. Our findings inform the current debate on the division of labour between inner and overt speech monitoring, and suggest that, although the influence of informativeness on speech production is extensive, it is not ubiquitous...|$|E
40|$|Kultura języka", a term {{which does}} not have an English equivalent, but {{corresponds}} roughly to "cultivated usage", consists in exercising conscious influence on the language and its development, as well as in making conscious use of it in interhuman relations. Exercising influence on the language means the forming of linguistic norms, that is to say certain directives on how to use the given elements of language, namely how to pronounce certain sounds, how to inflect words, by means of what rules to join them into sentences, etc. A linguistic norm must be based on linguistic reality, that is one cannot establish a norm which would not be supported by the usage of {{at least part of the}} language community. The notion of norm entails another phenomenon, namely a <b>linguistic</b> <b>error,</b> resulting either from one’s being ignorant of the norm, or from a visible misapplication of the norm. However, language is a phenomenon subject to constant evolution. This evolution results from linguistic innovations, that is to say from such deviations from the norm which do not meet with objection from the competent part of the society. The author goes on to discuss a number of examples which illustrate deviations from the norm in pronunciation, inflection, syntax, lexicon, etc. Talking about the lexicon, the author stresses the fact that the speaker must adjust his vocabulary to the subject matter, in accordance with his intention.

Translation is {{the replacement}} of textual material in one language (source language or SL) by equivalent textual material in another language (target language or TL). Since the past until current decade, the importance of translation is vivid because it acts as the bridge which connecting scattered knowledge and people with different languages. In translation, the most fundamental problem is linguistic problem since its mastery level determines {{the quality of a}} translation result. Therefore, this research focused on investigating the linguistic errors made by translation students as well as how they solved the problems in the process. The linguistic erros included in this study were grammatical, lexical, and stylistic errors. This research used the descriptive qualitative research design since it was able to give deep description regarding the encountered linguistic errors and the translation procedures used by the students in solving the problems. The samples were obtained from former translation II students. After conducting convenience sampling method, the obtained samples were 12 students of total 50 students. In collecting the data, this study used translation test which consisted of grammatical, lexical, and stylistic items. The result of this research showed that the students had difficulties when encountered some grammatical, lexical, and stylistic items. They were less capable in obtaining the closest equivalence of forms, meaning, and nuances from SL into TL. Moreover, it was also found that the students still lack of comprehension toward translation techniques. They mostly used literal procedure as the main technique and omitting as the final method in solving difficulties. Other procedures such as transposition, modulation, and adaptation were seldom being used by the students. Henceforth, the common translation difficulties were occured based on these following factors: (1) lingusitic mastery of both SL and TL, (2) cultural knowledge of both SL and TL, and (3) comprehension level of translation techniques...|$|E
40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of EnglishMichael L. DonnellyAmong {{the body}} of {{criticism}} on T. S. Eliot’s Four Quartets, critics such as Cleo McNelly Kearns and Alireza Farahbakhsh have recently interpreted the poet’s “intolerable wrestle / With words and meanings” (EC II) in light of deconstructionist theory. Although the poetry does recognize the difficulty of speaking about spiritual experience, it does not embrace the resulting linguistic miscommunication. In fact, the poems resist such a move, identifying the spiritual danger of such miscommunication; instead, they seek to overcome these difficulties and accurately communicate spiritual experience – an aim achieved {{in the context of}} biblical prophecy. Louis Martz argues that the Quartets are, in fact, not prophetic; however, he defines prophecy in terms of its social interests, rather than in terms of the interest in the human-divine relationship that characterizes both biblical tradition and Eliot’s poetry. I want to argue that reading the Quartets in the context of biblical prophecy, filtered through mystical tradition, explains their ability to transcend linguistic difficulty and explore spiritual experience in human language. In biblical tradition, the prophets overcome linguistic difficulty through a direct encounter with God, which purifies language of error and equips them to speak of divine reality. In Eliot’s Quartets, the poetry undergoes a similar purifying experience meant to replace <b>linguistic</b> <b>error</b> with a meaningful exploration of spiritual experience. For the Quartets, linguistic purification is accomplished by means of the mystical via negativa. Appropriating images associated with the via negativa, the poetry denies language tied to direct perception of spiritual reality and adopts instead a language that conveys such experience through unfamiliar words and images. In that language, the poetry is purified of its errors and made capable of exploring the human relationship with God. A poetry identified with the Incarnation, this solution communicates in human language the reality of spiritual experience. In this communication, the poetry at last explores spiritual experience in a way freed of miscommunication and meaningful for the audience, thereby fulfilling its prophetic aims...|$|E
40|$|<b>Linguistic</b> <b>error</b> {{has proven}} to be a {{recurrent}} area of interest for researchers. There exist several types of approaches to error; some studies have focused on specific errors, such as grammatical errors, others on more general or exogenous issues, such as the perception of error of the group object of study, etc. From the point of view of methodology, some have been dedicated to the definition and description of error, while others have studied the identification of erroneous uses of language. Several proposals for error categorisation have also been propounded. In the case of error production in languages foreign to the speaker, the learning factor must also be included. Some authors have focused on the underlying reasons, questioning if the cause for errors rests upon an inadequate teaching method, or the actual teacher, or even if the cause is intrinsic to any learnt language, as opposed to the Mother Tongue. From the principle that it is possible to improve the language proficiency level of students by looking at the errors produced, this doctoral dissertation studies pragmatic error in the production of written English. In addition, it includes pedagogic perspectives that introduce a Second Language to potential speakers and the European Framework of Reference. The thesis is structured as follows: the first part is dedicated to a theoretical justification of the research, with an introduction to Pragmatics, Error Analysis, Contrastive Analysis, Second Language Acquisition -in particular the Communicative Approach- and the European Framework for Languages. The third chapter is dedicated to the objectives. Chapter 4 explains the methodology used for data processing and analysis. The results are explained in chapter 5 and chapter 6 presents the conclusions derived from these. To begin with, a proposal for error analysis and identification is presented. This takes into account error distribution and classification and language levels proposed in the Common Europea Framework of Reference for Languages as an open tool for the analysis of errors investigated.
