5|$|Ashdod {{is home to}} the Israeli Andalusian Orchestra, which {{performs}} Andalusian classical music. It is an Arabic music {{style that}} originates from Moorish Iberia or Al-Andalus, has been jealously preserved in its original form by Arab and Jewish musicians of the Maghreb over the centuries, and has <b>left</b> <b>its</b> mark on the cante flamenco, the flamenco singing style, perhaps better known in the West. The orchestra was awarded the Israel Prize in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a diverse}} and growing {{cultural}} scene, with cultural life exhibited {{in a number}} of fields, including the visual arts, performing arts and nightlife. The city's cultural scene spans its history, dating back to Roman times: the city started to be built in that period, which has <b>left</b> <b>its</b> mark on the urban layout (centered on today's Piața Muzeului) as well as surviving ruins. However, the medieval town saw a shift in its centre towards new civil and religious structures, notably St. Michael's Church.|$|E
5|$|That night, 21 September, the {{regiment}} <b>left</b> <b>its</b> base at Musallabeh and headed north up the Jordan Valley. The 4th Squadron, leading, covered the first , reaching Kh Fusail and then Tel Es Ed Dhiab, with no opposition. They encountered a Turkish defence {{line at the}} Mafid Jozeleh bridge, which was captured along with twenty prisoners and two machine-guns. That night the infantry were left guarding the bridge, while the NZMRB continued advancing north to secure an important bridge at Damieh, cutting the Nablus road.|$|E

50|$|Another notable {{behavior}} of the species is occasional bipedal locomotion. It can run relatively quickly on its hind feet for a limited distance. It carries its body in an oblique position, lifting its hindlimbs high. It swings its forelimbs in phase with its hindlimbs, i.e. swinging its right forelimb as its right hindlimb comes up, and <b>its</b> <b>left</b> with <b>its</b> <b>left.</b>|$|R

5|$|The 3rd century saw the Danube river {{become the}} {{principal}} artery of trade, eclipsing the Amber Road and other commercial routes. The redirection of investment to the Danubian forts saw the towns along the Amber Road growing slowly, though yet retaining their prosperity. The prolonged {{struggle between the}} Romans and the barbarians further <b>left</b> <b>its</b> mark on the towns along the Amber Road.|$|E
5|$|The final attack {{had cost}} the 12th Parachute Battalion 126 killed, and <b>left</b> <b>its</b> three rifle {{companies}} with only thirty-five men between them. The 12th Devonshire company had another thirty-six killed. Amongst the casualties, was every officer or warrant officer, who had either {{been killed or}} wounded. The German defenders from the 3rd Battalion 858th Grenadier Regiment, had numbered 564 men before the British assault, {{by the time the}} village had been captured there were only 146 of them left.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 16 December 1941, Corregidor <b>left</b> <b>its</b> dock in Manila {{in total}} darkness, loaded to {{overcapacity}} with Filipino civilians seeking {{to escape to}} the southern Philippines after the war had started. It {{has been estimated that}} between 1,200 and 1,500 people were on board, including approximately 150 Philippine soldiers, 7 Americans, 5 Philippine legislators, and hundreds of college students who were traveling home after their schools had closed. Also aboard were military supplies as well the entire artillery complement of the Visayan-Mindanao Force of the Philippine Army. The owners of the ship failed to inform the Navy's Inshore Patrol of the ship's plan to leave Manila Bay.|$|E

5|$|Charles Darwin {{had been}} told that the Beagle was {{expected}} to sail about the end of September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle <b>left</b> <b>its</b> anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E
5|$|George Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier was {{illustrated}} by {{a photograph of}} homes in the Rosehall area of Coatbridge. In 1934 there was an exodus to Corby in England when the local Union Plant relocated. This {{had the effect of}} a hammer blow impact on the town's iron industry and ushered in the end of serious iron production. The decline of the Clydeside shipbuilding industry in the 1950s meant the demand for iron finally collapsed. A legacy of 'devastating' unemployment, appalling housing conditions and some of the worst overcrowding in Scotland <b>left</b> <b>its</b> stamp on the Coatbridge of the early 1930s. As late as 1936 Coatbridge was the most overcrowded place in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the Hong Kong dollar <b>left</b> <b>its</b> 16:1 peg {{with the}} Pound {{sterling}} and {{switched to the}} current US-HK Dollar peg. Hong Kong's competitiveness in manufacturing gradually declined due to rising labour and property costs, {{as well as new}} development in southern China under the Open Door Policy introduced in 1978 which opened up China to foreign business. Nevertheless, towards the early 1990s, Hong Kong had established itself as a global financial centre along with London and New York City, a regional hub for logistics and freight, one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia and the world's exemplar of Laissez-faire market policy.|$|E

5|$|In July 1915, the Truxtun {{was on its}} way to Alaska when {{it broke}} down and was unable to {{continue}} its mission. Initially, the blame fell on Callaghan, who had apparently ordered incorrect parts for the condenser. He was suspended from duty and ordered to appear before a court-martial. Subsequent investigation, however, found that another man was responsible for the error and Callaghan received a full acquittal and was reinstated. A few months later, he was appointed as commanding officer of the Truxtun, but the stress of his trial appeared to have <b>left</b> <b>its</b> mark—at the age of 25 years, his hair had already turned gray.|$|E
5|$|NY43 was {{extended}} slightly following {{the construction of}} a new alignment for NY30 near Central Bridge in the early 1940s. NY30 now <b>left</b> <b>its</b> old alignment southeast of Central Bridge and bypassed the community to the east. The former routing of NY30 into Central Bridge became an extension of NY43, which overlapped NY30 between the new alignment and Schoharie. When NY30A replaced NY148 in the late 1950s, the short piece of NY43 near Central Bridge became part of NY30A and NY43 was truncated back to NY30 near Schoharie. In the late 1960s, NY43 was rerouted through downtown Rensselaer to follow 3rd Avenue (previously NY381) east to US4. From there, NY43 overlapped US4 northward to Defreestville, where it rejoined its previous alignment.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Amhlaoibh sept from Co Fermanagh in Ulster derive {{its name}} from Amhlaoibh, a Gaelic {{personal}} name derived from the Old Norse names Áleifr and Óláfr. he sept traces its descent from Amlaíb (d.1306), younger son of the first Maguire king of Fermanagh—Donn Óc (c.1286–1302). The family {{was one of the}} junior septs that dispossessed other non Maguire families {{in the area of the}} Maguire lordship. In consequence of their military actions the family <b>left</b> <b>its</b> mark on the area in the name of the barony of Clanawley in Co Fermanagh.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese army <b>left</b> <b>its</b> {{fortress}} at Elvas on 12 July {{and arrived}} outside Badajoz the following day. A company of cuirassiers under dom Luiz de Menezes and some cavalry troops commanded by dom André de Albuquerque were confronted near a {{bridge over the}} Guadiana river by a Spanish cavalry party led by the Duke of Osuna. Both units retreated after inflicting serious losses upon {{each other in a}} bloody fight, the Spanish seeking protection behind the walls of the town. Mendes de Vasconcelos arrived shortly thereafter with the main Portuguese army, with its artillery, and a large number of supply wagons brought from Elvas. Seeing the strength of the Portuguese army, the Duke of San German hastily sent a message calling on Philip IV for help.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the period}} from around 1500 to 1800. In the 1530s, the monasteries were {{dissolved}} and their lands bought from the king by various important families in Somerset. By 1539, Glastonbury Abbey was the only monastery <b>left,</b> <b>its</b> abbot Richard Whiting was then arrested and executed on the orders of Thomas Cromwell. From the Tudor to the Georgian times, farming specialised and techniques improved, leading to increases in population, although no new towns {{seem to have been}} founded. Large country houses such as at Hinton St George and Montacute House were built at this time.|$|E
5|$|Though Brigham fully {{expected}} an all-out attack on Fort Blue Mounds following the incidents, it never came. The only violence that befell {{the occupants of}} the fort was that perpetrated on those who <b>left</b> <b>its</b> confines on June 6 and June 20. Dodge left a detachment at the fort for a time but after the June 20 attack the fort was never again a target during the Black Hawk War. Until {{the end of the}} war, Fort Blue Mounds served primarily as a supply center for the militia as they continued their pursuit of Black Hawk across Wisconsin.|$|E

5|$|After Hurricane Fay caused {{extensive}} {{power outages}} {{on the island}} just days before, residents of Bermuda were forced to complete preparations for Gonzalo in haste. Banks, businesses, schools, and government offices closed {{in advance of the}} storm, while the Royal Navy ship HMS Argyll <b>left</b> <b>its</b> post in the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with emergency assistance. The cyclone gradually weakened before crossing directly over central Bermuda at Category 2 strength around 00:30 UTC on October 18. Gonzalo battered the island with wind gusts as high as , downing hundreds of trees and creating widespread roof damage. At the height of the storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 total electricity customers were without power; service was not fully restored until early November. Many roads were impassable immediately following the hurricane, and in many cases the damage done by Gonzalo was indistinguishable from that of Fay. Bermuda Regiment soldiers and sailors from the Argyll took part in initial cleanup and repairs on the territory, and preliminary assessments revealed that the storm did not compare to the devastation of Hurricane Fabian in 2003. Catastrophe modelling firms estimated that Bermuda suffered up to $400million in losses, and despite the heavy disruptions, no deaths or serious injuries were reported there.|$|E
5|$|After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry {{and raising}} vast armies united by {{ethnicity}} and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually {{to the establishment}} of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206. The sultanate was to control much of North India, and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely <b>left</b> <b>its</b> vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs. By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India {{paved the way for the}} indigenous Vijayanagara Empire. Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India, and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.|$|E
5|$|After these losses Cochet {{took two}} weeks off to recover. Despite {{the rest in}} the 1931 Wimbledon Championships he shocked the tennis world by losing {{in the very first}} round to Nigel Sharpe. In the mixed doubles Cochet and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall were not more successful, falling in the fourth round. The doubles final {{remained}} unconquered for Brugnon and Cochet as the team of George Lott and John Van Ryn came back from 3–2 down in the fifth set to win the match. In July the Four Musketeers were ready to be challenged for the fifth time in the Davis Cup final. This time the opponent was the British Davis Cup team. In the first rubber Cochet was facing two set points for a two sets-love lead by Bunny Austin but fought back to claim the second set and won the next two for the match. Fred Perry battled through Borotra while the doubles were won by Cochet and Brugnon. Austin brought back the British hopes after a four set victory over the exhausted Borotra. The match was suspended multiple times due to rain, which made the court almost unsuitable for playing, which <b>left</b> <b>its</b> mark on the deciding rubber between Cochet and Perry. The recurring slight rain in the first set led Perry to drop the set from a 4–1 advantage. The second set went to Perry after he utilized passing shots as a counter for Cochet's net play. The third and fourth set however were taken by Cochet which gave the French team its fifth successive Davis Cup.|$|E
