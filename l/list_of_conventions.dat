Two of the longest-running and most prestigious awards are the Eisner Award and the Harvey Award, {{both of which}} began in 1988 after {{the dissolution of the}} Kirby Awards. The Eisner Award has been presented at San Diego Comic-Con International since 1988; while the Harvey Awards, also inaugurated in 1988 and after being presented at many different venues for much of their life, have been presented at the Baltimore Comic-Con since 2006.

40|$|As the use {{of mobile}} devices in the {{workplace}} grows exponentially, the current SQLite database managers available were too simple and failed to present the user with an intuitive way to browse and edit data. Most applications simply listed {{the content of the}} tables, ignoring the relations between them. This missing capability is what motivated this project. To create an app capable of managing a SQLite database focusing on the relations between tables. After selecting Android as the target operating system for its huge market share and how easily new developers can start to create projects, the application was developed using Java and Eclipse. Following the study of the way the SQLite language creates and saves the relations between tables, the nal code is able to understand these relations and present an intuitive user interface. In order to experience the full capabilities of the application, the database design must follow a short and simple <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>conventions,</b> but the relational functionalities can also be disabled, in which case the application works as a simple editor for any SQLite le. The result is an innovative, intuitive and fast SQLite Manager that allows the user to navigate through the database tables using the relations between them as well as making all the other basic activities such as creating new entries or editing existing ones. In conclusion, users who actively work with SQLite databases will now have a better and easier to use tool that will improve their experience with mobile devices in the workplace.

40|$|In {{architectural}} design, sketching is {{an important}} means to explore the first conceptual developments in the design process. It is necessary to understand the conventions of depiction and encoding in sketches and drawings {{if we want to}} support the architect in the sketching activity. The theory of graphic units provides a comprehensive <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>conventions</b> of depiction and encoding that are widely used among architects. These graphic units form useful building blocks to understand design drawings. We investigate whether it is possible to build a system that can recognize graphic units. The technology we are looking at is multi-agent systems. It was chosen for the following reasons: agents can specialize in graphic units, a multi-agent system can deal with ambiguity through negotiation and conflict resolution, and multi-agent systems function in dynamically changing environments. Currently there is no general approach or technology available for multi-agent systems. Therefore, in our research we first set out to make such a multi-agent system. In order to keep the complexity low, we first aim to make a system that can do something simple: playing Mah Jong solitary. The Mah Jong solitary system shares the following important features with a multi-agent system that can recognize graphic units: (1) specialized agents for moves; (2) negotiation between agents to establish the best move; (3) a dynamically changing environment; and (4) search activity for more advanced strategies. The paper presents the theoretical basis of graphic units and multi-agents systems, followed by a description of the multi-agent framework and its implementation. A number of systems that can play Mah Jong at various degrees of competence and accordingly degrees of complexity of multi-agent system, are distinguished. Finally, the paper demonstrates how the findings are informative for a system that can recognize graphic units...|$|E

40|$|This study explores what 2 ̆ 2 American drama 2 ̆ 2 signifies {{during the}} period after the Revolution. Traditionally, this {{category}} refers to plays set in America, which focus on American issues and/or person, and are written by American citizens. However, the dominance of such European dramatic genres of the sentimental, melodramatic, Gothic, and Romantic on American stages indicates that 2 ̆ 2 American drama 2 ̆ 2 also indicts foreign drama. In order to illustrate the complexity of pinpointing those elements that comprise antebellum American drama, three variations of Poe 2 ̆ 7 s Politian (1835) serve as case studies. Because Poe 2 ̆ 7 s play incorporates elements of these genres, it helps to delineate the conventions unique to each type while also revealing {{how many of the}} same devices are shared by these genres. These similarities have often led to conflation of these genres. Through consideration of America 2 ̆ 7 s reception and implementation of these genres, however, a culture 2 ̆ 7 s ability to manipulate these genres in ways that promote its norms becomes readily apparent [...] whether this culture is French, German, English, the American North, or the American South. A combination of reconstructive, genre, and textual criticism structure this study. It assumes the importance of learning about a period 2 ̆ 7 s historical, literary, political, and social forces in order to gain a better appreciation of literary works. Also, this type of reconstruction aids in analyzing genre. Using Frederic Jameson 2 ̆ 7 s work in genre studies, this analysis accepts the premise that, in addition to a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>conventions,</b> linking a genre to the influences that led to its creation and subsequent popularity are necessary in order to determine how to classify a work. These critical approaches elucidate how necessary it is to recognize that plays should not be considered in isolation from their cultural moments. The elements that a playwright elects to include and the revisions that he or she incorporates into later drafts reflect a dialagical process between the author and the audience. In the case of Poe 2 ̆ 7 s play in particular, his three versions not only address how European dramatic genres persisted in America but also how plays performed in America resonated with the country 2 ̆ 7 s cultural concerns...|$|E
