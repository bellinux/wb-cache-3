5|$|After {{the conference}} Carolyn Henson {{arranged}} {{a meeting between}} O'Neill and Arizona Congressman Morris Udall. Udall wrote a letter of support, which he asked the Hensons to publicize, for O'Neill's work. The Hensons included his <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first issue of the L-5 Society newsletter, sent to everyone on O'Neill's mailing list {{and those who had}} signed up at the conference.|$|E

5|$|The {{data were}} {{published}} as a <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Lancet in October 1999, co-authored by Ewen. It reported {{significant differences in}} the thickness of the gut epithelium of rats fed genetically modified potatoes (compared to those fed the control diet), but no differences in growth or immune system function were suggested.|$|E

There are 117 <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection that were written by Dumville family members, neighbors, Civil War soldiers, and Methodist clergy. The letters were written over the period 1851 through 1863. Most of <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection were written by Hephzibah Dumville.|$|R

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of an}} organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the {{scientific name}} of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.|$|E
5|$|The various {{sections}} {{into which}} the Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse were divided by Euthalian Apparatus and others, are not indicated in this manuscript. A cross appears occasionally as a separation in the Book of Acts. A larger <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> margin throughout the New Testament {{marks the beginning of}} a paragraph.|$|E
5|$|A 1788 <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky Gazette {{indicated}} that Marshall had unsuccessfully sought {{election to the}} Virginia General Assembly, although {{the year of the}} contest is not given. The letter continued that the defeat convinced Marshall that he could not win elected office in Fayette County and that he subsequently lobbied for the creation of Bourbon County, hoping that he might gain an office in that new county. When the county was created in 1785, he immediately applied to become the county lieutenant, but that office had apparently already been promised to someone else. Marshall applied for appointment as deputy lieutenant, and received the appointment.|$|E

5|$|As {{the college}} {{prepared}} for independence in 1953, Madgwick {{and his staff}} discussed establishing a farm-related degree program distinctive from the veterinary science degree offered at the University of Sydney. Madgwick journeyed to England and the United States to consult with agriculturalists, veterinarians, and specialists in animal husbandry. While Madgwick was gone, his deputy warden, James Belshaw, read a <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australian Veterinary Journal from Gordon McClymont, a researcher in animal nutrition for the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, which advocated {{the establishment of a}} multi-disciplinary approach to farm science combining animal husbandry and agronomy.|$|E
5|$|Blaine and {{his wife}} and daughters sailed for Europe in June 1887, visiting England, Ireland, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, and finally Scotland, where they stayed at the summer home of Andrew Carnegie. While in France, Blaine {{wrote a letter to the}} New-York Tribune criticizing Clevelandâ€™s plans to reduce the tariff, saying that free trade with Europe would {{impoverish}} American workers and farmers. The family returned to the United States in August 1887. His <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tribune had raised his political profile even higher, and by 1888 Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, both former opponents, urged Blaine to run against Cleveland again. Opinion within the party was overwhelmingly in favor of renominating Blaine.|$|E
5|$|Darby denied {{involvement}} with the murder, claiming that New Court partisans such as Francis P. Blair and Amos Kendall were seeking to defame him. He also countered that Eliza Sharp's letter to the New Court Argus was written by New Court supporters, including Kendall, the newspaper's editor. The claims and counterclaims {{between the two sides}} reached such an extreme that an 1826 <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New Court Argus suggested that New Court supporters had instigated Sharp's murder in order to blame Old Court partisans and affix a stigma to them.|$|E

5|$|In 1761 John Griffin {{published}} a <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> London Chronicle recommending methods for entering the Camel estuary during rough weather, particularly while north-northwest winds were blowing {{and described the}} bolts and rings he had fixed to the cliffs to assist ships trying to enter the harbour. Mooring rings were still there in 1824, and around 1830, three capstans {{at the base of}} the cliffs and bollards along the cliffs, by which means boats could be warped safely past the bar were installed.|$|E
5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|In early 1932, {{a letter}} Rhoads {{had written in}} November 1931, which disparaged Puerto Ricans and claimed he had killed and {{intentionally}} injected cancer cells into his patients, was given by a lab assistant to Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. He publicized the <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Puerto Rican and American media, {{which led to a}} scandal, an official investigation, and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests. In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague. Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community found evidence of his or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal was forgotten.|$|E

5|$|Kingdom Plantae {{belongs to}} Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is {{separately}} classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The scientific {{name of a}} plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination {{is the name of}} the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).|$|E
5|$|Many {{thousands}} of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better {{when they arrived at}} the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Times on 14 October triggered Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, to approach Florence Nightingale to form a detachment of nurses to be sent to the hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Ronald Hutton {{stated that}} the Mari Lwyd tradition appeared to have become defunct in the early 20th century. In {{the middle of that}} century it was revived in Llangynwyd. In 1967, Lois Blake published a <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> journal English Dance and Song in which she noted that the Mari Lwyd appeared each Christmas Eve at the Barley Mow Inn at Graig Penllyn, near Cowbridge, where a man named John Williams had kept the custom alive for the past sixty years. Blake also explained that she believed that the custom was still performed at several villages in the Maesteg area of Glamorgan. During the 1970s, Hole commented that the tradition was still found in Glamorganshire and Carmathenshire.|$|E

5|$|In season six, it is {{revealed}} that Jenny is dead. The series then reverts {{three months before}} the incident, picking up from the previous series finale. Shane's ex-girlfriend Molly Kroll (Clementine Ford) gives Jenny a letter of apology addressed to Shane. Jenny hides the letter so Shane will not find it.

5|$|The core game {{is based}} on Hangman. Each round has a {{category}} and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> answer, and punctuation revealed as needed. Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this list has evolved {{over the course of}} the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding the words in the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving all the words in the crossword. The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round. Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping.|$|E
5|$|The {{most egregious}} episode during the Red Summer was a vicious attack on blacks in Elaine, Arkansas, in which nearly 200 blacks were murdered. Reports {{coming out of}} the South blamed the blacks, alleging that they were conspiring to take over the government. Infuriated with the distortions, Du Bois {{published}} a <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New York World, claiming that the only crime the black sharecroppers had committed was daring to challenge their white landlords by hiring an attorney to investigate contractual irregularities.The sharecroppers were working with the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America. Over 60 of the surviving blacks were arrested and tried for conspiracy, in the case known as Moore v. Dempsey. Du Bois rallied blacks across America to raise funds for the legal defense, which, six years later, resulted in a Supreme Court victory authored by Oliver Wendell Holmes. Although the victory had little immediate impact on justice for blacks in the South, it marked the first time the Federal government used the 14th amendment guarantee of due process to prevent states from shielding mob violence.|$|E
