5|$|Because of the {{strength}} and commitment of these survivors and their families, the <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> has finally been broken and the shadow has been lifted... Instead of being forgotten, because of their testimony, the Rosewood story is known across our state and across our nation. This legislation assures that the tragedy of Rosewood will never be forgotten by the generations to come.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} of discovery depend {{very much on}} the level of aggressiveness of the civilization interacting with humanity, its ethics, and how much human and extraterrestrial biologies have in common. These factors will govern the quantity and type of dialogue that can take place. The question of whether contact is physical or through electromagnetic signals will also govern the magnitude of the long-term {{implications of}} contact. In the case of communication using electromagnetic signals, the <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> between the reception of one message and another would mean that the content of any message would particularly affect the consequences of contact, as would the extent of mutual comprehension.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand cricketer Warren Lees {{recounted the}} underarm {{incident}} on New Zealand's 20/20 current affairs show, on Thursday 17 February 2005. He {{said that after}} the affair there was a <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> in the dressing room, which was broken suddenly and unexpectedly by fellow player Mark Burgess smashing a tea cup.|$|E

25|$|The {{context of}} the sonnets vary, but the first 126, amongst which sonnet 54 is found, are {{addressed}} {{to a young man}} of good social status and profess the narrator's platonic love. The love is returned, and the young man seems to yearn for the sonnets, as seen in sonnets 100-103 where the narrator apologizes for the <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> However, Berryman suggests {{that it is impossible to}} determine how the relationship ended up. While theories exist that the sonnets were written as literary exercises, H. C. Beeching suggests that they were written for a patron and not originally intended to be published together.|$|E
25|$|After Attlee and Greenwood left, Chamberlain asked whom {{he should}} {{recommend}} to the King as his successor. The {{version of events}} given by Churchill is that Chamberlain's preference for Halifax was obvious (Churchill implies that the spat between Churchill and the Labour benches the previous night {{had something to do}} with that); there was a <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> which Halifax eventually broke by saying he did not believe he could lead the government effectively as a member of the House of Lords instead of the House of Commons. Churchill's version gets the date wrong, and he fails to mention the presence of David Margesson, the government Chief Whip.|$|E
25|$|Gus {{leaves the}} room {{to get a drink}} of water in the bathroom, and the dumbwaiter's {{speaking}} tube whistles (a sign that there is a person on the other end who wishes to communicate). Ben listens carefully—we gather from his replies that their victim has arrived and {{is on his way to}} the room. Ben shouts for Gus, who is still out of the room. The door that the target is supposed to enter from flies open, Ben rounds on it with his gun, and Gus enters, stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, tie and gun. There is a <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> as the two stare at each other before the curtain comes down.|$|E

30|$|Patients {{sometimes}} {{pause for}} a long time while answering a question. They do not use fillers during these long periods, and the interviewers did not interrupt these periods of silence. We hypothesized that these pauses may correspond to moments when the subject is retrieving information which is expected to be longer for the Alzheimer’s patients. Similarly, confusion may also lead to <b>long</b> <b>silences.</b> The rate of such long hesitation events, defined as silences longer than approximately one second, is used to detect the disease. This feature is computed as the ratio of the total count of <b>long</b> <b>silences</b> to the total number of words.|$|R
50|$|His unique flute style {{earned him}} All-Ireland {{champion}} titles in 1956 and 1957. It {{is characterized by}} strong rhythmic flow with sparse ornamentation, occasionally punctuated by unusually <b>long</b> <b>silences</b> which emphasize the rhythmic structure of the tunes.|$|R
25|$|That {{evening he}} played {{what he had}} written so far to {{a small group of}} Leningrad musicians. After Shostakovich {{finished}} the first movement, there was a <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> An air-raid warning sounded. No one moved. Everyone wanted to hear the piece again. The composer excused himself to take his family to the nearest air-raid shelter. When he returned, he repeated the first movement, which then was followed by the next movement for his guests. Their reaction encouraged him to start that night on the Adagio. He completed this movement on 29 September in the city. Shostakovich and his family were then evacuated to Moscow on 1 October 1941. They moved to Kuybyshev (now Samara) on 22 October, where the symphony was finally completed.|$|E

2500|$|Rubinstein was as {{well known}} during his {{lifetime}} for his sarcasm {{as well as his}} sometimes penetrating insight. [...] During one of Rubinstein's visits to Paris, French pianist Alfred Cortot played the first movement of Beethoven's Appassionata for him.

2500|$|On September 8, 2006, Howard Stern's Eddie Van Halen live {{interview}} {{broke the}} band's <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> Eddie {{said he was}} willing to reunite with Roth and revealed a solo album in the works. Anthony's departure was confirmed with Eddie's son, Wolfgang, taking his role. Wolfgang had played bass guitar alongside his father on some 2004 concerts. When queried about The Other Half tour, Eddie said Anthony could [...] "do what he wants" [...] now. This shocked and offended many fans. In November, Eddie's spokesperson, Janie Liszewski, claimed the Van Halen family was writing/rehearsing for a summer 2007 tour, which Billboard magazine's website shortly confirmed. However, the Van Halen website remained in the state it had been in since the Hagar reunion.|$|E
2500|$|Tommaso Buscetta, {{moved by}} the deaths of Falcone and Borsellino, decided to break his <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> on ties between {{politics}} and Cosa Nostra. He acknowledged that he had known Lima since the late 1950s. On November 16, 1992, Buscetta testified before the Antimafia Commission presided by Luciano Violante about the links between Cosa Nostra and Salvo Lima and Giulio Andreotti. He indicated Salvo Lima as the contact of the Mafia in Italian politics. [...] "Salvo Lima was, in fact, the politician to whom Cosa Nostra turned most often to resolve problems for the organisation whose solution lay in Rome," [...] Buscetta testified. Other collaborating witnesses confirmed that Lima had been specifically ordered to [...] "fix" [...] {{the appeal of the}} Maxi Trial with Italy's Court of Cassation and had been murdered because he failed to do so.|$|E

Then Victoria would close the volume, and fall to dreaming, too.|$|R
50|$|He {{began to}} lapse into <b>long</b> <b>silences</b> {{at the age}} of two, and the next year he was {{diagnosed}} with autism. His IQ is purported to be 53.

In 1999, he had his own solo exhibition at the KS Art gallery in New York City.|$|R
50|$|The Broken Giant is a 1998 American drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Estep Nagy, and stars John Glover, Brooke Smith and Will Arnett.

The soundtrack was released as Songs Put Together For (The Broken Giant) by Will Oldham in 1996.|$|R

On May 12, Clemens broke a <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> to denounce a heavily researched expose by four [...] investigative reporters from the New York Daily News, called [...] Clemens went on ESPN's Mike and Mike show to call the book [...] "garbage", but a review by Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times called the book [...] "gripping" [...] and compared it to the work of Bob Woodward.|$|E
2500|$|Rao's {{involvement}} in the nationalist movement is reflected {{in his first two}} books. [...] The novel Kanthapura (1938) was an account of the impact of Gandhi's teaching on nonviolent resistance against the British. The story is seen {{from the perspective of a}} small Mysore village in South India. [...] Rao borrows the style and structure from Indian vernacular tales and folk-epic. [...] Rao returned to the theme of Gandhism in the short story collection The Cow of the Barricades (1947). The Serpent and the Rope (1960) was written after a <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> during which Rao returned to India. The work dramatised the relationships between Indian and Western culture. The serpent in the title refers to illusion and the rope to reality. Cat and Shakespeare (1965) was a metaphysical comedy that answered philosophical questions posed in the earlier novels.|$|E
2500|$|The Australian press {{attacked}} the team, {{and called for}} changes, including the omission of the captain, Johnson. Acerbic cricket pundit and former Test cricketer and team-mate Sid Barnes called Johnson [...] "Australia's non-playing captain". [...] Bill Ferguson, the Australian team's scorer, was also critical: [...] "Had Johnson been told by his friends in the press that he was, in fact, a passenger, he might have pondered on the advisability of standing down. [...] There {{would have been no}} shame in standing down." [...] Johnson, Miller and Gil Langley were the tour selectors. Langley and Miller were willing to omit Johnson, but only if the captain volunteered to stand aside. Johnson did not volunteer, so the others did not discuss the topic. The only change occurred when Miller proposed the replacement of Peter Burge with Ian Craig. This change came after a <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> between the trio as they waited for the others to bring up Johnson's form. Writing after the tour, Miller stated [...] "Privately I thought that [...] was not a form selection. [...] On the other hand, I did not think it wise to change skippers in midstream." [...] Miller and Johnson had both been appointed as Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours, and between the Tests they attended their formal investiture.|$|E
