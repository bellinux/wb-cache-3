The Wreck <b>Master's</b> <b>Farm</b> is also known as Jens Thomsen's farm, in remembrance of a former owner - and the first wreck master of Rubjeg Knude - who overtook the place from his father in 1838. The place has been on the hands of the Thomsen family since 1814, when Jens' father Thomas, acquired the farm and it is now owned by the great-great grandson of Jens.|$|R
