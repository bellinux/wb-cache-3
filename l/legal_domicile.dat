40|$|India’s {{system of}} {{separate}} Hindu, Muslim, and Christian family laws is often {{cast as a}} threat to national unity. In contrast, I argue that Indian law was structured by the emphasis of English law on preserving the marriage tie and wives’ legal dependence on their husbands. Based on a study of judicial and bureaucratic decisions about families in Indian law,I show that a patriarchal English family structure based in coverture influenced Indian women’s experiences of the law {{at least as much as}} religious norms did. I focus on three <b>legal</b> devices: <b>domicile,</b> restitution of conjugal rights, and maintenance. I argue that “law of the family” is a better category with which to consider women’s rights than “family law. ” “Law of the family” suggests the ways in which family statuses structured many aspects of Indian law, including those concerned with family disputes as well as matters such as citizenship. The dissertation is divided into two parts. The first part studies bureaucratic and judicial decisions about the status of wives and sons in Indian citizenship law. Through the <b>legal</b> device of <b>domicile,</b> coverture structured Indian citizenship law. The second part is based in a survey of matrimonial litigation in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh between 1939 and 1972. Litigants of all religious communities used restitution of conjugal rights suits and maintenance suits to seek marital redress even after important statutory reforms such as the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act (1939) and the Hindu Marriage Act (1955). Courts ruled in favor of wives without condemning marital violence. An individual wife could win her suit without necessarily challenging the patriarchal structure of marriage. Wives faced difficulties in proving matrimonial violence and often won their suits on the grounds of more easily proved social offenses. Husbands often challenged wives with arguments about both geographic and religious jurisdiction, in a pattern found in England as well. The dissertation concludes with a study of the 1962 UP Amendment to the Hindu Marriage Act, which made cruelty a ground for divorce in the state, providing a model for national reform fourteen years later...|$|R
40|$|European Private International Law - Domicile and Brussels I Regulation Abstract It is undisputable, {{that the}} Council Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 on {{jurisdiction}} and the {{recognition and enforcement}} of judgments in civil and commercial matters, the so-called Brussels I Regulation, constitutes {{the cornerstone of the}} European Private International Law. The term domicile, employed as the most important connecting factor for the determination of jurisdiction under the Brussels I Regulation, is the key word thereof. Domicile as such is a very interesting, although complicated, legal concept. This holds true even in the case of domicile for the purposes of Brussels I Regulation. At the European level, the tradition of domicile, being the connecting factor in most cases of the determination of jurisdiction, was established by the Brussels Convention. Nevertheless, it did not provide for a uniform definition. Instead, it referred to the national laws of the then contracting states. By adopting, with an exception, a uniform definition of a <b>legal</b> person's <b>domicile,</b> the Brussels I Regulation has partially deviated from this practice. However, as regards the natural person's domicile, the reference to the national laws of the European Union Member States was upheld. As the understanding of this concept differs from [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{emerging}} market credit linked note, also sometimes called a “clean,” are traded by buy side clients {{to gain access}} to local debt markets for several reasons. First is that a direct investment in the sovereign debt may not be <b>legal</b> due to <b>domicile</b> restrictions of the country. One instance would be the local government requiring the purchaser of debt to have a business office in the country. Another instance would be tax restrictions or tariffs in countries with NDF currencies. A fund in USD would have difficulty repatriating the currency if local restrictions or taxes made it undesirable. When this occurs, the sell side global bank purchases the debt and structures it into a derivative note then issued to the client or clients. The client then owns the issued security which derives its total return from the underlying instrument. A CDS, credit default swap, is embedded in the instrument. It {{can be thought of as}} a fully funded total return swap where the underlying asset total return is exchanged for a funding fee as well as the cost of the issued CLN. From a market risk perspective owning a CLN is almost identical to owning the local debt.|$|R
