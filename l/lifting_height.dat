40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the effect of <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> and mass lifted on the peak low back load in terms of net moments, compression forces and anterior-posterior shear forces. Ten participants had to lift a box using four handle heights. Low back loading was quantified using a dynamic 3 -D linked segment model and a detailed electromyographic driven model of the trunk musculature. The effects of <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> and lifting mass were quantified using a regression technique (GEE) for correlated data. Results indicate that an increase in <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> and a decrease in lifting mass were related to a decrease in low back load. It is argued that trunk flexion is a major contributor to low back load. For ergonomic interventions it can be advised to prioritise optimisation of the vertical location of the load to be lifted rather than decreasing the mass of the load for handle heights between 32 cm and 155 cm, and for load masses between 7. 5 and 15 kg. <b>Lifting</b> <b>height</b> and load mass are important determinants of low back load during manual materials handling. This paper provides the quantitative effect of <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> and mass lifted, the results of which can be used by ergonomists at the workplace to evaluate interventions regarding <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> and load mass...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. One {{of basic}} {{elements}} of band bucket elevators is their drive. For determination of power drive {{it is necessary to}} conduct calculations on standard by methods, in what it is needed to expend enough time. One of project parameters is productivity of elevator. It is necessary to build parametric dependence of power drive of elevator on its design capacity that takes into account a type and descriptions of load, <b>lifting</b> <b>height,</b> standard sizes and parameters of buckets and tapes. Methodology. Using the method of hauling calculation of band buckets elevators, the parametric dependences of power drive of high-speed elevators are built with deep and shallow buckets from their productivity at fixed type of load and height of getting up. Findings. It is set {{on the basis of the}} built parametric dependences that the change function of a size of elevator power from design capacity (at fixed to the <b>lifting</b> <b>height,</b> load type, rate of tape movement) is piecewise and droningly increasing. The intervals of project values of productivity, which provide the permanent size of elevator power drive are certain in a general view. As the example of application of the recived results the construction process of power drive dependence from design capacity of elevator of shotblasting room, which is intended for transporting of the metallic shot using for consolidating of carriage springs, is considered.

40|$|Purpose. One of {{the main}} {{elements}} of the inclined belt bucket elevators is their drive. To determine the drive power, it is necessary to carry out calculations according to standard methods, which are described in the modern literature. The basic design parameters are the productivity, <b>lifting</b> <b>height,</b> type and properties of the transported material, the angle of inclination. It is necessary to build a parametric dependence of the driving power of the elevator on its design parameters, which takes into account the standard sizes and types of buckets and belts. Methodology. Using the methodology of traction calculation of inclined belt bucket elevator there were built parametric dependences of efforts in specific points of the route of the elevator, as well as the parametric dependences of the drive power of high-speed elevators with deep and shallow buckets on their design parameters and characteristics. Findings. On the basis of constructed parametric dependencies, {{it was found that the}} function of changing the value of the elevator’s power from design capacity (at fixed <b>lifting</b> <b>height,</b> type of cargo, belt speed) is piecewise constant and monotonically increasing. It was built a graphical representation of elevator drive power on the angle of its inclination within acceptable limits of change. The resulting relationship is non-linear and monotonically decreasing. In general terms the intervals of project performance values, which provide a constant value of drive power of inclined elevator were defined. As an example of the obtained results it was observed the process of dependence construction of the drive power on design capacity and inclination angle of the elevator for transporting the fine coal.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the work was to {{describe}} the physical principles of impulse pumping and investigate its potential applications in petroleum engineering. Investigations of the potential applications of impulse pumping were based on analysis of head, flow rate and efficiency performances for pumping of hydrocarbon fluids. The secondary purpose of the work was to analyse pressure wave propagation and attenuation models in fluid-filled production tubings. Additionally, one dimensional numerical simulation methods were investigated for accurate modelling of pressure transient events in pipelines, such as water hammer phenomena. Pressure wave propagation, transmission and reflection characteristics were first studied. Finite volume methods were also studied for numerical simulation of one-dimensional pressure transient phenomena. Accuracy of pressure wave attenuation models was then analysed using a contradiction method, relying on analysis of numerical simulation tools for pressure transient events. Impulse pumping physical principles were next described using fundamentals of pressure wave propagation. A numerical simulation tool was then developed to reproduce impulse pumping physical principles, using a finite volume numerical scheme. Impulse pumping performances were modelled afterwards in terms of lifting heights, flow rates and efficiency, based on results from the developed numerical simulation tool. Potential applications of impulse pumping in petroleum engineering were then analysed using the performance model. Impulse pumping generates flow from bottomhole to wellhead using pressure waves generated at wellhead. Fluid can be transported from bottomhole to wellhead without theoretical <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> limitations using impulse pumping. Impulse pumping performances were illustrated and a range of petroleum engineering applications was investigated. Impulse pumping greatest efficiency is obtained for artificial lift of water from shallow wells. Impulse pumping performances depend on pressure wave amplitude, wellhead pressure, <b>lifting</b> <b>height,</b> fluid compressibility and volume occupied in the production tubing.
