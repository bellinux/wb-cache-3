500|$|Reviewers echoed {{that while}} the mission served as {{political}} commentary {{on the use of}} torture by the United States government, its use of torture was in poor taste. IGN's Keza MacDonald felt the torture sequence [...] "pushed the boundaries of taste" [...] and Polygons Chris Plante commented: [...] "The script plays it for <b>laughs.</b> <b>I</b> felt nauseated". Carolyn Petit of GameSpot felt that placing the torture scene in context with the monologue created a hypocrisy in the mission's function as a commentary device. In an editorial, Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer discussed whether the political commentary was overshadowed by the violent content and compared the mission to s [...] "No Russian" [...] controversy. He said that the close-up camera and quick time events accentuated the sequence's impact beyond the violence depicted in previous Grand Theft Auto games. Summarising its function as [...] "flawed", he considered the sequence lacking enough context to justify its violence.|$|E

I just broke off all relations with him. He is indeed a very good scriptwriter though." ...|$|E

It was good stuff, a lot of good songs, but, just, the lunacy factor was... gone." [...] After his dismissal from the band, Cale was replaced by Doug Yule, a singer, bassist and organist.|$|E

5000|$|We {{were never}} really {{happy with the}} {{production}} on that album. I think the songs on the album were good, but I definitely wouldn't rank the album overall in amongst our top five albums ever. We were all very confused {{by a lot of}} things going on around us at the time, hence the cover! (<b>Laughs)</b> <b>I</b> think they were pretty grim times, and I think that's reflected on the rather dour tone of the songs. Practically all of us were on prescribed drugs at that time! (<b>Laughs)</b> <b>I</b> was taking such strong anti-depressantsat the time that I didn't really know what was going on at the time. The artwork for the album is a classic example where our brains were at the time. There were just bees in my head! (<b>Laughs)</b> <b>I</b> have no idea what that cover was supposed to represent. On a personal level, Believe In Nothing represented a really dark time in my life. I don't think anything positive comes out of being depressed or down like that. My personal life was kind of in a bad way at that time, and I think that album is a direct result of that. I know a lot of people really love that album, and I think that's great. But for me, I think the most disappointing element is the production, which I think could have been punchier, and the feelings the album conjures up. From Host through to Believe In Nothing, we didn't really kind of know where we were going. We were really in a dilemma. Nick Holmes ...|$|E
