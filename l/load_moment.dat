In the author’s opinion, Spot Welding Procedures Chart D. 1 (hereafter {{referred}} to as Figure D. 1) in Appendix D of International Standard ISO 15609 - 5 [1] is not accurate in principle.

In addition, two important reasons equally considered to advance <b>loading</b> <b>moment</b> of forging force are: (1) different spot welding equipments have different response time for welding pressure; (2) electric response speed is faster than that of mechanical or pneumatic mechanism, that is to say, response speed of current shall be faster than implementation speed of forging force. Is this paper, we discuss such above-mentioned kinds of different situations. We suggest advancing the forging force in Figure D. 1 to the maintenance course of welding current.

40|$|Abstract – In general Reinforced {{concrete}} slab type deck are {{often referred to}} as culverts and are commonly used for small spans. This type of super structure is economical for spans up to 8 m. for longer spans reinforced concrete continuous bridges are generally adopted for longer multiple spans. The bridge deck comprises either the solid slab, Tee beam and slab or box girders continuous over several spans. Continuous solid slab bridges are economical for shorter spans while Tee beam and slab continuous bridges are economical in the span range of 10 to 35 meters. The object of the present work is to convert the simply supported bridges into continuous bridges and then to compare the behavior of continuous bridges with that of simply supported bridges. For this purpose six cases of simply supported are considered. To study the comparison with simply supported bridges, the bending moments developed in continuous bridges are considerably less and consequently smaller sections can be adopted resulting in economy of steel and concrete. The ultimate moment capacity of continuous bridge deck is greater than that of simply supported decks due to the phenomenon of redistribution of moments in continuous structures. Observation shows that up to 6 m span dead <b>load</b> <b>moments</b> are @ 63 % of live <b>load</b> <b>moments</b> and at 8 m span theses are almost equal. At 10 m and 12 m spans dead <b>load</b> <b>moments</b> are 1. 50 times and 2. 40 times of that of dead <b>load</b> <b>moments</b> respectively. Therefore from slab design view point it is better to go for continuous two or three spans in multiple of 4 m, 5 m and 6 m. Present work provides at least two continuous spans may be taken in place of single span when bridge length i...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is {{to determine the effects of}} constraining the horizontal distance of the feet from the load on the posture adopted at the start of the lift. Kinematic data were collected while each of 24 subjects lifted 3, 6, and 9 kg loads from a starting height 18 cm above the ground. The position of the feet was controlled relative to the load such that the horizontal distance from the hand to the ankle at the start of extension was either 20, 40, or 60 cm. Subjects performed 20 trials in each of six combinations of load and ankle-load distance chosen to provide three sets of equivilent <b>load</b> <b>moment</b> pairs. The initial horizontal distance from the load to the ankle had a large influence on the posture adopted to lift the load. Ankle and knee flexion, in particular, were reduced when the ankle-load distance was smaller, and particularly so when the distance was reduced to 20 cm. Hip flexion was reduced to a smaller extent, while lumbar vertebral flexion remained relatively unchanged. The inclination of the trunk at the start of the lift was unchanged when the ankle-load distance was 60 or 40 cm, but was 10 degrees greater when the load was 20 cm from the ankles, indicating that subjects adopted a posture closer to a stoop when the ankle-load distance was small. Comparison of conditions of equal <b>load</b> <b>moment</b> (but different load mass and ankle-load distance) revealed differences which mirrored the effects of ankle-load distance alone, suggesting that the effects of ankle-load distance on the posture adopted at the start of extension were largely independent of the <b>load</b> <b>moment.</b> While the forces and torques required to lift a load must be to some extent dependent on the <b>load</b> <b>moment,</b> rather than load or ankle-load distance per se, the posture adopted to lift the load is not...|$|E

There are currently three methods used for deck design: empirical method, traditional method and finite element method. This research investigated and compared the steel reinforcement ratios and the stress developed in the reinforcing steel for the three different methods of deck design. This study included analysis of 15 bridge models that met the FDOT standards. The main beams were designed and load rated using commercial software to obtain live load deflections. The bridges were checked to verify that they met the empirical method conditions based on the FDOT Structures Design Guidelines – January 2009. The reinforced concrete decks were designed using the traditional design method. Then the bridges were analyzed using three-dimensional linear finite element models with moving live loads. The reinforced concrete decks were designed using dead <b>load</b> <b>moment,</b> live <b>load</b> <b>moment,</b> and future wearing surface moment obtained from the finite element models.

Second, logistic regression models were developed based on a study of 10 male and 10 female subjects that showed relative hand load greater than 34 % of maximal strength motivated subjects to reach and grasp cylinders using underhand posture (rather than overhand), and relative hand load as low as 24 % motivated subjects to hold the objects (for about 8 s) using palm grip at shoulder height (vs. hook grip at mid-thigh height). The relative hand load threshold increased to 53 % for selecting underhand over overhand posture for placing the objects. Third, a study of relative finger loads for 6 male and 6 female subjects lifting cylinders showed that selection of hand posture {{is related to the}} preference of reducing thumb and fingertip forces and joint loads. Subjects demonstrated strong preferences of underhand over overhand grasp, and hook grip over pinch to lift cylinders, while thumb tip and sum of fingertip forces can be reduced up to 60 % by selecting the preferred postures. Biomechanical models predicted overhand thumb and finger normal forces similar to data if friction was considered, while predicting about 2 times of measured normal forces if friction force was assumed zero. Fourth, finger force distribution and placement were determined for 6 males and 6 females holding unbalanced plate objects. The thumb and finger center-of-force (CoF) locations were generally aligned with the <b>load</b> <b>moment</b> arm. The distance between thumb and finger CoF locations increased by 39 % as <b>load</b> <b>moment</b> increased from 0. 98 Nm to 2. 35 Nm, and reduced by 17 % as hand length increased from 16. 2 cm to 21. 1 cm when the plate was held horizontally.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 A major {{barrier to}} air travel {{for people with}} disabilities is the general lack of {{accessible}} lavatories on board commercial passenger aircraft. A primary reason for this lack of greater accessibility is related to space. To design an airplane lavatory that is accessible, minimizes the risk of injury to both the transferor and transferee to the extent possible, and is still consistent with the restrictive spatial requirements of airplane environments requires a broader understanding as to how the relative angle of the wheelchair to the toilet affects assisted toilet transfers. This study investigated how the wheelchair-to-toilet angle affects both the spatial consumption required for assisted toilet transfers and the risk of injury to the transferor and transferee. Twenty-nine participants (transferors) were motion captured in a laboratory environment while conducting assisted toilet transfers using a pivot transfer technique at relative wheelchair-to-toilet angles of 0 º, 45 º, 90 º, and 180 º. A 95 th percentile male dummy represented the transferee. A novel, three-dimensional computer-based spatial mapping technique was developed to compute the spatial volume requirements of assisted toilet transfers from the motion capture data. The wheelchair-to-toilet angle directly affected the total spatial volume needed to conduct an assisted toilet transfer. The total rectangular area required to perform an assisted toilet transfer using a pivot transfer technique progressively increased as the wheelchair-to-toilet angle rose from 0 º to 180 º. However, the three-dimensional volume required for an assisted transfer differs between transfer angles, is non-rectangular, and varies in spatial area over the height of the transfer volume. The wheelchair-to-toilet angle also affected the magnitude of the transferor's kinematic risk factors for lower back disorder. Eight of the fourteen analyzed kinematic risk factors for lower back disorder were affected. Of these risk factors, the wheelchair-to-toilet angle primarily affected the transferor's odds of being at high risk of lower back disorder through its effect on the transferor's maximum <b>load</b> <b>moment</b> arm. Surprisingly, the magnitude of the transferor's maximum <b>load</b> <b>moment</b> arm was inversely related to the wheelchair-to-toilet angle. After accounting for the effects of the wheelchair-to-toilet angle and the direction of assisted transfer, associations were also found between the transferor's kinematic risk factors for lower back disorder and the transferor's standing height. The {{results of this study suggest}} that accessible lavatories can be designed for use in constrained environments by designing the lavatory to support assisted transfers at a single optimal wheelchair-to-toilet angle. The results further suggest that, in using a pivot transfer technique, the 180 º orientation is an optimal transfer orientation. Finally, it is suggested that transferors short in stature and physically capable of conducting assisted transfers should be preferentially selected to assist in assisted transfers, as they are predicted to have a lower risk of lower back disorder than taller transferors. This study investigated how the wheelchair-to-toilet angle affects both the spatial consumption required for assisted toilet transfers and the risk of injury to the transferor and transferee.

The nature of change in the regression line, with change in <b>loading</b> <b>moment,</b> gives rise {{to the idea of a}} variable phase shift between the first and second harmonics...|$|R
30|$|A {{computer}} program is developed {{based on the}} finite element method to analyze the soil-strip footing system under consideration using the above methodology. The developed program is able to calculate vertical displacements, rotations, shear forces, bending moments, contact pressure, nodes reactions. The analysis procedure is general enough {{to take into account}} different lengths, diameters, and stiffness of granular piles, any arrangements of granular piles and any types of external loads acting on the strip footing (i.e., concentrated loads, uniformly and non-uniformly distributed <b>loads</b> and <b>moment</b> <b>loads).</b>|$|R
