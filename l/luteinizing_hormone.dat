5|$|Deficiency of <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormone</b> (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to}} as the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.|$|E
5|$|Ovulation is {{the second}} phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses release of <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormone</b> (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|The hormones of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} {{actions in the}} body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormone</b> (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency {{is more common in}} people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{fluctuations}} {{that contribute}} to cyclical attacks in women have been treated with oral contraceptives and <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormones</b> to shut down menstrual cycles. However, oral contraceptives have also triggered photosensitivity and withdrawal of oral contraceptives has triggered attacks. Androgens and fertility hormones have also triggered attacks.|$|R

40|$|Adhesion {{of group}} B streptococci to {{epithelial}} {{cells of the}} human vagina proved to be type dependent and to fluctuate during the menstrual cycle with a maximum near the time of ovulation. Oral contraception completely abolished the observed cyclic changes. Reduced serum levels of <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormones</b> (less than 5 mIU/ml) and of follicle-stimulating hormone (less than 10 mIU/ml) were associated with a 10 -fold reduction in adhesion of B streptococci to vaginal cells...|$|R
5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormone</b> (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormone</b> (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E
5|$|Neurocognitive {{symptoms}}, such as fatigue, mood disturbances, {{and other}} related symptoms are common sequelae. Even in those who have made good neurological recovery, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive impairment are common; 46 {{percent of people who}} have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage have cognitive impairment that affects their quality of life. Over 60 percent report frequent headaches. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, two areas of the brain that {{play a central role in}} hormonal regulation and production. More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop hypopituitarism (deficiencies in one or more of the hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as growth hormone, <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormone,</b> or follicle-stimulating hormone).|$|E
40|$|Androgen {{deprivation}} therapy by bilateral orchiectomy (surgical castration) or <b>luteinizing</b> hormone-releasing <b>hormone</b> agonist therapy (medical castration) {{is recommended}} for advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.

5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormone</b> during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormone</b> or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{and maintenance of}} the seminal vesicles, {{as well as their}} secretion and size/weight, are highly dependent on androgens. The seminal vesicles contain 5α-reductase, which metabolizes testosterone into its much more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The seminal vesicles have also been found to contain <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormone</b> receptors, and hence may also be regulated by the ligand of this receptor, <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormone.</b>|$|E
40|$|Serum {{prolactin}} levels {{measured by}} specific radio-immunoassay were over 30 mug/l in {{seven out of}} 25 women with amenorrhoea and in eight women with the amenorrhoe-galactorrhoea syndrome. There was no apparent relationship between these levels and levels of follicle-stimulating <b>hormone,</b> <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormones,</b> and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Bromocriptine caused a transient fall in the proclatin levels in six out of seven cases, and in three menstruation and ovulation were restored.

50|$|The receptors for the RLN/INSL {{peptides}} are collectively called “Relaxin family peptide receptors (RXFPs)”. There are {{two distinct}} families of RXFPs, {{all of which}} are cell membrane-associated and coupled to G-proteins (known as G protein-coupled receptors or GPCRs). In humans there are 4 RXFP receptors: RXFP1 and RXFP2 are evolutionarily related to the receptors of follicle-stimulating and <b>luteinizing</b> <b>hormones</b> (FSH and LH, respectively), and are the cognate receptors for RLN and INSL3 respectively in humans. On the other hand, RXFP3 and RXFP4 are related to somatostatin et al. and, in humans, are the cognate receptors for RLN3 and INSL5. There is evidence that some relaxin hormones may also be able to interact with glucocorticoid-type nuclear receptors, which are found floating freely between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm.|$|R
