5|$|Further success {{followed}} in early 1777 with {{the capture of}} the 18-gun American privateer General Montgomery. News had reached England that this vessel was off the island of Madeira in March, having sailed from the Port of Philadelphia in February with a crew of 100 men. <b>Levant</b> was sent in pursuit, with her crew sighting the General Montgomery at midday on 8 March. Captain Murray ordered <b>Levant</b> to fly false colours, hoisting a Dutch flag to avoid alerting the privateer's crew. General Montgomery had also disguised herself by flying a British flag. For several hours the Americans allowed <b>Levant</b> to draw near, finally turning to flee when Murray fired a warning shot. A seven-hour chase ensued, extending into the night with the two ships often within musket shot but unable to bring their broadside cannons to bear. At around 1:00am the wind strengthened and <b>Levant</b> was able to overhaul her prey, forcing the out-gunned Americans to surrender. Nine of General Montgomerys crew enlisted aboard <b>Levant,</b> with the remainder being conveyed to Portsmouth where they remained imprisoned in poor conditions {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Mediterranean {{trade was}} busy, and <b>Levant</b> {{took part in}} halting and {{examining}} vessels with crews of various nationalities including Dutch, Genoese, Spanish, and the British Caribbean. Neutral shipping was permitted to continue on its way. However <b>Levant</b> detained a South Carolina merchantman named Dolphin in October 1776, on suspicion of being a supply vessel for the rebels, and sent her into Gibraltar along with her cargo of rice. In November 1776 <b>Levant</b> secured a substantial prize with the capture of another South Carolina vessel, Argo, carrying rice and indigo worth £37,200. Argo was to have exchanged her cargo in Bordeaux for clothing and medicine to supply the American rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Captain Murray {{then took}} <b>Levant</b> {{on a cruise}} to hunt for French or American vessels off Cadiz. While {{pursuing}} this task in June 1779 he ran across the Spanish battle fleet, comprising 32 ships {{of the line and}} two frigates, heading south towards an unknown destination. Spain was still nominally a neutral power and after a brief exchange of pleasantries the Spanish fleet left <b>Levant</b> unmolested and continued on its way. Murray immediately set sail for England to report that the Spanish were at sea, pausing off Land's End on 17 July to capture the French privateer La Revanche. <b>Levant</b> finally reached Portsmouth in late July but by this time Murray's news of the Spanish fleet was out of date; Spain had already declared war on Britain and her fleet had reached Gibraltar to commence an extended siege.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} results from {{implementation}} of <b>Levant’s</b> differentiator for velocity estimation from optical encoder readings. <b>Levant’s</b> differentiator is a {{sliding mode control}} theory-based real-time differentiation algorithm proposed as a velocity estimator. The application of the technique allows stable implementation of higher stiffness virtual walls as compared to using the common finite dif-ference method (FDM) cascaded with low-pass filters for velocity estimation. A single degree-of-freedom (DOF) linear haptic device {{is used as a}} test bed and an automated virtual wall hitting task is implemented to experimentally demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} extend the impedance-width (or Z-width) of a haptic interface via <b>Levant’s</b> differentiator...|$|R

In the interim <b>Levant</b> engaged and defeated a Spanish privateer whose crew {{were caught in the}} act of boarding a British merchant ship. A brief exchange of cannon fire holed the Spanish vessel below the waterline, sinking her; <b>Levant</b> rescued the majority of her crew and transported them to prison in Gibraltar.|$|E

In 1770 she {{returned to}} Deptford Dockyard where she was decommissioned and hauled out of the water for rebuilding. The work was granted to shipwright John Dudman and took six months from November 1770 to April 1771. Repair and rebuilding expenses were £5,869 with an additional £3,059 for fitting-out, amounting to considerably more than the vessel's original construction cost of £5,423.|$|E

40|$|In impedance-type haptic interfaces, {{encoders}} {{are typically}} em-ployed to provide high resolution position measurements from which velocity is estimated, most commonly via the finite differ-ence method (FDM). This velocity estimation technique performs reliably, unless very fast sampling is required, {{in which case}} noise or delay due to filtering of the position signals reduces accuracy in the estimate. Despite this limitation, FDM is attractive {{because it is a}} passive process, and therefore the passivity of the overall sys-tem can be guaranteed. <b>Levant’s</b> differentiator is a viable alterna-tive to FDM, and exhibits increased accuracy in velocity estimation at high sample rates compared to FDM. However, the passivity of this nonlinear velocity estimation technique cannot be shown us-ing conventional methods. In this paper, we employ a time do-main passivity framework to analyze and enforce passive behavior of <b>Levant’s</b> differentiator for haptic displays in discrete time. The performance of this approach is explored both in simulation and experimentally on a custom made one degree-of-freedom haptic in-terface. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the time domain passivity approach for compensating the active behavior observed with use of <b>Levant’s</b> differentiator for velocity estimation...|$|R
