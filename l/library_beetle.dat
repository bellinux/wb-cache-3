40|$|Beetle Blocks is a visual, blocks-based {{programming}} language/environment for 3 D {{design and}} fabrication, implemented {{on top of}} Berkeley Snap! and the ThreeJS 3 D graphics <b>library.</b> <b>Beetle</b> Blocks programs move a graphical beetle around a 3 D world, where it can place 3 D shapes, extrude its path as a tube and generate geometry in other ways. The resulting 3 D geometry can be exported as a 3 D-printable file. Beetle Blocks also aims to offer a cloud system and social platform meant to provide the community with ways to interact and learn from each other. Beetle Blocks was previously implemented as a Scratch extension, and migrated into Snap! in 2014. We explain how the project has evolved since this migration, and in particular how the advanced programming features it inherited from Snap! shaped the kind of designs that are now possible with the new system.

30|$|On {{its eastern}} side the Hall {{contains}} {{one of the}} most significant libraries in the National Trust, filled with Sir Richard Ellys’s books [13]. Ellys’s library was installed in 1745 in the Long Gallery [18], one of the finest rooms at Blickling with its elaborately decorated Jacobean plaster ceiling, has been the principle focus for content conservation for some years within the house. The library is known to suffer on and off from mould growth on leather and vellum book bindings, notably at the back of the books, where temperature may be lower due to radiant heat loss from the external walls. In the 1980 s, the presses were altered by extending the depth of the shelves so that ventilation holes could be drilled at the back of the shelves to facilitate ventilation behind the book stack and mitigate mould growth. However, occasional mould growth still occurs. Another significant issue within the <b>library</b> is deathwatch <b>beetle</b> infestation, of the textblock of books and wooden structural elements, especially at the North end of the library. This may be related to poor environmental conditions inside the library at this time, as well as past water ingress, such as flooding caused by failure of rainwater goods that was discovered in 1999. Water-soaked or decayed timber is vulnerable to insect attack [19 – 21]. Since these events, the National Trust has made considerable effort to prevent water ingress through repair and maintenance of the building fabric and rainwater goods. In the Long Gallery itself heating is used to prevent high humidity conditions that can encourage mould growth and insect infestation, aiming to keep indoor relative humidity level below about 60 %. The North East Turret is also subject to death watch beetle infestation, due to a long history of water ingress affecting its timbers. For all these reasons, with the aim of identifying and quantifying the environmental exposure, Blickling Hall was monitored between August 2012 and October 2014 using an extensive monitoring system, which is described in detail below. This paper summarizes the findings of this monitoring study and discusses the susceptibility of the building envelope to moisture-induced damage.|$|R
