This article suggests using a form-based approach for the assessment of discount schemes. However, this should not amount to a restrictive assessment of certain discount schemes.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the law and}} economics of <b>loyalty</b> <b>discounts.</b> While there have been recent advances in the economic analysis of <b>loyalty</b> <b>discounts,</b> this literature is still relatively recent and sparse. Though some of these papers provide tests that would serve to identify either deviations from short run profit maximization or, {{in the case of}} bundled discounts, a reduction in consumer welfare or the exclusion of a hypothetically equally efficient competitor, these tests have several shortcomings. As a result, the economic literature currently does not provide a reliable way to gauge whether the potential harm from the use of <b>loyalty</b> <b>discounts</b> would outweigh any demonstrable benefits from their use. A review of the major cases involving loyalty and other volume discounts suggests the following general observations. In the single product case, courts have consistently applied the “not easy to establish” two part test for predatory pricing set out by the Supreme Court in its Brooke Group decision. As a result, the courts have generally ruled that above-cost volume discounts, including those that use market share discounts and near exclusive thresholds, are lawful and do not violate the antitrust laws. In cases involving multimarket or bundled rebates, however, courts have not generally followed the Brooke Group Court’s presumption that above cost bundled discounts are presumptively legal. However, they have generally followed the Brooke Group Court’s focus on the actual facts or realities of the marketplace rather than on hypotheticals. Thus, while the lower courts have considered the theories and tests contained in the recent theoretical literature on <b>loyalty</b> <b>discounts,</b> they have generally refused to find liability absent sufficient proof that the conditions required by these tests apply, and that the underlying tests reflect market realities. This approach is consistent with the federal courts’ generally cautious approach to expanding Section 2 liability, and the recognition of the underdeveloped and untested state of the academic literature. Moreover, there are significant flaws in the two cases where courts have found use of bundled loyalty rebates to be unlawful. In SmithKline, the court did focus on data and concluded that an equally efficient competitor would have been excluded by the bundled discounts evaluated in the case. However, economic theory suggests that the court may have used a flawed standard, and should have instead focused on the fact that changes to the bundled rebate programs served to increase rather than decrease prices. And the court’s decision in LePage’s not only suggested use of the same flawed standard, it found liability without requiring sufficient proof that the standard even applied to the facts of the case...|$|R

If buyers incur firm specific costs or have shop specific tastes then competitive <b>loyalty</b> <b>discounts</b> lower consumer surplus overall and raise profits - {{the same is}} true of competitive volume discounts. Competition without these discounts causes all prices to be kept low as larger customers are targetted; with discounts the prices for heavy users drop, but more is extracted from small users.

Price discrimination is shown not to be the driving force behind the equilibrium prices - sellers price to steal customers from their rivals.

While nonlinear tariffs are an effective way for a monopolist to extract consumer surplus, when two suppliers compete using such schedules, the results are far more competitive in comparison to simple Bertrand–Nash competition with linear tariffs. This result holds when the product of each of the suppliers is attractive to a substantial portion of consumers.

40|$|For many {{goods and}} {{services}} such as electricity, healthcare, cellular-phone service, debit-card transactions, or those sold with <b>loyalty</b> <b>discounts,</b> {{the price of the}} next unit of service depends on past usage.

I develop a model of inattentive consumption, derive equilibrium pricing when consumers are inattentive, and evaluate bill-shock regulation requiring firms to disclose information that substitutes for attention. When inattentive consumers are sophisticated but heterogeneous in their expected demand, bill-shock regulation reduces social welfare in fairly-competitive markets, which may be the effect of the FCC’s recent bill-shock agreement. If some consumers are attentive while others naively fail to anticipate their own inattention, however, then bill-shock regulation increases social welfare and can benefit consumers. Hence requiring zero-balance alerts in addition to the Federal Reserve’s new opt-in rule for debit-card overdraft protection may benefit consumers...|$|R
40|$|Contracts between {{suppliers}} and customers frequently contain provisions rewarding the customer for exhibiting loyalty to the seller. For example, suppliers may offer customers preferential pricing for buying a specified percentage of their requirements from the supplier or buying minimum numbers of products across multiple product lines. Such loyalty-inducing contracts have come under attack on antitrust grounds because of their potential to foreclose competitors or soften competition by enabling tacit collusion among suppliers. This article defends loyalty inducement as a commercial practice. Although it can be anticompetitive under some circumstances, rewarding loyal customers is usually procompetitive and price- reducing. The two most severe attacks on <b>loyalty</b> discounting—that <b>loyalty</b> <b>discounts</b> are often disguised disloyalty penalties and that loyalty clauses soften competition—are unlikely to hold as a general matter.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} extent to which {{relationship}} marketing (RM) strategies were prevalent within the former NHS Internal Market and the determinants of such strategies. The research achieves its aims through the analysis of a postal survey of NHS Trust hospitals and District Health Authorities in England and case studies of the Warwickshire and Dudley health markets. The impetus for the research is the paucity of literature evaluating RM in the NHS context, resulting from the predominance of the traditional economics perspective on the purchaser - provider relationship. The latter is unable to systematically evaluate relational behaviour within quasi - markets given its adversarial contracting focus. Subsequently, the Relationship Marketing Paradigm is used to design a framework appropriate to evaluating relational oriented behaviour within the NHS Internal Market. To further investigate the determinants of NHS Trust hospital's RM strategies a series of hypotheses were developed and tested using Logit modelling techniques. These hypotheses sought to explain contract augmentation, contract customisation, <b>loyalty</b> <b>discounting,</b> default contracting and the use of cost - sharing contracts. In addition the case studies further examined the role of 'trust' within the purchaser - provider relationship through evaluation of contractual, competence and goodwill trust typologies. Equally, the case studies investigated the negative impact of RM strategies from the perspective of purchasers, providers and service users. The key conclusion is that RM was significantly more widespread than the literature suggests, indicating the centrality of relational oriented contracting. Furthermore, the nature of and determinants of the identified relationship marketing strategies were found to be mature and complex. Moreover, this weight of evidence questions Government policy's success in generating a competitive environment within the NHS Internal Market based upon adversarial contracting. To explore the likelihood of RM remaining an important phenomenon within the "new" NHS arrangements, evidence is drawn from the case studies and predictions from the Logit analysis...|$|R
