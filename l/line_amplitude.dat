The candidate features are then used with the ratio of a pair of single preevent and postevent SAR single-look amplitude images to estimate damage levels. The algorithm is very efficient, with overall computational complexity of $O(Nlog k) $ for an $N$-pixel image containing features of mean length $k$.

Therefore, {{it is important to}} determine the type of forest fire in the early detection based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to adopt the proper strategy to fight the fire.

From this data set, spatial maps corresponding to local spin density and maximum EPR spectral <b>line</b> <b>amplitude</b> are generated. A map of local EPR spectral linewidth is then computed. Because linewidth directly correlates with oxygen concentration, the linewidth image provides a map of oxygenation. This method avoids a difficulty inherent in other oxygen content mapping techniques using EPR, that is, the unwanted influence of local spin probe density on the image. We provide simulation results and data from phantom studies demonstrating the validity of this method. We then apply the method to map oxygen content in rat tail tissue and vasculature.

Simple machine models are presented that allow to staterelationships between the fault entity and the amplitude ofspecific spectrum lines in stator current or current space vector.

The roAp nature of the cool Ap star HD 122970 was established by Handler & Paunzen (1999), who found a main pulsational period of 11 : 09 min (f = 129 : 81427 c/d).

The contour-ordered polarization operator is computed {{in terms of}} the Green functions of the noninteracting system. We apply the proposed RPA-Keldysh scheme for studying Coulomb-modified Fano lines and dephasing effects in interferometers with side-coupled many-level dots. Our method allows us to treat on equal footing the decoherence induced by the intradot interaction and that by the Coulomb coupling to a nearby system. In the case of a single interferometer, we show that the intradot Coulomb interaction leads to a reduction of the Fano <b>line</b> <b>amplitude.</b> From the analysis of the interaction self-energy, it follows that this effect originates in inelastic scattering processes in which electron-hole pairs are involved. The interplay between the interdot and the intradot interactions in decoherence is discussed for two nearby identical T-shaped interferometers. We also show that the intradot interaction does not prevent the observation of controlled dephasing due to a nearby charge detector, as long as the latter is subjected to a sufficiently large bias. © 2008 The American Physical Society...|$|E
40|$|We analyze 15, 000 {{spectra of}} 29 stellar-mass black hole (BH) {{candidates}} collected over the 16 year mission lifetime of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer using a simple phenomenological model. As these BHs vary widely in luminosity and progress through {{a sequence of}} spectral states, which we broadly refer to as hard and soft, we focus on two spectral components: the Compton power law and the reflection spectrum it generates by illuminating the accretion disk. Our proxy for the strength of reflection is the equivalent width of the Fe–K line as measured {{with respect to the}} power law. A key distinction of our work is that for all states we estimate the continuum under the line by excluding the thermal disk component and using only the component that is responsible for fluorescing the Fe–K line, namely, the Compton power law. We find that reflection is several times more pronounced (~ 3) in soft compared to hard spectral states. This is most readily caused by the dilution of the Fe <b>line</b> <b>amplitude</b> from Compton scattering in the corona, which has a higher optical depth in hard states. Alternatively, this could be explained by a more compact corona in soft (compared to hard) states, which would result in a higher reflection fraction. United States.

The histogram of the 13 CO <b>line</b> <b>amplitude</b> and 13 CO line FWHM show power-law behavior, indicative of turbulence. Especially, the histogram of the FWHM of the 13 CO line show a dN/dv proportional to v- 2. 45 at high velocity end, {{which seems to be}} universal. By plotting the 2 D histogram of the 13 CO line strength versus the 13 CO line width, a lower limit of the 13 CO line width for a given 13 CO line strength can be identified. We argue that such a lower limit is due to the self-gravity of the molecular cloud. Second, with the combination of 13 CO data from the GRS survey and the Hi 21 cm data from the VGPS survey, we study the connection between the molecular gas probed with the 13 CO line emission and the cold Hi gas probed by the Hi 21 cm self-absorption feature. We found that the Hi gas that is associated with the molecular clouds is also turbulent. The molecular clouds that have detectable Hi envelope are more turbulent than clouds that do not show such envelope.
