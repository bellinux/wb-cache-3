Popjustice viewed the song as [...] "one {{of her best}} singles to date and possibly {{one of the eight}} best ballads of 2007". Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote that [...] "No One" [...] "shows the soulful chanteuse acting her age, in the best possible way" [...] and that Keys [...] "hold back on the mastery of vocal craft to <b>let</b> <b>cool,</b> crisp production lead", adding that it [...] "heralds her youth, while maintaining Keys' lockdown on penetrating hooks and soul-sopped production with a buoyancy that makes it a blast to sing along with." [...] According to The Star-Ledger [...] "No One" [...] is a song in which [...] "Keys attempts to offer uplift through cliches".|$|E
60|$|When any saline Liquor is {{evaporated}} to a Cuticle and <b>let</b> <b>cool,</b> the Salt concretes {{in regular}} Figures; which argues, that the Particles of the Salt before they concreted, {{floated in the}} Liquor at equal distances in rank and file, and by consequence that they acted upon one another by some Power which at equal distances is equal, at unequal distances unequal. For by such a Power they will range themselves uniformly, and without it they will float irregularly, and come together as irregularly. And since the Particles of Island-Crystal act all the same way upon the Rays of Light for causing the unusual Refraction, may it not be supposed that in the Formation of this Crystal, the Particles not only ranged themselves in rank and file for concreting in regular Figures, but also by some kind of polar Virtue turned their homogeneal Sides the same way.|$|E
6000|$|But I {{found the}} {{proportion}} of Brine to fresh Water to be near 13 to 12: Supposing therefore GHM to represent the Sea, and FI {{the height of the}} Mountain above the Superficies of the Sea, FM a Cavern in the Earth, beginning {{at the bottom of the}} Sea, and terminated at the top of the Mountain, LM the Sand at the bottom, through which the Water is as it were strained, so as that the fresher parts are only permitted to transude, and the saline kept back; if therefore {{the proportion of}} G M to FM be as 45 to 46, then may the Cylinder of Salt-water GM make the Cylinder of Fresh-water to rise as high as E, and to run over at N. I cannot here stand to examine or confute their Opinion, who make the depth of the Sea, below its Superficies, to be no more perpendicularly measured then the height of the Mountains above it: 'Tis enough for me to say, there is no one of those that have asserted it, have experimentally known the perpendicular of either; nor shall I here determine, whether there may not be many other causes of the separation of the fresh water from the salt, as perhaps some parts of the Earth through which it is to pass, may contain a Salt, that mixing and uniting with the Sea-salt, may precipitate it; much after the same manner as the Alkalizate and Acid Salts mix and precipitate each other in the preparation of Tartarum Vitriolatum. I know not also whether the exceeding cold (that must necessarily be) at the bottom of the Water, may not help towards this separation, for we find, that warm Water is able to dissolve and contain more Salt, then the same cold; insomuch that Brines strongly impregnated by heat, if <b>let</b> <b>cool,</b> do suffer much of their Salt to subside and crystallize about the bottom and sides. I know not also whether the exceeding pressure of the parts of the Water one against another, may not keep the Salt from descending to the very bottom, as finding little or no room to insert it self between those parts, protruded so violently together, or else squeeze it upwads into the superiour parts of the Sea, where it may more easily obtain room for it self, amongst the parts of the Water, by reason that there is more heat and less pressure. To this Opinion I was somewhat the more induced by the relations I have met with in Geographical Writers, of drawing fresh Water from the bottom of the Sea, which is salt above. I cannot now stand to examine, whether this natural perpetual motion may not artificially be imitated: Nor can I stand to answer the Objections which may be made against this my Supposition: As, First, How it comes to pass, that there are sometimes salt Springs much higher then the Superficies of the Water? And, Secondly, Why Springs do not run faster and slower, according to the varying height made of the Cylinder of Sea-water, by the ebbing and flowing of the Sea? ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{method is}} to put the ground coffee in a cup, pour hot water over it and <b>let</b> <b>cool</b> while the grounds sink to the bottom. This is a traditional method for making a cup of coffee that is still used in parts of Indonesia. This method, known as [...] "mud coffee" [...] in the Middle East owing to an extremely fine grind that results in a mud-like sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, allows for extremely simple preparation, but drinkers then have to be careful if they want to avoid drinking grounds either from this layer or floating at the surface of the coffee, which can be avoided by dribbling cold water onto the [...] "floaters" [...] from the back of a spoon. If the coffee beans are not ground finely enough, the grounds do not sink.|$|E
50|$|Soak the ham in four cups {{of water}} for about three hours to {{dissolve}} some of the salt. Discard the water. Par-boil both the smoked ham and the fresh ham shank in a stockpot with five {{cups of water}} on medium heat. Skim off any scum forming {{on top of the}} liquid. Cook for about 20 minutes. Remove the meat and put in a large Chinese clay pot. Strain the liquid from par-boiling through a fine sieve and pour into the clay pot. Or you can discard the liquid and use fresh water instead.Peel off the tough outer leaves from the bamboo shoots. The simplest way to accomplish this is to cut the shoot lengthwise into halves and then remove the leaves. Par-boil the bamboo shoots in a stockpot with about four cups of water over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Drain the shoots and <b>let</b> <b>cool.</b> Slice the shoots very thinly crosswise when cool. Put the bamboo shoot slices into the clay pot.|$|E
50|$|A {{full anneal}} {{typically}} {{results in the}} second most ductile state a metal can assume for metal alloy. Its purpose is to originate a uniform and stable microstructure that most closely resembles the metal's phase diagram equilibrium microstructure, thus letting the metal attain relatively low levels of hardness, yield strength and ultimate strength with high plasticity and toughness. To perform a full anneal on a steel for example, steel is heated to slightly above the austenitic temperature and held for sufficient time to allow the material to fully form austenite or austenite-cementite grain structure. The material is then allowed to cool very slowly so that the equilibrium microstructure is obtained. In most cases this means the material is allowed to furnace cool (the furnace is turned off and the steel is <b>let</b> <b>cool</b> down inside) {{but in some cases}} it's air cooled. The cooling rate of the steel has to be sufficiently slow so as to not let the austenite transform into bainite or martensite, but rather have it completely transform to pearlite and ferrite or cementite. This means that steels that are very hardenable (i.e. tend to form martensite under moderately low cooling rates) have to be furnace cooled. The details of the process depend on the type of metal and the precise alloy involved. In any case the result is a more ductile material but a lower yield strength and a lower tensile strength. This process is also called LP annealing for lamellar pearlite in the steel industry as opposed to a process anneal, which does not specify a microstructure and only has the goal of softening the material. Often the material to be machined is annealed, and then subject to further heat treatment to achieve the final desired properties.|$|E

50|$|Put chai ko (缽仔糕 or 砵仔糕) is {{a popular}} snack in Hong Kong. The pudding cake is palm size and is sweet in taste. It is soft, but can hold its molded shape outside of a bowl.

The batter is poured into {{porcelain}} bowls and steamed until cooked through. Then it is <b>let</b> <b>cooled</b> and served at room temperature. Traditionally, the hawker inserts two bamboo skewers into the cake to turn it out and the eater holds the skewers to consume. But nowadays, most Put Chai Ko are sold in plastic bags.|$|R
