25|$|So it {{was that}} Richard Henderson and company did their due diligence. They sent Daniel Boone to explore and report the finding. Richard Henderson went with Thomas Price and Nathaniel Hart to meet with Attacullaculla. They inquired about <b>the</b> <b>legalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crown law from high British officials. They did not however foresee the change that was coming that {{transformed}} Crown Law to American law.|$|R
40|$|Although the new Criminal Code made {{a series}} <b>of</b> {{amendments}} to <b>the</b> criminal legislation, <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation has not been significantly changed, but only from <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> governing rules. Thus, while the previous Criminal Code regulated through a single provision both <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminal penalties, <b>the</b> new Criminal Code has split <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and criminal penalties into two principles - <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminal penalties, by allocating them two separate articles in Chapter I of Title I <b>of</b> <b>the</b> General Part. In this article, we aim to examine <b>the</b> theoretical side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and to analyse some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important legal issues concerning <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> this principle in the case-law...|$|R

5|$|Although she {{was never}} {{successful}} in her {{more than a decade}} of legal pursuits for recompense from the United States government for seized land, in 1911 she was finally granted a $1,250 a month lifetime pension by the Territory of Hawaii. Historian Sydney Lehua Iaukea noted that besides being a greatly reduced figure from what she had asked for recompense, it also never addressed the question of the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seizure itself.|$|E
5|$|An {{order for}} review of {{detention}} directs someone holding {{a person in}} detention to produce the detainee before the High Court so that the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detention can be established. The power of the Court to require that this be done is specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore. While the other prerogative orders may only be applied for with the court's permission, an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court.|$|E

Luke Collingwood died three days after Zong reached Jamaica, two years before the 1783 court proceedings about the case.|$|E
5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} complicated the divestiture. Two legal challenges to the parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to give up its bid to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E

5|$|The formal {{controversy}} over the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> annexation of Texas {{stems from the fact}} that Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.|$|E
5|$|The <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bat'leth in the United States differs between states. In 2009, {{a replica}} bat'leth {{was used in}} Colorado Springs, Colorado, in two armed robberies.

Alice, who {{continued}} to regard herself as regent, wanted to appoint her new husband as bailli, but this appointment was opposed by all Cypriot barons. Alice then offered the office to Aimery Barlais, who was amenable, but the High Court ruled that Alice could not replace Philip of Ibelin who had been made bailli {{for the duration of}} her son's minority. Barlais left the island to join Alice, while his supporter, Gavin of Chenichy visited with the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, who had decided to launch a crusade for the Holy Land.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{atmosphere}} in which the New York City press accused <b>the</b> Soviets <b>of</b> holding Kasenkina against her will, on 11 August New York Supreme Court Justice Samuel Dickstein issued a writ of habeas corpus on Consul-General Lomakin, demanding that he present Kasenkina the following day in court. The same day a Soviet consular official stated that Lomakin would not be presenting Kasenkina, and the following morning Ambassador Panyushkin presented the State Department with a note disputing <b>the</b> <b>legalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> writ under international law. A State Department legal adviser wrote to Governor of New York Thomas E. Dewey, outlining the Soviet complaints and urged Justice Dickstein {{to take the case}} under advisement.

5|$|During {{and after}} the trial, {{questions}} were raised about the fairness and <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court-martial proceedings. Owing to public pressure, the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men. Widespread publicity surrounding the case {{turned it into a}} cause célèbre among certain Americans; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944–45 led the Navy to change its practices and initiate the desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946. In 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated to the lives lost in the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Bradley moved to Louisville and resumed his legal practice. Shortly after Bradley left office, Goebel and his running mate, J. C. W.

Bradley and his colleague Augustus Willson formed part of the legal team that represented the Republicans before the General Assembly and in court, where they challenged the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goebel Election Law and, later, the actions of the General Assembly's contest committee.|$|E
5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E
25|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Compromise <b>of</b> 1850, Congress {{abolished}} the domestic slave trade (though not <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> slavery) in <b>the</b> District <b>of</b> Columbia.

25|$|After the Second World War, {{during which}} Sarawak and Borneo had been {{occupied}} by Japanese forces, the third rajah, Vyner Brooke, ceded his life interest in Sarawak to the Colonial Office. Unclear as to <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> cession, <b>the</b> British Government simultaneously passed a Bill of Annexation.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> this seizure {{was seriously}} disputed, but the British {{government}} {{had already been}} somewhat embarrassed by <b>the</b> activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alabama, a ship also built by Laird Son & Co and operated as a commerce raider by the Confederate Navy.

5|$|In 1911, a Mr Bowker from Shawford {{successfully}} {{applied for}} the towpath to be diverted, but this was overturned when Rev. J H Du Boulay appealed against the decision. The diversion was sanctioned in 1914, {{although there have been}} doubts about the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action, and subsequently two further diversions were made, at Chickenhall, near the southern end and at Hockley, near the northern end. No maintenance was carried out on the waterway until the formation of Catchment Boards. Thus responsibility for the waterway as a drainage channel passed to the Hampshire Catchment Board in 1942, and some work was carried out to maintain the integrity of the waterway. These responsibilities later passed to the Southern Water Authority, and now reside with the Environment Agency.|$|E
5|$|In their decision, the Supreme Court {{held that}} the {{application}} of curfews against citizens is constitutional. As a companion case to Hirabayashi v.

The court remanded {{the case to the}} district court for sentencing as the lower court had determined the curfew was not valid against citizens, but Yasui had forfeited his citizenship by working for the Japanese consulate. The Yasui and Hirabayashi decisions, along with the later Ex parte Endo and Korematsu v. United States decisions, determined the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curfews and relocations during the war. In the 1980s, new information was used to vacate the conviction of Yasui.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 {{amendments}} to the ISA were challenged before the High Court in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989). Justice Frederick Arthur Chua held that sections 8B(1) and 8B(2) of the ISA govern judicial review {{in the context of}} that Act, and thus preclude any consideration of the legal position laid down in the obiter remarks of the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze. Therefore, applying the subjective test, the respondents' burden of justifying the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> applicant's detention was discharged as the respondents had produced a valid detention order and evidence of the subjective satisfaction of the President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, that the applicant was a risk to national security.|$|E
50|$|Community {{archaeology}} in the United Kingdom {{has existed}} for many years, although only recently has it {{come to be known}} by that name. <b>The</b> roots <b>of</b> archaeology in <b>the</b> United Kingdom lie in <b>the</b> tradition <b>of</b> antiquarian and amateur work, and many county or locally based archaeology and history societies founded over a century ago have continued to enable <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> local people in archaeology. Up until the 1970s volunteers often had opportunities to initiate or take part in archaeological investigations. Since then the recognition that more investigations were required by <b>the</b> subsequent establishment <b>of</b> archaeological units eroded some of these opportunities; more significantly <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> archaeology to <b>the</b> <b>legalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planning process through Planning Policy Guidance note 16 (PPG16) and <b>the</b> full professionalization <b>of</b> archaeology, has made public participation in archaeology extremely limited.|$|R

This paper suggests that Dworkin’s view fails to account for several features of modern legal practices, particularly those that deal with international and comparative legal standards. It also highlights some inconsistencies in law as integrity as a conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> and suggests an alternative conception to correct for them. <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> this conception <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> provides <b>the</b> major thesis <b>of</b> this paper.
