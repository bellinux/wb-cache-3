There was a dare-devil fellow whom, as I know him to be dead, I feel justified in naming Jack Harris. He was engaged in all manner of speculative ventures on his own account, but the special agent had so frequently employed him in [...] "enterprises of great pith and moment" [...] that he was in a certain sense and to a certain extent one of us. He seemed to me at the time unique, but shortly afterward I had learned to classify him as a type of the Californian adventurer with whose peculiarities of manner, speech and disposition most of us are to-day familiar enough. He never spoke of his past, having doubtless good reasons for reticence, but any one <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> <b>Western</b> slang--a knowledge then denied me--would have catalogued him with infallible accuracy. He was a rather large, strong fellow, swarthy, black-bearded, black-eyed, black-hearted and entertaining, no end; ignorant with an ignorance whose frankness redeemed it from offensiveness, vulgar with a vulgarity that expressed itself in such metaphors and similes as would have made its peace with the most implacable refinement. He drank hard, gambled high, swore like a parrot, scoffed at everything, was openly and proudly a rascal, did not know the meaning of fear, borrowed money abundantly, and squandered it with royal disregard. Desiring one day to go to Mobile, but reluctant to leave Montgomery and its pleasures--unwilling to quit certainty for hope--he persuaded the captain of a loaded steamboat to wait four days for him at an expense of $400 a day; and lest time should hang too heavy on the obliging skipper's hands, Jack permitted him to share the orgies gratis. But that is not my story.|$|E

It justifies the need to reduce excess mortality. Further, it analyzes the trends, structure and the burden of cardiovascular diseases, demonstrates prevalence of major cardiovascular risk factors (psychosocial factors, alcohol abuse, smoking, eating habits, arterial hypertension, low physical activity, obesity, and dyslipidemy) in the Russian population. The measures required to control high mortality from cardiovascular disease and existing barriers in Russia are addressed.

In-depth exploration {{of this phenomenon}} is helpful for understanding the features of mathematics teaching in China. This paper demonstrates how the teacher can encourage students to actively generate knowledge under the teacher’s control from a perspective of variation and further deconstruct the legitimacy of teacher-centeredness and student-centeredness dichotomy. Teacher-dominated classrooms in countries {{under the influence of}} the Confucian-heritage culture (CHC) are often seen as an environment not conducive to <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> <b>western</b> countries (Biggs, 1996). However, students from CHC countries have consistently performed well in recent international studies of mathematics achievement (Beaton et al, 1996; Mullis et al, 1997; 2000; 2003). The mismatch between the unfavorable learning environment and the outstanding achievement has prompted discussion on the so-called “paradox of the Chinese learners ” which led to many studies about the teaching in CHC classrooms and the psychological and pedagogical perspectives about Chinese teaching and learning (Leung, 2001; Watkins & Biggs, 2001; Fan, et al, 2004). To crack the paradox, some studies have tried to explore the mechanism of mathematics teaching in CHC settings (Huang, 2002...|$|R
