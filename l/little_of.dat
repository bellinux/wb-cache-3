5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} <b>little</b> <b>of</b> it is ionized {{in the stomach}} after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E
5|$|After {{his service}} in the House, Brown took a break from politics, but re-entered the {{political}} arena {{as a candidate for}} governor of Kentucky in 1891. He secured the Democratic nomination in a four-way primary election, then convincingly won the general election over his Republican challenger, Andrew T. Wood. Brown's administration, and the state Democratic Party, were split between gold standard supporters (including Brown) and supporters of the free coinage of silver. Brown's was also the first administration to operate under the Kentucky Constitution of 1891, and most of the legislature's time was spent adapting the state's code of laws to the new constitution. Consequently, <b>little</b> <b>of</b> significance was accomplished during Brown's term.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Ernest Thompson {{exercised}} an option of his lease allowing him to buy Craigiehall from Lord Rosebery. However, the army had still not moved out, and in 1948 offered to purchase the property from Thompson, finally completing the sale in 1951. Through the early 1950s the Army made alterations to Craigiehall. The original roof was replaced in 1953 due to woodworm, and extra rooms added in the attic. This resulted {{in the loss of}} Bruce's chimneys, and Burn's dining room pediment. Internally the house was redecorated, it being considered that there was too <b>little</b> <b>of</b> the original scheme remaining to allow restoration. Another extension was added, this time to the north-west, to house the staff of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC) in Scotland.|$|E

Built around a Royal Air Force ground reconnaissance squadron equipped with armored cars, this unit contained American, British, French, and Italian technical specialists of various kinds who would enter Rome {{on the heels of the}} advancing Allied forces. The expectation that Rome would soon be captured proved premature, and by March 1944 most of the Alsos Mission had returned to the United States. The Alsos Mission had gathered <b>little</b> <b>of</b> value about nuclear matters, but submitted detailed reports about German rockets and guided missiles.|$|E
