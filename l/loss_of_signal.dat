5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal.</b> Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reception}} quality {{during the early}} stage of deployment of DAB was poor even for people who live well within the coverage area.

2500|$|In signal processing, each vector is {{interpreted}} as a signal. In this interpretation, a vector expressed as a linear combination of the frame vectors is a redundant signal. Using a frame, {{it is possible to}} create a simpler, more sparse representation of a signal as compared with a family of elementary signals (that is, representing a signal strictly with a set of linearly independent vectors may not always be the most compact form). Frames, therefore, provide robustness. Because they provide a way of producing the same vector within a space, signals can be encoded in various ways. This facilitates fault tolerance and resilience to a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal.</b> [...] Finally, redundancy can be used to mitigate noise, which is relevant to the restoration, enhancement, and reconstruction of signals.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{effectiveness}} of using both local and remote (wide-area) feedback signals for power oscillation damping (POD) controllers is shown. However, {{the challenge is to}} guarantee a minimum level of dynamic performance with only the local <b>signal</b> following sudden <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> remote <b>signals.</b> A case study on the Nordic equivalent system is presented to show that the closed-loop response could deteriorate once the remote signals are lost.

The problem is solved non-iteratively using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Under the normal condition (when both local and remote signals are present) the fault-tolerant controller (FTC) requires more control effort as compared to a conventional controller (CC) in order to achieve the same performance.

2500|$|Control action - The {{mathematical}} model and practical loop above both use a [...] "direct" [...] control action {{for all the}} terms, which means an increasing positive error results in an increasing positive control output for the summed terms to apply correction. However, the output is called [...] "reverse" [...] acting if it's necessary to apply negative corrective action. For instance, if the valve in the flow loop was 100-0% valve opening for 0-100% control output - meaning the controller action has to be reversed. Some process control schemes and final control elements require this reverse action. An example would be a valve for cooling water, where the fail safe mode, {{in the case of}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal,</b> would be 100% opening of the valve; therefore 0% controller output needs to cause 100% valve opening.|$|E

40|$|Recent data {{indicate}} that cortical dopamine denervation results in dystrophic changes in the dendrites of pyramidal cells, including decreases in dendritic spine density and length. However, {{it is not known}} if the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> through specific dopamine receptors subserves these dendritic changes. We examined the dendritic structure of layer V pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex of D 1, D 2, and D 4 dopamine receptor null mutant mice and their wild-type littermates. Decreased basal dendritic length and spine density were observed in the D 1 knockout mice. Similarly, a decrease in basal dendritic spine density was uncovered in the D 2 knockout mice relative to wild-type littermates. No changes in any dendritic parameter were observed in the D 4 knockout mice. These observations suggest that the dystrophic changes observed in prefrontal cortical pyramidal cell dendrites are due to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> through D 1 and possibly D 2 receptors.

40|$|AbstractTissue {{growth is}} {{achieved}} through coordinated cellular growth, cell division and apoptosis.

40|$|An {{emerging}} paradigm {{holds that}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> negative <b>signalling</b> to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is permis-sive for their oncogenic activity. Herein, we have addressed tumor suppression by RALT/MIG- 6, a tran-scriptionally controlled feedback inhibitor of ErbB RTKs, {{in breast cancer}} cells. Knockdown of RALT expression by RNAi enhanced the EGF-dependent proliferation of normal breast epithelial cells, indicating that <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> RALT <b>signalling</b> in breast epithelium may represent an advantageous condition during ErbB-driven tumorigen-esis. Although mutational inactivation of the RALT gene was not detected in human breast carcinomas, RALT mRNA and protein expression was strongly and selec-tively reduced in ERBB 2 -amplified breast cancer cell lines. Reconstitution of RALT expression in ERBB 2 -amplified SKBr- 3 and BT 474 cells inhibited ErbB- 2 -dependent mitogenic signalling and counteracted the ability of ErbB ligands to promote resistance to the ErbB- 2 -targeting drug Herceptin. Thus, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> RALT expression cooperates with ERBB 2 gene amplification to drive full oncogenic signalling by the ErbB- 2 receptor. Moreover, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> RALT <b>signalling</b> may adversely affect tumor responses to ErbB- 2 -targeting agents...|$|R
