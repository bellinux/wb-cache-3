5000|$|In 1988, 26 years later, <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> {{denied any}} {{involvement}} in the dynamiting of the Student Union building, stating that his deputy Brigadier Aung Gyi, who by that time had fallen out with <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> and been dismissed, had given the order to dynamite the building. <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> further stated that he himself, as a [...] "revolutionary leader", had {{to take responsibility for}} the incident by giving the [...] "sword with sword and spear with spear" [...] speech.|$|R

50|$|Ba Swe and U Nu, {{his former}} senior {{colleague}} and later adversary, were released on 27 October 1966.

50|$|In 1974, {{he became}} Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Burma created by <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> {{to replace the}} Revolutionary Council. In 1977, he was blamed for the {{economic}} problems {{of the country and}} removed from office by <b>Ne</b> <b>Win.</b> He then {{became a member of the}} State Council of Burma, a position from which he retired in 1985.|$|R
50|$|The coup {{created a}} policy vacuum, where the Revolutionary Council and <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> could realize their ideas for society, but <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> needed a {{rationale}} for implementing his political agenda that would resonate with the population. This led to the formulation of the Burmese Way to Socialism, which {{was presented to the}} public on 7 May 1962.|$|R
5000|$|In {{spite of}} these nationalisation, China still gave its support to General Ne Win’s policy even {{at the expense of}} its own {{economic}} interests in order not to reduce their influence in Burma. In June 1964, Chinese government not only informed General <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> about the possible coup to overthrow him when it received the information through its intelligence networks but it also offer assistance. This was followed by Zhou Enlai’s secret visit to Burma in July 1964 to discuss the Burma’s domestic and political issues with General <b>Ne</b> <b>Win.</b> The reason behind China’s support can be attributed that it believed that if General <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> fell from power, Burma would lean towards the west which would increase the influence of US in Burma and this would impact on the struggle of anti-US imperialism in Southeast Asia and to China. Therefore, China should support General <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> ...|$|R

He founded the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP), which in 1964 was formally declared {{to be the only}} legal party.|$|R
50|$|The {{consolidation}} of the military {{was a result of}} lengthy periods of wars, especially the war as well as intramilitary struggles, which led to a purge of army commanders who had tense relationships with <b>Ne</b> <b>Win.</b> In this way Callahan argues that <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> seized power at a time where there were no genuine obstacles due to the strong character of the military.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> quickly {{took steps}} to {{transform}} Burma into his vision of a 'socialist state' and to isolate the country from contact {{with the rest of}} the world. [...] A one-party system was established with his newly formed Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) in complete control. [...] Commerce and industry were nationalised across the board, but the economy did not grow at first if at all as the government put too much emphasis on industrial development at the expense of agriculture. [...] In April 1972, General <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> and the rest of the Union Revolutionary Council retired from the military, but now as U <b>Ne</b> <b>Win,</b> he continued to run the country through the BSPP. A new constitution was promulgated in January 1974 that resulted in the creation of a People's Assembly (Pyithu Hluttaw) that held supreme legislative, executive, and judicial authority, and local People's Councils. <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> became the president of the new government.|$|R
5000|$|Scholars have {{stressed}} the importance of the 1962Rangoon University protests as a formative event and focal point for laterstudent activism against military rule in Burma. As a visiblesign of the symbolic importance of the events as a reference point, “manyRangoon University students wore black or participated in furtive, nighttimedemonstrations around campus“ on the anniversary of the 7July incident. General <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> himself was also firmly aware of the symbolicpower connected with the events. This was, inter alia, reflected in hisdecision to release students, which were detained during the beginning of the8888 Uprising in March and June 1988, on the 7 July anniversary. Furthermore, when <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> had to resign only a few weeks later as aresult of the 8888 Uprising, he referred in his departure speech to thedestruction of the RUSU building as “one of the key episodes” during his time in power. Moreover, <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> also explicitly denied any involvement in dynamiting of the Student Unionbuilding, stating that his deputy Brigadier Aung Gyi, who by that time hadfallen out with <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> and been dismissed, had given the order without his approval and that he had to takeresponsibility as a [...] "revolutionary leader" [...] by giving the swordwith sword and spear with spear speech. Aung Gyi, in turn, “claimed that he merelydelivered the order given by General <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> to the commander of the militarycompany which eventually detonated the explosives that destroyed the unionbuilding.” However, the conviction has gained ground amongacademic scholars that <b>Ne</b> <b>Win</b> in fact bears the ultimate responsibility for thedestruction of the RUSU building.|$|R

50|$|The {{descriptions}} of the coup vary in the scholarly literature, {{when it comes to}} how militarily coordinated the coup was. According to historian Robert H.
