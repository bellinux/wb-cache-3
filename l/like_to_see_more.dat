Harrison {{noted that the}} writers appear to explore the characters' backgrounds during the second season, like how Leonard's background was in focus in [...] "Wet Hot Demonic Summer". Harrison concluded his review while commenting on [...] "Callie and Her Sister": [...] "This sort of episode {{is still in its}} early stages, but I don't begrudge Ugly Americans the training wheels if it means we get to better know the people and creatures of the fascinating animated world.

500|$|Speculation about {{a presidential}} run began {{several months after}} the release of his February 2011 book Seize Freedom! American Truths and Renewal in a Chaotic Age. The first {{instance}} occurred during the April 22 episode of Red Eye, where host Greg Gutfeld asked McCotter to enter the presidential race. Five days later, political commentator and fellow Red Eye frequenter S.E. Cupp listed McCotter as a potential candidate in her Daily News column. McCotter confirmed in May that he was seriously considering a run for the presidency. He told the newspaper Politico he felt most Republicans lacked enthusiasm for the current crop of candidates. Commentator Andrew Breitbart expressed excitement at the prospect of a McCotter run. Describing him as [...] "blunt, sarcastic, pop-culture-savvy, constitutionally sound and an authentic voice," [...] Breitbart remarked [...] no one I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> at a debate than McCotter." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The {{plot of the}} episode has been criticized by some reviewers. Kyle Lemmon of Under the Radar gave the episode a three out of ten rating, concluding that [...] "this new episode is rarely grounded {{in any kind of}} reality. The best examples of The Simpsons center the situational humor in somewhat plausible scenarios within the town. I guess after so many years, they've completely run out of ideas." [...] Similarly, Television Blend's Jesse Carp wrote that the plot shows [...] "essentially what is wrong with the show and why I stopped watching. Because of the endless amount of material needed to keep a series running for twenty three years, they have to resort to outlandish plots and endless cameos to stay interesting. The best episodes,... definitely have some absurd elements but they're all firmly grounded in a fairly real world of Springfield, USA and its colorful cast of characters.

Club gave the episode a B+, {{and felt that}} it gave an accurate depiction of the characters. He opined: [...] "I {{had a problem with}} the show's tendency to wander into cul-de-sacs in the first season, mainly because so much of it felt redundant, the work of writers who had no real idea how to construct narrative television. But this season, I'm starting to think they're getting a handle on things, and [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] is the sort of episode I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> off [...] as The Walking Dead continues." [...] Paste Josh Jackson asserted that the episode was superior to preceding installments, describing it as [...] "simply a catch of breath." [...] Similarly, Josh Wigler of MTV evaluated that despite less violence than usual, the quality of [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] improved from the previous episode. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed analogous sentiments, and argued that while the show's character still need more development, the development displayed in the episode was a [...] "definite {{step in the right direction}} on that front." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings concluded that the episode contained many powerful scenes. Eric Goldman of IGN was critical of the episode, ultimately giving it a seven out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "good" [...] rating. Goldman felt that [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] was a disappointment, citing that it lack any focus or direction. Henry Hanks, writing for CNN, said that the episode was the weakest of the season.|$|E

2500|$|The game, {{while in}} early access, has already {{received}} alternate gameplay modes created by players, determined by unenforceable rules that players agree to abide by, {{that have been}} popular with streamers. This was aided by a quiet release of custom server support {{to a number of}} influential streamers which subsequently made it into public release. In one case, [...] "Zombie Mode", all but four players pretend to be zombies, who may sometimes distinguish themselves by removing all clothing and are limited only to collecting melee weapons and consumable items, and must rush to attack the other four players, who are able to collect all gear and attempt to outrun and defeat the zombies. Inspired by this mode, Greene announced plans to introduce an official zombie-based gameplay mode based on this into Battlegrounds. Whereas {{most of the rest of}} the team continued to develop the core gameplay and maps, Greene is taking on the zombie mode as a near solo project, only using the assistance of the lead animator to help with the zombie animations. Greene sees Battlegrounds as a platform, and would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> custom game types and mods developed by players for it. Greene identified that some mods that he also previously worked on from ARMA 3 may become part of the Battlegrounds platform.

In fact, the Frogman was {{thinking}} that he'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> of the world. Here in the Yip Country he had become the most important creature of them all, and his importance was getting to be a little tame. It would be nice to have other people defer to him and ask his advice, and there seemed no reason so far as he could see why his fame should not spread throughout all Oz. He knew nothing of the rest of the world, but it was reasonable to believe that there were more people beyond the mountain where he now lived than there were Yips, and if he went among them he could surprise them with his display of wisdom and make them bow down to him as the Yips did. In other words, the Frogman was ambitious to become still greater than he was, which was impossible if he always remained upon this mountain. He wanted others to see his gorgeous clothes and listen to his solemn sayings, and here was an excuse for him to get away from the Yip Country. So he said to Cayke the Cookie Cook, [...] "I will go with you, my good woman," [...] which greatly pleased Cayke because she felt the Frogman could be of much assistance to her in her search.|$|E
