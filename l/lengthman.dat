50|$|Sea Trolls {{are made}} of water, have a {{tendency}} to suffer from fish and chronic tides, (as related in The Colour of Magic) and are notoriously long-lived, even by trollish standards. A sea troll named Tethis was encountered by Rincewind in The Colour of Magic. Tethis' body was made up of animated water, as opposed to the more normal rock, and his height and body shape changed with the tides. He was a <b>Lengthman</b> for Krull, which meant that he patrolled the vast nets the citizens of that continent arranges around the rim of the Disc (the 'Circumfence'), to trap debris from falling {{off the edge of the}} Disc. Tethis himself however claims to have come from another world altogether, named Bathys, and to have passed through space in a frozen state after falling off the edge. Tethis and other 'sea trolls' like him have never appeared in any of the other books, possibly suggesting that there is no similar race native to the Discworld.|$|E
50|$|The village {{maintains}} its {{links with the}} canal through the thriving boatyard and boat hire company Rose Narrowboats at Stretton Stop {{to the north of}} the village. The boatyard was started in 1960 at the site of the old <b>lengthmans</b> cottage. The manager was Charles Haslam and he worked for the Maid Line Cruiser company from Thames Ditton, London. The house was renovated by a local building in 1960 but was never more than a very drafty pile with a very damp basement. The old outbuildings were renovated and turned into a small workshop and a waterfront office. The waterfront office was the gathering place for boat owners on a Sunday evening to sit and enjoy the summer air while sharing stories and the odd pint of beer from the (now closed) Railway Inn. In 1962 a slipway was dug and a large boatshed built {{to the north of the}} canal. Since the 1960s the boatyard has become a thriving source of income for the village.|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} the {{buildings}} associated with the canal have survived and appear on the listed building register, including five circular cottages, built with three floors. The lower floor {{was intended to be}} used as a store and has access to the outside. A set of outside steps leads up to the first floor, which is around [...] in diameter. It was designed as a living area and was equipped with a cooking range. A staircase, built between the inner and outer wall, leads up to a circular bedroom on the second floor. [...] The round houses are situated at Lechlade, by the entrance lock from the Thames; at Marston Meysey; at Cerney Wick near Latton, next to lock 39; at Coates, close to the eastern portal of the tunnel; and at Chalford, next to lock 13. Some had a pointed slate roof, while others had a lead cone, which collected rain water for drinking. They were built in the 1790s for use by lock-keepers and <b>lengthmen,</b> but were not particularly popular due to the limited amount of space and problems with finding suitable furniture for a circular room.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. This {{research}} is {{an evaluation of}} labour-based methods and techniques {{that are used in}} rural road construction and maintenance. The study places emphasis on the Zibambele rural road maintenance programme in Umbumbulu, which is based on a <b>lengthmen</b> (male or female) system. The {{research is}} an attempt to determine how strategies such as Zibambele can be used for the social and economic upliftment of impoverished rural areas as well as contribute to adequate road access for rural communities to address the legacy of apartheid, with special reference to the empowerment of women-headed households. Rural road networks in South Africa are underdeveloped and characterised by its poor state, lack of maintenance and lack of provision, thereby having little impact on the lives of the rural poor Black population. It is evident in the study that development and maintenance of physical infrastructure are keys to rapid economic growth and poverty reduction. The study examined the impacts of labour-based rural road maintenance on accessibility and poverty alleviation in the Umbumbulu community through the use of quantitative methods (specifically a questionnaire survey) and qualitative methods (specifically focus group discussions, ranking exercises, mental mapping and venn/ chapatti diagrams). The_findings of the study indicated that the Zibambele poverty alleviation and rural road maintenance programme impacted positively on the livelihoods of many women-headed households by providing an income, facilitating skills development, and improving their social environment. It was also determined that through the introduction of new programmes such as Zibambele, the transport infrastructure within a community and the quality of life immediately improves, thus alleviating many affects of povert...|$|R
