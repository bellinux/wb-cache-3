40|$|The {{objective}} of the present paper is to analyse the progress of data in shipping demand between 1993 and 2002 in the most important spanish ports, in the others words, those ports that are under State Ports protection, and their relation with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as Freight Index. The methodology {{that has been used}} to draw the shipping demand function up is the traditional one, due to we use added variables, i. e. they mean the global behaviour of a certain group of individuals. To prepare this paper, the demand account of sea transport services has been divided in three groups, in function of cargo types: General Merchandise, Solid Bulks and Liquid Bulks. The reason why we use this kind of division is that Principals Institutions in Sea Transport bring their statistics down in this way. Similarly, we pretend to analyse the evolution in the share of different cargos in the whole shipping demand in the period mentioned before (1993 / 2002). The particular demand function for each cargo type in a certain year {{is going to be in}} function of the GDP and the freight rate in that year. The Freight Index used depends on the cargo analysed. So, in case of general merchandise it has been used the liner freight index, since this cargo type use to be transported in <b>liner</b> <b>terms.</b> Usually, Freight Conferences fix prices in this navigation. In case of Solid and Liquid Bulks, we have chosen dry cargo and tanker cargo freight index respectively. The standard procedure to transport these kind of bulks is by "tramp" navigation. In "tramp" navigation, prices use to be fixed by time freight, when ships services are contracted for a limited period of time, or travel freight, when ship services are contracted for a particular trip. ...|$|E

40|$|A lined {{pipeline}} {{consists of}} an outer main load-bearing pipe of Carbon-Manganese steel, termed backing steel, and an inner corrosion resistant alloy layer, <b>termed</b> <b>liner.</b> The purpose of the liner is {{to serve as a}} membrane; protect the backing steel from the sour contents owing inside and thus prevent internally corrosion. The main challenge of lined pipelines arise because of its low bending capacity due to local buckling of the <b>liner,</b> <b>termed</b> wrinkling. In installation as well as in operation, the pipeline will be exposed to bending and wrinkling of the liner may occur if the imposed curvature is su cient. Based on previous work in a joint industry project[5], nite element basis for mechanical behaviour of lined pipelines in installation and operation have been developed in present the project. Di erent parameters that in uence the wrin- kling phenomena in installation have been studied. The nite element model - established in the present task - is able to predict the post-buckling behaviour of the liner. This open the possibility to determine a limiting bending strain/cur- vature on lined pipelines based on wrinkling height. The wrinkling behaviour during operational phase is brie y discussed.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between measurements and simulations of the acoustic-particle-velocity field in a rectangular duct {{in the near}} field of a single-degree-of-freedom, Helmholtz-resonator liner is presented. For the measurements, at low-velocity (Ma= 0. 01) grazing flow condition, the non-intrusive measurement technique particle-image velocimetry (PIV) is applied. The computational aeroacoustic (CAA) simulation is performed by solving the linearised Euler equations in the time domain, without background flow (Ma= 0). The CAA solution uses an extended-Helmholtz-resonator acoustic-impedance model to represent the liner. A strong similarity between the simulated and the measured acoustic-particle-velocity distributions is observed. This suggests that the PIV-based technique enables the visualisation of the acoustic-velocity field, on the one hand.

The high level of noise is not only very disturbing to the people living close to the installation site but can also potentially cause structural failures in the piping.

40|$|The {{kinetic theory}} of wave {{propagation}} in random media {{is applied to}} assess {{the relative merits of}} the peripherally segmented, axially segmented and 'checkerboard' configured acoustic duct treatments proposed by Mani (1976).

This results in a relatively simple analytical description of the acoustic properties of the <b>liner</b> in <b>terms</b> of a system of linear, first order ordinary differential equations, whose solution gives the distribution with axial distance of the acoustic modal intensities. The theory is expected to be valid provided that the variation in the impedance from segment to segment is small, so that the conclusions obtained here are of a preliminary nature, and must be regarded as giving a general indication of features which should be incorporated into the design of efficient acoustic liners. The principal such conclusion is that a checkerboard liner offers the best means of increasing the attenuation over and above that of a uniformly lined duct. On the other hand, only minimal gains are to be derived from the use of strictly peripherally segmented liners...|$|R

We confirm the existence of such luminous LINERs in the local universe, after being previously detected at z ~ 0. 3 by Tommasin et al. Themedian stellar mass of these LINERs corresponds to 6 - 7 × 1010 M⊙ which was found in previous work to correspond to the peak of relative growth rate of stellar populations and therefore for the highest SFRs. Other LINERs although showing similar AGN luminosities have lower SFR. We find that most of these sources have LAGN ~ LSF suggesting co-evolution of black hole and stellarmass.

40|$|The {{optimized}} {{design of}} bias flow liner {{is a key}} element for the development of low emission combustion systems in modern gas turbines and aero-engines. The research of bias flow liners has a fairly long history concerning both the parameter dependencies as well as the methods to model the acoustic behaviour of bias flow liners under the variety of different bias and grazing flow conditions. In order to establish an overview over the state of the art, this paper provides a comprehensive review about the published research on bias flow liners and modelling approaches with an extensive study of the most relevant parameters determining the acoustic behaviour of these liners. The paper starts with a historical description of available investigations aiming on the characterization of the bias flow absorption principle. This chronological compendium is extended by the recent and ongoing developments in this field. In a next step the fundamental acoustic property of bias flow <b>liner</b> in <b>terms</b> of the wall impedance is introduced and the different derivations and formulations of this impedance yielding the different published model descriptions are explained and compared. Finally, a parametric study reveals the most relevant parameters for the acoustic damping behaviour of bias flow liners and how this is reflected by the various model representations. Although the general trend of the investigated acoustic behaviour is captured by the different models fairly well for a certain range of parameters, in the transition region between the resonance dominated and the purely bias flow related regime all models lack the correct damping prediction. This seems to be connected to the proper implementation of the reactance as a function of bias flow Mach number...|$|R

The Faraday rotation technique measured the 16 MA currents in these experiments with better than 1 % precision. In addition, six B-dot probes were fielded at equal angles around a circle in the powerflow channel outside the liner to measure the symmetry of the liner impact on the target cylinder. The B-dot probes measure the local I-dot, which has a jump when the liner impacts the target cylinder. A high-pass filter allows one to measure this jump more accurately.

Defibrillation is the key intervention for improving survival from SCA and can increase survival up to 75 %. This has sparked the movement to increase public access to defibrillation by placing automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public areas such as universities, shopping centers, and athletic centers. The effectiveness of AEDs to revive those with SCA is dependent on the design of these devices. The purpose of this study was (1) to evaluate the design features that aid or hinder the effective and timely use of three commercially available AEDs using a heuristic evaluation; (2) to rank the three AEDs in terms of overall usability based on user comments and preference, and the severity of usability heuristic violations; and (3) develop design recommendations to guide the future design of AEDs.

The lubricating film of oil is provided to seal of gases towards crankcase and also to give smooth friction free translatory motion between rings and liner. Of the three rings present top ring is more crucial as it does the main work of restricting gases downwards the crankcase. Boundary lubrication is present at the Top dead centre (TDC) and Bottom dead centre (BDC) of the liner surface. In addition to this, top ring is exposed to high temperature gases which makes the oil present near the top ring to get evaporated and decreasing its viscosity, making metal-metal contact most of the time. Due to this at TDC, excess wear happens on the <b>liner</b> which is <b>termed</b> as Top ring reversal bore wear.

Here we mainly use this sample to study the absorption properties of active galaxies, to probe new AGN classes and to test the AGN unification scheme. We find that half (48 %) of the sample is absorbed while the fraction of Compton thick AGN is small (~ 7 %). In line with our previous analysis, we have however shown that when the bias towards heavily absorbed objects which are lost if weak and at large distance is removed, as it is possible in the local Universe, the above fractions increase to become 80 % and 17 %. We also find that absorption {{is a function of}} source luminosity, which implies some evolution in the obscuration properties of AGN. Few peculiar classes, so far poorly studied in the hard X-ray band, have been detected and studied for the first time such as 5 XBONG, 5 type 2 QSOs and 11 <b>LINERs.</b> In <b>terms</b> of optical classification, our sample contains 57 % of type 1 and 43 % of type 2 AGN; this subdivision is similar to that found in X-rays if unabsorbed versus absorbed objects are considered, suggesting that the match between optical and X-ray classification is overall good. Only a small percentage of sources (12 %) does not fulfill the expectation of the unified theory as we find 22 type 1 AGN which are absorbed and 10 type 2 AGN which are unabsorbed. Studying in depth these outliers we found that most of the absorbed type 1 AGN have X-ray spectra characterized by either complex or warm/ionized absorption more likely due to ionized gas located in an accretion disk wind or in the biconical structure associated to the central nucleus, therefore unrelated to the toroidal structure. Among 10 type 2 AGN which resulted to be unabsorbed, at most 3 - 4 % is still eligible to be classified as a "true" type 2 AGN. Comment: 21 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

In this case, the contact between the geomembrane and the GCL was quantified in terms of flow rate through the composite <b>liner</b> and in <b>terms</b> of interface transmissivity. Various situations were tested in the past in order to evaluate the situation where a smooth GM is used in contact with the GCL. The situation where a textured geomembrane is used in contact with the GCL was also evaluated. More recently, the effect {{of the nature of the}} bentonite in the GCL, sodium or calcium bentonite, leading to different flow rates in the GCL was evaluated. In all cases an HDPE GM was used. This choice is linked to the fact that it is the most commonly GM used in composite liners including GCLs for chemical compatibility reasons. However one could imagine that the use of other GMs, like bituminous geomembranes (B-GMs) associated to a GCL, could be adapted for hydraulic applications. A quantification of flow rates was thus performed in laboratory tests at the decimetric scale for the case of a damaged B-GM located on top of a GCL. This corresponds to an alternative design for a canal projected in France at the moment.

40|$|Porous {{sound-absorbing}} ceramics {{contribute to}} the passive damping of thermo-acoustic instabilities and sound dissipation. As ceramic liners, they must satisfy all requirements respecting mechanical strength and thermal resistance. Design and development of such ceramics concern various aspects like thermal shock resistance, crack behavior, fatigue limit, creep and erosion resistance. The aim of this work is to investigate the mechanical behavior of highly porous sound absorbing ceramics and to predict the brittle damage behavior considering the material microstructure. It studies the applicability of such ceramics as insulation liners for the combustion chambers and gives a clue to further material improvement in terms of mechanical strength. Experiments were performed in this work to characterize the mechanical strengths of a new developed sound absorbing ceramic for the application as ceramic heat shields for the combustion chambers of premixed gas turbines. Compressive tests at both room and high temperature as well as four-point bending tests at room temperature have been carried out. Furthermore, the fits of fracture strengths of the material to the Normal, Weibull and Type I extreme value distributions are investigated. The characterization was then expanded to other physical properties such as porosity, density, thermal conduction coefficients and thermal expansion coefficients. A non-multi-physic but multi-scale approach is applied in this work which predicts {{the influence of the}} microstructure on the macroscopic properties. The scale transition method is known as mean-field homogenization method, based on assumed relations between average values of micro-strain and -stress fields in each phase. This homogenization model is based on the Eshelby model and assumes the pores (or rather inclusions) to be ellipsoidal. Influence of the pore density, pore form and pore orientation on the strength of these porous sound absorbing ceramic are studied here. Depending on the loading condition higher strength by higher porosity values is achievable by for example aligning the pores on a desired direction or changing their form from spherical to ellipsoid with high aspect ratios. Furthermore, direct finite element simulations of a representative-volume element (RVE) are also implemented in this work to investigate the pure brittle damage of this sound absorbing ceramic. An effective-stress degradation model has been implemented in a predefined user-subroutine of ABAQUS. It is based on the three dimensional rupture criterion and describes the pure brittle damage under mechanical, thermomechanical, static and quasi-static loadings. Different RVE s have been generated and investigated in terms of damage considering different structural parameters. The present results demonstrate the application potential of these sound absorbing ceramic as <b>liner</b> in <b>terms</b> of mechanical strengths, predict their brittle damage behavior considering the microstructure and provide a base for further material developments and numerical investigations.

40|$|The thermal heating {{caused by}} the {{deposition}} of spent nuclear fuel containers increases the in situ rock stress during disposal time. The thermal stress increase was modelled using thermo-mechanical modelling. The numerical codes used to establish the effects of heating on the in situ stress field are outlined, together with the rock mass parameters, in situ stress values, radiogenic temperatures and reinforcement structures. This {{is followed by a}} study of the temperature and stress evolution during the repository's operational period and the effect of the heating on the reinforcement structures. It is found that, during excavation, the maximum principal stress is concentrated at the transition areas where the excavation profile changes and that, due to the heating from the deposition of spent nuclear fuel, the maximum principal stress rises significantly in the tunnel arch area of NW/SW oriented central tunnels. However, it is predicted that the rock’s crack damage (CD, short term strength) value of 99 MPa will not be exceeded anywhere within the model. An additional study of the radiogenic heating effect on the brittle deformation zones is included. The main conclusion is that, despite deep reaching damage potential in all the load cases studied the currently designed and used reinforcement types and configurations (rock bolts, shotcrete) are capable of handling the dead weight of the damaged rock should this occur, with damage occurring on the shotcrete <b>liner.</b> The long <b>term</b> safety and stability of the repository during its lifetime can be guaranteed by perceiving the reinforcement strategy in two stages. Firstly, by installing the rock reinforcement to sustain the initial stresses and short term increases from the start of deposition with a monitoring programme in place. Secondly, by installing additional reinforcement, if found necessary through monitoring and observation of the underground facilities. In this way, the effect of any time dependent rock stress increase affecting the reinforcement structures can be observed, in addition to creep based damage, thus providing a better level of safety than a single stage design.

40|$|The {{main object}} of this thesis is to {{investigate}} acoustic lining in turbofan ducts which have optimal attenuation for a tonal and broadband noise sources. Liner attenuation {{is necessary in}} modern turbofan engines. There are several techniques for achieving increased attenuation with acoustic liners. This study concentrated on two-dimensional and three-dimensional piecewise liner distribution simulated with an advanced acoustic models in which the nacelle geometry is kept unchanged while the liner characteristics are tuned to optimum values. Two computational acoustic prediction codes are used. First a semi-analytic method based on a modal representation of the pressure field to propagate sound in a circular duct is used. Then a more realistic geometry is examined with a spectral/finite element method. The code presented allows the treatment of non-axisymmetric nacelles by combining a standard bi-quadratic approximation in the axial and radial directions, with a spectral representation in the circumferential direction. The aim is to predict how different liner configurations, at various flight conditions, affect the attenuation of sound within an inlet. Two different noise models are used: single-mode and multimode. These represent the two principal fan noise sources: tonal and broadband noise. A robust and consistent optimization procedure based on a Response Surface Model and formal design of experiment methods is built and used. The optimization problems presented are demanding in terms of computer resources, number of variables, optimization convergence and acoustic modeling. In order to allow efficient use of computational resources and effective management of the results the design optimization makes use of Grid computing technology within the Geodise environment. The use of these various techniques in combination makes possible improvements of liner designs with more realistic geometries at modest computational cost. The main feature that emerges from {{the current study is}} {{that it is possible to}} predict and optimize turbofan <b>liner</b> characteristics in <b>terms</b> of impedance and geometrical distribution to attenuate the noise emission. One of the main indication drawn from this study is the important reduction in terms of fan sound emission when a piecewise azimuthal liner variation is optimized...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to evaluate the milking characteristics of the Bodmin NuPulse milking machine. The first experiment describes the mode of operation of the NuPulse pulsation mechanism and establishes that the NuPulse has a distinctly different mode of action from the conventional type of milking machine. The aim of the 2 nd experiment {{was to determine if}} the liner movement characteristics of the NuPulse cluster had any advantage over the conventional type of pulsation and <b>liner</b> movement, in <b>terms</b> of milk production and mastitis over the period of a lactation. Ten pairs of infection-free identical twins were allocated to the experiment; one member of each pair was milked by the NuPulse pulsation system and the other member was milked by the NuPulse cluster which had been modified for the conventional pulsation treatment by removal of the NuPulse pulsation mechanism. Because of this modification the experiment did not examine the difference between the NuPulse and a conventional machine but only {{the difference between the two}} pulsation mechanisms. The Mark I NuPulse Cluster was used for both treatments in order to eliminate any possible effects of cluster weight, size and stability on the cow during milking. The trial cows were grazed with a 100 cow, mixed aged herd. The herd was milked in an eight bail walk-through, high pipe-line dairy, equipped with four NuPulse clusters and four conventional (modified NuPulse) units. The non-trial cows in the herd were milked by one machine or the other, at random, whereas the trial cows were milked by any one of the four machines appropriate to their treatment. Before 'cups-on' the teats of all cows (including the trial cows) were squirted for five to ten seconds with water and only washed if they were dirty. At times during the summer months, cows with clean teats received no wash at all. During the experiment (and including the first 3 months of the following lactation) no significant difference in mastitis or teat end condition developed between the two treatment groups. The one line NuPulse cluster, with the pulsator incorporated into the claw piece was associated with the same problem of frothing as other one line machines used with high lift pipeline machines. However, the production data indicated that the pulsation mechanism of the NuPulse influenced the cows in some way during milking. The NuPulse group of twins recorded higher milk yields during the last 5 months of lactation and at the time of drying-off, were giving significantly (P < 0. 01) higher yields than the group of twins milked by the conventional machine. The group milked by the conventional machine (modified NuPulse) reached the drying off yield of the NuPulse group (5. 9 l/day) 12 days earlier. When the lactation was ended for both groups at a yield of 5. 9 l/day and the total production for both groups compared, it was found that the NuPulse group achieved significantly higher yields (P < 0. 05). Compared to the conventional (or modified NuPulse) machine, the higher milk yields recorded with the NuPulse during the last 5 months of lactation suggests that the NuPulse was associated with a more positive stimulation effect during milking. However, in view of the small number of animals used in the experiment further studies should be made to verify the increased production effect of the NuPulse on a larger scale, as the efficiency of such increases in production has wider economic implications. Possible stimulation mechanisms associated with the mode of action of the NuPulse are discussed...|$|R
