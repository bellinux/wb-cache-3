5|$|Nefarious covers human {{trafficking}} in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Interviews are interspersed with re-enactments. The film {{opens with a}} re-enactment of a girl being kidnapped by organized criminals. She is confined with other girls in a dark room, lit by a flickering <b>lightbulb.</b> Men order the girls to remove their clothes, and then examine them and shout commands and threats at them, causing them to cry from fear. One girl is dragged into another room. A victim of ordeals such as these, speaking in voiceover, explains that, in this situation, girls are often taken into a separate room to have their sexual performance tested. Identifying these events as taking place near Belgrade, Serbia, the film then tracks the fictional girls through Croatia to Amsterdam's red-light district De Wallen, and to sex markets in Berlin and Las Vegas. The film states that this slavery goes unnoticed in cities where prostitution is legal. Slaves are depicted in confinement, at their places of work, and as they are sold. Many of the girls are orphans, and all are either kidnapped or tricked into forced prostitution. Traffickers in the film use hard drugs, brainwashing and sexual and physical abuse to keep the girls under control.|$|E

25|$|Bailey began {{touring the}} country with comedians such as Mark Lamarr. In 1984 he formed a double act, the Rubber Bishops, with Toby Longworth (a fellow former pupil at King Edward's, Bath). It was there that Bailey began {{developing}} his own style, mixing in musical parodies with deconstructions of or variations on traditional jokes ("How many amoebas {{does it take to}} change a <b>lightbulb?</b> One, no two! No four! No eight..."). According to comedy folklore, after a reviewer once criticised his act for its lack of jokes, Bailey returned the following night, at Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh, to perform a set composed entirely of punchlines. Longworth left to join the RSC in 1989 and was replaced by Martin Stubbs.|$|E

25|$|Americans, by and large, {{are often}} fascinated by new {{technology}} and new gadgets. There are many within the United States that share the attitude that through technology, many of the evils in the society can be solved. Many of the new technological innovations {{in the modern world}} were either first invented in the United States and/or first widely adopted by Americans. Examples include: the <b>lightbulb,</b> the airplane, the transistor, nuclear power, the personal computer, video games and online shopping, as well as the development of the Internet. By comparison with Japan, however, {{only a small fraction of}} electronic devices make it to sale in the US, and household items such as toilets are rarely festooned with remotes and electronic buttons as they are in some parts of Asia.|$|E
25|$|Gas-core reactor. A {{closed loop}} {{version of the}} nuclear <b>lightbulb</b> rocket, where the fissile {{material}} is gaseous uranium-hexafluoride contained in a fused silica vessel. A working gas (such as hydrogen) would flow around this vessel and absorb the UV light produced by the reaction. This reactor design could also function as a rocket engine, as featured in Harry Harrison's 1976 science-fiction novel Skyfall. In theory, using UF6 as a working fuel directly (rather than as a stage to one, as is done now) would mean lower processing costs, and very small reactors. In practice, running a reactor at such high power densities would probably produce unmanageable neutron flux, weakening most reactor materials, and therefore as the flux {{would be similar to}} that expected in fusion reactors, it would require similar materials to those selected by the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan {{developed}} a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880. On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown {{at a meeting of}} the Newcastle Chemical Society, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. This bulb lasted about 40 hours. Swan then turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' in the early 1880s and obtained British Patent 4933 that same year. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house, Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, was the first in the world to be lit by a <b>lightbulb</b> and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity. The first street in the world to be lit by an incandescent <b>lightbulb</b> was Mosley Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. It was lit by Joseph Swan's incandescent lamp on 3 February 1879.|$|E

25|$|A compact {{fluorescent}} lamp is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent <b>lightbulb.</b> Some CFL's fit into light fixtures formerly used for incandescent lamps and {{they are designed to}} produce the same amount of visible light found in incandescent light. CFLs generally use 70% less energy and have a longer rated life. In 1941, George Inman devised the first practical fluorescent lamp while working for General Electric. The key patent for this light source, U.S. patent #2,259,040 was filed by Inman on April 22, 1936 and issued to him on October 14, 1941. In 1976, Edward E. Hammer invented the first helical or spiraled {{compact fluorescent}} lamp, but due to the difficulty of the manufacturing process for coating the interior of the spiral glass tube, General Electric did not manufacture or sell the device. Other companies began manufacturing and selling the device in 1995.|$|E
25|$|The next {{album was}} delayed {{for almost three}} years as the band {{was looking for a}} new record label after {{finishing}} their deal with Delerium. In the meantime, they launched Metanoia (1998), a compilation of improvisations recorded during the Signify sessions, some of which were later shaped into songs. Finally, they signed to Snapper/K-Scope and the album Stupid Dream (1999) was issued. The album was a departure in style from all their previous works, in favour a more song-oriented direction, as a consequence this alienated some older fans but brought a lot of new ones. Its follow-up, <b>Lightbulb</b> Sun (2000), assured the fan base and solidified the ground of its predecessor. For this one, they worked with Dave Gregory of XTC, who provided string arrangements. A collection of EP tracks and out-takes from the previous two albums was launched a year after under the title of Recordings (2001).|$|E
25|$|On November 9, 2016, {{a massive}} fire struck the Industrial Materials Recycling {{facility}} {{located in the}} plant's former galvanizing, cold mill, and hot mill buildings. The fire, which began at about 7 AM after a <b>lightbulb</b> exploded over flammable materials, was fought by more than 100 firefighters from Lackawanna, Buffalo, and other towns. Several explosions were caused by the fire, which collapsed {{the roof of the}} structure and caused other heavy damage to it. Federal and state environmental officials rushed to the scene to monitor health hazards from the blaze, which caused the evacuation of a nearby neighborhood due to fire and the closure of two elementary schools due to smoke dangers. Burning debris fell on the towns of Lackawanna and Hamburg. The fire was contained but still burning on the morning of November 10, requiring the continued evacuation of the neighborhood and the schools.|$|E

Her arm, also floating in, carries a flame-lit lamp. The lamp is positioned very close to the bulb, and is a symbol of hope, clashing with the <b>lightbulb.</b> From the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center below the floating female figure. She looks up blankly into the blazing light bulb. Daggers that suggest screaming replace the tongues of the bull, grieving woman, and horse. A dove is scribed on the wall behind the bull. Part of its body comprises a crack in the wall through which bright light (hope, or the outside world) can be seen. On the far right, a woman with arms raised in terror is entrapped by fire from above and below; her right hand suggests the shape of an airplane. A dark wall with an open door defines the right end of the mural.|$|E
25|$|Many inventors {{lived in}} Salem. Moses Farmer {{was the first}} to light his home by {{electricity}} and sold his <b>lightbulb</b> to Thomas Edison. Edison also used his arc lighting in his demonstrations. Farmer provided Tesla with his lightbulbs for Westinghouse after Edison refused to sell them his to light the Columbian Exposition World Fair of 1893. Farmer would die at the fair. Charles Grafton Page made an electromagnet that could lift 1,000 pounds, electric train, an early telegraph, and worked in the US patent office. He was a precursor to what would befall Tesla for his laboratory had burned down during the Civil War and the section of the Smithsonian which housed his magnet also burned at a later date. Joseph Dixon the inventor of high temperature graphite crucibles, the Single Reflex Lens, and the Dixon-Ticonderoga #2 pencil lived in Salem. Packard Electric were making electric cars in the nineteenth century up to the 1914 fire which destroyed their factory. Alexander Graham Bell invented the phone in Salem and held the first public demonstration at the Salem Lyceum Hall. Also Nicola Tesla would create a power plant for Pequot Mills. He was in the area after Mark Twain introduced him to John Hammond Sr.. Tesla would give his son, John Hammond Jr. the patents for remote control which Hammond used to develop guided missiles and boats for the military during WWII. Tesla would conduct tests on ESP at Hammond Castle using a Faraday Cage to prove ESP did not transmit through electromagnetic waves, for a psychic received a message from a woman in the cage a few miles away. It was John Hammond Sr. who helped destroy Tesla's plans for free wireless electricity since he just invested heavily in a copper mine that was going to create electrical lines for transmission. Also Elihu Thomson had his Thomson-Houston Electric Company in the bordering town of Lynn and lived in the other border town Swampscott. This company will be merged with Edison Electric Company to make General Electric. Many of these Salem inventors' inventions are still displayed in the Smithsonian in the electricity display room.|$|E

40|$|Display signs usually {{consist of}} <b>lightbulbs</b> {{organized}} into a matrix and {{are capable of}} dynamically displaying messages. Since not every message uses every available bulb, {{it is possible to}} optimize the production costs of such signs by reducing the number of bulbs on the sign. As with all optimization problems, we are confronted with the two opposing goals: a) we would like to use as few <b>lightbulbs</b> as possible and b) we require the displayed messages to be readable. In our thesis, we implemented several optimization algorithms for searching through state space of lightbulbs' configurations, trying to find the most optimal position of the <b>lightbulbs.</b> We estimate the optimality of the solution using a heuristical estimate which we developed and proposed especially for our approach. The proposed estimate estimates a quality with which a sign with certain configuration of <b>lightbulbs</b> is capable to represent a set of selected symbols. The estimate takes into consideration number of used bulbs and favors such configurations with less bulbs. Among the implemented algorithms, the harmony search has shown to be the most successful in this task. Its solutions had best quality values and on consecutive searches showed the most consistent behaviour. ...|$|R
