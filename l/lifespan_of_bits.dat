40|$|Bit {{products}} are {{those which are}} expressed in binary 0 and 1, they are distributed over data networks and stored in the form <b>of</b> <b>bit</b> stream. And the market structure <b>of</b> <b>bit</b> product differs from traditional physical products very much; there exist a widely popular phenomenon of “winner takes all” and long-tail market. This paper discusses what strengths the monopoly tendency while compelling the market environment becomes more competitive and why the structure is unstable. It’s the positive feedback of a synthetic function of economy of scale, network effect, lock-in effect and economy of scope that makes the market favor monopolization. At the same time, the short <b>lifespan</b> <b>of</b> <b>bit</b> product and differentiation guarantees the fierce competition. What’s more, technological innovations bring changes to market structures and accelerate the dynamic evolution...|$|R
40|$|Human {{beings are}} {{entering}} {{an era of}} big data, where information is explosively increasing each year [1]. The fast growth of big data centres enabling massive amounts of information to be processed and stored is motivating scientists to study and record phenomena that last over centuries, which emerge as long data [2]. In this regards, continuously reading and writing the information in a single storage device over centuries without changing its baseline is essential for long data storage. This stringent requirement represents an insuperable challenge to the current big data centres enabled by magnetic hard disc drives with a unit capacity of ~ 1 TB and a typical <b>lifespan</b> <b>of</b> 2 - 3 years. On the other hand, optical disks have relatively long lifespan {{for a couple of}} decades and remove the necessity of frequent data migration every 2 - 3 years of hard disk drives. However, the diffraction barrier of light restricts the maximum storage capacity of optical disks to far below one Terabyte. Thus, optical discs have not {{played a key role in}} long data storage. In this paper, we demonstrate the super-resolution photoinduction-inhibited nanolithography (SPIN) technique [3] enabled ultra-high capacity optical recording for big data. As an essential step toward long data storage, we increase Young's modulus of the polymer composites by two-order of magnitude through the in-phase incorporation of ceramic components, leading to an enhanced <b>lifespan</b> <b>of</b> recorded <b>bits</b> toward 500 years. This feature is confirmed through the accelerated aging experiment when heated at different temperatures. Thus, continuously recording and reading information in an optical disk over centuries without changing the baseline has been demonstrated. In addition, the development of SPIN technique in such a medium can confine the recording at a nanometer scale toward multiple tens of Terabytes in a single optical disk, revealing the potential of optical storage in recording the long processes in astronomy, geology, biology and history...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAlthough {{many studies}} have shown that there are {{trade-offs}} between longevity and reproduction, whether such trade-offs exist in humans has been a matter of debate [1, 2]. In many species, including humans, males live shorter than females, which could be due to the action of male sex hormones. Castration, which removes the source of male sex hormones, prolongs male lifespan in many animals, but this issue has been debated in humans [3]. To examine the effects of castration on longevity, we analyzed the <b>lifespan</b> <b>of</b> historical Korean eunuchs. Korean eunuchs preserved their lineage by adopting castrated boys. We studied the genealogy records of Korean eunuchs and determined the <b>lifespan</b> <b>of</b> 81 eunuchs. The average <b>lifespan</b> <b>of</b> eunuchs was 70. 0 ± 1. 76 years, which was 14. 4 – 19. 1 years longer than the <b>lifespan</b> <b>of</b> non-castrated men of similar socio-economic status. Our study supports the idea that male sex hormones decrease the <b>lifespan</b> <b>of</b> men...|$|R

40|$|The Cane Corso Italiano belongs {{among the}} new dog breeds that were fully {{recognised}} by Federation Cynologique Internationale (FCI) in 2007. For the first time, this study describes a median lifespan using the data of 232 dogs of the Cane Corso Italiano breed collected from kennels and individual owners from 25 countries. The median <b>lifespan</b> <b>of</b> the whole examined group is 9. 29 years (IQR 6. 98 - 11. 12, IQR = Interquartile Range). This paper {{is the first to}} describe the possible relationship between median lifespan and hair colour within one breed. The longest living group is formed by black brindle coloured dogs, with a median of 10. 30 years (IQR 8. 33 - 13. 00), and brindle coloured dogs, with a median of 10. 13 years (IQR 7. 12 - 11. 25). The median <b>lifespan</b> <b>of</b> black brindle dogs exceeded the overall median <b>lifespan</b> <b>of</b> all dogs by 1. 01 year and the median <b>lifespan</b> <b>of</b> other colour dogs by 2. 21 years.
