5|$|McCabe married Edna May Linton on 5 February 1935 at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, and {{the couple}} had two {{children}}, {{a son and a}} daughter, born in 1939 and 1950 respectively. The devout McCabe sent both of his children to Catholic boarding schools even though the family home was nearby. Plagued by ill-health in his middle age, McCabe’s fitness was further hindered by his feet, which prevented him from exercising. He thus gained a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight,</b> and heavy smoking wore down his body, as did the large amount of people who wanted to meet him. McCabe weakened significantly {{in the last two years}} of his life and was hospitalised for a period for liver problems. He was released from hospital soon before his death, but still aged 58, was a very frail man who moved very tentatively.|$|E

25|$|Back on tour, Tallchief saw {{her parents}} in Los Angeles. Seeing Tallchief's frail appearance– she had lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> from a {{combination}} of poor nutrition and stress– and her minor role in The Snow Maiden, her mother attempted to persuade Tallchief to quit ballet and return to piano. Ruth Tallchief changed her mind when Lichine showed her Martin's column and explained that he was America's top dance critic. Tallchief's second year with Ballet Russe brought bigger roles. She was a soloist in Le Beau Danube and got the lead in Ancient Russia, another Nijinska ballet.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for Chappell, {{his health}} was now blighted by {{recurring}} tonsillitis {{and he found}} it difficult to bat for long periods during the 1974–75 Ashes series. He was the backbone of Australia's sometimes inconsistent batting, scoring 608 runs at 55.3. At Sydney, where Australia won to reclaim the Ashes, Chappell dominated with 84 and 144, which he followed up with a century in a losing cause in the sixth Test at Melbourne. At Perth, he broke the world record for a fielder by snaring seven catches. Ironically, his grandfather Vic Richardson was one of several players who held the old record of six. Chappell reluctantly had his tonsils removed, but he quickly lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> which affected his performance on the tour of England that followed. He played in the World Cup (for what proved to be the only time), then made only one good score (73* at Lords) in the four Ashes Tests that followed.|$|E

But I cut my hair off, lost <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight,</b> glammed up, and ran it up the flagpole - and it worked! It worked all the way to a Grammy, which was kind of surprising.

[...] Just prior to the 2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season opener for the 2006 Michigan Wolverines football team, Schilling was diagnosed with mononucleosis. [...] This caused him to miss several weeks of practice. In late October, he decided to redshirt and have a second shoulder surgery after having missed weeks of practice and lost <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight.</b> [...] As part of his transition from a Wing T offense that rarely passed, Schilling had to work on improving his pass blocking.|$|R

500|$|The group reconvened in September 1977, but Townshend {{announced}} {{there would}} be no live performances for the immediate future, a decision that Daltrey endorsed. By this point, Moon was so unhealthy that the Who conceded {{it would be difficult for}} him to cope with touring. The only gig that year was an informal show on 15 December at the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn, London, filmed for the documentary, The Kids Are Alright. The band had not played for 14 months, and their performance was so weak that the footage was unused. Moon's playing was particularly lacklustre and he had gained a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight,</b> though Daltrey later said, [...] "even at his worst, Keith Moon was amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, {{composer}} Tyler Bates {{began work}} on the film, describing the score as having [...] "beautiful themes {{on the top and}} large choir," [...] but [...] "tempered with some extreme heaviness."

Bates said that the score had [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and intensity in {{the low end of the}} percussion" [...] that Snyder found agreeable to the film. The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and features the vocals of Azam Ali. A standard edition and a special edition of the soundtrack containing 25 tracks was released on March 6, 2007, with the special edition containing a 16-page booklet and three two-sided trading cards.|$|E

The subsequent 1988 Castro Street Fair was named [...] "A Tribute to Sylvester," [...] and although he was too ill to attend, crowds chanted his name {{to such an extent that}} he was able to hear them from his bedroom. He continued to give interviews to the media, being open about the fact that he was dying of AIDS, and sought in particular to highlight the impact that the disease was having in the African-American community. In an interview with the NME, he stated, [...] "I don't believe that AIDS is the wrath of God. People have a tendency to blame everything on God." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach to}} graph clustering {{is based on}} the intuitive notion of intracluster density versus intercluster sparsity. As for the weighted case, clusters should accumulate <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight,</b> in contrast to their connection to the remaining graph, which should be light. While both formalizations and algorithms focusing on particular aspects of this rather vague concept have been proposed, no conclusive argument on their appropriateness has been given. In order to deepen the understanding of particular concepts, including both quality assessment as well as designing new algorithms, we conducted an experimental evaluation of graph-clustering approaches. By combining proved techniques from graph partitioning and geometric clustering, we also introduce a new approach that compares favorably...|$|R

500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight.</b> While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but I always had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved this because it meant she was allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly". The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.|$|E

And she lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> so that if you looked at her, you would say she could pass from the arms up as a dancer. She's an amazing actor. I can't act like that. But to say that she did all of the dancing is {{absolutely}} ridiculous to anyone that knows anything about ballet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most modern monohull boats have fin keels, {{which are}} heavy and deep, but short in {{relation}} to the hull length. More traditional yachts carried a full keel which is generally half or more of the length of the boat. A recent feature is a winged keel, which is short and shallow, but carries a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> in two [...] "wings" [...] which run sideways from {{the main part of the}} keel. Even more recent is the concept of canting keels, designed to move the weight at the bottom of a sailboat to the upwind side, allowing the boat to carry more sails.|$|E
50|$|Another {{potential}} {{reason for}} the inconsistency in these findings is {{that the number of}} items in the original scale is insufficient. Normally, three or more “strongly loaded” items (i.e. items that carry a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> statistical <b>weight</b> or importance) are needed to ensure the reliability of these factors. The 25 item CD-RISC does not always stick to these guidelines. For example, Factor 5 (spiritual influences) only has two items that support it. Because of the discrepancies in these findings surrounding factor structure, the subscales of the original CD-RISC are not recommended to be used alone.|$|R
50|$|In a subplot, Cartman devises {{a scheme}} to earn money after {{discovering}} that Jared {{did not have to}} eat sandwiches to lose weight. He proposes that Butters gain <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and then become fit by other means, while pretending that he lost weight by eating at City Wok. After striking a deal with the manager of the restaurant to film several commercials, Butters manages to gain the weight, but finds himself unable to lose it, and the boys resort to liposuction. As they perform the operation, Butters' parents return home, and ground him for performing surgery in the house. When it is time to film the commercials, Butters states he is grounded and will not leave; however, the boys manage to convince him to come as Cartman stays behind at Butters' house to cover for him. Butters' parents call the house, with Cartman replying to them each time with crude language. Meanwhile, when Stan discovers City Wok's owner will only pay them 15 dollars, he severs the deal, and Butters returns home. Just before Butters' parents arrive, Cartman brings over a lawn chair, a drink, and a bucket of popcorn, then sits outside and watches as Butters' parents ruthlessly beat him for the language that Cartman, pretending to be Butters, used on the phone.|$|R
50|$|King Offa's {{currency}} reform replaced the sceat with the silver penny. This coin {{was derived from}} half of a silver dirhem. The weights were then derived by a count of coins, by a mix of Charlemagne and Roman systems. A shilling was set to twelve pence, an ounce to twenty pence, and a pound to twelve ounces or twenty shillings. The penny was quite a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money, so <b>weight</b> by coins was not a general practice.|$|R
2500|$|When Maria Luisa {{arrived in}} Lucca, {{she was already}} thirty-five years old. Ten years of endless struggles had taken their toll: her youth was gone and she had gained a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight.</b> Nevertheless, she set her sights on a new marriage. She first {{addressed}} Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who was a widower, and also her first cousin, possibly {{with the idea of}} securing her position in Lucca and gaining a foothold in Florence. After this failed, she tried Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este but this failed as well. After the assassination of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, in 1820, there were plans to marry her to his father, the future King Charles X of France.|$|E
2500|$|Muto was {{in charge}} of the script for eleven out of the twenty-four episodes.

[...] "Director Furuhashi as well as Ubukata-san, who is a novelist, both put a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> on the dialogues", Muto said. Suga commented that [...] "ompared to other works, the script for Le Chevalier D'Eon is enormous", noting that one episode had a one hundred-page script. Muto noted that their main focus while writing was the [...] "...'emotion' of each character". Muto was present during the productions' post-recording sessions, primarily because he believed that it would be easier for the staff to have a writer on-hand in case problems arose during recordings.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, Raj Kapoor {{started playing}} roles of fathers in films like Kal Aaj Aur Kal in 1971 and Dharam Karam in 1974 and {{had put on}} a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and films with Dilip Kumar as lead hero were {{failures}} {{at the box office}} [...] Some of the hurriedly made films with Dev Anand as the leading man—three each opposite Hema Malini - Shareef Badmaash, Jaaneman, Joshila and two with Zeenat Aman - Ishq Ishq Ishq and Prem Shastra and Yeh Gulistaan Hamara with Sharmila Tagore—became flops and posed a threat to his career as leading man. But he delivered commercial hits again with young heroines Yogeeta Bali and Raakhee in Banarasi Babu (1973), with Hema Malini in Chhupa Rustam (1973) and Amir Garib (1974), with Zeenat Aman in Heera Panna (1973), Warrant (1975) Kalabaaz and Darling Darling (1977) and with Parveen Babi in Bullet (1976).|$|E
50|$|Historically, mobile robots {{have been}} {{designed}} to be statically stable, which results in the robot not needing to expend energy while standing still. This is typically achieved through the use of three or more wheels on a base. In order to avoid tipping, these statically-stable mobile robots have a wide base for a large polygon of support, and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> dead <b>weight</b> in the base to lower the center of gravity. They also tend to have low acceleration or deceleration to avoid tipping. The wide base makes it difficult for statically-stable mobile robots to navigate cluttered human environments. Moreover, these robots have several other limitations that make them poorly suited to a constantly changing human environment. They can neither roll in any direction, nor can they turn in place.|$|R
5000|$|Bridges {{came in and}} redshirted his {{freshman}} season and assisted in scouting players. In Bridges's first year with Villanova he appeared in all 40 games for the Wildcats.

He had a key role coming off the bench in the 2016 NCAA Tournament, scored 11 points in a Final Four rout of the Oklahoma Sooners. Bridges won the NCAA championship along with his teammates for the school {{for the first time since}} 1985. He averaged 6.4 points, 3.2 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game as a freshman.

50|$|Upon {{his release}} from prison, Joe manages {{to go up to}} Bantamweight, after {{provoking}} a champion boxer named Wolf Kanagushi. Joe quickly raises up and gains popularity for his brawling style, and trademark cross-counter KO wins. Joe manages to perform a triple-cross counter on Wolf. Joe then earns the right to fight Rikiishi in the professional ring. Although Rikiishi is assured a promising career, he is intent in settling his score with Joe, whom he feels stands in his path. Because Rikiishi is three weight classes above Joe, he has to cut down on <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and go under a super-strenuous weight loss program. Rikiishi defeats Joe in the 8th round with but collapses as he is about to shake Joe's hand due to an extremely hard blow to the temple two rounds before and him landing his head on the ropes. Rikiishi dies from the combined effects <b>of</b> the extreme <b>weight</b> loss on his body and brain hemorrage suffered during the fight. Joe is still shaken up from that match, both mentally and physically. Soon after, during matches, his trainer Danpei realises that Joe is having a serious problem with boxing: he is not giving shots to the face. It takes Joe quite some time to get over it and costs him three straight losses. But then he finally conquers his fears when he faces the globally #6 ranked Carlos Rivera. The fight ends with a draw, yet it gives Joe tremendous fame and respect around the world, especially since Rivera was going to face the World Champion Jose Mendoza in his next match.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{talk show}} host Kyle is known to react with hostility and anger towards those who he sees as having acted immorally, is seen as having a patronising, [...] "holier-than-thou" [...] {{attitude}} towards many of his guests, and is accused of exploiting the vulnerable. However, he does claim that he is acting {{in the best interests}} of his guests and is intent on helping to solve their personal problems. There have been success stories as a result of guests being on the show, such as the case of a morbidly obese young woman who lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> after her appearance on the show. Graham Stanier told The Observer that he was [...] "immensely proud" [...] of the help provided to the show's guests, with [...] "full shows of people coming back on the programme who have been successful in overcoming drug, alcohol or relationship problems, through the care that we have provided".|$|E
2500|$|I have {{a theory}} about what caused her vocal decline, but it's more from {{watching}} her sing than from listening. I really think it was her weight loss that was so dramatic and so quick. It's not the weight loss per se—you know, Deborah Voigt has lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it's suddenly gone and one doesn't develop another musculature for support, {{it can be very}} hard on the voice. And you can't estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. I was told, by somebody who knew her well, that the way Callas held her arms to her solar plexus [...] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette, it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire, the stuff that requires the most stamina, the most strength.|$|E
2500|$|Octave Chanute {{organized}} the International Conference on Aerial Navigation in 1893, during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. From there, {{in conjunction with}} his contacts in Europe, he joined with younger experimenters, including Augustus Herring and William Avery. In 1896 and 1897 they tested hang gliders based on designs by German aviator Otto Lilienthal. They also tested their own hang glider design. To open the steady winds, {{they came to the}} shores of Lake Michigan in the town of Miller Beach. The location is today in Marquette Park. These experiments convinced Chanute and his partners to achieve the extra lift needed without a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> was to place stack several wings one above the other. The idea was originally proposed by British engineer Francis Wenham in 1866 and tested by Lilienthal in the 1890s. Chanute invented the [...] "strut-wire" [...] braced wing structure to hold the several wings together, which became the standard design in powered biplanes. The Strut wire design came from Chanutes bridge designs using the Pratt truss. The Wright brothers, based their Flyer designs on the Chanute [...] "double-decker.".|$|E

5000|$|On 10 July 2015, it was {{reported}} by Paraguay's ABC Color that Uchida had been detached from Deportivo Santaní {{and was unable to}} return to Japan. Uchida, who could not speak much Spanish, had visited the ABC to inform the difficulty that he was living due to his agent, Kazunori Sato, who had apparently abandoned the player. A letter which was signed by Uchida's lawyer revealed his problem and stated as to why the player could not return to Japan. Uchida stated [...] "During the five months of contract with Santaní, I haven't been able to receive my salaries and despite my requests of help from Mr. Sato, he only responds to me evasively, which is why I feel abandoned on my luck". The main issue was that Uchida could not understand the language and explained that his agent, Sato, had included things in their contract which Uchida did not understand at the time. Sato had instered in the contracted a pay out sum of US$18, 000 in order to release Uchida from his services. Uchida thanked Deportivo Santaní, who had provided accommodation for him at the Victoria Complex in Ypacaraí and it was thanks to them that Uchida did not go hungry. However, Uchida explained that because of the loneliness and preoccupation he lost <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight.</b> He also explained that when the San Pedro outfit would not stay at the Victoria Complex for concentration, Uchida had to abandon the place and stay at a hotel {{that he would have to}} pay from his own wallet.

Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?'

[...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> room for sort of soft, and gentle psychology.
