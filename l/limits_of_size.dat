Atomically-thin two-dimensional crystals offer a new approach for tuning the energies of the electronic states based on the interplay between the environmental sensitivity and unusual strength of the Coulomb interaction in these materials. By engineering the surrounding dielectric environment, we are able to tune the electronic bandgap in monolayers of WS 2 and WSe 2 by hundreds of meV. We exploit this behavior to present an in-plane dielectric heterostructure with a spatially dependent bandgap, illustrating the feasibility of our approach for the creation of lateral junctions with nanoscale resolution. This successful demonstration of bandgap engineering based on the non-invasive modification of the Coulomb interaction should enable the design of a new class of atomically thin devices to advance the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> and functionality for solid-state technologies...|$|E

This {{is known as}} the Lindemann criterion, first introduced in the year of 1910 by Lindemann. However, Chakravarty et al. demonstrated that this common wisdom is inadequate because the MSD at melting can be temperature dependent when pressure is also allowed to vary along the coexistence line of the phase diagram [Chakravarty C, Debenedetti P G and Stillinger F H 2007 J.

In this so-called "von Neumann" architecture, computation speed is limited mainly by {{the time required to}} transfer data between the processor and memory. This limiting factor has been referred to as the "von Neumann bottleneck". The concern that the miniaturization of silicon-based integrated circuits will soon reach theoretical <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> and gate times has led to increased interest in parallel architectures and also spurred research into alternatives to silicon-based implementations of processors. Meanwhile, sequential processors continue to be produced that have increased clock rates and an increase in memory locally available to a processor, and an increase in the rate at which data can be transferred to and from memories, networks, and remote storage. The efficiency of compilers and operating systems is also improving over time. Although such characteristics limit maximum performance, a large improvement in the speed of scientific computations can often be achieved by utilizing more efficient algorithms, particularly those that support parallel computation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of thin films, {{in the context}} of ongoing reduction in the size of electronic systems, poses challenging questions for the materials sciences of multifunctional nanostructures. These include the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> reduction, integration of heterogeneous functions, and system characterization or process control at an atomic scale. We present here different studies devoted to perovskite oxide materials (or materials with derived structure), where in specific directions of the crystal structure the atomic organization decreases down to a few nanometers, thus building nanostructures. In these materials, very original physical phenomena are observed in multilayers or superlattices, nanowires (NWs) or nanodots, mainly because strain, surfaces, and interfaces play here a predominant role and can tune the physical properties. Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) routes have been used for the synthesis of oxide materials. We first introduce the basic rules governing the choice of metal-organic precursors for the MOCVD reaction. Next we discuss the principles of the pulsed injection MOCVD system. A laser-assisted MOCVD system, designed to the direct growth of 2 D and 3 D photonic structures, will also be described. Selected case studies will finally be presented, illustrating the powerful {{development of}} different oxide nanostructures based on dielectric, ferroelectric, or superconducting oxides, manganites, and nickelates, as well as first results related to the growth of ZnO NWs...|$|E
40|$|Capsule {{endoscopy}} is used {{to examine}} the gastrointestinal tract, primarily the small intestines. The transformation of endoscopic capsules from passive to active systems, will save resources and make capsule endoscopy more applicable. An active endoscopic capsule wants to integrate the possibility for biopsy and smaller gastrointestinal surgeries. For this to be achievable, the robot pill needs a well-working propulsion system. This thesis work aims to optimize a design for optimum propulsion and realize a prototype. The analysis of the different propulsion systems, researched within this scientific field, shows that the two main groups of systems are expanding and non-expanding design. Expanding systems use features to expand their body, to anchor themselves in the intestinal walls, before they achieve propulsion. To stay within the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> and power of an in vivo system, this study focuses on the non-expanding systems. The result is a single actuated, wheeled design. The prototype performed very promising in the propulsion testing. However, some problems with the testing environment, and diameter of the intestine specimen, prevents this study to draw an indisputable conclusion onto whether the resulting propulsion system is the optimum. But the results and space efficient design is a reliable alternative for robot pills. With some further testing, it is reasonable to believe that this system {{will have an impact on}} future endoscopic capsules...|$|E

40|$|Chitin, a {{nitrogen-containing}} polysaccharide, is {{the chief}} structural element in the cell walls of fungi and in the integument of arthropods. Structurally chitin resembles cellulose, the unit of structure being the acetyl-giucosamine residue instead of the glucose residue (Meyer and Mark, 1930). Organized chitin is optically anisotropic and exhibits birefringence which is ordinarily positive I {{in relation to the}} principal axis of the structure in which it occurs. Attempts to analyze the double refraction of chitin by means of the imbibition technique of Ambronn (Ambronn and Frey, 1926) have ascribed to it two components: (1) a positive double refraction due to the parallel arrangement of minute, submicroscopic micelles 2 of chitin imbedded in another medium (form birefringence), and (2) a negative double refraction of the crystalline micelles themselves. The latter, if correct, is remarkable since the micelle of cellulose is strongly optically positive. The theory of the imbibition technique as developed by Ambronn may be briefly stated as follows (see Ambronn and Frey, 1926; Schmidt, 1934; Frey-Wyssling, 1935). Bodies exhibiting form birefringence are two phase systems, consisting usually of a solid framework permeated by a continuous medium such as gas or liquid. If the dimensions of the solid units and the spaces between them are small in 1 Birefringence is referred to as positive in relation to some axis when the greatest index of refraction of the substance, nT, is parallel to, negative when n 7 is perpendicular to that axis. Micelle is here used in the sense of Naegeli to denote an aggregate of submicroscopic dimensions of smaller chemical units. Polarization optics can assign no definite <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> to the miceUe, but can only tell us that it is an elongate structure. For cellulose, a recent estimate of the miceUar dimensions is 60...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we examine}} the {{evolution}} of irradiated clouds using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) algorithm coupled with a ray-tracing scheme that calculates {{the position of the}} ionisation-front at each timestep. We present results from simulations performed for three choices of IR-flux spanning the range of fluxes emitted by a typical B-type star to a cluster of OB-type stars. The extent of photo-ablation, of course, depends on the strength of the incident flux and a strong flux of IR severely ablates a MC. Consequently, the first star-formation sites appear in the dense shocked layer along the edges of the irradiated cloud. Radiation-induced turbulence readily generates dense filamentary structure within the photo-ablated cloud although several new star-forming sites also appear in some of the densest regions at the junctions of these filaments. Prevalent physical conditions within a MC {{play a crucial role in}} determining the mode, i. e., filamentary as compared to isolated pockets, of star-formation, the timescale on which stars form and the distribution of stellar masses. The probability density functions (PDFs) derived for irradiated clouds in this study are intriguing due to their resemblance with those presented in a recent census of irradiated MCs. Furthermore, irrespective of the nature of turbulence, the protostellar mass-functions(MFs) derived in this study follow a power-law distribution. When turbulence within the cloud is driven by a relatively strong flux of IR such as that emitted by a massive O-type star or a cluster of such stars, the MF approaches the canonical form due to Salpeter, and even turns-over for protostellar masses smaller than ∼ 0. 2 M_.

40|$|The use of block {{polymers}} continues to gain attention with their myriad applications in industry for advanced applications in biology, medicine, electronics, and separations. The ability of {{block polymers}} to self assemble into ordered {{states on the}} nanometer level makes these materials suitable for applications that mandate structural order on this scale. By tuning the chemistry of these block domains, we may explore their utilization for advanced separations. ^ In this dossier, we detail the efforts into the controlled radical polymerization of polyisoprene-b-polystyrene-b-poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PI-PS-PDMA) via. a facile reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) mechanism. For this high molecular weight block polymer synthesis, it was experimentally established that rate retardation occurred during {{the addition of the}} PS and PDMA domains. Utilizing ab initio methods, it was determined that this rate retardation may be attributed to slow intermediate radical termination. ^ Utilizing a scalable self-assembly and non-solvent induced phase separation (SNIPS) technique, casting a solution of PI-PS-PDMA as a convectively drying thin film before quenching in water affords an anisotropic, size-selective membrane template. Scanning electron microscopy imaging of these films yielded a pore density on the order of 1013 pores m- 2 with pore sizes down to less than 1 nm, pushing the observed <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> separation observed using block polymer membranes. ^ Upon fashioning PI-PS-PDMA into membrane devices, the PDMA interior may be deprotected to a polyacrylic acid (PAA) functionality. Facile amidation chemistry of these deprotected PI-PS-P(Acrylate) templates to PI-PS-PAA membranes demonstrates these devices are versatile in their tunable capacity for size and chemistry separation of target analytes (e. g., small molecules and heavy metal salts). ^ By incorporation of acrylate block chemistries into a PI-PS support, the potential for low pore sizes for separation of salts and small molecules using block polymers are possible. By integrating the tunable block polymer chemistry to enable chemical tuning of pores, precise chemo-selective control may be made for targeted elution of analytes and fouling resistant membranes for advanced reverse osmosis (RO) and small molecule purification for application in industry. ...|$|E
