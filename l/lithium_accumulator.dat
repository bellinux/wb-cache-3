40|$|The EC-directive 91 / 338 /EWG puts {{a ban on}} cadmium {{for special}} {{applications}}. In the FRG, for all applications included in that directive cadmium is already substituted today. The substitution of cadmium stabilizers will be completed in the near future. The use of cadmium for corrosion protection has been also greatly diminished. Only the substitution of cadmium pigments in red and yellow "high engineering plastics" and keramic glazes cannot be realized presently. The substitution of cadmium for the colouring of plastics lags behind the technical feasibilities. The nickel/hydrogen accumulator, which is available now, and the <b>lithium</b> <b>accumulator</b> will probably cut back the growing consumpton rate of cadmium for sealed nickel/cadmium cells. There are sufficiently large capacities for the recycling of nickel/cadmium accumulators available {{but the number of}} accumulators returned is still low. Although the EC-directive 91 / 157 allows a deposit on batteries containing environmetally hazardous su bstances, its introduction is not currently planned. Cadmium polluted zinc, lead and copper and especially phosphate fertilizers are responsible for a considerable amount of cadmium input into the environment. A threshold limit for cadmium in phosphate ferilizers for the entire EC is not to be expected in the near future...|$|E

40|$|The Pios {{fuel cell}} {{tricycle}} {{was designed and}} built to make hydrogen and fuel cell technology visible and cycleable for {{the public and the}} media. However, with its impressive cruising range of about 800 km, it {{is much more than a}} demonstration vehicle for fairs. The tricycle is allowed to use the roads as a cycle with an additional electrical engine or as a small motor bike up to 45 km/hr without restriction. The vehicle is built with components that are available at the still limited market for hydrogen technology and electric bicycle parts. The hydrogen tank for compressed hydrogen can be refilled from standard hydrogen bottles to a pressure up to ~ 180 bar. The fuel cell tricycle is a completely integrated system of a fuel cell, peripheral devices, and hydrogen supply. It is connected to an electrical engine, over a DC-DC-converter, an energy buffer (<b>lithium</b> polymer <b>accumulator)</b> and a motor controller (four-quadrant-synchronous-three-phase-motor controller, which means forward and backward driving and regenerative braking) ...|$|R
