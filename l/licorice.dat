While a number of small studies show possible benefit from monolaurin, L-lysine, aspirin, lemon balm, topical zinc, or <b>licorice</b> root cream in treatment, these preliminary studies have not been confirmed by higher-quality randomized controlled studies.|$|E
5|$|Breaking the day's fasting {{traditionally}} {{begins with}} the brief consumption of dates and a chilled beverage. Palestinians make a variety of fruit-based beverages, including the flavors, tamar Hindi or tamarind, sous or <b>licorice,</b> kharroub or carob and Qamar Eddine. Tamar Hindi is made by soaking tamarinds in water for many hours, then straining, sweetening and mixing it with rose water and lemon juice. Kharroub is made similarly except instead of tamarind, carob is used. Qamar Eddine is made of dried apricots boiled into a liquid and chilled.|$|E
5|$|The menu {{is created}} by Bosi. He has been {{described}} as an innovator and his work has been compared to that of Heston Blumenthal at The Fat Duck. One of the new dishes Bosi introduced following his move to London was a two-part pork dish. The first part was roasted suckling pig served with sea urchin, kohlrabi and a fondant of sweet potato. The second, inspired by his daughter, featured a sausage roll with a salad and a truffle dressing. Other dishes have included roast chicken with an onion fondue and <b>licorice,</b> and desserts include a chocolate tart served with basil ice cream.|$|E
5|$|A more {{coherent}} Walter explains that, {{according to}} the Observer September, the Observers made the Earth uninhabitable by 2609, and so traveled {{back in time to}} take over the planet themselves. As forces corner the three, Walter sets up an antimatter device to wipe out the Massive Dynamic building and their pursuers. Walter is able to lead Simon and Etta to where Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) and William Bell have been encased in amber. They are able to free Astrid, but as Fringe forces approach they find the equipment to free the others has malfunctioned. Simon sacrifices himself to the amber in order to push Peter free, while Walter severs Bell's hand for an unknown purpose. They escape the area as Broyles and his team arrive, though Broyles finds a piece of <b>licorice,</b> a telltale sign of Walter's presence. As the group travels away from the city, Walter, in an ominous manner, reminds Astrid of what Bell did to Olivia (Anna Torv). Peter then comes to recognize Etta as his daughter, Henrietta, wearing a fired bullet as a necklace.|$|E
25|$|Many {{adverse effects}} of <b>licorice</b> {{poisoning}} can be seen and most are attributed to the mineralocorticoid effects of GZA. Depending on the dose and intake of <b>licorice,</b> serious problems and even hospitalization can arise. People with previously existing heart or kidney problems may be more susceptible to GZA and <b>licorice</b> poisoning. It is important to monitor the amount of <b>licorice</b> consumed {{in order to prevent}} toxicity. It is difficult to determine a safe level, due to many varying factors from person to person. In the most sensitive individuals, daily intake of about 100mg GZA can cause problems. This is equivalent to 50 g <b>licorice</b> sweets. However, in most people, they can consume up to 400mg before experiencing symptoms, which would be about 200 g <b>licorice</b> sweets. A rule of thumb says a normal healthy person can consume 10mg GZA a day.|$|E

25|$|<b>Licorice,</b> {{which has}} {{indirect}} mineralocorticoid activity by inhibiting mineralocorticoid metabolism, {{has been found}} in studies to inhibit the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone. Moreover, the addition of <b>licorice</b> to spironolactone has been found to reduce the antimineralocorticoid side effects of spironolactone in women treated with the drug for hyperandrogenism, and <b>licorice</b> may hence be used to reduce these side effects in women treated with spironolactone as an antiandrogen who are bothered by them. On {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum, spironolactone is clinically useful in reversing licorice-induced hypokalemia.|$|E

25|$|<b>Licorice</b> is {{an extract}} from the Glycyrrhiza glabra plant which {{contains}} glycyrrhizic acid, or GZA. GZA {{is made of}} one molecule of glycyrrhetic acid and two molecules of glucuronic acid.|$|E
25|$|Hoxsey herbal {{treatments}} {{include a}} topical paste of antimony, zinc and bloodroot, arsenic, sulfur, and talc for external treatments, and a liquid tonic of <b>licorice,</b> red clover, burdock root, Stillingia root, barberry, Cascara, prickly ash bark, buckthorn bark, and potassium iodide for internal consumption.|$|E
25|$|The term {{root crops}} refers to any edible {{underground}} plant structure, but many root crops are actually stems, such as potato tubers. Edible roots include cassava, sweet potato, beet, carrot, rutabaga, turnip, parsnip, radish, yam and horseradish. Spices obtained from roots include sassafras, angelica, sarsaparilla and <b>licorice.</b>|$|E
25|$|Contaminated water smelled sweet, {{resembling}} <b>licorice.</b> According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, if {{consumed the}} chemical may provoke the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, diarrhea, reddened/burning skin and/or eyes, itching, and rashes. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists stated that MCHM caused headaches, eye and skin irritation, and difficulty breathing from prolonged exposures at high concentrations.|$|E
25|$|The {{extracts}} from {{the root of}} the plant can also be referred to as <b>licorice,</b> sweet root, and glycyrrhiza extract. G. glabra grows in subtropical climates in Europe, the Middle East, and Western Asia. When administered orally, the product of glycyrrhetic acid is found in human urine whereas GZA is not. This shows that glycyrrhetic acid is absorbed and metabolized in the intestines in humans. GZA is hydrolyzed to glycyrrhetic acid in the intestines by bacteria.|$|E
25|$|As a food, dried wolfberries are {{traditionally}} cooked before consumption. Dried wolfberries are often added to rice congee and almond jelly, {{as well as}} used in Chinese tonic soups, in combination with chicken or pork, vegetables, and other herbs such as wild yam, Astragalus membranaceus, Codonopsis pilosula, and <b>licorice</b> root. The berries are also boiled as a herbal tea, often along with chrysanthemum flowers and/or red jujubes, or with tea, and packaged teas are also available.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{botanicals}} or flavouring {{agents for}} gin, besides the required juniper, often include citrus elements, such as lemon and bitter orange peel, {{as well as}} a combination of other spices, which may include any of anise, angelica root and seed, orris root, <b>licorice</b> root, cinnamon, almond, cubeb, savory, lime peel, grapefruit peel, dragon eye (longan), saffron, baobab, frankincense, coriander, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cassia bark or others. The different combinations and concentrations of these botanicals in the distillation process cause the variations in taste among gin products.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in intake of <b>licorice</b> can cause many toxic effects. Hyper mineralocorticosteroid syndrome can {{occur when the}} body retains sodium, loses potassium altering biochemical and hormonal activities. Some of these activities include lower aldosterone level, decline of the renin-angiotensin system and increased levels of the atrial natriuretic hormone in order to compensate the variations in homoeostasis. Some other symptoms of toxicity include electrolyte imbalance, oedema, increased blood pressure, weight gain, heart problems, and weakness. Individuals will experience certain symptoms based on the severity of toxicity. Some other complaints include fatigue, shortness of breath, renal failure, and paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{style and}} flavor profile of wines made from Syrah is {{influenced}} by the climate where the grapes are grown with moderate climates (such as the northern Rhone Valley and parts of the Walla Walla AVA in Washington State) tending to produce medium to full-bodied wines with medium-plus to high levels of tannins and notes of blackberry, mint and black pepper. In hot climates (such as Crete, and the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale regions of Australia), Syrah is more consistently full-bodied with softer tannin, jammier fruit and spice notes of <b>licorice,</b> anise and earthy leather. In many regions the acidity and tannin levels of Syrah allow the wines produced to have favorable aging potential.|$|E
25|$|After sitting unused {{for over}} 20 years, {{the car was}} {{restored}} to the same specifications as in the movie. The body of the Pacer was stripped and repainted, the wheels were re-chromed, and the interior was re-covered, all to match the specifications of the screen car. Finally, a modern aftermarket head unit and speakers were added, and are the only aftermarket parts installed on the car, though the original <b>licorice</b> dispenser remains intact. OEM factory parts used to restore the car were all obtained New Old Stock (NOS). The car was sold for $37,000 at the 2016 Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction in Las Vegas, Nevada. In the animated feature film Cars 2, Acer, Tubbs Pacer, Petey Pacer, and Fred Pacer {{are based on a}} 1975 AMC Pacer.|$|E
25|$|DOCG {{regulations}} {{stipulate that}} Barbaresco wines must be aged {{for a minimum}} of 2 years (at least 1 year in oak) prior to release and aged for at least 4 years to be considered a riserva. The wines must have a minimum 12.5% alcohol level though most wines are closer to 13.5%. Well-made examples of Barbaresco wines are expected to be aged at least 5 to 10 years after vintage before they are consumed, as they are extremely tannic and tight in their youth, and some continue to drink well even after 20 years. The typical style of a Barbaresco has bouquets of roses or violets with flavor notes of cherry, truffles, fennel and <b>licorice.</b> As the wine ages, it can develop smoky notes and more earthy and animal flavors like leather and tar.|$|E
25|$|Barolos {{tend to be}} rich, deeply {{concentrated}} full bodied wines with pronounced tannins and acidity. The {{wines are}} almost always lightly colored varying from ruby to garnet in their youth to more brick and orange hues as they age. Like Pinot noir, Barolos are never opaque. Barolos {{have the potential for}} a wide range of complex and exotic aromas with tar and roses being common notes. Other aromas associated with Barolos include camphor, chocolate, dried fruit, damsons, eucalyptus, leather, <b>licorice,</b> mint, mulberries, plum, spice, strawberries, tobacco, white truffles as well as dried and fresh herbs. The tannins of the wine add texture and serve to balance Barolo's moderate to high alcohol levels (Minimum 13% but most often above 15% ABV). Excessive extraction from prolonged maceration periods and oak aging can give the wines an over-extracted bitterness.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{made from}} Nebbiolo are {{characterized}} by their ample amounts of acidity and tannin. Most examples are wines built for aging {{and some of the}} highest quality vintages need significant age (at least a decade or more) before they are palatable to many wine drinkers and can continue to improve in the bottle for upward of 30 years. As Nebbiolo ages, the bouquet becomes more complex and appealing with aromas of tar and roses being the two most common notes. Other aromas associated with Nebbiolo include dried fruit, damsons, leather, <b>licorice,</b> mulberries, spice as well dried and fresh herbs. While Barolo & Barbaresco tend to be the heaviest and most in need of aging, wines made in the modernist style are becoming more approachable at a young age. Lighter styles from Carema, Langhe and Gattinara tend to be ready drink within a few years of vintage. Nebbiolo from California and Australia will vary from producer and quality of vineyard.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} and {{imposing}} 19th-century residence in Buca {{is that of the}} David Forbes the younger, of MacAndrews and Forbes, <b>Licorice</b> manufacturers fame. Situated {{on the top of a}} hill, the mansion has an impressive appearance and view and is being very slowly restored. Buca municipality plans to coincide the restoration with the development of a vast park comprising seven artificial lakes in order to thematize the whole quarter comprising a dozen 19th-century residences. A persisting rumor attributes the unusual curve traced in Buca by the İzmir-Aydın railway, completed in 1866 and crossing right in front of mansions, to the influence of the Forbes family, who would have wanted it closer to their residence for easier rides. But that accomplishment is disputed by the Rees and Baltazzi families who also left magnificent residences to Buca and who claim the curve to be of their own making. The Baltazzis are no other than the maternal family of Baroness Maria Vetsera, of Mayerling Incident fame.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{chewing gum}} was first {{developed}} in the 1860s when chicle was brought from Mexico by the former President, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, to New York, where {{he gave it to}} Thomas Adams for use as a rubber substitute. Chicle did not succeed as a replacement for rubber, but as a gum, which was cut into strips and marketed as Adams New York Chewing Gum in 1871. Black Jack (1884), which is flavored with <b>licorice,</b> Chiclets (1899), and Wrigley's Spearmint Gum were early popular gums that quickly dominated the market and are all still around today. Chewing gum gained worldwide popularity through American GIs in WWII, who were supplied chewing gum as a ration and traded it with locals. Synthetic gums were first introduced to the U.S. after chicle no longer satisfied the needs of making good chewing gum. By the 1960s, US manufacturers had switched to butadiene-based synthetic rubber, as it was cheaper to manufacture.|$|E
500|$|... "Jury Duty" [...] {{was written}} by {{consulting}} producer Aaron Shure, his sixth writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the fifth season. It was directed by Eric Appel, his first directing credit for the series. The episode features a guest appearance from Jack Coleman as Senator Robert Lipton, Angela's husband, who {{first appeared in the}} seventh season episode, [...] "WUPHF.com". The episode marks the first appearance of Jenna Fischer since [...] "Gettysburg". Due to her pregnancy, she was on maternity leave for four episodes. Her pregnancy was written into the series, with Pam and Jim having their second baby. Unlike the sixth season, there was no episode focusing on the baby's birth; it was instead announced on a blog. According to showrunner Paul Lieberstein, she will come back [...] "with very little fanfare". The episode also marks the seventh appearance of Lindsey Broad, who plays Cathy, Pam's replacement during her maternity leave. She appeared in a recurring role for the season, after she initially appeared in [...] "Pam's Replacement". The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Andy getting a friend of his, who starred in the Scranton production of Sweeney Todd, to pretend to be a police officer, only to have Darryl uncover the truth, Dwight telling the camera about a recurring nightmare where he is on trial and all of his co-workers are the members of the jury, and Jim trying to make it up to the office by buying all of the despised black <b>licorice</b> from the vending machines so {{that the rest of the}} office has access to the red <b>licorice.</b> However, his plan goes awry and his co-workers make him eat all of the black <b>licorice</b> as punishment.|$|E
500|$|In 1977, {{at the age}} of 23, Groening {{moved to}} Los Angeles to become a writer. He went through what he {{described}} as [...] "a series of lousy jobs," [...] including being an extra in the television movie When Every Day Was the Fourth of July, busing tables, washing dishes at a nursing home, clerking at the Hollywood <b>Licorice</b> Pizza record store, landscaping in a sewage treatment plant, and chauffeuring and ghostwriting for a retired Western director.|$|E

500|$|Dicoumarol was {{a product}} of the plant {{molecule}} coumarin (not to be confused with Coumadin, a later tradename for warfarin). Coumarin is now known to be present in many plants, and produces the notably sweet smell of freshly cut grass or hay and plants like sweet grass; in fact, the plant's high content of coumarin is responsible for the original common name of [...] "sweet clover", which is named for its sweet smell, not its bitter taste. They are present notably in woodruff (Galium odoratum, Rubiaceae), and at lower levels in <b>licorice,</b> lavender, and various other species. However, coumarins themselves do not influence clotting or warfarin-like action, but must first be metabolized by various fungi into compounds such as 4-hydroxycoumarin, then further (in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde) into dicoumarol, in order to have any anticoagulant properties. Fungal attack of the damaged and dying clover stalks explained the presence of the anticoagulant only in spoiled clover silages; dicoumarol {{is considered to be a}} fermentation product and mycotoxin.|$|E

On April 28, the album {{was released}} in the United Kingdom, Brazil and {{throughout the rest of}} Europe, and on April 29, in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Billboard reported that the title of the album was <b>Licorice,</b> as announced on the Sirius Satellite Radio programme OutQ. In an interview with MTV Australia, Madonna explained that a prominent theme of the Hard Candy album was about incorporating the image of a boxer, an idea which has been repeated within the song [...] "Give It 2 Me". According to her, [...] " [...] is basically [...] I'm not , 'give me all you got' , so it's quite a sort of tough stance." [...] Hence, initially Madonna decided that the title of the song was to be used for the then-unnamed album. This was changed following the release of a similarly named song by Timbaland. After that, Madonna decided to call the album Black Madonna, and even shot a photograph for the cover art, wearing blackface make-up with white eyes.

500|$|In 1985, Milken raised $750 {{million for}} a similar blind pool for Ronald Perelman which would {{ultimately}} prove instrumental in acquiring his biggest target: The Revlon Corporation. [...] In 1980, Ronald Perelman, {{the son of a}} wealthy Philadelphia businessman, and future [...] "corporate raider" [...] having made several small but successful buyouts, acquired MacAndrews & Forbes, a distributor of <b>licorice</b> extract and chocolate that Perelman's father had tried and failed to acquire 10 years earlier. [...] Perelman would ultimately divest the company's core business and use MacAndrews & Forbes as a holding company investment vehicle for subsequent leveraged buyouts including Technicolor, Inc., Pantry Pride and Revlon. [...] Using the Pantry Pride subsidiary of his holding company, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Perelman's overtures were rebuffed. [...] Repeatedly rejected by the company's board and management, Perelman continued to press forward with a hostile takeover raising his offer from an initial bid of $47.50 per share until it reached $53.00 per share. [...] After receiving a higher offer from a white knight, private equity firm Forstmann Little & Company, Perelman's Pantry Pride finally was able to make a successful bid for Revlon, valuing the company at $2.7 billion. [...] The buyout would prove troubling, burdened by a heavy debt load. [...] Under Perelman's control, Revlon sold four divisions: two were sold for $1 billion, its vision care division was sold for $574 million and its National Health Laboratories division was spun out to the public market in 1988. [...] Revlon also made acquisitions including Max Factor in 1987 and Betrix in 1989 later selling them to Procter & Gamble in 1991. [...] Perelman exited the bulk of his holdings in Revlon through an IPO in 1996 and subsequent sales of stock. [...] As of December 31, 2007, Perelman still retains a minority ownership interest in Revlon. [...] The Revlon takeover, because of its well-known brand, was profiled widely by the media and brought new attention to the emerging boom in leveraged buyout activity.|$|E
