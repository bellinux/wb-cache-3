Ribbon T 1 for which ejection overpressure was 1. 5 bar showed typical melt-spun ribbon microstructure consisting of a top layer of small equi-axial grains and columnar grains below.

Further, previous studies showed that the sizes of particles formed by {{all of the above}} given melt ejection mechanisms were greater than 100 nm (i.e., in microscale).

40|$|A {{study of}} the gas {{dynamics}} of the vapor plume generated during laser ablation was conducted including a counterpropagating internal shock wave. The density, pressure, and temperature distributions between the external shock wave front and the sample surface were determined by solving the integrated conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy. The positions of the shock waves and the contact surface (boundary that separates the compressed ambient gas and the vapor plume) were obtained when the incident laser energy that is transferred to the vapor plume and to the background gas, E, and the vaporized sample mass, M, are specified. The values for E and M were obtained from {{a comparison of the}} calculated trajectories of the external shock wave and the contact surface with experimental results for a copper sample under different laser fluences.

Instead of generating a continuous spray with constant flow rate or a constant stream of droplets we have tuned the driving of the electrospraying process {{in such a way that}} we were able to generate well controlled single event electrospraying (SEE) with short voltage pulses.

40|$|An {{integrated}} micropump and electrospray emitter {{system based}} on porous silica monoliths The work presents the design of an integrated system consisting of a high-pressure electroosmotic (EO) micropump and a microporous monolithic emitter, which together generate a stable and robust electrospray. Both the micropump and electrospray emitter are fabricated using a sol–gel process. Upon application of an electric potential of suffi-cient amplitude (. 2 kV), the pump delivers fluids with an electroosmotically induced high pressure (. 1 atm). The same potential is also harnessed to electrostatically generate a stable electrospray at the porous emitter. Electrokinetic coupling between pump and spray produces spray features different from sprays pressurized by independent mechanical pumps. Four typical spray modes, each with different drop sizes and charge-to-mass ratios, are observed and have been characterized. Since the monolith is silica-based, this integrated device {{can be used for}} a variety of fluids, especially organic solvents, without the swelling and shrinking problems that are commonly encountered for polymer monoliths. The maximum pressure generated by a 100 mm id monolithic pump is, 3 atm at an applied voltage of 5 kV. The flow rate can be adjusted in the range of 100 nL/min to 1 mL/min by changing the voltage. For a given applied voltage across the pump and emitter system, it is seen that there exists one unique flow rate for which flow balance is achieved between the delivery of liquid to the emitter by the pump and the <b>liquid</b> <b>ejection</b> from the emitter. Under such a condition, a stable Taylor cone is obtained. The principles that lead to these results are also discussed...|$|E

This phase transition can propagate with the speed of sound, but can also be located at fixed positions {{in the case of a}} standing sound wave. Sonication of a vapor-liquid interface creates a fine dispersion of liquid and vapor, irrespective whether the ultrasound horn is placed in the liquid or the vapor phase. In the absence of an interface, sonication of the <b>liquid</b> leads to <b>ejection</b> of a macroscopic vapor phase from the ultrasound horn with a velocity of several meters per second in the direction of wave propagation.

40|$|Nanoparticles (NPs) of {{different}} materials have found numerous applications {{due to their}} unique properties. For instance, particular attention has been attracted to several very promising medical applications, such as cancer and antibacterial treatment, imaging, censors, etc. Therefore, new methods are required to prepare liquid solutions with NPs using ultra-short and long laser pulses. Laser ablation (LA) is one such simple and versatile technique. The major advantage of the LA method is in its ''green'' character, which means that NPs are almost unaffected chemically. For simulation of multi-stage processes of femtosecond laser ablation of gold target into ambient water we develop the two-temperature wide-range hydrodynamic model [1]. It consistently describes the laser energy absorption, thermal conduction, electron-phonon/ion coupling, material expansion and compression. For the description of thermodynamic functions of gold we use thermodynamically complete multi-phase equation of state (EOS) with stable and metastable phases. Usage of this EOS enables us to describe phase transitions as well as introduce kinetics {{for the evolution of}} the metastable liquid state. It is shown in numerical simulations that the large-size particles are the result of <b>liquid</b> layer <b>ejection</b> and fragmentation. This regime is observed for low laser intensities when the thermodynamic trajectories enter the metastable liquid region far below the critical point. For higher laser intensities, the near-critical and supercritical trajectories appear for front target layers and the mass fraction of the liquid-gas mixture increases. Formation of small NPs can be observed for these trajectories and estimation of the NPs size matches quite well with the experimental findings. The calculation results thus explain bimodal size distributions of NPs frequently observed in experiment. [1] M. Povarnitsyn et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2013, V. 15, P. 3108...|$|R
40|$|Two {{technologies}} for cooling of high-heat flux microelectronics based on enhanced phase-change are described. The first technology {{is based on}} a submerged vibration-induced bubble ejection process in which small vapor bubbles that form on and are attached to a submerged heated solid surface are dislodged and propelled into the cooler bulk <b>liquid.</b> This <b>ejection</b> technique involves forced removal of the attached vapor bubbles using a submerged turbulent surface jet generated by a vibrating piezoelectric diaphragm operating at resonance. A small-scale vibration-induced bubble ejection module that produces a submerged liquid jet directed to a boiling heated surface was constructed. Initial test data described in this study include the operating characteristics of the jet as well as its cooling capabilities. The efficacy of this cooling approach is demonstrated using a thermal test die which normally dissipates 83 W/cm 2 at 120 ºC {{in the absence of the}} jet. When the jet is active, the heat dissipation increases to 220 W/cm 2 (i. e., improvement of 165 %) at the same surface temperature. The second technology consists of a gravity-independent, two-phase closed heat transfer cell, in which heat is removed from the hot surface by the evaporation of a thin liquid film that is produced by the impact of self-propelled atomized droplets. Surface atomization is achieved within the sealed heat transfer cell using a vibration-induced droplet atomization (VIDA) process. The present paper describes the operation of a small-scale VIDA heat transfer cell for cooling desktop microprocessors with particular emphasis on its operating characteristics and cooling capabilities. The effects of internal flow regulation and of geometry and surface characteristics of the heated surface on the cell performance are investigated.

Figure  4 c-i presents the QTF sensor responses versus the tip-sample distance during approach and retraction of the sample, which shows that the NWs can be fabricated at an arbitrary length, as marked by three arrows (a, b, and c) (here, <b>liquid</b> <b>ejection</b> starts at the zero-distance position). Figure  4 c-ii plots the dependence of the NW’s length on the stress–strain curves. As the length increases from a (5  μm) to c (15  μm), the fracture occurs at the increased shear strain, whereas the shear stress at the fracture slightly decreases by ~ 20  MPa. The fluctuating behavior of the shorter NWs (5 and 10  μm) is attributed to rearrangement of the constituent nanoparticles as the NW is laterally stressed, which is averaged out in the longer 15  μm NW over its length probably due to its lesser sensitivity to movement of individual nanoparticles. In Fig.  4 c-iii, the differing shear stress–strain curves are presented for the three LSC phases, where each slope provides the shear modulus of about 80, 180, and 400  MPa, respectively. The good agreement of the values with those of experiment 1 (Fig.  4 b-ii) indicates that the oscillation motion at 32  kHz is still slow enough to be considered as static. Note that the measured shear modulus of the phase- 3 NW shows similar values with the protein crystal (100 – 1, 000  MPa) or ANA-polymer (~ 500  MPa) [28]. Figure  4 c-iv shows the repetitive stress–strain measurements for the phase- 3 NW during stepwise increase of the shear strain followed by the subsequent relaxation. Up to ~ 25  % strain (black curve, region I), {{there is no significant}} hysteresis between the forward and backward displacements. However, at above ~ 25  % strain, permanent deformation (or thinning) of the NW occurs, accompanied by a sudden slight drop of the shear stress and recovery of zero strain (red curve, region II). Then, a second deformation takes place at ~ 30  % strain, followed by another hysteresis and subsequent ultimate fracture.|$|E
40|$|Laser induced {{explosive}} boiling (LIEB) {{generated by}} localized high energy laser on solid surface has wide applications. Compared with traditional electric heating induced phase change process, LIEB has advantages in: (a) controllable ultra-short heating time, (b) no-pretreatment/fabrication required on substrate, (c) fully controllable heating size {{as well as}} heating energy. In this study, we utilized laser induced strong local heating by guiding laser into taped micro-nozzle to induce <b>liquid</b> <b>ejection</b> from the nozzle. The localized strong heating induces rapid phase change of ink liquid inside the nozzle. As a result, high pressure can be generated inside nozzle and can squeeze liquid out from the nozzle. This inkjet process has less limitation in ink materials than current inkjet techniques. By adjusting laser energy and laser pulse duration, {{we are able to}} generate different ink patterns vary from single droplet to ink spray consisted of sub-micron droplets. To better understand and control the LIEB process for construction laser inkjets, meshfree numerical analysis capable to study a LIEB process is also explored in this study. SPH was selected as the starting point of the meshfree numerical simulation considering its advantages in simulation of large distortion of free surface and moving interface of two phase flow. With a gaining experience in SPH, we noticed that it has limitations in achieving high enough numerical accuracy in derivative computing as well as providing stable numerical simulation without artificial smoothing processes. These limitations of traditional SPH prevent us from using SPH as a tool directly to study the LIEB. To solve the limitations of traditional SPH, we developed a new meshfree scheme providing following improvements: (a) using equation of state of fluid directly, which handles the P, ?, T relation as well as the associated buoyancy forces without simplifications; (b) higher order accuracy in 1 st and 2 nd derivatives calculation providing 2 nd and 1 st order accuracy for random particle distribution and even higher accuracy for symmetric conditions. With this novel high order accuracy meshfree scheme developed in this study, we have a tool not only to stimulate the LIEB process but also bubble dynamics and micro cavitation directly...|$|E

Spin-coating produces the most efficient solution-processed organic solar cells and has been the preferred approach for rapid screening and optimization of new organic semiconductors and formulations for electronic and optoelectronic applications, both in academia and in industrial research facilities. In this article we demonstrate, for the first time, a spin-coating experiment monitored in situ by time resolved UV-visible absorption, {{the most commonly used}}, simplest, most direct and robust optical diagnostic tool used in organic electronics. In the first part, we successfully monitor the solution-to-solid phase transformation and thin film formation of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT), the de facto reference conjugated polymer in organic electronics and photovoltaics. We do so in two scenarios which differ by the degree of polymer aggregation in solution, prior to spin-coating. We find that a higher degree of aggregation in the starting solution results in small but measurable differences in the solid state, which translate into significant improvements in the charge carrier mobility of organic field-effect transistors (OFET). In the second part, we monitor the formation of a bulk heterojunction photoactive layer based on a P 3 HT-fullerene blend. We find that the spin-coating conditions that lead to slower kinetics of thin film formation favour a higher degree of polymer aggregation in the solid state and increased conjugation length along the polymer backbone. Using this insight, we devise an experiment in which the spin-coating process is interrupted prematurely, i. e., after <b>liquid</b> <b>ejection</b> is completed and before the film has started to form, so as to dramatically slow the thin film formation kinetics, while maintaining the same thickness and uniformity. These changes yield substantial improvements to the power conversion efficiency of solar cells without requiring additional thermal annealing, or the use of solvent additives. Through these simple examples, we demonstrate that gaining insight into the thin film formation process can inspire the development of new processing strategies. The insight into the inner workings of spin-coating may be increasingly important to improving the performance or efficiency of roll-to-roll manufactured devices.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{demonstrate}} the possibility of ejecting liquid metals using drop on demand printing technology. The plan was to make transducers for operation in the 100 MHz frequency range and to use these transducers to demonstrate the ability to eject drops of liquid metals such as gallium. Two transducers were made by indium bonding piezoelectric lithium niobate to quartz buffer rods. The lithium niobate plates were thinned by mechanical polishing to a thickness of 37 microns for operation at 100 MHz. Hemispherical lenses were polished in the {{opposite ends of the}} buffer rods. The lenses, which focus the sound waves in the liquid metal, had an F-number equals 1. A mechanical housing was made to hold the transducers and to allow precise control over the liquid level above the lens. We started by demonstrating the ability to eject drops of water on demand. The drops of water had a diameter of 15 microns which corresponds to the wavelength of the sound wave in the water. A videotape of this ejection was made. We then used a mixture of Gallium and Indium (used to lower the melting temperature of the Gallium) to demonstrate the <b>ejection</b> of <b>liquid</b> metal drops. This proved to be difficult because of the oxide skin which forms {{on the surface of the}} liquid.

The changes in the GT and SL region occur reversibly by controlling the Tel. Neither the change in alloy composition except oxygen nor the difference in crystallized phases is seen. Their hardness increases significantly by the disappearance of GT and SL region. The reversible changes in the appearance and disappearance of GT and SL region was found for different Zr-based glassy ribbons, being independent of alloy compositions. The disappearance is presumably due to the change in atomic configurations from high-coordinated to less-coordinated atomic packing in the melt-spun ribbons by freezing high-temperature liquid.

40|$|International audienceWith an {{interest}} in pulsed laser deposition and remote spectroscopy techniques, we explore here the potential of laser pulses temporally tailored on ultrafast time scales to control the expansion and the excitation degree of various ablation products including atomic species and nanoparticulates. Taking advantage of automated pulse-shaping techniques, an adaptive procedure based on spectroscopic feedback is applied to regulate the irradiance and enhance the optical emission of monocharged aluminum ions {{with respect to the}} neutral signal. This leads to optimized pulses usually consisting in a series of femtosecond peaks distributed on a longer picosecond sequence. The ablation features induced by the optimized pulse are compared with those determined by picosecond pulses generated by imposed second-order dispersion or by double pulse sequences with adjustable picosecond separation. This allows to analyze the influence of fast- and slow-varying envelope features on the material heating and the resulting plasma excitation degree. Using various optimal pulse forms including designed asymmetric shapes, we analyze the establishment of surface pre-excitation that enables conditions of enhanced radiation coupling. Thin films elaborated by unshaped femtosecond laser pulses and by optimized, stretched, or double pulse sequences are compared, indicating that the nanoparticles generation efficiency is strongly influenced by the temporal shaping of the laser irradiation. A thermodynamic scenario involving supercritical heating is proposed to explain enhanced ionization rates and lower particulates density for optimal pulses. Numerical one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for the excited matter support the interpretation of the experimental results in terms of relative efficiency of various relaxation paths for excited matter above or below the thermodynamic stability limits. The calculation results underline the role of the temperature and density gradients along the ablated plasma plume which lead to the spatial distinct locations of excited species.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here {{focuses on the}} ignition of single Ni- and Fe-coated Al particles in pure CO 2 and Ar atmospheres and Ti particles in O 2 /N 2 and O 2 /Ar environments. The importance of studying Ni- and Fe-coated Al particles is related to their potential use in propulsion and materials synthesis applications. Meanwhile, Ti combustion may be utilized to eliminate hazardous chemical and biological air pollutants. ^ Ni- and Fe-coated Al particles. The use of Ni- or Fe-coated Al particles (10 – 100 μm) as a fuel component in propellants is expected to improve the performance characteristics of solid rocket motors by reducing Al agglomeration. They {{can also be used}} for combustion synthesis of nickel and iron aluminides. The ignition mechanism of such particles, however, is not well understood. In this work, to provide sufficient spatial and time resolutions, single ∼ 2. 5 -mm Ni- and Fe-coated Al particles were laser-heated in argon and carbon dioxide atmospheres. The ignition process was investigated using a high-speed digital video camera, thermocouple measurements, and analysis of particles quenched at different pre-ignition stages. ^ It was shown that the Ni-coated Al particle ignition temperature is ∼ 1325 °C and does not depend on atmosphere (Ar or CO 2) or Ni content. The established ignition mechanism includes exothermic intermetallic reactions and phase transformations of different Ni-Al compounds. Specifically, the melting of NiAl 3 at 854 °C was determined to {{play a critical role in}} particle ignition. ^ Despite the lower exothermicity of Fe-Al reactions, iron-coated Al particles were investigated because, unlike Ni, Fe is not toxic. Further, a prior study showed that Fe coatings may exhibit a more favorable effect on Al agglomeration than Ni coatings. It was shown that significant differences exist between the ignition of the Fe-Al and Ni-Al particles. In contrast to Ni coatings, the ignition of Fe-coated Al particles is influenced by atmosphere (Ar or CO 2) and the post-ignition product phases are not well-mixed. Again, the ignition mechanism relied on exothermic intermetallic reactions and phase transformations. For Fe-coated Al particles, the intermetallic reactions contributed significantly to heating rate upon Al melting at 660 °C. ^ The above differences between the Ni- and Fe-coated Al particle systems may be related to the manner by which buoyancy influences phase formation in each system. Thus, microgravity (10 - 2 – 10 - 3 g) experiments were conducted to reduce convective mixing, allowing its effect on ignition to be examined. The results indicated that Nicoated Al particle ignition is not influenced by microgravity. Meanwhile, for Fe-coated Al particles, microgravity lowered ignition temperature by ∼ 100 °C, indicating a significant influence of buoyancy. In normal gravity, similar effects are expected to occur with decreasing the initial particle size from 2. 5 mm to 250 – 550 μm. ^ Ti particles. Combustion of Ti-rich pyrotechnic mixtures in air may potentially be used for the in-situ synthesis of nano-scale TiO 2 particles, which can photocatalytically degrade chemical and biological air pollutants. Knowledge of Ti particle reactions in O 2 -containing atmospheres is required to develop this method. In the present work, large (∼ 3 mm) single Ti particles were heated by a laser in O 2 /N 2 and O 2 /Ar environments. High-speed digital video recording, thermocouple measurements and quenching at different stages of the process were used for diagnostics. Analysis of the obtained temperature-time curves and quenched particles does not show a significant influence of nitrogen on oxidation of solid Ti. In all experiments, noticeable surface oxidation started at temperatures between ∼ 850 – 950 °C, leading to a sharp temperature rise at ∼ 1400 °C. During prolonged heating at the Ti melting point (1670 °C), a liquid TiO 2 bead formed and, after an induction period, ejected fragments. It was shown that this phenomenon may result from an excess of oxygen in the <b>liquid</b> bead. Fragment <b>ejection</b> was more intense in O 2 /N 2 atmospheres than in O 2 /Ar, indicating that N 2 accelerates the oxidation of liquid Ti. ...|$|R
