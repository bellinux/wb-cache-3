Inter cut scenes features the group dancing and singing to the song, whilst in several different hallways. During the second chorus, the girls continue to search for him without any luck. The man enters the office, sits down on a sofa, with a helmet piece of shiny–coloured plastic on his head. The girls find the office entrance, with CCTV footage catching them enter the room.|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard <b>lights</b> <b>flashing.</b> Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E

Then they walk down a street of Hollywood stars with bubbles floating all around them. As they walk down the street, they also stop to sing on a bench. As the second chorus starts, the Dolls climb scaffolding and begin to dance. During Scherzinger's solo, she stands in a small area with the Pussycat Dolls logo to the left and a mirror to the right, with <b>lights</b> <b>flashing.</b> The Dolls then dance in the breakdown section with the logo behind them and the camera zooms out to reveal filming equipment and playback screens.|$|E
500|$|Holy Ghost! first {{announced}} in a January 7, 2016 interview with The Boston Globe that an extended play titled Crime Cutz {{was to be}} released in late spring of that year. The title track of Crime Cutz first premiered worldwide on Zane Lowe's Apple Music show Beats 1 on February 4, 2016. The label DFA Records released it as a digital download single a day later. As part of the PopMatters feature Singles Going Steady, multiple writers reviewed the track upon its release. The 12" [...] vinyl single for the song that also includes the instrumental version of the song was a 300-copy limited edition. An official Ben Fries-directed video for the song depicted multicolored <b>lights</b> <b>flashing</b> to the beat, with Aubrey Cook starring as the dancer.

40|$|The Apollo 16 mission {{provided}} {{the opportunity to}} obtain additional data on the characteristics and frequency of the <b>light</b> <b>flashes</b> and also {{provided the}} first opportunity to obtain a direct physical record of incident cosmic ray particles with the Apollo <b>light</b> <b>flash</b> moving emulsion detector (ALFMED). The ALFMED is an electromechanical device that is worn on the head like a helmet and supports cosmic radiation-sensitive emulsions around {{the head of the}} test subject. Two <b>light</b> <b>flash</b> observation sessions were conducted during the mission: one during translunar coast and the second during transearth coast. Characteristics of the <b>light</b> <b>flashes</b> observed and reported by the Apollo crew members were generally similar to those reported on previous missions. Analyses of the ALFMED emulsion plates are proceeding as scheduled, although results are not yet available. The ALFMED results should provide conclusive evidence establishing the correlation, if any, between the incident cosmic ray particles and the perception of <b>light</b> <b>flashes</b> as reported by Apollo crew members...|$|R

500|$|Although filmed {{to create}} the {{illusion}} that events occurred in real time, the episode employed several camera tricks and effects. For the opening shot, a [...] "surreptitious cut" [...] helped to replace actor Judson Mills with a stunt person when the cop car is overturned by the monster. Usually, an episode of the series required 800 to 1,200 film cuts, but [...] "X-Cops" [...] only required 45. During post-production, a minor argument broke out between Vince Gilligan and the network. Originally, Gilligan did not want the X-Files logo to appear {{at any time during the}} episode. He stressed that he wanted [...] "X-Cops" [...] to feel like an [...] "episode of Cops that happened to involve Mulder and Scully." [...] The network, fearing that people would not understand that [...] "X-Cops" [...] was actually an episode of The X-Files, vetoed this idea. A compromise was reached wherein the episode would open with the Cops theme song, but the normal X-Files credits would scroll after an opening scene. In addition, the commercial bumpers would feature red and blue <b>lights</b> <b>flashing</b> across The X-Files logo while dialogue is heard in the background, in a similar fashion to the Cops logo. The episode also features a disclaimer at the beginning informing viewers that the episode is a special installment of The X-Files to prevent watchers from thinking that the show [...] "has been preempted this week by Cops".|$|E
2500|$|Photosensitive {{epilepsy}} - This is an epileptic {{reaction to}} flashing lights in susceptible persons, which can range in severity from an unusual feeling or involuntary twitch to a generalized seizure. [...] This epileptogenic response can {{be triggered by}} <b>lights</b> <b>flashing</b> in the frequency range of 10–20Hz, regardless of color. [...] While individual light sources used on emergency vehicles generally have much lower flash rates than this, the Loughborough study suggests that such possibilities be minimized. [...] It also notes that emergency workers may report distraction and eyestrain unrelated to epilepsy from working under the lights.|$|E
2500|$|Reception for Sagan's {{work was}} {{generally}} positive. In The New York Times Book Review, novelist James Michener praised Cosmos as [...] "a cleverly written, imaginatively illustrated summary of ... ruminations about our universe... His style is iridescent, with <b>lights</b> <b>flashing</b> upon unexpected juxtapositions of thought." [...] David Whitehouse of the British Broadcasting Corporation {{went so far}} as to say that [...] "there is not a book on astronomy [...] in fact not one on science [...] that comes close to the eloquence and intellectual sweep of Cosmos... If we send just one book to grace the libraries of distant worlds..., let it be Cosmos." [...] Kirkus Reviews described the book as [...] "Sagan at his best." [...] Cornell News Service characterized it as [...] "an overview of how science and civilization grew up together." [...] In 1981, Cosmos received the Hugo Award for Best Non-Fiction Book.|$|E
25|$|The first {{proposal}} {{concerning the}} effect of space radiation on the CNS was made by Cornelius Tobias in his 1952 description of <b>light</b> <b>flash</b> phenomenon caused by single HZE nuclei traversals of the retina. <b>Light</b> <b>flashes,</b> such as those described by Tobias, were observed by the astronauts during the early Apollo missions {{as well as in}} dedicated experiments that were subsequently performed on Apollo and Skylab missions. More recently, studies of <b>light</b> <b>flashes</b> were made on the Russian Mir space station and the ISS. A 1973 report by the NAS considered these effects in detail. This phenomenon, which is known as a Phosphene, is the visual perception of flickering light. It is considered a subjective sensation of light since it can be caused by simply applying pressure on the eyeball. The traversal of a single, highly charged particle through the occipital cortex or the retina was estimated to be able to cause a <b>light</b> <b>flash.</b> Possible mechanisms for HZE-induced <b>light</b> <b>flashes</b> include direction ionization and Cerenkov radiation within the retina.|$|R

2500|$|After {{accelerating}} from [...] {{in three}} seconds. {{out of the}} station, the train enters into a three-story [...] "parking garage" [...] shell, passing through two upwards helixes meant to mirror the ascension of a car through a true parking garage.

Riders then go through an overbanked turn at 88 degrees, followed by a dip and then traveling down a set of [...] "subway stairs". [...] The train then comes to a halt in front of a tunnel. A helicopter rises to the train's left, shooting simulated gunfire. Under Paramount's operation, the gunfire cracked pipes and barrels, which sprayed [...] "gasoline" [...] (truly, water) all around riders. Though that effect has since been removed, the second round of gunfire still ignites where the gasoline would've splashed, catching two barrels on fire before a gas tank explodes.

2500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Scherzinger {{sitting in the}} back of a London hackney carriage. As the rain pours outside and raindrops cover the windows, she sings the first verse while {{changing}} her smart clothes for more casual ones. She stares longingly out of the carriage's window, watching the rain outside. During the chorus, there are two main scenes. In the first she is seen wrapped in blanket while in the second she walks across the room of an old house, in need of renovation. The lighting is cold and dim, and most of the furniture is covered in plastic wrap. Scherzinger stares resentfully at her surroundings while crossing the room. In the second verse, Scherzinger stands in front of a mirror in the bathroom of the house where she has a moment of realisation. After turning the taps on for a while, the sink overflows as she scornfully looks in the mirror, relating to the lyrics of the song. She is then scene walking towards the camera, through a hallway of the house. It is a confident independent walk towards the audience with <b>lights</b> <b>flashing</b> rhythmically behind her. The bridge sees Scherzinger sitting in one the house's empty rooms, in an old armchair and intersects some of the earlier carriage and bathroom scenes. As she sings the lyric [...] "The screen fades to black", the blanket seen earlier on falls in front of the camera, revealing a close up shot of Scherzinger's face. Her hair flows in the wind and she finally gets up from the armchair to stand in front of the room's open windows. In the final scene, she stands confidently in front of the window as wind and light flood the room. She sings the final verse of the song, looking directly at the camera and smiling for the first time in the video.|$|E
