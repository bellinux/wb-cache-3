We restrict {{our attention to}} the deployment of orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) and repetition codes both of which have been recently proposed for FSO links. Our performance analysis demonstrates that, although both schemes are able to extract full diversity, repetition codes outperform OSTBCs. The performance gap increases with the increasing number of transmit apertures. Our findings clearly point out that deployment of OSTBCs is not necessary for a FSO IM/DD <b>link.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Free-space optical communication, spatial diversity, atmospheric turbulence, space-time coding.

We propose two lower bounds, {{for the primary}} user mean rate, depending on the channel state information available for the sec-ondary-user power control {{and the type of}} constraint for spec-trum access. Several power control policies are investigated and the achieved primary-user mean rates are compared with these lower bounds. Specially, assuming all pairs of transmitter–receiver are achieving real-time delay-sensitive applications, we propose a novel secondary-user power control policy to ensure for both users, at a given occurrence, predefined minimum instantaneous rates. This power control uses only the secondary-user direct links gains es-timations (secondary-to-secondary link and secondary-to-primary <b>link).</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Channel state information, cognitive radio, inter-ference channels, interference constraints, power control, radio spectrum management, Rayleigh channels.

The transmis-sion is coded by random linear network coding (RLNC) on packet level to recover from packet erasures and by forward error-correction coding (FEC) on bit level to combat channel distortions. Based on the two-layer model developed by Adams et al. where the end-to-end coded transmission is characterized by a throughput-reliability function, we formulate the cross-layer design as a goodput optimization problem relax the integrality constraint. We show that for single-hop transmissions there exists a globally optimal operating point for the relaxed problem. For multiple-hop transmissions, the goodput function is component-wise concave with respect to the physical layer data rate over each individual <b>link.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Wireless networks, coded transmission, delay constraint, cross-layer design, optimization I...|$|E

Unlike terrestrial networks, satellite networks face a unique set of challenges, such as signal fading and interference from multiple transmitters combined with long propagation delays. A well known challenge is that these unique characteristics can have an adverse impact on various protocols, making it necessary to study protocol behavior in satellite networks. The challenge of our research, and the focus of this paper, is to develop an architecture for a highfidelity and scalable emulation testbed tailored for mobile satellite communications research. The testbed is designed to provide multi-beam, multi-satellite, TDMA, and mobility functionality.

In that work, VFDM was shown {{to be able to}} completely cancel the interference towards a primary macro-cell system at the price of perfect channel state information (CSI) at the opportunistic secondary small-cell. In this work, we propose a prototype of VFDM transceiver as a first step towards a proof of concept of the complete technique. We focus on the secondary small-cell and, using the new SDR 4 All platform developed at the Alcatel-Lucent Chair on Flexible Radio (SUPELEC), we design the transmitter/receiver pair needed for our test.

We derive a unified set of sufficient conditions that guarantee the uniqueness of the solution and global convergence of both algorithms.

Deformable linear {{objects such as}} cables and strings are widely used in our daily life, electric industries, medical operations. Modeling, control, and manipulation of deformable linear objects are keys to many applications. We have proposed the differential geometry coordinates to describe the 2 D/ 3 D deformation of a linear object with the minimum number of parameters. Based on this description, we have formulated the static deformation of a linear object using the differential geometry coordinates but the dynamic deformation has not been investigated yet. In this paper, we apply differential geometry coordinates to the dynamic modeling of linear objects. First, we formulate the dynamic 2 D deformation of an inextensible linear object based on a differential geometry coordinate system. Second, we show simulation results using the proposed modeling technique. Next, we apply the proposed dynamic modeling to the control of a flexible <b>link.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — deformation, linear object, dynamics, mod-eling, simulation, contro...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new control strategy {{to improve the}} performance of the PWM Boost Type Rectifier when operating under an unbalanced supply. An analytical solution for harmonic elimination under unbalanced input voltages is obtained resulting in a smooth (constant) power flow from ac to dc side in spite of the unbalanced voltage condition. Based on the analysis of the open loop configuration, a closed loop control solution is proposed. Sim-ulation results show excellent response and stable operation of the new rectifier control algorithm. A laboratory prototype has been designed to verify the discussions and analyses done in this paper. Theoretical and experimental results show excellent agreement. Elimination of the possibility of low order ac and dc side harmonics due to unbalance is expected to materially affect the cost of dc link capacitor and ac side filter. The proposed method will be particu-larly useful in applications where the large second harmonic at the DC link may have a severe impact on system stability of multiply connected converters on a common <b>link.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—PWM boost type rectifier, unbalanced conditions.

Four channel models are considered and developed: the decoded relaying multihop channel; the amplified relaying multihop channel; the decoded relaying multihop diversity channel; and the amplified relaying multihop diversity channel. Two classifications are discussed: decoded relaying versus amplified relaying, and multihop channels versus multihop diversity channels. The channel models are compared, through analysis and simulations, with the “singlehop ” (direct transmission) reference channel {{on the basis of}} signal-to-noise ratio, probability of outage, probability of error, and optimal power allocation. Each of the four channel models is shown to outperform the singlehop reference channel under the condition that the set of intermediate relaying terminals is selected intelligently. Multihop diversity channels are shown to outperform multihop channels. Amplified relaying is shown to outperform decoded relaying despite noise propagation. This is attributed to the fact that amplified relaying does not suffer from the error propagation which limits the performance of decoded relaying channels to that of their weakest <b>link.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Ad-hoc networks, cooperative diversity, diversity techniques, mesh networks, multihop channels, multihop diversity, wireless relaying.

40|$|Abstract — Passive radio {{frequency}} (RF) tags in the UHF and microwave bands have drawn considerable attention {{because of their}} great potential for use in many {{radio frequency}} identi-fication (RFID) applications. However, more basic {{research is needed to}} increase the range and reliability of a passive RF tag’s radio link, particularly when the RF tag is placed onto any lossy dielectric or metallic surface. This paper presents two new useful forms of the radio link budget that describe the power link of an RF tag system when the tag is attached to an object. These radio link budgets are dependent upon the gain penalty, a term which quantifies the reduction in RF tag antenna gain due to material attachment. A series of measurements, or radio assay, was used to measure the far-field gain pattern and gain penalty of several flexible 915 MHz antennas when attached to cardboard, pine plywood, acrylic, de-ionized water, ethylene glycol, ground beef, and an aluminum slab. It is shown that the gain penalty due to material attachment can result in more than 20 dB of excess loss in the backscatter communication <b>link.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — RFID, radio frequency identification, RF tag, radio frequency tag, antenna measurements, antenna gain pat-terns, link budget, material properties I...|$|E
