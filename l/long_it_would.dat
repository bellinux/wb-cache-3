5|$|Nigel Kneale {{had been}} unhappy with Hammer's {{adaptation}} of The Quatermass Experiment, {{partly because he}} received no extra remuneration {{from the sale of}} the film rights and partly because of the changes made in the film to his original television script. In the wake of his dissatisfaction, Kneale exerted pressure on the BBC to allow him to be more involved in the sale of the rights to his work. Despite being in the final months of his BBC contract, Kneale was allowed to collaborate with Hammer on the adaptation of Quatermass II. The first draft of the screenplay was written by Kneale with input from producer Anthony Hinds. Subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest, as he had done before on The Quatermass Xperiment. Guest recalled of Kneale's script that there was “lots of philosophising and very down-to-earth thinking but it was too <b>long,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not have held screenwise. So, again, I had to tailor it and sharpen it and hopefully not ruin it”. The script was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) in April 1956. BBFC reader Audrey Field commented, “There should be the customary general caution that the sky is not the limit, either in sights or sounds”. The BBFC's main objection was to a scene in which a guard from the Winnerden Flats complex murders a family having a picnic. This scene was omitted from the final film, although it is present in the original television presentation.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September, the {{commander}} of the 104th Brigade, Colonel Ivan Rukljić, took command of all Croatian forces in Varaždin. The Yugoslav Air Force attacked an airfield in Čakovec, mimicking the strike carried out in Varaždin a few days earlier. That evening, the heaviest fighting of the siege erupted in Varaždin, and the 104th Brigade reported it was uncertain how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be able to maintain the blockades. Croatian forces received additional weapons that day, after the JNA garrisons in Čakovec, Križevci and Virovitica surrendered to the ZNG. In Varaždin itself, corps-level units of the JNA 32nd Corps based at the 15. maj barracks also surrendered to the ZNG that day. The following day, fighting intensified again, as Croatian forces captured several minor JNA facilities in Varaždin itself—leaving the Corps headquarters, the Kalnički partizani barracks and the Jalkovečke žrtve barracks as the only JNA-held military bases in the city. In the course of this fighting, the ZNG suffered one fatality and captured nine JNA officers and 30 soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Riders became {{adept at}} {{circumventing}} controls. Their advisers learned to calculate how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take {{a drug to}} move from blood into urine, and therefore how much time a rider could risk waiting before going to a drugs test. And sometimes riders simply cheated. In 1978 the world discovered {{how it could be}} done.|$|E

25|$|Dewey is {{well known}} for his work in the applied {{philosophy}} of the philosophy of education. Dewey's philosophy of education is one where children learn by doing. Dewey believed that schooling was unnecessarily long and formal, and that children would be better suited to learn by engaging in real-life activities. For example, in math, students could learn by figuring out proportions in cooking or seeing how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take to travel distances with certain modes of transportation.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Olympic {{assisted}} with both the American and British inquiries into the disaster. Deputations from both inquiries inspected Olympics lifeboats, watertight doors and bulkheads and other equipment which were identical to those on Titanic. Sea tests were performed for the British enquiry in May 1912, to establish how quickly the ship could turn two points at various speeds, to approximate how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have taken Titanic to turn when it sighted the iceberg.|$|E

The title is a reference to how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take the plane to fall to the ocean far below and to how much time's worth of oxygen was expended of the breath-packs found in {{the wreckage of the}} Challenger.|$|E

25|$|The {{crew had}} been on reduced-rations {{since the end of}} the first week on the island. Some of the crewmen, noting that there were ample {{supplies}} of water and rum, went to the captain to ask for an increase in their rations, but he chased them off with threats. The men then asked Royal Marine Lieutenant Scott to intercede for them. When Scott presented a petition to Captain Herbert on behalf of the men, Herbert had Scott arrested. The captain then explained to the crew that he did not know how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be until they could leave the island, and then read them the Articles of War. The next day the captain increased the water ration by one pint per man.|$|E
25|$|The vehicle {{tracking}} and maintenance issue had not improved by August 2013. The Washington Post {{reported that the}} Ellerbe never ordered the 16 fire engines and seven ladder trucks which he said were needed in 2011. Ellerbe blamed the city council and an unspecified dispute with a vendor for the two-and-a-half year delay. He also asserted that six new fire engines and two new ladder trucks had been ordered, but did not say how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be until they arrived. The newspaper also reported that Ellerbe had yet to fix the vehicular tracking database problem. The department spent $160,000 on a consultant to inventory the department's equipment, but no permanent staff person had been hired to oversee the project and keep it going.|$|E
25|$|The Credit CARD Act of 2009 {{requires}} that consumers opt into over-limit charges. Some card issuers have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into overlimit fees, presenting {{this as a}} benefit as it may avoid {{the possibility of a}} future transaction being declined. Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging overlimit fees. Whether a customer opts into the overlimit fee or not, banks will in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the credit limit or not. Of course, any approved over limit transactions will only result in an overlimit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee. This legislation took effect on 22 February 2010. Following this Act, the companies are now required by law to show on a customer's bills how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take them to pay off the balance.|$|E

In this case, the final [...] "e" [...] would be pronounced (as an [...] "ee" [...] or [...] "aye"), giving the name four syllables, and the accent would shift from the first syllable, to either the second or third syllable, depending on whether the medial syllables are considered short or <b>long.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> then be pronounced: fill-uh-STRA-tay.|$|E
500|$|The {{estimate}} of how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{take for the}} fleet to reach Singapore after the outbreak of hostilities varied. It had to include {{the time required to}} assemble the fleet, prepare and provision its ships, and then [...] sally to Singapore. Initially, the estimate was 42 days, assuming reasonable advance warning. In 1938, it was increased to 70 days, with 14 more for reprovisioning. It was further increased in June 1939 to 90 days plus 15 for reprovisioning, and finally, in September 1939, to 180 days.|$|E

500|$|As most of Balzac's biographers point out, Hańska {{was not in}} {{the room}} when he died. Robb says she [...] "must have retired for a moment", while André Maurois notes that she had been by his side for weeks with no way of knowing how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> continue, and [...] "there was nothing to be done". Vincent Cronin {{attributes}} her absence to the nature of their relationship: [...] "From the first day by the lakeside at Neuchâtel theirs had been a Romantic love and Eve wanted to guard it to the end against that terrible taint of corruption." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} {{recording}} [...] "Yoda", Yankovic started recording [...] "Like a Surgeon", the lead single for the album.

Madonna asked {{one of her friends}} how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take until Yankovic satirized her song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] into [...] "Like a Surgeon". This friend was a mutual friend of Al's manager, Jay Levey. When word got back to Yankovic, he decided {{it was a good idea}} and wrote the song. This is the only known time that Yankovic has gotten a parody idea directly from the original artist.|$|E

500|$|Washington {{introduced}} Arnold to Reuben Colburn, a boat builder from Gardinerstown, Maine, {{who was in}} Cambridge at the time. [...] Colburn {{offered his}} services, and Arnold requested detailed information about the route, including potential British naval threats, Indian sentiment, useful supply opportunities, and an estimate of how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take to construct bateaux sufficient for the contemplated force. [...] Colburn left for Maine on August21 to fulfill these requests. [...] Colburn asked Samuel Goodwin, the local surveyor in Gardinerston, to provide maps for Arnold. [...] Goodwin, who was known to have Loyalist sympathies, provided maps that were inaccurate in the routes, distances and other important features they described.|$|E
500|$|He {{referenced}} {{the idea}} of a molecular assembler, a nanorobot capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product, posing the question of how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material. He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one mole of material, but self-replicating assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond. Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely, causing a grey goo scenario, or, referring to Bill Joy's previous article [...] "Why the future doesn't need us", that the nanorobots could develop swarm intelligence and become alive in some sense.|$|E
500|$|The interim Corps of Engineers {{report was}} {{released}} in December 1963, and reported that building the dam was feasible from an engineering standpoint. President John F.

The needed money was included in a House appropriations bill, and studies continued. The initial report included some figures {{about the size of}} the project.
