2500|$|Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees can {{be either}} bifurcating or multifurcating, and either labeled or unlabeled. A rooted bifurcating tree has exactly two {{descendants}} arising from each interior node (that is, it forms a binary tree), and an unrooted bifurcating tree {{takes the form of}} an unrooted binary tree, a free tree with exactly three neighbors at each internal node. In contrast, a rooted multifurcating tree may have more than two children at some nodes and an unrooted multifurcating tree may have more than three neighbors at some nodes. A <b>labeled</b> <b>tree</b> has specific values assigned to its leaves, while an unlabeled tree, sometimes called a tree shape, defines a topology only. The number of possible trees for a given number of leaf nodes depends on the specific type of tree, but there are always more multifurcating than bifurcating trees, more labeled than unlabeled trees, and more rooted than unrooted trees. The last distinction is the most biologically relevant; it arises because there are many places on an unrooted tree to put the root. For labeled bifurcating trees, there are: ...|$|E

5000|$|One can {{generate}} a labeled tree's Prüfer sequence by iteratively removing vertices {{from the tree}} until only two vertices remain.

50|$|A tree {{is a set}} T ⊆ ℕ* {{such that}} if t.c ∈ T, with t ∈ ℕ* and c ∈ ℕ, then t ∈ T and t.c1 ∈ T for all 0 ≤ c1 < c. The {{elements}} of T are known as nodes, and the empty word ε is the (single) root of T. For every t ∈ T, the element t.c ∈ T is a successor of t in direction c. The number of successors of t is called its degree or arity, and represented as d(t). A node is a leaf if it has no successors. If every node of a tree has finitely many successors, then it is called a finitely, otherwise an infinitely branching tree. A path π is a subset of T such that ε ∈ π and for every t ∈ T, either t is a leaf or there exists a unique c ∈ ℕ such that t.c ∈ π. A path may be a finite or infinite set. If all paths of a tree are finite then the tree is called finite, otherwise infinite. A tree is called fully infinite if all its paths are infinite. Given an alphabet Σ, a Σ-labeled tree is a pair (T,V), where T is a tree and V: T → Σ maps each node of T to a symbol in Σ. A <b>labeled</b> <b>tree</b> formally defines a commonly used term tree structure. A set of labeled trees is called a tree language.|$|E

40|$|A {{widely used}} method for {{determining}} the similarity of two <b>labeled</b> <b>trees</b> is to compute a maximum agreement subtree of the two trees. Previous work on this similarity measure has only been concerned with the comparison of <b>labeled</b> <b>trees</b> of two special kinds, namely, uniformly <b>labeled</b> <b>trees</b> (i. e., trees with all their nodes labeled with the same symbol) and evolutionary trees (i. e., leaf-labeled trees with distinct symbols for distinct leaves). This paper presents an algorithm for comparing <b>trees</b> that are <b>labeled</b> in an arbitrary manner. In addition to this generality, this algorithm is faster than the previous algorithms. Another contribution {{of this paper is}} on maximum weight bipartite matchings. We show how to speed up the best known matching algorithms when the input graphs are node-unbalanced or weight-unbalanced. Based on these enhancements, we obtain an efficient algorithm for a new matching problem called the hierarchical bipartite matching problem, which {{is at the core of}} our maximum agreement subtree algorithm. © 2001 Academic Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Ordered <b>labelled</b> <b>trees</b> are trees {{where each}} node has a label and the left-to-right order among {{siblings}} is significant. Ordered labelled forests are sequences of ordered <b>labelled</b> <b>trees.</b> Ordered <b>labelled</b> <b>trees</b> and forests are useful structures for hierarchical data representation. Given two ordered labelled forests F and G, the local forest similarity is to compute two sub-forests F 2 ̆ 7 and G 2 ̆ 7 of F and G respectively {{such that they}} are the most similar over all the possible F 2 ̆ 7 and G 2 ̆ 7. Given a target forest F and a pattern forest G, the forest pattern matching problem is to compute a sub-forest F 2 ̆ 7 of F which is the most similar to G over all the possible F 2 ̆ 7. This thesis presents novel efficient algorithms for the local forest similarity problem and forest pattern matching problem for sub-forest. An application of the algorithms is that {{it can be used to}} locate the structural regions in RNA secondary structures which is the necessity data in RNA secondary structure prediction and function investigation.
