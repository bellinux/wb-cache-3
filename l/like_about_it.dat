25|$|Act One {{begins as}} the alarm in Mal and Jill's bedroom goes off, and Mal reaches for it. They rise for breakfast, and Sam, their son, {{tries to get}} Jill to sign a {{permission}} form for an after-school drama group without Mal knowing, but Mal finds the form and rips it up. It is unclear what Mal does not <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> other than claiming acting is men prancing around in tights. Sam is openly contemptuous of his father, whilst Mal is openly disappointed with his son, unlike his daughter, Chrissie, who worked hard at school, found her man, got pregnant and got married (in that order). Mal's prized son-in-law, Dean, arrives at the house, and prior to setting off for work together, Dean speaks of how successful his marriage is (his proudest example being his wife making him cooked breakfast every day apart from Sunday when he makes her breakfast).|$|E
500|$|Chosen to play female lead Sadie Hermann, Dorothy Mackaill {{opined that}} the film would appeal to [...] "every girl in America". She {{believed}} that [...] "there is not a situation in this picture which could not happen to any girl. That {{is one of the}} things I <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> There is nothing in it that could not be true." [...] The rest of the cast includes Charles Murray as a driver, Peggy Shaw as Ethel, Gaston Glass as Fred Perry, and Bernard Randall portraying Brown.|$|E
500|$|On February 5, 2010, Gaga {{was interviewed}} by Ryan Seacrest on KIIS-FM. She commented on the video, saying, [...] "What I <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is it's a real true pop event, and when I was younger, I was always excited {{when there was a}} big giant event {{happening}} in pop music and that's what I wanted this to be." [...] Gaga also said that her intent was to take [...] "the idea that America is full of young people that are inundated with information and technology and turn it into something that was more of a commentary on the kind of country that we are." ...|$|E
60|$|Milt {{studied the}} shiny-seamed, worn-buttonholed, limp object with dislike. Its {{personality}} was disintegrated. The {{only thing he}} <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> was the good garage stink of gasoline.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm hanged if I {{turn out}} tomorrow," [...] he said, {{as they left}} the shop. [...] "He can do what he <b>likes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Besides, what can he do, after all? Only kick us out of the team. And I don't mind that." ...|$|R
5000|$|The tour {{received}} mostly positive reviews. The Orange County Register {{called the}} tour [...] "a surprisingly strong performance" [...] {{in a positive}} review. In a negative review, Variety called the tour [...] "chilly" [...] and [...] "calculated". Seventeen, impressed with the tour, posted a list of ten things they <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
500|$|Once {{he had the}} sound, {{he rolled}} off the bottom to [...] "take the muddiness out". It was {{actually}} double reverbed; the gated reverb was only on the snares and the toms, {{and the rest of}} the kit as a whole had another plate reverb, which came off the Lexicon 960, for smoothing it out. Swivel said that it actually took him five minutes. According to him, the sound obtained was [...] "a little unorthodox" [...] and therefore, he tried to refine it. Beyoncé thought that it was better the way Swivel did it originally. Swivel commented, [...] "... and in all honesty, whatever works first is usually going to work best. You end up finding something you <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and that's where the emotional attachment to a sound comes into play." [...] Swivel often replaces or augments sounds with samples, trying to realise the producer's vision. Similarly in [...] "I Care", he added a couple of kicks underneath the original kick and pitched them down an octave, so that [...] " [...] could not hear them but could feel them on big speakers." [...] Swivel further said that it started with [...] "a dark, almost warehouse‑sounding" [...] kick, and he then added a little thump to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can do {{what you}} <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but if you're wise, you'll keep out of my sight," [...] he said. [...] "It won't hurt me to let people know what made the trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're going ahead; {{you can do}} {{what you}} <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> And now, while I admire the way you pulled my partner through, there's not much more to say. I wish you a safe journey. Good-morning." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{handed the}} glad news on to Florence {{and left her}} {{to do what she}} <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> She went down and interviewed Stevens. I suppose he'd had {{experience}} of her. At any rate, he didn't argue. He yielded up the address in level time. Old man Craye was living in Paris, but was to arrive in New York that night, and would doubtless be at his club.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Pilot" [...] is the 1st {{episode of}} the first season of the now defunct WB Network comedy What I <b>Like</b> <b>About</b> You. <b>It</b> {{originally}} aired on September 20, 2002.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{really wanted}} it to be the first single but I never thought Capitol would agree to it, and I believe it was Punch (Andrews, Seger's manager and often co-producer) who talked them into <b>it.</b> What I <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> was that it broke new ground for us. It really showed that we were unafraid to push the {{envelope}} of what we were doing before, which was basically pretty hot rock and roll, you know, with a few ballads thrown in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it's a great life," [...] {{the doctor}} proclaimed enthusiastically, pausing from {{sharpening}} his knife on the stovepipe. [...] "What I <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is the struggle, the endeavor with one's own hands, the primitiveness of it, the realness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose you'll want a dish o' tay, or victuals of some sort, hey? Not yet? Well, do as ye <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But faith, if 'twas I, I {{should be}} as dry as a kex wi' {{travelling}} so far." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, would you--WOULD you? Oh, {{how good}} you always are, Pen! And you always say what you think. I wish there was some one coming to see you too. That's all that I don't <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Perhaps----He was telling about his friend there in Texas----" ...|$|E
5000|$|On 28 October 2016, Na Mooneys {{received}} a warm review from Irish News' critic Robert McMillen, stating: [...] "It {{goes without saying}} that this is an album with a superb pedigree and the thing I <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> most is that it sounds as if you were there in the Mooney household, either in Slíochán or in Cois Chlaidí. It is full of energy, the songs are really great and there's something different with the treatment of even the very well-known tunes." ...|$|R
60|$|FAITH. I don't know. You can't tell {{anything}} in there. [With sudden vehemence] I wish I had my baby back, though. It was mine; and I--I don't <b>like</b> thinking <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you're not {{grown up}} yet," [...] Abner consoled her. [...] "And {{so long as}} you are feeling <b>like</b> that <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> I'm not likely to want you to marry him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{it may be}} nothing, I am sure I hope so," [...] Ripon said, [...] "but Sankey and I {{thought you}} ought to know and then it will be off our minds, and you can do as you <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Now, Sankey, tell what you knew first, then I will tell what Mother Brown said to me on Wednesday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yes, {{thanks to}} your influence! I leave the stones in your hands, sir. Do what you <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But {{remember}} that {{whatever you do}} against me, is done against the future husband of your only daughter. You will hear from me soon again, Elise. It {{is the last time}} that I will ever cause pain to your tender heart,' and with these words he left both the room and the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is so simple," [...] he said. He {{shot the}} outer barrel {{back along the}} inner one. [...] "That loads it and cocks it, you see. And then all I {{have to do is}} pull the trigger, eight times, as fast as I can quiver my finger. See that safety clutch. That's what I <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It is safe. It is {{positively}} fool-proof." [...] He slipped out the magazine. [...] "You see how safe it is." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{far back}} as I can {{remember}} I have always loved art—drawing, painting, making music. What I <b>like</b> most <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is the freedom to create something—anything—from nothing. - Ryan Singer, 2009 ...|$|R
50|$|Lawrence {{started his}} career {{at the age of}} 15 by {{performing}} poetry at open mic nights in 1998. After realizing that the part he <b>liked</b> most <b>about</b> <b>it</b> was making people laugh, he moved to comedy.|$|R
60|$|ANN. Miss Ramsden {{would not}} <b>like</b> to speak <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before me, Granny. I {{ought not to}} be present.|$|R
6000|$|... "I declare," [...] Mrs. Gaylord went on, [...] "it worked me up {{considerable}} to {{have her}} come in some those times, and see by her face 't she'd seen him with some the other girls. She used to look so! And then I'd hear her up in her room, cryin' and cryin'. I shouldn't cared so much, if Marcia'd been like any other girl, kind of flirty, <b>like,</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But she wa' n't. She was just bowed down before her idol." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess we'll {{call this}} conference finished," [...] he said. [...] "You've been told all {{you came to}} find out,--my reason for closing the Casino. If it doesn't strike you as a {{satisfactory}} reason, that's up to you. Do what you <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The one thing you may take as a solid fact--and you can spread it around the town as much as ever you please--is that it is closed, and {{is not going to}} be reopened while I'm ruler here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Congdon was loyalty itself. [...] "Now don't {{you jump}} at conclusions. Yes, she pulled up, and I {{went out to}} see her. She gave me {{her hand in the}} old way, and said; 'Isn't this a joke. The Captain ordered it from Chicago. He saw a picture in one of my {{magazines}} of a girl driving one of these things, and here I am. You don't think they'll charge me a special license, do you?' Oh, she's all right. Don't you worry about her. Then she said: 'What I don't <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is the Captain can't ride in it. I'm not going to keep it,' she said." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{final phase}} of {{principal}} photography took place in Alberta in late November2009. The location manager discovered a temporarily closed ski resort, Fortress Mountain. An elaborate set was assembled near the top station of the Canadian chairlift, taking three months to build. The production {{had to wait for}} a huge snowstorm, which eventually arrived. The ski-chase sequence was inspired by Nolan's favorite James Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969): [...] "What I <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> that we've tried to emulate in this film is there's a tremendous balance in that movie of action and scale and romanticism and tragedy and emotion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Mr. S. Very well. Just as you like. Don't believe it. Only it's true, and it's my {{business}} {{to find them}} things out. It's {{my business}}, and I finds 'em out. Mr. Trewillian can do as he <b>likes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> If it's right, why, then it is right. It ain't {{for me to say}} nothing about that. But there's the fact. The lady, she has wrote another letter; and the Colonel,--why, he has received it. There ain't nothing wrong about the post-office. If I was to say what was inside of that billydou,--why, then I should be proving what I didn't know; and when it came to standing up in court, I shouldn't be able to hold my own. But as for the letter, the lady wrote it, and the Colonel,--he received it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come!" [...] said Laverick. [...] "There's no {{need for}} you to be feeling <b>like</b> this <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> All that you've done is not to have remembered those two {{customers}} who were in your restaurant late one night. There's nothing criminal in that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> all, Ponderevo, is its poetry.... That's {{where we}} get {{the pull of the}} animals. No animal would ever run a factory like this. Think!... One remembers the Beaver, of course. He might very {{possibly}} bottle things, but would he stick a label round 'em and sell 'em? The Beaver is a dreamy fool, I'll admit, him and his dams, but after all there's a sort of protection about 'em, a kind of muddy practicality! They prevent things getting at him. And it's not your poetry only. It's the poetry of the customer too. Poet answering to poet--soul to soul. Health, Strength and Beauty--in a bottle--the magic philtre! Like a fairy tale....|$|E
6000|$|Ernest's face {{began to}} get red in return, and he {{answered}} with unwonted heat, 'How dare you address me so, yourself, Lord Exmoor? How dare you speak to me in that imperious manner? You're forgetting yourself, I think, and I had better leave you for the present, till you remember how {{to be more careful}} in your language. But Lynmouth is not to go pigeon-shooting. I object to his going, because the sport is a cruel and a brutal one, whoever may practise it. If I have any authority over him, I insist upon it that he shall not go. If he goes, I shall not stop here any longer. You can do as you <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> of course, but you have my final word upon the matter. Lynmouth, go down to the study.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, Hawkins. A {{fine steel}} saw, such as burglars use, will {{work its way}} through an iron bar almost noiselessly, and I should say that it would go through copper almost as easily as it would through hard wood. It is as well to say nothing to the crew about it, but I think it my duty to lay the matter before the club committee, {{and they can do}} as they <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Mind, I don't say for a moment that it was done by anyone on board the Phantom. It may have been someone on shore who had laid a bet of a few pounds against us, and wanted to make sure of winning his money. Besides, the Phantom might very well have hoped to have beaten us fairly, for she was just as much fancied as we were. Take it below, and lay it in my cabin, and when we get in unshackle the other bit of the bar, and put it with this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lansman {{was brought}} up in an Orthodox Jewish family in Southgate, north London. He was a pupil at the {{independent}} Highgate School from 1970 to 1975. [...] He first visited Israel when he was 16: [...] "I worked on a kibbutz in the Negev and my aunt lived in Beersheba. [...] It was actually a very politicising experience. When I did my bar mitzvah I saw myself as a Zionist and I think after I went there I felt it less. [...] I was more interested in the kibbutz and what I <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> was the pioneering spirit, the sense of community and radicalism of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Brom {{has been}} drawing and {{painting}} since childhood, although he had never taken any formal art classes. [...] "I wouldn't exactly call myself self-taught, because I've always looked at the work of other artists and emulated what I <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> So you can say they taught me." [...] Brom cites the work of Frank Frazetta, N.C. Wyeth, and Norman Rockwell as influences on his style: [...] "Okay... Rockwell isn't the kind of inspiration most people expect from me, but he just painted things so well. To me it's {{not so much the}} genre but the way it's done, and you have to admire his technique." ...|$|R
