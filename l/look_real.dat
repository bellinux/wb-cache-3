5|$|Overseeing {{the visual}} effects {{department}} for New Moon was Susan MacLeod, {{who had previously}} worked with Weitz during the production of The Golden Compass. MacLeod enlisted Tippett Studio to create the computer generated wolves, while Prime Focus of Vancouver handled {{the effects of the}} vampires. To prepare for the aggressive task of making the wolves <b>look</b> <b>real,</b> Tippet artists studied wolf culture. They also were able to reflect leadership and human muscle size by adjusting certain features of the wolves, such as their fat and tallness. In February 2009, a group of artists were able to travel to Wolf Mountain Sanctuary, outside of Los Angeles, and see real wolves. The artists were able to observe the behavior of both the timber and arctic wolves, who ran in packs of three to five. The idea was to give everyone a deeper feeling of the creature that they were creating.|$|E
5|$|The video's main {{theme is}} a romantic fantasy narrative. It {{begins with a}} montage of pencil {{drawings}} in a comic-book style representing motorcycle sidecar racing, in which the hero, played by Morten Harket, is pursued by two opponents, {{one of whom is}} played by English actor Philip Jackson. It then cuts to a scene in a cafe, in which a young woman, played by Bunty Bailey (Harket's girlfriend at the time), is seen drinking coffee and reading the comic book in a coffee shop. As the woman reads, the waitress brings her the bill. The comic's hero, after winning the race, seemingly winks at the woman from the page. His pencil-drawn hand reaches out of the comic book, inviting the woman into it. Once inside, she too appears in the pencil-drawn form, as he sings to her and introduces her to his black-and-white world which features a sort of looking-glass portal where people and objects <b>look</b> <b>real</b> on one side and pencil-drawn on the other.|$|E

25|$|Jake, Riggan's {{best friend}} and lawyer, is {{producing}} the play which co-stars Riggan's girlfriend Laura and Broadway débutante Lesley. Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict whom {{he is trying to}} reconnect with, is working as his assistant. The day before the first preview, a light fixture falls onto Riggan's hopeless co-star Ralph, which Riggan tells Jake he caused. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile method actor Mike Shiner. The first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over the replacement of his gin with water, attempts to have real sex with Lesley during a sex scene and claims that the prop gun does not <b>look</b> <b>real</b> which is hindering his performance. Riggan clashes continually with Mike and is incensed at influential theater critic Tabitha Dickinson's praise for Mike's performance, but Jake persuades him to continue with the play. Riggan catches Sam using marijuana and berates her; she tells him he is expendable and that his play is a vanity project.|$|E
500|$|The {{back cover}} of the album {{features}} {{a photograph of a}} rubber monkey in front of a collage created by Cobain. The collage features photos of raw beef from a supermarket advertisement, images from Dante's Inferno, and pictures of diseased vaginas from Cobain's collection of medical photos. Cobain noted, [...] "If you <b>look</b> <b>real</b> close, there is a picture of Kiss in the back standing on a slab of beef." [...] The album's liner notes contain no complete song lyrics; instead, the liner contains random song lyrics and unused lyrical fragments that Cobain arranged into a poem. However, the single for [...] "Lithium" [...] contains lyrics for each song in Nevermind.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Barkley {{wrote the}} {{foreword}} for Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly's book The Life of Reilly. In it, Barkley quipped, [...] "Of {{all the people}} in sports I'd like to throw through a plate glass window, Reilly's not one of them. It's a shame though, skinny white boys <b>look</b> <b>real</b> aerodynamic." [...] In 2002, Barkley released the book I May Be Wrong, But I Doubt It, which included editing and commentary by close friend Michael Wilbon. Three years later, Barkley released Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man?, which is a collection of interviews with leading figures in entertainment, business, sports, and government. Michael Wilbon also contributed to this book and was present at many of the interviews.|$|E

500|$|The stunt {{coordinator}} for the season was Tanner Gill. In September 2013, Ming-Na Wen talked about stunts and action scenes on the series, saying [...] "I have great stunt coordinators and choreographers to help me through every step and with the magic of filmmaking and editing, it all brings about her skills, to another level. That {{has to be very}} believable ... I think the hardest part is doing the actual stunts, the stunt-fighting. That's a whole other thing. I'm not really punching out the stunt guy, nor are they hitting me, so it's learning this dance, really, within the fight. It's how to pull back, how to take a hit and make it <b>look</b> <b>real.</b>|$|E
500|$|Visual effects {{supervisor}} Jay Worth found {{inspiration for}} the ash storyline from holding his grandmother-in-law's hands while at her funeral. He noted during production, [...] "The Ash Man definitely had {{its own set of}} challenges, because we wanted to utilize a lot of real elements, and because we didn't have the time to do all the simulation and particle work needed to make it <b>look</b> <b>real.</b> The thing that sold The Ash Man more than anything was the aftermath shot: This half-disintegrated body with a pile of ash for the head on the ground. It ended up being a layering, compositing, tweaking challenge beyond belief. I got to shoot the elements myself and had more control over them." ...|$|E
500|$|The title [...] "Disneyland {{with the}} Death Penalty" [...] {{refers to the}} subject of the article, the Southeast Asian {{city-state}} of Singapore, whose strictly guarded sterility Gibson describes with horror. After opening the article with the Disneyland metaphor, Gibson cites an observation attributed to Laurie Anderson that virtual reality [...] "would never <b>look</b> <b>real</b> until they learned how to put some dirt in it" [...] in relation to the immaculate state of the Changi Airtropolis, [...] Singapore's international airport. Beyond the airport, he notes that the natural environment has been cultivated into [...] "all-too-perfect examples of itself", such as with the abundance of golf courses. Singaporean society is a [...] "relentlessly G-rated experience", controlled by a government akin to a megacorporation, fixated on conformity and behavioural constraint and with a marked lack of humour and creativity.|$|E

500|$|Make-up artist Greg Cannom {{was pleased}} to be {{involved}} in Hannibal as it offered him the chance to produce [...] "incredible and original make-ups". For Mason Verger, the make-up team would initially produce 20 different heads which looked like zombies and did not reflect the vision Scott had of the character; Scott wanted Verger to <b>look</b> <b>real</b> with hideous scarring, and not something from the [...] "House of Wax". Scott himself would actually call up the help of expert doctors {{in an effort to get}} the look of the character as realistic as possible. Scott showed the make-up team pictures of foetal things, which he thought touching; he wanted to make Mason Verger more touching than monstrous, as he thought of Verger as being someone who hadn’t lost his sense of humour...almost sympathetic. Oldman would spend six hours a day in make-up to prepare for the role.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Lizard {{merchandise}} designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape {{with a layer}} of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics. Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more [...] "Steve Ditko derived" [...] (the character's original artist). Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling. He stated [...] "that in a comic book, you just put that thing up there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you try to do that and make it <b>look</b> <b>real,</b> it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Hiddleston portrayed novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald in writer-director Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris. He then {{played the}} noble Captain Nicholls in War Horse, a film {{based on the}} 1982 novel by Michael Morpurgo, {{directed}} by Steven Spielberg. The same year he starred as Freddie Page, a RAF pilot in the drama The Deep Blue Sea, alongside Rachel Weisz. In 2012, he reprised {{his role as the}} supervillain Loki in The Avengers. While filming a scene with Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, the film's director, Joss Whedon told the fighting duo that the scene did not <b>look</b> <b>real</b> enough, so Hiddleston told Hemsworth to really hit him for the fight scene. [...] "I said to Chris, 'Dude, just hit me. Just hit me because I'm protected here and it's fine.' He's like, 'Are you sure?' I was like, 'Yeah, it will look great. Just go for it.'" [...] He provided the voiceover the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead in 2011 and poetry for iF Poems and The Love Book on iTunes in 2012.|$|E

500|$|Six {{companies}} {{working on}} different scenes and elements created 500shots of visual {{effects in the}} film. These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings. CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the Scorcher VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release. To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: [...] "We worked really {{hard to make the}} CG crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence <b>look</b> <b>real.</b> Ben was adamant about that, {{but at the same time}} he wanted the explosion to be huge. When you see it hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It was the same thing with Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade... Now, I was in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that... But it was a big dramatic moment and it looks really cool... and feels kind of real." ...|$|E
500|$|The lack of graphics, poor {{interface}} {{and controls}} {{were seen as}} {{the reasons for the}} game's difficulty. However, the reviewers also noted most of it having a role in gameplay and the argument that the text-based graphics forces players to use their own imagination, making it more engaging. Weiner wrote, [...] " [...] may not <b>look</b> <b>real,</b> but once you're hooked, it feels vast, enveloping, alive. A micro-manager's dream, the game gleefully blurs the distinction between painstaking labor and creative thrill." [...] Quintin Smith from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said, [...] "The interface has a tough job to do, bless it, but getting it {{to do what you want}} is like teaching a beetle to cook." [...] Ars Technica's Casey Johnston highlighted the difficulty in performing basic actions and felt that tinkering or experimenting ended up being unproductive; she compared it to [...] "trying to build a skyscraper by banging two rocks together". She pointed out the lack of in-game tutorial and said how players can learn by themselves in other games, which are also open-ended or have intuitive mechanics, but in Dwarf Fortress, there is no autonomy [...] "even after hours" [...] of gameplay.|$|E
500|$|All four episodes were {{directed}} by Lee Salisbury, who learned {{three weeks before}} filming {{that he would be}} working on the episodes, and said he was [...] "a bit dumbstruck" [...] to discover he would be directing the fire episodes and Windsor's departure, but that he was proud to do so. He said his main aim for the fire was to show the fear, panic and pandemonium that comes when a fire starts and quickly spreads. He wanted the story to be character-led rather than led by the fire, saying that the fire [...] "almost becomes a backdrop". Salisbury said it was hard to make the fire <b>look</b> <b>real</b> because [...] "you can't actually set fire to stuff". As the fire lasted for some time, characters' scenes could be divided up into small sections. Salisbury commented: [...] "Bryan Kirkwood, the writer [...] and myself also wanted it to be an episode where things kept happening and the audience would keep thinking, 'Wow, that must have been the explosion' or 'That must have been the stunt'. But more things keep happening and happening, and I think that's what people will find really shocking." [...] The production team had several production meetings for the weeks' worth of episodes, whereas there is usually just one.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Orloff, the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios, {{considered}} the creature {{one of the}} most challenging effects his company helped make for the season. He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, that it really takes a lot to make it <b>look</b> <b>real</b> in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to believe in it is kind of the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When I first got here tonight, I was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E
500|$|The Hill Valley {{town square}} scenes were shot at Courthouse Square, {{located in the}} Universal Studios backlot (...) [...] Gale {{explained}} {{it would have been}} impossible to shoot on location [...] "because no city is going to let a film crew remodel their town to look like it's in the 1950s." [...] The filmmakers [...] "decided to shoot all the 50s stuff first, and make the town <b>look</b> <b>real</b> beautiful and wonderful. Then we would just totally trash it down and make it all bleak and ugly for the 1980s scenes." [...] The interiors for Doc Brown's house were shot at the Robert R. Blacker House, while exteriors took place at Gamble House. The exterior shots of the Twin Pines Mall, and later the Lone Pine Mall (from 1985) were shot at the Puente Hills Mall in City of Industry, California. The exterior shots and some interior scenes at Hill Valley High School were filmed at Whittier High School in Whittier, California. The Battle of the Bands tryout scene was filmed at the McCambridge Park Recreation Center in Burbank, and the [...] "Enchantment Under the Sea" [...] dance was filmed in the gymnasium at Hollywood United Methodist Church. The scenes outside of the Baines' house in 1955 were shot at Bushnell Avenue, South Pasadena, California.|$|E
500|$|Hollywood-based Mark Garbarino was Chopra's makeup artist. At first, {{they wanted}} her to look exactly like Kom by using {{prosthetic}} makeup. Chopra did a prosthetic test in the United States which included heavier eyelids for a more East-Asian look. However, the final result did not appeal to the makers. Also, the prosthetic would not hold during filming of the heavy-action boxing scenes. It was later reported that Chopra's look would be created post production by using visual effects. However, the results were unsatisfactory and hence this idea was also dropped. Chopra said [...] "We tried a bunch of stuff – Visual effects, prosthetics, makeup, [...] it looked too gimmicky. That's when {{we decided to go}} with just carrying the essence of the film, rather than the outer, cosmetic part." [...] Later, Uday Shirali, Chopra's makeup artist since Agneepath (2012), was hired. For creating boxing scars, makeup artist Subhash Shinde was employed. His biggest challenges were to make the fight marks look as realistic as possible as it required {{a lot of time and}} detailing. He stated, [...] "Every punch or scar needed to <b>look</b> <b>real,</b> change colour and age with time on screen, and shouldn't look like they were created using makeup." [...] He did some research by visiting hospitals to understand more about skin injuries.|$|E
