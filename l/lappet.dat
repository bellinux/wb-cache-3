500|$|One of Busch's notable {{stories is}} Der Virtuos (1865), which {{describes}} {{the life of}} a pianist who plays privately for an excited listener. Satirizing the self-publicizing artist's attitude and his overblown adoration, it varies from Busch's other stories as each scene does not contain prose, but is defined with music terminology, such as [...] "Introduzione", [...] "Maestoso" [...] and [...] "Fortissimo vivacissimo". As the scenes increase in tempo, each part of his body and <b>lappet</b> run around. The penultimate scene again depicts the pianist's movements, with score sheets floating above the grand piano on which musical notes are dancing. Over the years graphic artists have been fascinated by Der Virtuos. August Macke, in a letter to gallery owner Herwarth Walden, described Busch as the first Futurist, stating how well he captured time and movement. Similar pioneering scenes are in Bilder zur Jobsiade (1872). Job fails to answer rather easy questions set by twelve clergy, who shake their heads in synchronicity. Each scene is a movement study that presages Eadweard Muybridge's photography. Muybridge began his work in 1872, not released until 1893.|$|E
2500|$|Jellyfish {{employ a}} loose network of nerves, {{located in the}} epidermis, which is called a [...] "nerve net". Although {{traditionally}} thought {{not to have a}} central nervous system, nerve net concentration and ganglion-like structures could be considered to constitute one in most species. A jellyfish detects various stimuli including the touch of other animals via this nerve net, which then transmits impulses both throughout the nerve net and around a circular nerve ring, through the rhopalial <b>lappet,</b> located at the rim of the jellyfish body, to other nerve cells.|$|E
2500|$|The hennin {{was worn}} tilted {{backward}} at an angle. It {{was made of}} light material, often card or a wire mesh over which a light fabric was fixed, although little is known {{of the details of}} their construction. There was often a cloth <b>lappet,</b> or [...] "cornet" [...] in French, in front of the hennin covering part of the brow, and sometimes falling onto the shoulders to either side. There is very often a [...] "frontlet" [...] or short loop seen on the forehead (right), to adjust the hennin forward, and perhaps even to hold it on in wind.|$|E
50|$|Papal <b>lappets</b> on tiaras came to {{be highly}} decorated, with {{intricate}} stitching in gold thread. Often a pope who either commissioned a tiara, received it as a gift, or who had it remodelled for their usage, had their coat of arms stitched on to the <b>lappets.</b> Many later papal <b>lappets</b> were made of embroidered silk and used lace.|$|R
50|$|Since early medi√¶val {{times each}} papal tiara has {{included}} two <b>lappets.</b> Their origins remain a mystery, {{though they are}} obviously an imitation of the <b>lappets</b> on the bishop's mitre. It has been speculated that <b>lappets</b> first were added to papal tiaras {{as a form of}} sweatband, with inner cloth being used to prevent popes from sweating too heavily during papal ceremonial in hot Roman summers.|$|R
50|$|Minicryphaeus was {{split-off}} from Pseudocryphaeus. The main {{differences are}} that in Minicryphaeus the genal spines are about 75% {{of the length}} of the glabella, the spaces between the lateral pygidial <b>lappets</b> are V-shaped, and the terminal spine is triangular and longer than the other <b>lappets.</b> In Pseudocryphaeus the genal spines are about half as long as the glabella, the spaces between the <b>lappets</b> are U-shaped, and the terminal spine is pentangular.|$|R

5000|$|The Latin {{name for}} the <b>lappets</b> is infulae, which were {{originally}} headbands worn by dignitaries, priests, and others among the ancient Romans. [...] They were generally white. Mitre <b>lappets</b> are often lined with red silk.|$|R
50|$|The epanokamelavkion is {{attached}} {{to the front of the}} kamilavkion and extends over the top to hang down the back, with <b>lappets</b> hanging down on each side.

60|$|Nod {{opened his}} mouth as if to speak, and shut it again. He stared hard at those bandaged eyes. He glanced across at the black, huddling thorn-trees; at the Mountain-mulgars, going and {{returning}} with their faggots; at Thimble lying dozing in his litter. All the while betwixt finger and thumb he squeezed and pinched his Wonderstone beneath the <b>lappet</b> of his pocket.|$|E
60|$|The {{man looked}} round stupidly, but Rupert {{pointed to his}} wife, and again poured some spirits between her lips. This time she made a slight {{movement}} and opened her eyes. The peasant gave a wild scream of delight, and poured forth a volume of words, of which Rupert understood nothing; but the peasant kneeling beside him, bent his forehead till it touched the ground, and then kissed the <b>lappet</b> of his coat--an action expressive of the intensity of his gratitude.|$|E
6000|$|But the {{minister}} was down upon him at once,--had {{him by the}} <b>lappet</b> of his coat, though he knew {{how important it was}} for his dear niece that he should allow Mr. Glascock to amuse himself this evening after another fashion.

The question is important, and I should be glad if you would communicate my ideas to your great philosopher.

60|$|She {{took me by}} one of the lappets of my coat. I am a slovenly old man, and a {{good deal}} of my meat and drink gets splashed about on my clothes. Sometimes one of the women, and {{sometimes}} another, cleans me of my grease. The day before, Rosanna had taken out a spot for me on the <b>lappet</b> of my coat, with a new composition, warranted to remove anything. The grease was gone, but there was a little dull place left on the nap of the cloth where the grease had been. The girl pointed to that place, and shook her head.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} better here," [...] said Edie, seating {{himself on the}} stone bench, and {{stretching}} the <b>lappet</b> of his blue gown upon the spot, when he motioned Lovel to sit down beside him--"we shall be better here than doun below; the air's free and mild, and the savour of the wallflowers, and siccan shrubs as grow on thae ruined wa's, is far mair refreshing than the damp smell doun below yonder. They smell sweetest by night-time thae flowers, and they're maist aye seen about rained buildings. Now, Maister Lovel, can ony o' you scholars gie a gude reason for that?" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{found the}} piazza crowded. Opposite the Riario Palace was erected a stage on which were seats, {{but these were}} empty. The sky was blue, the sun shone merrily on the people, {{and the air was}} soft and warm. Nature was full of peace and goodwill; but in men's hearts was lust of blood.... A {{flourish}} of trumpets announced the approach of Caterina and her suite. Amid ringing cheers she entered the square, accompanied by her half-brother, the Duke of Milan, and by the Protonotary Savello. They took their seats on the platform, the Duke on her right, Savello on her left. She turned to the priest and talked most amiably to him; he smiled and bowed, but his agitation was shown by the twitching of his hands fidgeting with the <b>lappet</b> of his cloak.|$|E

2500|$|Unique to England was {{the gable}} hood, a wired headdress shaped like the gable of a house. [...] In the 16th century gable headdress had long {{embroidered}} <b>lappets</b> framing {{the face and}} a loose veil behind; later the gable hood would be worn over several layers that completely concealed the hair, and the <b>lappets</b> and veil would be pinned up {{in a variety of}} ways.|$|R

6000|$|... "Move on, move on," [...] said a {{policeman}} to her. Lifting her veil, Beatrice {{turned and looked}} at him, and muttering something he moved on himself, leaving her in peace. Presently she saw Geoffrey and the gentleman who had been so kind to her walking along together. They came through the gateway; the <b>lappet</b> of his coat brushed her arm, and he never saw her. Closer she crouched against the pillar, hiding herself in its shadow. Within six feet of her Geoffrey stopped and lit a cigar. The light of the match flared upon his face, that dark, strong face she loved so well. How tired he looked. A great longing took possession of her to step forward and speak to him, but she restrained herself almost by force.|$|E
60|$|After this our {{position}} grew quite warm, for as I {{have said the}} thorn trunks were not very broad, and {{three or four of}} the natives, who had probably been hunters, were by no means bad shots, though the rest of them fired wildly. Anscombe, in poking his head round the tree to shoot, had his hat knocked off by a bullet, while a slug went through the <b>lappet</b> of my coat. Then a worse thing happened. Either by chance or design Anscombe's horse was struck in the neck and fell struggling, whereon my beast, growing frightened, broke its riem and galloped to the wagon. That is where I ought to have left them at first, only I thought that we might need them to make a bolt on, or to carry Anscombe if he could not walk.|$|E
60|$|This second day's {{journey was}} in many respects a {{counterpart}} of the first. The road was utterly deserted, and they saw neither Boer, Englishman, nor Kafir upon it; nothing, indeed, except a few herds of game grazing on the ridges. About two o'clock, however, {{just as they had}} started after a short outspan, a little incident occurred. Suddenly the Vilderbeeste's horse put his foot into an ant-bear hole and fell heavily, throwing his rider on to his head. He was up in a minute, but his forehead had struck against the jawbone of a dead buck, and the blood was pouring from it down his hairy face. His companion laughed brutally at the accident, for there are some natures in the world to which the sight of pain is irresistibly comical, but the injured man cursed aloud, trying to staunch the flow with the <b>lappet</b> of his coat.|$|E
