5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow,</b> with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E

I use event history models to describe the longitudinal patterns in disciplinary actions taken against physicians' licenses by state medical boards in the United States, 1990 - 2000. Adverse licensure action episodes that included discipline for drug or alcohol abuse were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>followed</b> by license restoration than episodes that did not.

Furthermore, disciplinary licensure actions for drug abuse were the category most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>followed</b> by a subsequent action {{for the same reason}} over the longer term (4 - 11 years). The increased risk of repeat disciplinary action associated with drug abuse may result in part from intensive surveillance of physicians who complete impaired physician programs, through mechanisms that include urine screening. However, it is also likely that the chronic nature of addiction leads to continued risk of relapse even among physicians receiving appropriate treatment.

2500|$|In 1811–1812, Samuel Taylor Coleridge {{made two}} points of {{criticism}} about this play. The first {{was that the}} entire play {{should be seen as}} a dream.

He thought that this was a reflection of the lack of principles in women, who are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> their own passions and inclinations than men. Women, in his view, feel less abhorrence for moral evil, though they are concerned with its outward consequences. Coleridge was probably the earliest critic to introduce gender issues to the analysis of this play.

2500|$|One {{focus of}} {{attachment}} {{research has been}} on the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called [...] "day care wars" [...] of the late 20th century, during which the deleterious effects of day care were stressed. As a beneficial result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues and the need for relationship-building through techniques such as assignment of a child to a specific care provider. Although only high-quality child care settings are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> through on these considerations, nevertheless a larger number of infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than {{was the case in the}} past, and emotional development of children in nonparental care may be different today than it was in the 1980s or in Bowlby's time.|$|E
2500|$|Building on the {{importance}} of idealism, some recent researchers suggest the 'engaged followership' perspective. Based on an examination of Milgram's archive, in a recent study, social psychologists Alex Haslam, Stephen Reicher and Megan Birney, at the University of Queensland, discovered that people are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the prods of an experimental leader when the prod resembles an order. However, when the prod stresses {{the importance}} of the experiment for science (i.e. 'The experiment requires you to continue'), {{people are more likely to}} obey. The researchers suggest the perspective of 'engaged followership': that people are not simply obeying the orders of a leader, but instead are willing to continue the experiment because of their desire to support the scientific goals of the leader and because of a lack of identification with the learner. Also a neuroscientific study [...] supports this perspective, namely watching the learner receive electric shocks, does not activate brain regions involving empathic concerns.|$|E
2500|$|The Roman Empire {{expanded}} to include different peoples and cultures; in principle, Rome followed the same inclusionist policies that had recognised Latin, Etruscan and other Italian peoples, cults and deities as Roman. Those who acknowledged Rome's hegemony retained their own cult and religious calendars, independent of Roman religious law. Newly municipal Sabratha built a Capitolium near its existing temple to Liber Pater and Serapis. Autonomy and concord were official policy, but new foundations by Roman citizens or their Romanised allies were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> Roman cultic models. Romanisation offered distinct political and practical advantages, especially to local elites. All the known effigies from the 2nd century AD forum at Cuicul are of emperors or Concordia. By {{the middle of the}} 1st century AD, Gaulish Vertault seems to have abandoned its native cultic sacrifice of horses and dogs in favour of a newly established, Romanised cult nearby: {{by the end of that}} century, Sabratha’s so-called tophet was no longer in use.

40|$|Although {{comprehension}} {{is critical}} to the survey response process, much about it remains unknown. Research has shown that concepts can be clarified through the use of definitions, instructions or examples, but respondents do not necessarily attend to these clarifications. This dissertation presents the results of three experiments designed to investigate where and how to present clarifying information most effectively. In the first experiment, eight study questions, modeled after questions in major federal surveys, were administered as part of a Web survey. The results suggest that clarification improves comprehension of the questions. There is some evidence from that initial experiment that respondents anticipate the end of a question and are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> ignore clarification that comes after the question than before it. However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that clarifications are most effective when they are incorporated into a series of questions. A second experiment was conducted in both a Web and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) survey. IVR was chosen because it controlled for the effects of interviewers. The results of this experiment suggest that readers appear no more capable of comprehending complex clarification than listeners. In both channels, instructions were least <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>followed</b> when they were presented after the question, more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>followed</b> when they were placed before the question, and most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>followed</b> when they were incorporated into a series of questions. Finally, in a third experiment, five variables were varied to examine the use of examples in survey questions. Broad categories elicited higher reports than narrow categories and frequently consumed examples elicited higher reports than infrequently consumed examples. The implication of this final study is that the choice of categories and examples require careful consideration, as this choice will influence respondents' answers, but {{it does not seem to}} matter where and how a short list of examples are presented...|$|R
