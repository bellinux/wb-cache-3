5|$|The {{campaign}} in the Adriatic has been credited with having {{a significant effect on}} the wider war through the disruption of French forces in the Balkans. It has been suggested that Napoleon intended to invade the Ottoman Empire following the War of the Fifth Coalition, but was dissuaded in part due to the difficulty of supplying a force in the region without control of the Adriatic, his attention eventually turning to Russia. The campaign also had effects on the morale and effectiveness of the French fleet, which <b>lost</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> best commanders and frigates in the campaign, and on the Austrian advance on Italy in 1813, when French defence lines were repeatedly out-flanked by British attacks from the sea.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the music {{produced}} by the movement and its passage from underground phenomenon to mainstream genre, prompted its main promoter Geoff Barton to declare the NWOBHM finished in 1981. He felt disappointed by the low quality of the new bands and frustrated by {{the ease with which}} record labels exploited enthusiasm for heavy metal. Coincidentally, in the same year, the Bandwagon was closed and the Prince of Wales pub was subsequently demolished to build a restaurant. Although the movement had <b>lost</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> appeal for diehard fans, as evidenced by the increased popularity of American-influenced AOR releases on sales-based national polls, it retained enough vitality to launch a second wave of bands, which rose from the underground and released their first albums in 1982 and 1983.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Arévalo's {{presidency}} in 1951, Jacobo Árbenz {{was elected to the}} {{presidency in}} a landslide. The progressive military leader of 1944 continued Arévalo's reforms, and began an ambitious land-reform program, known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation, and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion. Árbenz' policies ran afoul of the United Fruit Company, which <b>lost</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> uncultivated land. The company lobbied the US government for Árbenz' overthrow, and the State Department responded by engineering a coup under the pretext that Árbenz was a communist. Carlos Castillo Armas took power {{at the head of a}} military junta, provoking the Guatemalan Civil War. The war lasted from 1960 to 1996, and saw the US-backed military commit genocide against the indigenous Maya peoples, and widespread human rights violations against civilians.|$|E
5|$|The charter {{became part}} of English {{political}} life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it <b>lost</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> practical significance. At {{the end of the}} 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going {{back to the days of}} the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as habeas corpus. Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles.|$|E

The scrapped eastern alignment would have also included a link to a future urban area in the Kowen District.

40|$|Potamogeton rutilus Wolfg. {{is a rare}} {{threatened}} macrophyte which, {{within the}} British Isles, is confined to oligo-mesotrophic Scottish lochs. The species has been <b>lost</b> from <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> former recorded sites, thought due to eutrophication and other environmental habitat changes. The plants limited distribution may be partly related to <b>its</b> lack <b>of</b> seed production that may limit long distance bird seed dispersal. P. rutilus appears to be reliant on clonal growth for reproduction, so may have a reduced genetic diversity that can reduce fecundity. To assist the development of strategies for the future conservation of P. rutilus, a series of investigations was carried out to reveal the autecological factors that influence the plant’s distribution and survival. In summing up the main findings of the investigation, {{it was found that}} Scottish and Finnish P. rutilus have different trophic plant community types, with Scottish P. rutilus inhabiting less nutrient rich oligo-mesotrophic lochs than the more nutrient rich, eutrophic, Finnish P. rutilus habitats. Salinity may have caused P. rutilus to be <b>lost</b> from <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> former machair lochs. P. rutilus abundance and macrophyte diversity significantly declined with reduced light availability in lochs. The growth experiments revealed that P. rutilus turion size is a good measure of plant fitness and fecundity and eutrophic phosphate conditions, under a half-light regime, produced optimum P. rutilus turion growth. The genetic investigations suggest there is limited gene flow between P. rutilus populations and this could be {{due to the lack of}} seed production for inter-population seed dispersal. However, P. rutilus does not totally rely on clonal growth for reproduction, as genetic evidence suggested there was <b>some</b> degree <b>of</b> sexual reproduction in some populations.

The result was that the poor took to the streets, in a series of large-scale demonstrations that were also poorly handled by the government, with large numbers of protesters being shot dead by the authorities. Atabani was the lead-signatory among 31 reformers who sent a memorandum to the president, deploring the killings and advising a different response the situation.
