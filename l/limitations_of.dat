40|$|Florida law is {{currently}} unclear {{on the issue}} of whether a professional may rely upon a <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> liability clause in a professional services contract. <b>Limitation</b> <b>of</b> liability clauses are common in business contracts, especially in construction, a field that includes many professionals such as engineers and architects. While Florida has historically enforced <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> liability clauses in professional services contracts, recent cases have cast doubt on whether the clauses are enforceable. If the Florida Supreme Court establishes that professionals cannot rely upon these clauses, it will be taking a position contrary to the majority of states, including New York, California, and Texas, all <b>of</b> which enforce <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> liability clauses with varying degrees of restriction. This Note argues that Florida should not prohibit professionals from using <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> liability clauses. These clauses do not violate public policy when, as already required by Florida law, the clauses are stated clearly, ensuring that both parties to the contract are aware of their existence. Permitting professionals to continue to rely upon <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> liability clauses honors the contracting parties’ freedom <b>of</b> contract.
