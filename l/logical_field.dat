In this study, we performed a comparative planetology approach to discriminate between these two features on Saturn's moon Titan, by comparing the radar signature of their terrestrial analogues. The Ku- band (13. 8 GHz) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) onboard the Cassini spacecraft is able to sense through the optically-opaque atmosphere of Titan, but the resolution of this instrument (200 m) is not sufficient to clearly observe the morphology of linear structures. We then considered orbital radar images of terrestrial structures, provided by the high reso- lution (18 m) X-band radar (9. 6 GHz) of the TerraSAR-X mission. We acquired images of the Great Sand Sea (Egypt) and the Namib Desert (Namibia) for the linear dunes; and of the Lut Desert (Iran) and the Dju- rab Desert (Chad) for the mega-yardangs. We modeled the geometrical effect of the topography using DEM models provided by SRTM and GDEM, and the surface roughness effect was estimated using single scattering models such as Integral Equation model and Geometrical Optics model. We were able to reproduce in a quite faithful way the backscattered radar signal by terrestrial dunes and mega-yardangs. These results were applied on Titan to the analysis of T 8 and T 49 fly- bys over the Bellet equatorial region, which contains linear dune fields, and to the analysis of T 64 and T 83 flybys, which show potential mega- yardang structures. Based on our quantitative radar modeling results, we can confirm that linear structures in T 64 and T 83 are actually mega- yardangs. As on Earth mega-yardang are usually formed over former lakes depressions on homogeneous rocks with a strong and stable uni- directional wind erosion over million years.

40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] PU vir CHO, 1959. This study furnishes {{some results}} of an {{investigation}} to ascertain whether {{the possibility of a}} Christian logic can be maintained as a meaningful question. This problem seems to be enmeshed in a complex encompassing the problem of Christian science* as such. Whether the possibility of a Christian logic is maintained or denied, at any rate this implies a positive standpoint towards the problem of a Christian logic. Some general remarks having been made in an introductory chapter, the main aspects bearing on the background of different points of view towards logic are presented in Chapter II. The general philosophical conception adopted seems to be of importance with a view to the formation of a conception of logic in at least and especially two respects. Philosophical trends have a marked influence on the view taken of logic. As far as modern philosophy is concerned, one can point to the differences appertaining to logic, its character, and the domain accorded to logic as science, its place in the cosmic reality, etc., differences which become evident in the conceptions of, for example, Descartes, Arnauld & Nicole, Kant, Opzoomer, Heymans, Bolland, Dewey, Bergson and Heidegger. Whereas Dewey, Bergson and Heidegger move in an irrationalistic direction, the first mentioned six philosophers bear evidence of a rationalistic point of view. The idealistic conception of Kant differs from the scientialism of a Descartes and the practicalism of the writers of The Port Ro*al Logic; the difference {{can be traced to the}} fact that Kant lends. the divergent solutions furnished by scientialism and practicalism to a unity, which ascribes to the ~ human perceptive faculty two functions, a theoretical and practical; theoretical reason and practical reason are autonomous, each in its particular sphere. The more recent rationalism of an Opzoomer, Heymans and Bolland, keeps to the rationalistic main lines but takes the a priori's of autonomous reason in a dynamic-active sense by laying stress on the scientific methods. Positivism advanced the first solution in this direction, overestimating scientific theory in a scientialistic spirit, with the result that the practical existence is viewed in the light of science. The positivism of a Comte and Opzoomer finds an antipode in the neo-positivism of, for instance, Dilthey, Wundt and Heymans, laying stress on the practical aspect. And then the neoidealism of Cassirer, Bosanquet, Bolland and others bridges the opposition between the positivistic and nee-positivistic conceptions. The far-reaching influence of rationalistic conceptions encountered a serious set-back on account of the increasing importance attached to the se-called critique of science and especially the rise of irrationalistic conceptions. Irrationalism accepts reason in a rationalistic sense, but limits its validity and importance to a specific sphere. The pragQatism of James and Dewey, for instance, supports science only in so far as it furthers practical purposes: one has to obey reason in order to experiment, but the important point is exactly the fact that one is busy experimenting on account of a need bearing on practical life. A second trend, the "philosophy of life" which had an eminent exponent in Bergson, emphasizes the importance of "life" (taken in an organicpsychovitalistic sense) instead of practical utility, and therefore accentuates intuition in contrast to the symbolic operational method of intelligence (which "belong to the domain of logic). And finally existentialistically-minded philosophers champion the cause of human existence, of the individual concrete situation. It is pointed out that these differences in philosophical conception result in different points of view taken of logic. Secondly the specific type of philosophical point of view is an ontological factor of supreme importance in the realisation of a conception of logic. Kant and Hegel, for instance, both advance an idealistic conception, but differ as to the type of philosophical point of view; for Hegel attaches himself to a contradictory type whereas Kant propounds an "ennoetic" conception which regards the sensations as furnishing the material for the forms of the intellect, that is to say, the intellect has the sensations as contents of the mind. Moreover I may refer to the interaction-theory of a Descartes and the instrumentistic point of view of a Bergson or the psychomonistic type represented by a Heymans, etc. Each particular type of philosophical conception involves a specific cosmology and anthropology, and results in a particular conception of logic and the problems of this branch of science. In addition to the above mentioned ontological matters, it is necessary to point separately to the importance of epistemological factors for one's conception of logic. This point is illustrated by enumerating some basic problems of a theory of knowledge and explaining a few points in greater detail, for instance, the possibility and suppositions of knowledge; the analysis of knowledge (including the essence, character and kinds of knowledge), the formation of knowledge, the purpose of knowledge and the unity of knowledge (including limits and scope of knowledge, the partial nature and coherence of knowledge); and the validity of knowledge (including knowledge and law, knowledge and value, as well as the reliability of knowledge). In yet another respect different points of view may arise, viz. according to the opinion held as to logic as science, its character and domain, and the investigation of the <b>logical</b> <b>field.</b> There is, for instance, a trend in logic which attempts to approach the field of logic from that of mathematics, and on the other hand some logicians undertake the task of studying the basic principles of mathematics with logic as the starting-point. Moreover, also the points of view of psychologism in logic (Sigwart) and Husserl’s reaction against this trend, tend to show that the scientific determination of the field of investigation bears testimony to the fact that the logician cannot afford to neglect matters which can be traced to different attitudes in theory of science, and different points of view in regard to the field of investigation. Lastly the suggestion may be offered that one-sided stressing of one or more of the different factors of importance (mentioned above) as such, may also result in different conceptions of logic. * * * Up to this point no attention has been paid to the possibility of the Christian conviction, the Christian "life and world-view", etc., as an important factor in the formation of a conception of logic. Chapter III gives a general survey of the points of view taken on logic in a Christian atmosphere. A Christian logic is an utter impossibility; this is the first standpoint taken as to this problem. This, point of view comprises, however, various subordinate solutions of the problem. Some argue that as far as the importance and implications of Christianity are concerned, Christianity is confined to divine worship and this does not bear on logic in any way whatsoever. Others acknowledge the importance of Christianity for divine worship, and add: for daily practical life too [...] - although in no wise for science and therefore not for logic. A third solution accepts the significance of Christianity for a section of science, for instance as far as theology is concerned, and also for philosophy, and perhaps in some respects for other branches of science (e. g. sociology, ethnology, the science of history, etc.) but at any rate not as far as logic is concerned. On the other hand some scientists, inspired by the reformational concept of Calvin, maintain that Christianity, that the Christian view of cosmos and man, the Christian approach to scientific matters, etc., must be esteemed a factor of importance so far as the conception of science as such is concerned, and that moreover it is imperative that all scientific investigations be undertaken in the light of the revelation (in Holy Scripture); for this reason among others the idea of a Christian logic is not absurd. This thesis can be elucidated by mentioning some contributions to a Christian logic, for instance, A. Kuyper's opinion that science is of two kinds because humanity is of two kinds, those regarding the cosmos as normal and those who take into account the reality of the fall of man in Adam, and therefore acknowledge the fact that an act of interference on the part of God is necessary to put the cosmos again in a correct relation to Him. On account of this difference Kuyper therefore maintains the existence of a Christian and non Christian science. As the fact of sin dit not affect the formal activity of thinking, according to Kuyper, he states that the palingenesis does not cause any difference in this respect; therefore only one kind of logic exists [...] - a Christian logic. S. O. Los indicates the necessity of a Christian logic by stating that the Calvinistic principles ought to find application in every section of science, not excluding logic. A Christian logic takes into account the principles of Holy Scripture and brings them to bear upon scientific studies. H. G. Stoker's conception of the cosmos as a created coherent diversity implies i n t era 1 i a that the field of logic has an irreducible, unique character of its own, but the logical sphere is part of a comprehensive totality in which all diversity is given in a coherent complex. Because it is a radical diversity, it is unlike the psychical, lingual or ethical sphere, and therefore the logical sphere may not be reduced to any other diversity nor isolated from the diversity with which it constitutes a totality. On account of the fact that cosmic reality is a created diversity, it is not autonomous nor self-sufficient; a Christian logic therefore naturally opposes the dogma of the autonomy of thought. C. Van Til points out that whereas the facts and laws with which logic is concerned, are not detached from their being created, the facts and laws of logic too are not self-sufficient, but part of created reality; accordingly it is imperative that the Christian truths (of, for instance, creation, fall of man into sin, and redemption in Jesus Christ in the communion of the Holy Spirit) be acknowledged from the very beginning. Indeed, as Van Til explains in detail, no part of Christianity remains intact when once the Arminian logic is allowed to run its course. K. Schilder puts forward various considerations bearing on the impossibility of a formal or neutral logic, and states that logic has a foundation in fundamental philosophical ideas, on account of which a Hegelian, Fiahtian and Calvinist have different conceptions of logic; moreover, logic is not detached from other sciences, and in no science can one find one's way without a standpoint in faith. H. Dooyeweerd's "philosophy of the cosmonomic idea" states and illustrates in various respects both the possibility and necessity of a Christian logic. Especially his theory of the nodal spheres each subjected to its own law, discloses an insight of great depth concerning the logical sphere as a modal aspect of cosmic reality, having the numerical and spatial aspects, the aspect of mathematical movement, the aspect of physical energy, of organic life and of psychical feeling as substratum spheres and the historical and linguistic aspects, the aspect of social intercourse, the economic, the aesthetic, the jural, the moral aspects and the aspect of faith as superstratum spheres. In its modal nucleus each sphere enjoys a sovereignty in its own sphere and differs from every other modal aspect; on account of retrocipations each sphere coheres with every previous sphere in the cosmic order and by means of anticipations with the superstratum spheres, thus presenting also a universality in its own sphere. The variable phenomena of each sphere function subjected to a law of their own, for instance, in the logical sphere judgements are subjected to the logical (analytical) law; accordingly this subject is treated as the theory of the spheres of law [...] - a really important milestone on the way towards a Christian logic, particularly so, as it has proved to be exceptionally useful in determining the characteristic nature of the logical sphere. D. H. Th. Vollenhoven has established the cardinal data of a Christian logic and acquired an insight into such various points of importance for the problem of a Christian logic, that it is considered necessary to treat thereof in a separate chapter. * * * The first section of chapter IV is given to a general survey of the more important writings of Vollenhoven in so far as they contributed towards his conception of a Christian logic. An attempt is made to show how Vollenhoven arrived at his final conception. This section is also intended to furnish the basis for an interpretation of his conception, which follows in the succeeding parts of chapter IV. Ontology presents an insight into the difference in the being of God, law and cosmos. God is the Sovereign who created the cosmos and put his law to the cosmos. Only God is sovereign, i. e. not subjected to the law. It is only of the law that one can say that it obtains (for that which is subjected to the law); and the being of the cosmos exists in its being subjected to. the law. The word "law" can be taken in three different senses: as structural (modal) law, as the commandment of love, and as positive law. The being of the cosmos displays a diversity of created subjects, heavenly and earthly. By temporarily disregarding the essentials in which man differs from other "things", it is possible to investigate the being of the thing. It is necessary to distinguish the being of the subject and the object, both being subjected to the law, but in different respects. Both have to be investigated as to the modal (universal) differences and to the individual differences, as well as their particular relations and the bonds between modal differences (retrocipations and anticipations) and between individual differences (coherences). An object is a complex having a subject as the bearer of object-functions, attributes such as colour, warmth, etc.; although being more complex than the subject, subject and object have this in common that they are both subjected to the law. The structure of man is even more complex. Beside modal differences and individual differences (having this specific individual characteristic and not that, on account of which this judgement differs from that judgment [...] - although they do-not differ modally as both are logical), the difference in direction of his functions (good or bad) is of extreme importance as far as the being of man is concerned. For the different modal functions constitute the frame for the activities of man, and therefore the logical sphere is called the logical function. The activities of the heart of man (prefunctional) are, as it were, sent into a specific functional channel; and this activity is directed by the heart in a twofold exit, namely for better or worse. The structure of the realms (man, animal, plant and mineral) brings us to the genetic bond; and as to the structure of mankind two points are worth mentioning, viz. the bonds of community (their character, diversity and mutual relation) and religion as the covenant between God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and man. After the particular relation between heaven and earth has been treated, the bond between God, law and cosmos demands attention. Theory of knowledge is distinct from ontology but nevertheless presupposes a close relation. The theory of human knowledge is discussed in two main sections: the structure of the non-scientific cognition (including its suppositions; the knowable; the activity of learning-to-know; the result of knowing; and the bond between the result of knowing and the activity of learning, the knowable, and the norm of learning-to-know! and secondly the development of the non-scientific cognition), and the structure of the scientific cognition (including firstly the cognition in particular scientists method and the diversity of scientific methods in particular science, the analysable for particular sciences, and the result of scientific cognition in particular sciences; and secondly the scientific cognition of nonparticular sciences as, for instance, philosophy); the theory of science investigates particular sciences• and non-particular sciences; and c > methodology studies the problem of method as such, as well as in relation to the different sciences, not excluding logic. Under logic is discussed fundamental philosophical questions, including those of philosophy of the <b>logical</b> <b>field</b> which discloses an insight into the logical sphere of law [...] - which logic has to investigate [...] (including in particular the question of what the logical modality is and how the logical aspect is present in that which subsists gnostically),and philosophy of logic (including, the problem of logic as a science and that of its relation to philosophy). Under the general structure of the analytical (logical) sphere attention is paid to the analytical law and the analytically subjected, viz. the analytical subjects (including the analytical activity, and the result of this activity: concept and judgment) and the analytical objects (i. e. the• analytical aspect of all the sub analytical); furthermore the bond between analytical subject and object, and lastly the bond between the analytical law and the analytically subjected, as well as the bond between God, analytical law and the analytically subjected. Under the concept is discussed the concept as such, the division of concepts and the particular relations of concepts. The theory of judgment likewise avails itself of these three themes for treating judgment. Chapter V investigates some problems of a more particular nature in the domain of logic; the investigation has had to be restricted to three subjects. The analytical (logical) law. Firstly the question is considered whether an analytical law exists, and it is pointed out that logicians who do give attention to this question usually stress one-sidedly the importance of either the analysable or the analytical activity or the result of thinking (the thought). As far as the sense of the analytical law is concerned, a point of particular importance is Vollenhoven's insight that the analytical law is specifically an analytical (and no nonanalytical, e. g. a mathematical) law, a structural law, 1. e. a modal law, and as law, the boundary between God and cosmos. As to the contents of the analytical law, some critical remarks are made about the conception of e. g. Welton &Monahan, and reference is made to the importance and consequences of Vollenhoven's synopsis of the contents of the analytical law: "analyse well the analysable, whatever it may be". The discussion of the question whether the analytical law can or must be considered as being formal, touches a few facets of the problem and gives some arguments for the supposition that it is not formal. Ontology (stating the fundamental distinction between the being of God, law and cosmos) appears of cardinal importance also in respect to the question whether the analytical law be. considered a norm. Finally attention is drawn to fallacies, And the supposition is advanced that one's conception of the analytical law determines in important respects one's view held as to fallacies. Fallacies seem to be due chiefly to the following three causes: by disobeying the analytical norm, by reason of the fact that the substratum-functions of the logical function fail and on account of "wickedness of heart". With reference to R. Robinson some points of importance concerning the problem of definition are discussed. The attitude is taken that definition is a specific kind of judgment, viz. a judgment in which the predicate does not analyse or evaluate the subject of the judgment, but delimits the sphere and scope of the subject, determines it, defines it, that is to say: attributes a predicate to the subject of a judgment with a scientific purpose. Definition can be given of concepts, or words, or the contents of words or of concepts, or the meaning of words. Especially important is the fact that the theory about definition presupposes a specific category theory; accordingly a Christian standpoint adopted in scientific study results in a different point of view taken towards definition. Lastly may be mentioned. that the difference between scientific and non-scientific definition ought not be neglected. The comprehensive problem of the division of judgments likewise indicates that a Christian standpoint in science (logic) does not impede or hamper the investigation of the field of logic [...] - in this case the division of judgments [...] but on the contrary furthers scientific study and results in a new perspective, opening new fields leading to hitherto unexplored data. By comparing the divisions of judgments furnished by Welton & Monahan, Stebbing, De Vleeschauwer and Vollenhoven, the conclusion is reached that the poi...|$|E

All those works rely crucially on biorthogonality to get extensionality and compositionality properties. But the use of biorthogonality in the definitions also complicates matters when it comes to operational correctness. Most of the time, such correctness results amount to show an unfolding lemma that makes reduction more explicit than in a biorthogonal definition. Unfortunately, unfolding lemmas are not easy to derive for rich languages and in particular for assembly code. In this paper, we focus on three different situations that enable to reach step-by-step the assembly code universe: the use of Curry-style polymorphism, the presence of syntactical equality in the language and finally an ideal assembly code with a notion of code pointer...|$|R

Eponymous terms are defined. The opinion is held that such a term which is a person’s name, {{the name of a}} city, village, of some other geographical place, of a country or nation, as well as of a tribe included in its structure, can be called an eponymous term. The Lithuanian terms of such a kind were not discussed till now, that’s why the article could give the start for discussions or for more thorough studies in this <b>field.</b> <b>Logical</b> – semantic links between the eponymous term and its original source (the proper name) are examined. As one-word terms are loans, or borrowings, their original source is indicated.

Howard Gardner, a researcher in child psychology, has studied intelligences {{for at least}} to decades in Project Zero at Harvard College. Garner states in his theory {{that there is not}} only intelligence (linguistics and logistics) but multiple intelligences, at least eight. I have proposed two questions to answer in my thesis: 1) How can a teacher use the theory of multiple intelligences to reach students whose strengths are not so-called “academic intelligences?” and 2) How can I use what Howard Garner has learned b y working with exceptional children to apply it {{to a wide variety of}} students in one classroom? I have written about Howard Garner and his theory of multiple intelligences. I have also discussed several teaching styles that Gardner, other researchers, and teachers have helped create that would accommodate many of these intelligences. By using the information, I have described several ways I could use his their in my class. Finally, I have developed possible lesson plans to utilize these multiple intelligences. I plan to use this information in my classroom, and I hope that other teachers can use this information, too. Some students do not excel in linguistic or logical-mathematical skills, but in other areas, or intelligences, according to Gardner.

The IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE command does not currently define that field. It would be helpful if it were optionally available, and if implemented by an ATAPI device supporting SCSI commands, matched the SCSI target device name returned in the SCSI INQUIRY command Device Identification VPD page (83 h). The other SCSI names/identifiers it could be each have problems: a) It cannot serve as the SCSI target port name, because if the SATA device is behind a SATA port selector, the same name appears in two different domains. b) It cannot serve as the SCSI target port identifier, because the value is not actually used for addressing within any domains. In SAS, the expander to which the SATA device is attached assigns it a SAS address. An advanced expander could send IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE to retrieve the World Wide Name and use that as the SAS address, but this is not required in SAS- 1. 1. c) It cannot serve as the logical unit name, because the PACKET command payload might include a SCSI- 2 compatible <b>LOGICAL</b> UNIT NUMBER <b>field</b> in the CDB (byte 1 bits 7 : 5), and each logical unit name must be unique.

40|$|Weather radars {{have been}} used to quantitatively {{estimate}} precipitation since their development in the 1940 s, yet these estimates are still prone to large uncertainties which dissuade the hydrological community in the UK from adopting these estimates as their primary rainfall data source. Recently dual polarisation radars have become more common, with the national networks in the USA, UK and across Europe being upgraded, and the benefits of dual polarisation radars are beginning to be realised for improving quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE). The National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) mobile Doppler X-band dual polarisation weather radar is the first radar {{of its kind in the}} UK, and since its acquisition in 2012 has been deployed on several field campaigns in both the UK and abroad. The first of these campaigns was the Convective Precipitation Experiment (COPE) where the radar was deployed in Cornwall (UK) through the summer of 2013. This thesis has used the data acquired during the COPE field campaign to develop a processing chain for the X-band radar which leverages its dual polarisation capabilities. The processing chain developed includes the removal of spurious echoes including second trip, ground clutter and insects through the use of dual polarisation texture <b>fields,</b> <b>logical</b> decision thresholds and fuzzy logic classification. The radar data is then corrected for the effects of attenuation and partial beam blockage (PBB) by using the differential phase shift to constrain the total path integrated attenuation and calibrate the radar azimuthally. A new smoothing technique has been developed to account for backscatter differential phase in the smoothing of differential phase shift which incorporates a long and a short averaging window in conjunction with weighting smoothing using the copolar correlation coefficient. During the correction process it is shown that the calculation of PBB is insensitive to the variation in the ratio between specific attenuation and specific differential phase shift provided a consistent value is used. It is also shown that the uncertainty in attenuation correction is lower when using a constrained correction such as the ZPHI approach rather than a direct linear correction using differential phase shift and is the preferred method of correction where possible. Finally the quality controlled, corrected radar moments are used to develop a rainfall estimation for the COPE field campaign. Results show that the quality control and correction process increases the agreement between radar rainfall estimates and rain gauges when using horizontal reflectivity from a regression correlation of - 0. 01 to 0. 34, with a reduction in the mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) from 86...|$|R
40|$|As {{the aim of}} the research, {{the author}} set the task of searching for new ways of {{conducting}} educational activity when teaching Project Management at the university taking into account the dominating mosaic thinking of modern students. There is a need to teach students of the given <b>field</b> <b>logical</b> thinking, the ability to work in the financial and humanitarian spheres of current business. In order to get a result, the analysis of the existing scientific views and approaches to teaching students with dominating mosaic thinking was conducted. The existing views by both Russian and foreign authors of mosaic thinking were considered, its different educational, psychological and philosophical aspects. As a result of the synthesis of the given approaches, taking into account the author’s inventions, proposals were developed on solving the problems of mosaic thinking in teaching students. Taking a constructive approach as a basis, the mosaic thinking is suggested to be considered as a phenomenon having both advantages and disadvantages. Changing the content of the educational process is done through updating standard methods and patterns of education, wide use of innovation approaches, intensifying cooperation and online collaboration of the teacher and the student in the process of study. The basis is formed by the emotional impact on the student in the course of studies, which will allow using logic and form the intention to learn the presented fact. Teaching Project Management to students is proposed taking into account their mosaic thinking, in four stages. During the lecture students receive a chain of images structured by the lecturer in the sequence embracing basic issues of the theme under consideration and presented {{in such a way as}} to inspire them to study the given questions independently. At the second stage, the students search for the solution of the assigned tasks in the course of independent work with the opportunities available for their level of perception. During the seminar classes (practical studies) at the third stage, the lecturer evaluates the quantity and quality of the solutions of practical tasks (case problems) found by the students. In the course of discussion, the students share their variants of solving practical problems, grounding the relevance of the proposed variants. At the fourth stage (midterm assessment – examination) the students develop a project as a whole or one of its stages, solving a set of interrelated practical problems. Since mosaic thinking is the reality of a new information society now, a conclusion was made of the necessity not to fight mosaic thinking, but to reorganize the educational process taking into account, on the one hand, the peculiarities of students having mosaic thinking, on the other hand, needs of business which requires project managers capable of both processing great amounts of information and arranging logical chains and determining cause and effect relationships. The given modification of education is proposed to be implemented in regards to changing the content of lectures and seminar classes, adding figurativeness and emotionalism into them, which will make it possible to set the cognitive activity of the students having mosaic thinking, and changing the direction and content of students’ independent work, setting the independent search for solving problems and case tasks as its goal.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The Indigenous {{cultural}} {{and natural resource}} management (ICNRM) sector has grown rapidly in Australia, particularly {{in the north of}} the continent. ICNRM programs are generally focused on activities that are classed as ‘environmental’ by funding sources. Yet there is emerging evidence that the programs, and the activities they undertake, generate a range of health, economic, social and cultural benefits additional to the main environmental outcomes. Such evidence demonstrates why the ICNRM sector is so popular amongst Indigenous people. The economic significance of the sector is substantial, even when taking into account that Australia has a social security system that provides for otherwise unemployed or under-employed Indigenous people. There is also evidence that the sociopolitical recognition of ownership and management rights and of the knowledge and skills in ‘caring for country’ accruing from such programs, may be as important to many program participants as the direct economic benefits. The wider non-environmental benefits of ICNRM appear to be both diverse and significant. This report examines a case study of how those benefits may accrue within an Indigenous community, and the implications of that for wider systems of benefit classification. It uses a mixed methods approach - an extensive literature review is combined with the case-study involving both qualitative research and collaborative film production. This research aimed to identify a diverse array of potential community benefits through in-depth engagement with a case study where, based on the program circumstances, good prospects existed to identify such benefits. This study did not aim to generate a quantitatively representative account of benefits across a particular ranger program, or indeed across the sector as a whole. Rather, it aimed for in-depth research that complements other recent studies, notably a larger scale, predominantly survey-based review of the social benefits of the Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) program (URBIS 2012). The case study selected is in Blue Mud Bay, an area of the Laynhapuy IPA in northeast Arnhem Land. The Laynhapuy IPA is managed by Yirralka Rangers, an ICNRM program that is highly regionalised (decentralised) in comparison with many other programs. This makes it particularly useful for examining non-environmental benefits that accrue at the scale of the local Indigenous community. In addition, Baniyala, the Blue Mud Bay homeland on which the research focused, is considered locally as the origin point of the entire program. This means that considerable thinking has occurred in that location about the underlying purposes, ongoing operations, and wider effects of ranger efforts. The case study was investigated using a combination of individual and group interviews, site visits, workshops, and the collaborative production of a film. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with ranger program staff, their immediate families, community elders, and wider homeland residents. Questions focused on key topics relating to the program – underlying principles and purposes, desirable activities, domestic and wider community consequences, existing challenges, and future aspirations. The film involved a formal collaboration between CSIRO, Yirralka Rangers, and The Mulka Project, a local multimedia organisation {{that is part of the}} Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Arts Centre. It focused on:• placing the ranger program in its wider community and cultural context;• representing a suite of key activities the rangers engage in - site protection, visitor management,  business development, etc.;• and demonstrating the benefits derived from the program. The film complements the data presented here, and provides a key means for achieving both community and wider public impact from this research. In terms of benefit classification, Section 2 of the report contains the results of the literature review,and demonstrates that significant benefits have been identified by a range of studies. Key benefitsinclude:• biophysical and mental health outcomes grouped under the broader category of wellbeing;• social benefits such as educational engagement, crime reduction, and improved family structure;• cultural benefits such as intergenerational knowledge transmission and the mitigation of racism;  and• economic and livelihood benefits across the market, customary, and state components of regional  economies. These areas of benefit are clearly identifiable from the existing literature, but current evidence for them remains insufficient. The survey and the field data gathered here also suggest that an additional category - political benefits - is under-reported in existing reviews on benefits and may be useful in benefit classification. This category would also enable better articulation with the literature on the governance implications of ICNRM. The qualitative field data was iteratively categorised and analysed using NVivo software. The results of this analysis appear in Section 3. The analysis adopts the broader benefit categories identified in the literature review, but extended these in ways appropriate to the field data. Significant data supported the major benefit categories already identified - health and wellbeing, social, cultural, economic, and political respectively. These broad categories were further divided into subcategories appropriate to the field data. Health and wellbeing encompassed two subclassifications, emphasising biophysical and psychological aspects respectively. Cultural benefits were subdivided into: compatibility between program and cultural objectives; knowledge acquisition and sharing; and support for customary age and gender roles. Social benefits were identified as: homeland residence; formal education and training; broader horizons; and future aspirations. Economic benefits were identified as: income; employment stability; career progression and employment mobility; and business development. Political benefits were identified as: governance; leadership; succession; and independence. The subcategories are locally applicable instances and examples of the main benefit categories that would be expected to occur more broadly. Section 4 considers key factors which may influence (i. e. augment or minimise) the nature and degree of wider benefits to an Indigenous community generated by an ICNRM program. Again using Yirralka Rangers at Baniyala as the case study, key factors identified include: program size and structure; resource levels and resource distribution; activity selection; compatible values and priorities; motivation; and communication. The section uses a combination of <b>logical</b> inference and <b>field</b> data examples to demonstrate how particular factors may preferentially influence particular categories of benefit, or particular subcategories of benefit within the main categories. In doing so, Section 4 lays preliminary foundations for management, increasing both the awareness of particular benefits and how policy, funding, and management decisions may impact on those benefits. Section 5 provides a concluding discussion that summarises key points and provides some preliminaryrecommendations arising from the work. These include recommendations to:• foster policies, procedures, and management structures that explicitly take account of the full range  of benefits derived from ICNRM programs;• support the ongoing strategic regionalisation/decentralisation of ICNRM programs where diversified  residential location is culturally desirable and logistically possible;• adopt funding, resourcing, and program monitoring models that recognise the resourcing needs  and additional benefits of regionalised ICNRM programs;• support structured opportunities for ranger mobility within the sector to assist sectoral knowledge  sharing and individual career development;• enable ongoing support and incentive structures for collaborations between local ICNRM  organisations and other relevant local agencies (e. g. arts and media, education, health);• conduct additional research focused on: [...] the synthesis and standardisation of benefit categories; [...] the development consistent methods and metrics for benefit assessment based on thesecategories; [...] field studies demonstrating causal rather than correlative relationships in the assessment ofbenefits; [...] research engagement with the broader literature on:~~ further human interactions with natural environments~~ ecosystem services and PES~~ the wider benefits of NRM program...|$|R
