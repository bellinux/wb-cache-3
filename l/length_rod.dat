It is shown that similar to previous results under impulse voltages, dust pollution can {{significantly reduce the}} DC breakdown voltage values of such gaps which depends upon electrode radius, gap length and voltage polarity. These factors should therefore be considered prior to the design and application of air insulation in desert regions, where sand and dust storms can occur frequently.

40|$|In this paper, {{a set of}} {{potential}} hydrocyclone designs are explored for fines classification using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique. The CFD model uses Volume of Fluid multiphase model coupled with Reynolds Stress turbulence model for two phase flow predictions. Lagrangian Particle Tracking and Algebraic Slip Mixture model (ASM) modified with shear lift forces and slurry rheology corrected with fines fraction are used to predict the particle classification. Conventional cylindrical-conical design and various novel cyclone designs having a combination of, multiple and small cone angles, tapered vortex finder and air core free designs are considered in this study. Simulation results are presented in terms of mean and turbulent flow field along with particle efficiency' curve. Predictions show that all the tested novel designs are inherently having the potential for finer cut separation and higher tangential velocity compared to the conventional design. Cyclone design with a small cone angle is further modified by placing various sizes of rods at the center axis of the cyclone. Multiphase simulations with modified ASM model are also carried out for the multiple cone angles design, standard design, and the modified small cone angle design with full <b>length</b> <b>rod</b> at 15 wt% of solids. Performance by multiphase simulations show that multiple cone angles design and modified small cone angle design with the full <b>length</b> <b>rod</b> are the best among the tested designs yielding high separation efficiency, smaller cut-point and minimum coarse particle misplacement due to resultant turbulence minimization...|$|E

In both problems the non-reflecting boundary segments yield results that differ only slightly (less than 6 %) during a short duration from their corresponding theoretical solutions.

30|$|We have {{analyzed}} the relative magnitudes of four force elements (mass force, drag force, buoyancy force, force by the viscous flow, and surface tension force) {{according to the}} <b>rod</b> <b>length,</b> when hydrophobic <b>rods</b> have rotational motion with high speed moving into water from the water surface.

30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} change of the {{relative}} magnitudes of force and impulse components generated by the rotational motion of a hydrophobic carbon rod moving into water from the water surface, by varying the <b>rod</b> <b>length.</b> Whereas added mass force and drag force were dominant regardless of the <b>rod</b> <b>length,</b> buoyancy force and surface tension force were relatively small. For relatively short <b>rod</b> <b>lengths</b> (2, 4, 6  cm), drag forces were larger than added mass forces {{in the beginning of}} the rotational motion; the magnitudes of the two forces, however, reversed during the rotation. It was found that the reversals of magnitudes of the two forces occurred when the velocity at the end of the rod was 0.5  m/s. On the other hand, for a long <b>rod</b> <b>length</b> of 8  cm, added mass force was higher than drag force throughout the rod motion. The change of impulse by varying the <b>rod</b> <b>length</b> showed a similar tendency to that of force. Added mass impulse and drag impulse were also considerably larger than buoyancy impulse and surface tension impulse. Furthermore, drag impulse was larger than added mass impulse for short <b>rod</b> <b>lengths,</b> and the magnitudes of the two impulses reversed for long <b>rod</b> <b>lengths.</b> Compared to the shorter rod, the larger rod has a relatively low momentary force, but its force has much larger duration time, resulting in an increase of impulse.|$|R
40|$|Subject of Research. The paper {{deals with}} {{questions}} of operation safety for {{continuous welded rail track}} under dynamic loads. We study the gap value formed in the rail bar in view of its possible break under the conditions of dynamic loads caused by the moving train and varying temperatures. Occurring strains are linked to a variable stiffness of the rail track base (ballast). Methods. We studied longitudinal oscillations in a semi-infinite rod under dynamic loads and in the process of thermal expansion of the finite <b>length</b> <b>rod</b> on the elastic-damped foundation. Oscillatory processes in a semi-infinite rod on an elastic foundation was modeled using the extended equation of longitudinal vibrations, taking into account the reaction of the foundation, performing the role of a damper. To determine the state of the model after the damping of oscillations we used the time limiting transition. In solving the problem of thermal expansion of the finite <b>length</b> <b>rod</b> on the elastic foundation we used equilibrium equation for small fragment, which takes into account the thermal load and the elastic force of both the rod and the foundation. Main Results. We have calculated the maximum value of the dynamic displacement of the rod end at different values of parameters. We have obtained the distributions of stresses and displacements along the rod length for different stiffness distribution in the elastic foundation. In the event of accidental break in the rail, the gap value after the damping of oscillations is set at the level of 5 - 7 cm. We have shown that the amplitude of these oscillations can reach 10 - 12 cm. The availability of limited stiffness change zones in the rail base causes no significant deformation of rail bars, but can lead to the growth of the gap in the rail bar break. Practical Relevance. The proposed model can be used in the calculation and design of continuous welded rail tracks...|$|E

The pattern {{was produced by}} an inductively coupled plasma etch using a self-assembled monolayer of silica spheres on AlN as the lithographic mask. The resulting uniform 1 [small mu]m <b>length</b> <b>rod</b> structure across a wafer showed a massive reduction in threading dislocations (TDs) when annealed at 1100 [degree]C. Overgrowing homoepitaxial AlN {{on top of the}} nanorods, at a temperature of 1100 [degree]C, produced a crack free coalesced film with approximately 4 [small mu]m of growth, which is formed at a much lower temperature compared to that typically required for microscale ELOG. The improved crystal quality, in terms of TD reduction, of the AlN above the rods was determined by detailed weak beam (WB) electron microscopy studies and showed that the threading dislocation density (TDD) was greatly reduced, by approximately two orders of magnitude in the case for edge-type dislocations. In situ reflectance measurements during the overgrowth allowed for thickness coalescence to be estimated along with wafer curvature changes. The in situ measurements also confirmed that tensile strain built up at a much slower rate in the ELOG AlN layer compared to that of AlN prepared directly on sapphire...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} Global Positioning em antenna adaptor allows fixed {{antenna height}} measurements by removably attaching an adaptor plate to a conventional surveyor's tripod. Antenna height {{is controlled by}} an antenna boom which is a fixed <b>length</b> <b>rod.</b> The antenna is attached to {{one end of the}} boom. The opposite end of the boom tapers to a point sized to fit into a depression at the center of survey markers. The boom passes through the hollow center of a universal ball joint which is mounted {{at the center of the}} adaptor plate so that the point of the rod can be fixed in the marker's central depression. The mountains of the ball joint allow the joint to be moved horizontally in any direction relative to the tripod. When the ball joint is moved horizontally, the angle between the boom and the vertical changes because the boom's position is fixed at its lower end. A spirit level attached to the rod allows an operator to determine when the boom is plumb. The position of the ball joint is adjusted horizontally until the boom is plumb. At that time the antenna is positioned exactly over the center of the monument and the elevation of the antenna is precisely set by the length of the boom...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic CO 2 {{emissions}} are acidifying the world's oceans. A {{growing body of}} evidence is showing that ocean acidification impacts growth and developmental rates of marine invertebrates. Here we test the impact of elevated seawater pCO 2 (129 Pa, 1271 µatm) on early development, larval metabolic and feeding rates in a marine model organism, the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Growth and development was assessed by measuring total body <b>length,</b> body <b>rod</b> <b>length,</b> postoral <b>rod</b> <b>length</b> and posterolateral <b>rod</b> <b>length.</b> Comparing these parameters between treatments suggests that larvae suffer from a developmental delay (by ca. 8 %) rather than from the previously postulated reductions in size at comparable developmental stages. Further, we found maximum increases in respiration rates of + 100 % under elevated pCO 2, while body length corrected feeding rates did not differ between larvae from both treatments. Calculating scope for growth illustrates that larvae raised under high pCO 2 spent an average of 39 to 45 % of the available energy for somatic growth, while control larvae could allocate between 78 and 80 % of the available energy into growth processes. Our results highlight the importance of defining a standard frame of reference when comparing a given parameter between treatments, as observed differences can be easily due to comparison of different larval ages with their specific set of biological characters...|$|R

40|$|This paper derives a modal {{solution}} to the displacement field of a finite <b>length</b> <b>rod</b> whose area varies with respect to its length. This new method facilitates a {{solution to}} any problem where the area and derivative of the area can be represented as analytical functions. The problem begins by writing the longitudinal displacement of the non-uniform area rod {{as a series of}} indexed coefficients multiplied by the eigenfunctions of the uniform area rod. This series solution is inserted into the non-uniform area rod equation and multiplied by a single p-indexed eigenfunction. This equation is then integrated over the interval of the rod. Although the resultant expressions are not orthogonal, they can be written as a set of linear algebraic equations which can be solved to yield the unknown coefficients. Once these are known, the displacement of the system can be calculated. Five example problems are included: the first one has a non-uniform area that corresponds with a known analytical solution, the second has an area that can be represented by a Fourier series, the third and fourth have areas that do not have a known analytical solution and the fifth is a generic second order non-constant coefficient differential equation. Four of these problems are verified with other methods. Convergence of the series solution is discussed. It is shown that this new model is almost two orders of magnitude faster than corresponding finite element analysis...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{conduct of}} {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass surgery requires {{the use of}} equipment and devices like the oxygenator. The oxygenator comes in different makes and each manufacturer customizes the carrier or ′holder′ of this device specific to their design. Aim: This paper presents an innovation designed to overcome the need to purchase a different holder for every oxygenator thereby cutting the cost. Materials and Methods: A sheet of iron measuring 1. 9 cm (width) × 0. 1 cm (thickness) was used to design the holder circular main frame. Another sheet measuring 2 cm (width) × 0. 6 cm (thickness) × 24 cm (length) was used to construct a V-shaped handle with the arms of the V attached to the main frame 7 cm apart. At the narrow base of the handle is a latch requiring two 13 -gauge screws to attach the holder to the heart-lung machine. Within the circumference of the main frame are four T-shaped side arms which grip the oxygenator; located at 2, 5, 7 and 11 O′clock positions. The stem of the T consist of a 0. 6 cm (thickness) × 13 cm (<b>length)</b> <b>rod</b> drilled through the main frame. The cross of the T consists of variable lengths of the same sheet as the mainframe attached to the stem by a screw mechanism. At the base of the T, is attached a circular handle (4 cm in diameter) made of 0. 4 cm iron rod. Result: An oxygenator holder which weighs 1. 75 kg with a total length of 54 cm (the diameter of the mainframe is 30 cm). Its advantages include (i) affordability, (ii) materials are locally accessible, (iii) versatility (iv) reproducibility. The disadvantages include, (i) it requires some time to fit, (ii) caution is required in fitting the oxygenator to avoid breakage, (iii) a spanner is required to lock the latch. Conclusion: The concept of a universal holder is pertinent, especially in resource poor environments to avoid purchasing a new holder whenever the usual oxygenator common to the centre is unavailable. This device is amenable to further modifications to meet the unforeseen challenges...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityOne of my {{research}} topic is about the human body exposure to AMI. Power utilities are increasingly deploying residential meters that communicate wirelessly. These meters may employ multiple antennas and radiate at different frequencies, ranging from 850 MHz to 2. 4 GHz. Unlike radiofrequency (RF) exposure caused by cell phones, where {{the position of the}} phone relative to the body is somewhat fixed, the position of a power meter relative to the body is rather unconstrained. In this work we use the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to study the specific absorption rate (SAR) produced in full anatomical models of humans when they are exposed to the RF fields produced by a wireless AMI meter. When one accounts for the meter's true duty cycle or there is a realistic separation between the meter and an individual, all SAR values fall within safety limits. Another topic of {{my research}} is about the RF burns. Both the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) have maximum permissible exposure (MPE) guidelines that specify the limits on the magnitude of the electromagnetic (EM) fields and contact currents to which humans are allowed to be exposed. However, even when the fields do not exceed the ICNIRP or IEEE limits, a radio frequency (RF) burn may occur when a person is in contact with a perfect electric conductor (PEC). In this work we use the FDTD method and a full anatomical model to calculate the contact current density when a person is in contact with a PEC rod that is on order of 2 m in length. The effects of rod <b>length,</b> <b>rod</b> diameter, and the type of touch are considered. Frequencies are between 10 MHz and 600 MHz. A SubGridding technique in FDTD field was investigated as a topic in my thesis. The fundamental FDTD method is not well suited to model problems in which the structure of interest has important geometric features at greatly different scales. In order to study such "multiscale" problems, numerous modified FDTD algorithms have been proposed that incorporate a subgridding technique. In 2006, Berenger proposed a promising new technique known as the Huygens subgridding (HSG) method. However, this technique suffers from a late-time instabilities. In this work, we demonstrate how the judicious use of artificial loss can be used to control this instability. We also explore other aspects of the HSG method, such as the reflection coefficient, for various discretizations. Department of Electrical Engineering, Washington State Universit...|$|E
