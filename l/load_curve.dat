The results found that peak resultant linear acceleration did not always correlate with brain deformation measures. The results also indicated that, due to the complex nature of the interaction between <b>loading</b> <b>curve</b> characteristic and tissue parameters, there was no commonality in curve shape which produced large magnitudes of brain deformation.

40|$|This paper proposes {{and compares}} feature {{construction}} and calibration methods for clustering daily electricity <b>load</b> <b>curves.</b> Such <b>load</b> <b>curves</b> describe electricity demand {{over a period}} of time. A rich body of the literature has studied clustering of <b>load</b> <b>curves,</b> usually using temporal features. This limits the potential to discover new knowledge, which may not be best represented as models consisting of all time points on <b>load</b> <b>curves.</b> This paper presents three new methods to construct features: 1) conditional filters on time-resolution-based features; 2) calibration and normalization; and 3) using profile errors. These new features extend the potential of clustering <b>load</b> <b>curves.</b> Moreover, smart metering is now generating high-resolution time series, and so the dimensionality reduction offered by these features is welcome. The clustering results using the proposed new features are compared with clusterings obtained from temporal features, as well as clusterings with Fourier features, using household electricity consumption time series as test data. The experimental results suggest that the proposed feature construction methods offer new means for gaining insight in energy-consumption patterns...|$|R

Theload curve method was established by Svenska Elverksföreningen {{at the start of}} the nineties andfocus was put on standardizing annual energyconsumption, in order to make the method usableacross the nation. Present consumption patterns have changed since the original <b>load</b> <b>curves</b> wereproduced, which leads to a need to update the <b>load</b> <b>curves.</b> The work began with an update of present <b>load</b> <b>curves</b> according to recommendation taken fromanother earlier thesis. Thereafter a forecast model was produced in Excel to calculate the strainfor one customer, using the new <b>load</b> <b>curves.</b> The updated <b>load</b> <b>curves</b> were computed into theFortum network calculation software to be used in the calculations of the outgoing feeders indistribution stations in four geographically different areas in Sweden. The calculations were madethe third Wednesday in January of both 2013 and 2014. The day is arbitrarily chosen. Calculatedvalues were compared to measured hourly values of feeders in distribution stations of the sameday. An acceptable border for calculated values is determined by Fortum to plus/minus 10 % inrelation to observed values. Network calculations with the updated <b>load</b> <b>curves</b> showed ofaverage an error marginal of more than 30 % in all four distribution channels. We discovered nogeographical influence of the error marginal. Due to the new average error marginal being far above Fortums permit limitation we believe thisnew categorization should not be used.
