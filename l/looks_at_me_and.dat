60|$|And he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I {{seen that}} he had got it in the neck, right enough.|$|E
60|$|His {{expression}} has changed. He {{takes the}} document and examines it, turns it over, <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> smiles that faint smile of his again.|$|E
6000|$|... "And she <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{she wants}} to stay with me," [...] he went on monotonously. [...] "She's got such a will, {{it seems as if}} she would never go--never!" ...|$|E
60|$|Galeotto <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> smiled darkly, {{stroking}} his great beard.|$|R
60|$|She stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and,</b> of course, I stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> laughed, {{but that}} laugh was uncommonly like a snarl.|$|R
60|$|God, how she starts! And <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{looks in}} the palm of her hand! And again at me! I turn and run Down the Embankment, run for my life.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{about ten}} minutes this fall of manna {{leans back in his}} chair and snores. Andy <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> says: 'I reckon I'd better stay with him for five minutes or so, in case the waiter comes in.' ...|$|E
60|$|How {{the time}} wears, I know not; until I am {{recalled}} by my child-wife's old companion. More restless than he was, he crawls {{out of his}} house, and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> wanders to the door, and whines to go upstairs.|$|E
60|$|My wife <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> {{then slowly}} withdrew her hands from my arm.|$|R
60|$|Then he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> his {{brooding}} {{eyes seemed}} to scan my face.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> Charmian <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I {{knew she}} {{wondered}} where I had got it.|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{he marched}} me and Tobin {{to the back}} room of a saloon, and ordered the drinks, and laid the money on the table. He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> Tobin like {{brothers}} of his, and we have the segars.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it will be}} such a {{bother to}} {{have to talk about}} it. He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> is such an idiot. Then Augusta frowns. When I see Augusta {{frowning}} I am so angry that I feel like boxing her ears. Do you know, Lucy, that I often think that it will not do, and that I shall have to be sent away. I wish it had been you that they had chosen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{some time}} I hesitated {{how to change}} it. Then one day I came here to see my friend Giatron--we came {{together}} from Italy. I hand him the note. I ask him please change. He give me the change and I stay {{to have a drink}} with the head waiter, who is a friend of mine. Presently Giatron comes out. He calls me into the office. Then I begin to tremble. He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I tremble more.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{smiled a}} little abstractedly. Then {{she turned to the}} table.|$|R
50|$|The song {{is used in}} the 2004 film <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> the 2012 film Moonrise Kingdom.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I {{saw that}} he did not know what I meant. I explained.|$|R
6000|$|... [p.73]But {{sometimes}} he nods over a difficult passage under my very eyes, or he reads {{it over a}} dozen times in the wantonness of idleness, or he takes what school-boys call a long [...] "shot" [...] most shamelessly at the signification. When this happens I lose my temper, and raise my voice, and shout, [...] "Verily there is no power nor might save in Allah, the High, the Great!" [...] Then he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> with passing meekness whispers- ...|$|E
6000|$|The guide's rough face reddens with pleasure. If a crowned king on {{a throne}} had spoken condescendingly to him, {{he could hardly}} have looked more proud of the honor conferred than he looks now. He makes a clumsy attempt to take the Master's hand and kiss it. Mr. Dunross gently repels the attempt, and gives him a little pat on the head. The guide <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my friend {{as if he had}} been honored with the highest {{distinction}} that an earthly being can receive. The Master's hand had touched him kindly! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{brother is}} {{making fun of}} me," [...] she declared. [...] "He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> judges me just as I believe he would judge most people--sternly and without mercy. After all, you know, even though I am a {{daughter}} of the cities, there is another point of view--ours. Can you {{not believe that the}} call which prompts men and women to do the things in life which are really worth while is heard as often amid the hubbub of the city as in the solitude of these austere hills?" ...|$|E
60|$|The lanthorn on the chariot {{was burning}} bright. And I saw Patty <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> laugh.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and,</b> {{with that}} {{extraordinary}} penetration {{which used to}} disconcert me, shook her head.|$|R
60|$|Euphemia <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{then the}} little pelican between us {{began to shake}} violently as we laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say? Sometimes nothing--sometimes everything. She {{is never}} the same. Sometimes she walks in and takes her place without a word, without a smile, gravely, stiffly, {{as if it}} were an awful bore. She hardly <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> she walks away without even glancing at my work. On other days she laughs and {{chatters}} and asks endless questions, and pours out the most irresistible nonsense. She is a creature of moods; you can't count upon her; she keeps observation on the stretch. And then, bless you, she has seen such a lot! Her talk is full of the oddest allusions!" ...|$|E
60|$|ARETHUSA. He hasn't {{learned to}} know you, Kit, as I have, nor yet {{do you know}} him. He seems hard and violent; at heart he is only a man {{overwhelmed}} with sorrow. Why else, when he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> does not know that I observe him, should his face change, and fill with such tenderness, that I could weep to see him? Why, when he walks in his sleep, as he does almost every night, his eyes open and beholding nothing, why should he cry so pitifully on my mother's name? Ah, if you could hear him then, you would say yourself: Here is a man that has loved; {{here is a man}} that will be kind to lovers.|$|E
6000|$|... "So, {{one night}} when he sits by the fire, very sick, his head hanging down, I say, 'My son, I have learned the {{way for you to}} go to the white man's land.' He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> his face is glad. 'Go,' I say, 'even as Yamikan went.' But Bidarshik is sick and does not understand. 'Go forth,' I say, 'and find a white man, and, even as Yamikan, do you kill that white man. Then will the soldier white men come and get you, and even as they took Yamikan will they take you across the salt lake to the white man's land. And then, even as Yamikan, will you return very fat, your eyes full of the things you have seen, your head filled with wisdom.' ...|$|E
60|$|Guest <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> away {{out of the}} window. Adèle {{was behind}} us, and out of hearing.|$|R
60|$|Now, while Pereira was mocking and bragging of his prowess, Pieter Retief <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{our eyes}} met.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I {{saw that}} she was putting in a bit of the old drenched-irises stuff.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I can {{understand}} well enough when I know what's to be understood," [...] {{the young man}} asserted. [...] "But I hope you won't mind my saying that you've kept me pretty well {{in the dark about}} that. I've been waiting, waiting, waiting; so much has depended on your news. If you've been working for me I'm afraid it has been a thankless job. Can't she say what she'll do, one way or the other? I can't tell in the least where I am, you know. I haven't really learnt from you, since I saw you there, where she is. You wrote me to be patient, and upon my soul I have been. But I'm afraid you don't quite realize what I'm to be patient with. At Waterbath, don't you know? I've simply to account and answer for the damned things. Mona <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> waits, and I, hang it, I look at you and do the same." [...] Fleda had gathered fuller confidence as he continued; so plain was it that she had succeeded in not dropping into his mind the spark that might produce the glimmer invoked by his mother. But even this fine assurance gave a start when, after an appealing pause, he went on: [...] "I hope, you know, that after all you're not keeping anything back from me." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 3 April Briggs wrote [...] "I was {{instructed}} to proceed to Hendon last Thursday afternoon in an Avro to give Mr. Winston Churchill a flying lesson. I duly arrived on time at that point and so did Winston Churchill. He took two <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> one at a cloud overhead that started to sprinkle gentle spots of rain, then turned on his heel, re-entered his car, and drove off. I gather that he considered the weather unsuitable or that he didn't like my face." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cox {{initially}} {{wanted to}} play Sophia pre-transition as well, but was dissuaded by Foster, explaining, “I was like, ‘I have to butch it up,’ because I don’t think Jodie believed that I could pull this off. I go to Jodie and she <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> she’s like, ‘We’re gonna have to hire someone.’ Jodie Foster didn’t think I looked masculine enough to play a guy.” Cox said that several [...] "really butch black men" [...] auditioned for the part before “our casting director found out that I have a twin brother Lamar...He auditioned, and he got the part.” ...|$|E
60|$|After {{the noisy}} {{congratulations}} were {{over and the}} Rube had gone, Spears <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked a}} little to and fro after saying this to himself with a shudder, <b>and</b> then <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> brightened, and came and sat down again {{with his hands in}} his pockets.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> fell {{a victim}} to my {{confidence}} of manner. The petulancy died {{out of his}} face.|$|R
