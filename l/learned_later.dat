5|$|As {{with the}} Ju 87 A-0, the B-1s were {{returned}} discreetly to the Reich. The {{experience of the}} Spanish Civil War proved invaluable - air and ground crews perfected their skills, and equipment was evaluated under combat conditions. The Ju 87 had not been tested against numerous and well-coordinated fighter opposition; this lesson was <b>learned</b> <b>later</b> at great cost to the Stuka crews.|$|E
5|$|Magic in Vagrant Story is <b>learned</b> <b>later</b> in {{the game}} using Grimoires that are dropped by enemies. Once a Grimoire is used, the magic spell {{associated}} with the Grimoire {{will remain in the}} menu, and players only need to spend magic points (MP) to cast a learned spell. Magic spells can be used to attack, heal, create status effects, and manipulate Ashley's elemental and enemy affinities. Certain magic spells allow the player to affect multiple targets by using a small sphere positioned within the Battle Mode wire frame. Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained.|$|E

500|$|Vick {{had hired}} Wong, a {{business}} manager in Omaha, Nebraska, {{in the fall}} of 2007 on the recommendation of Falcons teammate Demorrio Williams. Wong helped cash in some of Vick's investments to provide restitution funds required by the federal court in his criminal case. According to a document filed by one of Vick's attorneys, she used a power of attorney from Vick to [...] "wrongfully remove" [...] at least another $900,000 from his various accounts. Court papers also alleged Wong [...] "caused certain business entities owned by [...] to be transferred to her." [...] Vick <b>learned</b> <b>later</b> that Wong had been permanently barred from working with any firm that traded on the New York Stock Exchange as the result of taking more than $150,000 from two elderly widows she met while working at Wells Fargo.|$|E
500|$|A {{meeting was}} {{arranged}} for the following day; Caroline went to a secluded room, where Leopold arrived with two aides. As Leopold II was unknown to her, Caroline was so flustered with the encounter that she mixed up Belgium and Sweden in the king's presence, referring to him as His Majesty Oscar, to his surprise and amusement. The two aides' purpose soon became clear: one sat {{on each side of}} her and began asking questions that required her to [...] "turn my head first to the right, then to the left ... their only aim, as I <b>learned</b> <b>later,</b> being to show off my two profiles to the mute personage", according to her memoirs. Leopold confessed himself pleased and invited Caroline to Austria with him; a large sum of money duly arrived the next day, along with some empty trunks, as Leopold was aware that she loved to buy clothes.|$|E

2500|$|An {{obituary}} in 1996 of Hodgkinson's son Colin, who {{was born}} in 1920 and who himself had an extraordinary career as a war-time pilot despite losing both legs in an air accident, gives a small portrait of Gerard Hodgkinson in the inter-war period. [...] "'s earliest memories of his father were of a powerful man in hunting pink. As he <b>learned</b> <b>later,</b> he was an outstanding Master of Foxhounds with the Mendip, a big-game hunter and a fine shot," [...] it says. Hodgkinson was joint master of the Mendip Farmers' Hunt from 1929 to 1932. He was also the owner and manager of the Wookey Hole Caves at this time.|$|E

2500|$|My {{first meeting}} with Adm. James Holloway was some experience. I had asked to brief him on our plan for Jordan and was shown to his office. He was {{reclining}} on a sofa and remained that way throughout the session. When I would make a particular point, he would exclaim, 'Atta boy,' or 'That's it. Give'm hell' [...] a one-man cheering section, so to speak. It was quite the most incredible briefing I ever gave. I <b>learned</b> <b>later</b> that he suffered from some ailment at the time, which required him to take these rest sessions. He impressed me as a 'big picture' type, not too interested in details, but I left his office feeling that {{here was a man}} for whom you would make that extra effort and take that extra step." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} factor {{related to the}} origin of Eisa is Chondaraa (...) , a group of puppeteers. The Ryūkyū-koku yuraiki records two theories regarding the etymology of Chondaraa. One is that it indicates their origin, Kyoto. The other is that its founder was named Kyō (no) Kotarō (京小太郎). The fact that their origin had been obscured by the early 18th century suggests that they came from mainland Japan a long time ago. Based on modern-day Shuri Kubagawa-chō (part of the capital Shuri), they performed puppet plays, chanted Banzei (manzai) on celebratory occasions and sang nembutsu songs as a funeral service. For these reasons, they were also called Ninbuchaa (nembutsu prayer) or Yanzayaa (banzei chanter). It is uncertain if the Chondaraa performed nembutsu {{from the very beginning}} or <b>learned</b> <b>later</b> from a different group. Unlike Taichū's followers, they wandered around Okinawa Island.|$|E

2500|$|Josephine's {{life after}} Tombstone and with Wyatt Earp {{is not well}} known, {{although}} it isn't as obscured by stories {{of her life in}} Tombstone that she told to hide facts. The San Diego Union printed a report from the San Francisco Call on July 9, 1882 that Virgil Earp was in San Francisco (receiving treatment for his shattered arm) and that Wyatt was expected to arrive there that day. [...] During the same time period Josephine began using the name of [...] "Josephine Earp". Wyatt took a job managing a horse stable in Santa Rosa. Earp developed a reputation as a sportsman as well as a gambler. He was reputed to own a six-horse stable in San Francisco, although it was <b>learned</b> <b>later</b> that the horses were leased. At Santa Rosa, Earp personally competed in and won a harness race. The Sacramento Daily Record reported on October 20, 1882, that Virgil had arrived in town from Tombstone to greet his brother Wyatt arriving from the east.|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{arrived at}} the scene around 11:45p.m. After about ten minutes, a man walked up to Hollis' driver-side door and flashed a {{flashlight}} in his face, blinding him. Hollis, {{not sure if it}} was a prank or if he had been mistaken for someone else, told the man, [...] "Fellow, you've got me mixed up with someone else. You've got the wrong man." [...] The man had a pistol and told him something like, [...] "I don't want to kill you fellow, so do what I say", and ordered them {{to get out of the}} car. They both got out through the driver-side door. The man told Hollis to [...] "take off your [...] britches." [...] Larey pleaded with Hollis to please take them off, believing that if he did they would not be hurt, but, after Hollis removed his trousers, he was struck twice in the head with a heavy, blunt object. Larey explained in an interview three months later with Texarkana Gazette reporter Lucille Holland that the noise was so loud she thought he had been shot, but she <b>learned</b> <b>later</b> it was the sound of his skull cracking.|$|E

50|$|According to John Robison's Proofs of a Conspiracy (1798), {{the third}} degree of the Bavarian Illuminati was called Minerval or Brother of Minerva, {{in honour of}} the goddess of <b>learning.</b> <b>Later,</b> this title was adopted for the first {{initiation}} of Aleister Crowley's OTO rituals.|$|R
60|$|It {{was hard}} work for the boys to keep their minds on their lessons. Dick, especially, was very serious, and for a good reason. Something was {{worrying}} him greatly-- something of which Tom and Sam knew little. What it was we shall <b>learn</b> <b>later.</b>|$|R
60|$|My {{threat was}} unfortunate and {{resulted}} in {{more harm than good}} to Dejah Thoris, for, as I <b>learned</b> <b>later,</b> men do not kill women upon Mars, nor women, men. So Sarkoja merely gave us an ugly look and departed to hatch up deviltries against us.|$|E
