A Court system that sends men of genius to the second table, I hold to be a Snobbish system. A society that sets up to be polite, and ignores Arts and Letters, I hold to be a Snobbish society. You, who despise your neighbour, are a Snob; you, who forget your own friends, meanly to follow after those of a higher degree, are a Snob; you, who are ashamed of your poverty, and blush <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>calling,</b> are a Snob; as are you who boast of your pedigree, or are proud of your wealth.|$|R

You, who live so sweetly in your forest bowers, ever fair and youthful and innocent, are no fit comrades for a son of humanity. For I have looked upon man, finding him doomed to live for a brief space upon earth, to toil for the things he needs, to fade into old age, and then to pass away as the leaves in autumn. Yet every man has his mission, which is to leave the world better, in some way, than he found it. I am of the race of men, and man's lot is my <b>lot.</b> <b>For</b> <b>your</b> tender care of the poor, forsaken babe you adopted, as well as <b>for</b> <b>your</b> loving comradeship during my boyhood, my heart will ever overflow with gratitude.

500|$|Another dispute {{occurred}} between TLC and Rolston {{was over the}} choice of clothing. The director was interested in [...] "tight and sexy" [...] lingerie looks for them while they only liked baggy, tomboy clothes. Combining the two, he finally gave out {{the idea of the}} girls wearing the silk pajamas with each custom-made cost more than 1,000. Thomas also talked about their exhaustion on the set: [...] "People don't realize that for video shoots you have to wake up at like 5 in the morning <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>call</b> time. So when we did that part {{at the very end of}} the video where we're talking to the camera and looking all silly, we were so tired. But sometimes that ends up being your best shots." [...] Eventually, she praised Rolston's final product for the group as [...] "excellent" [...] while Lopes said that after two failed ones, the director finally gave them a [...] "real video." ...|$|R

"I'd like {{to think}} that the John Wayne 'school of acting' {{consists}} of three things: (1) Be on time <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>call.</b> (2) Know <b>your</b> dialogue; and (3) Don't leave the camera, even if you're not in the shot. So many times, especially if you're working with younger actors, the director says [...] "cut" [...] and, boom, they scatter like quail. They've got to go make a phone call or leave for a date. Duke usually ends up directing a picture about halfway into it and he wants his actors on the set. He doesn't want to have to look around for them at the honey wagon or in their trailer. He wants them there around the camera. If you remember those three things, you could work with John Wayne. He'd like you. Working with him was almost like going to school and learning the finer points working in the film business." ...|$|R
6000|$|For the offence {{you take}} at any comment upon <b>your</b> <b>calling</b> baptism, 'a livery': and <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>calling</b> it 'the Spirit's metaphorical {{description}} of baptism': both phrases are boldness, without the word. Neither do I find it called a listing ordinance, nor the solemnization {{of the marriage}} betwixt Christ and a believer. But perhaps you had this from Mr. D'Anvers, who pleaseth himself {{with this kind of}} wording it: and says moreover in justification of you, 'That persons entered into the visible church thereby [by baptism, which is untrue, though Mr. Baxter also saith it] are by consent admitted into particular congregations, where they may claim their privileges due to baptized believers, being orderly put into the body, and put on Christ by their baptismal vow and covenant: for by that public declaration of consent, is the marriage and solemn contract made betwixt Christ and a believer in baptism. And, saith he, if it be preposterous and wicked for a man and woman to cohabit together, and to enjoy the privileges of a married state without the passing of that public solemnity: So it is NO less disorderly upon a spiritual account, for any to claim the privileges of a church, or be admitted to the same, till the passing of this solemnity by them.' ...|$|R
500|$|Nash was {{slower and}} more portly {{than he was}} in the 1930s, short of match {{practice}} and forced to spend most Sundays in hospital having fluid drained from his injured knees swollen from the exertions of the day before, forcing South Melbourne coach Bull Adams to nurse Nash through the season. Additionally, in the Round 5 match against Footscray, he tore the webbing between his fingers which later became infected, causing him to miss the Round 6 match against North Melbourne and although Nash wore a special leather glove to protect his hand, the injury would trouble him {{for the rest of the}} season. Despite these setbacks, Nash could still be a match winner and many opposition players saw him as the key player for South Melbourne. Nash's best return for the year was seven goals against St Kilda in Round 12 and he twice kicked six goals in a match; against Geelong in Round 15 and Fitzroy in Round 18. When an opposition player did well against Nash, it was something to savour; years later leading Richmond player Don [...] "Mopsy" [...] Fraser wrote [...] "Trouncing Nash does a <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> confidence, even an ageing Nash." ...|$|R
