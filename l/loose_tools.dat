WORF will include a means of preventing the formation of condensation on the interior surface {{of the window and}} a retractable bump shield to protect the interior window surface from impacts of <b>loose</b> <b>tools</b> and hardware being used in the area during the set-up and change-out of sensor packages by the crew. The interior of the WORF provides a non-reflective, light-tight environment to minimize stray reflections and glare off the window allowing use to equipment that are sensitive to extremely low energy phenomena such as auroras. An opaque fabric shroud can be attached {{to the front of the}} rack to allow crew-members to work in the WORF without the problem of glare from the U.S. Laboratory interior lights.|$|E

If the general method of free forging is used, the upsetting diameter of ingot will reach 2900 mm, and 8400 t hydraulic press current will not be produced so that the <b>loose</b> <b>tooling</b> forging process is to be used. The <b>loose</b> <b>tooling</b> forging process of rectangular flange has been researched by using DEFORM- 3 D simulation software and establishing a reasonable forging process.

50|$|Exact dating {{can almost}} never be {{attained}} with treen. Even if an object is inscribed with a date, {{it still has}} to prove itself. Our best gauge for dating treen is dating it to like forms in other materials that have a known date, such as pewter or silver which is often hallmarked to indicate its year of manufacture. This, however, is still a <b>loose</b> <b>tool</b> and can at best give us a ten-year window. Over the years, the more objects that we see and feel, the more they speak to us, the more they tell us of their age and lives.|$|R
40|$|Tile {{inspection}} and repair activities have implicit hazards associated with them. When an Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA) crewmember and associated hardware are added into the equation, additional hazards are introduced. Potential hazards to the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), the Orbiter or the crew member themselves are created. In order to accurately {{assess the risk}} of performing a TPS inspection or repair, an accurate evaluation of potential hazards and how adequately these hazards are controlled is essential. The EMU could become damaged due to sharp edges, protrusions, thermal extremes, molten metal or impact with the Orbiter. Tools, tethers {{and the presence of}} a crew member {{in the vicinity of the}} Orbiter Thermal Protection System (TPS) pose hazards to the Orbiter. Hazards such as additional tile or Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) damage from a <b>loose</b> <b>tool,</b> safety tethers, crewmember or arm impact are introduced. Additionally, there are hazards to the crew which should be addressed. Crew hazards include laser injury, electrical shock, inability to return to the airlock for EMU failures or Orbiter rapid safing scenarios, as well as the potential inadvertent release of a crew member from the arm/boom. The aforementioned hazards are controlled in various ways. Generally, these controls are addressed operationally versus by design, as the majority of the interfaces are to the Orbiter and the Orbiter design did not originally account for tile repair. The Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS), for instance, was originally designed to deploy experiments, and therefore has insufficient design controls for retention of th...|$|R

2500|$|Rotary hammers, {{also called}} [...] "combi drills," [...] {{are similar in}} that they also pound the drill bit in and out while it is spinning. However, they use a piston {{mechanism}} instead of a special clutch. This causes them to deliver a much more powerful hammer blow, {{making it possible to}} drill bigger holes much faster. Rotary hammers have such force, in fact, that the usual masonry bits are no longer adequate. Their smooth shanks would be pounded <b>loose</b> from the <b>tool's</b> chuck in a few seconds. Rotary hammers require special bits which lock into the rotary hammer and continue spinning while smashing away.|$|R

Without such, Xunzi argued, man would act virtuelessly and be steered by his own human nature to commit immoral acts. Han Fei's education and life experience during the Warring States period, and in his own Han state, contributed his synthesis of a philosophy {{for the management of}} an amoral and interest-driven administration, to which morality seemed a <b>loose</b> and inefficient <b>tool.</b> Han agreed with his teacher's theory of [...] "virtueless by birth", but as in previous Legalist philosophy, pragmatically proposed to steer people by their own interest-driven nature.|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic bore tools do have {{drawbacks}} {{which can}} cause difficulties completing the bore. First {{the distance of the}} bore the tool can create is limited by the length of the hose that supplies the tool with air. Also the tool is not steerable. Once it has exited the bore pit, the operator no longer has control over it. The tool can be deflected by rocks and soil density to a path the operator had not intended. If this deflection is {{in the direction of the}} surface, the tool can cause damage to the obstacle being bored under. If it is downward, the tool can dive to an unrecoverable depth. If it is deflected side to side the tool could also run into other utilities. These hazards make it important for the operator to maintain close observation of the tool.The type of ground the tool is working in can also lead to problems. If the soil is too <b>loose,</b> the <b>tool</b> cannot compact the soil, stalling it out or leaving no bore hole. If the soil is rocky the tool may be deflected or fail to pound forward due to its inability break the rock. These drawbacks can be overcome by directional boring.|$|R
40|$|The simple operant {{conditioning}} originally used in behavioral neurophysiology 30 years ago {{has given way}} to complex and sophisticated behavioral paradigms; so much so, that early general purpose programs for analyzing neurophysiological data are ill-suited for complex experiments. The trend has been to develop custom software for each class of experiment, but custom software can have serious drawbacks. We describe here a general purpose software tool for behavioral and electrophysiological studies, called MatOFF, that is especially suited for processing neurophysiological data gathered during the execution of complex behaviors. Written in the MATLAB programming language, MatOFF solves the problem of handling complex analysis requirements in a unique and powerful way. While other neurophysiological programs are either a <b>loose</b> collection of <b>tools</b> or append MATLAB as a post-processing step, MatOFF is an integrated environment that supports MATLAB scripting within the event search engine safely isolated in a programming sandbox. The results from scripting are stored separately, but in parallel with the raw data, and thus available to all subsequent MatOFF analysis and display processing. An example from a recently published experiment shows how all the features of MatOFF work together to analyze complex experiments and mine neurophysiological data in efficient ways.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{technological}} advances in DNA sequencing and genotyping {{have led to}} the accumulation of a remarkable quantity of data on genetic polymorphisms. However, the development of new statistical and computational tools for effective processing of these data has not been equally as fast. In particular, Machine Learning literature is limited to relatively few papers which are focused on the development and application of data mining methods for the analysis of genetic variability. On the other hand, these papers apply to genetic data procedures which had been developed for a different kind of analysis and do {{not take into account the}} peculiarities of population genetics. The aim of our study was to define a new similarity measure, specifically conceived for measuring the similarity between the genetic profiles of two groups of subjects (i. e., cases and controls) taking into account that genetic profiles are usually distributed in a population group according to the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Results We set up a new kernel function consisting of a similarity measure between groups of subjects genotyped for numerous genetic loci. This measure weighs different genetic profiles according to the estimates of gene frequencies at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the population. We named this function the "Hardy-Weinberg kernel". The effectiveness of the Hardy-Weinberg kernel was compared to the performance of the well established linear kernel. We found that the Hardy-Weinberg kernel significantly outperformed the linear kernel in a number of experiments where we used either simulated data or real data. Conclusion The "Hardy-Weinberg kernel" reported here represents one of the first attempts at incorporating genetic knowledge into the definition of a kernel function designed for the analysis of genetic data. We show that the best performance of the "Hardy-Weinberg kernel" is observed when rare genotypes have different frequencies in cases and controls. The ability to capture the effect of rare genotypes on phenotypic traits might be a very important and useful feature, as most of the current statistical <b>tools</b> <b>loose</b> most of their statistical power when rare genotypes are involved in the susceptibility to the trait under study. </p...|$|R
