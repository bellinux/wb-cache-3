40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{evidence}} of dissatisfaction with locum doctors' performance, but {{little is known about}} doctors who work as locums in general practice or about their experiences of this work. AIM: To describe the motivations and experiences of <b>doctors</b> providing <b>locum</b> cover in general practices. METHOD: A postal questionnaire survey distributed to locums through organizations such as locum groups, commercial agencies, and general practices. RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by 111 doctors currently working as locums in general practice. Four main reasons for working as a locum GP were: as a short-term option while between posts, to gain experience of different practices before commitment to one practice, to balance work and family or other commitments, to continue part-time work after retirement. One-quarter of responders intended to continue working as a locum indefinitely. The drawbacks of locum work included frustration with low status, lack of security, and difficulty accessing structured training and education. CONCLUSION: <b>Locum</b> <b>doctors</b> in general practice are a heterogeneous group that includes those who have chosen this type of work. The doctors who intend to continue as locums indefinitely represent a useful resource in primary care whose ability to provide short-term cover could be maximized. The need to control the quality of 'freelance' doctors should not overshadow the need to control the quality of their working environments...|$|R
40|$|Older people (over 65 years) are at {{increased}} risk of medication-related problems (MRPs) and adverse medication events compared with younger adults. Within the older population, there is a very high risk subgroup: those who access hospital inpatient and aged care services. They are, on average, at the extreme end of age (over 80 years), with high disease-burden (more than four comorbidities) and high medication use (more than eight medications); they are often frail and medically unstable. The research presented in this thesis comes from three projects that explored MRPs and deficiencies in medication management processes in this high risk subgroup, and investigated the impact of pharmacist-led interventions to improve medication use and safety. The projects focused on areas in which there has been little research previously conducted in Australia or internationally. Project 1 (medication regimen complexity in hospitalised older people) explored the impact of hospitalisation on the complexity of older patients' medication regimens, and strategies to reduce complexity prior to hospital discharge. In a prospective study of 186 older patients admitted to general medicine and aged care wards, it was observed that multiple medication changes were made during hospitalisation, and the complexity of medication regimens increased by 32 %. Most medication regimens had potential to be simplified without altering the therapeutic intent. Therefore an intervention was designed and tested. During the intervention period, hospital pharmacists who had received training in regimen simplification reviewed 205 patients' medications prior to discharge, in consultation with hospital doctors, to identify ways to reduce complexity. The outcome was that the increase in regimen complexity between admission and discharge was significantly smaller following the intervention. The difference in regimen IV Abstract complexity was equivalent to prescribing at least one less medication, and up to two or three medications for some patients. Barriers to reducing regimen complexity were identified, including lack of pharmacist time to review and simplify medication regimens, and nonacceptance by patients or doctors of some pharmacist recommendations. Project 2 (continuity of medication management after discharge from hospital to residential care) explored gaps in the continuity of medication management when patients were discharged to residential care facilities (RCF), and evaluated strategies to improve the continuity of care. In a prospective observational study of 202 patients, 20 % were exposed to a medication administration error in the 24 hours after hospital discharge, and 33 % required a <b>locum</b> <b>doctor</b> to write a medication chart at the RCF. To address these issues, a pharmacist-prepared 7 -day interim residential care medication administration chart was developed, with patient and medication data auto-populated onto the chart from hospital pharmacy dispensing software. The impact of the chart on medication administration errors and use of locum doctors after hospital discharge was investigated in a prospective pre- and post-intervention study (n = 428 patients). Provision of the chart reduced the incidence of missed and delayed medication doses from 18 % to 2 % and the use of locum medical services from 33 % to II%. RCF nurses and doctors were highly satisfied with the chart. Provision of interim medication charts by hospital pharmacists was reliable and accurate, with more than 95 % of patients receiving one on discharge, and a 1 % discrepancy rate between the charts and discharge prescriptions. Project 3 (medication-related problems in people referred to aged care outpatient clinics and assessment services) explored the accuracy of medication histories, the prevalence of MRPs, and the impact of pharmacist-conducted medication reviews in 46 patients referred to aged care outpatient clinics in a cross-sectional study, and 80 patients referred to an aged care assessment team (ACAT) in a randomised comparative study. A tool for assessing the risk associated with unresolved MRPs was developed and validated. Despite deteriorating health and functional decline, fewer than 7 % of patients had received a Home Medicines Review (HMR) in the 12 months prior to referral, in both studies. Medication histories recorded by aged care clinicians were usually inaccurate, and many MRPs were not identified prior to pharmacist-conducted reviews. In the ACAT study, referral of patients to their general practitioner for a HMR resulted in 18 % receiving a pharmacist-conducted medication review within 4 weeks; referral to a hospital outreach pharmacist resulted in 90 % receiving a medication review within 4 weeks. A median of three unresolved MRPs per patient were identified via hospital outreach pharmacist review; more than three-quarters of these were rated as having moderate, high or extreme risk of adverse outcome if not addressed. Just over 50 % of pharmacist recommendations led to changes to patients' medication management. General practitioners and aged care clinicians reported that pharmacist-conducted medication reviews were useful. Together, these three projects have identified a range of problems with medication use and safety in a very old, high-risk subset of the Australian population. The projects provide evidence to guide implementation of strategies to improve medication use in this population. Pharmacist-led interventions resulted in significant improvements in various aspects of medication management. Although the impact on long-term clinical outcomes was not assessed, the MRPs that were prevented or resolved were assessed by experts as having significant risk of adverse outcomes if not addressed, and have been associated with adverse outcomes in previous studies. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to confirm that the interventions described lead to improved clinical outcomes. In conclusion, complex medication regimens on discharge from hospital, medication errors after discharge from hospital to RCFs, and MRPs in patients referred to hospital-based ambulatory aged care services are common. Pharmacist-led interventions can improve medication use and safety...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{patients}} {{needs and}} {{the seriousness of the}} disease are not the only factors that determine referral to hospital. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyse whether <b>locum</b> <b>doctors</b> (LDs) have a different pattern of referral to hospital from regular GPs (RGPs). METHODS: All hospital referrals for one year (n = 5566 patients) from two Norwegian rural primary health care (PHC) centres to the nearby district hospital were analysed with regard to ICD- 10 diagnosis groups. A major difference between the PHCs was that one had a continuous supply of LDs while the other had a stable group of RGPs. The equal-sized communities were demographically and socio-culturally similar. RESULTS: The PHC centre mainly operated by short-term LDs referred a relatively high number of patients to the district hospital within the diagnosis groups of chapter VI Diseases of the nervous system (proportionate referral rate 210 %; p = 0. 010), and chapter IX Diseases of the circulatory system (proportionate referral rate 130 %; p = 0. 048), and a comparatively low number of patients for the diagnostic groups in chapter X Diseases of the respiratory system (p = 0. 018), and chapter XIV Diseases of the genitourinary system (p = 0. 039), compared with the norm of the district hospitals total population. The number and proportion of the total number of referrals, adjusted for population size, did not differ between the two rural communities. The LD-run PHC centre differed significantly from the total norm in 5 out of 19 ICD chapters, equal to 41 % of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Only one significant difference in hospital referrals related to ICD-diagnoses groups were found between the studied rural PHC centres, but the LD-run PHC differed from the total norm. These differences could neither be explained from the districts consumption of somatic hospital care nor the demographical differences, but were related to staffing at the PHC, that is LDs or RGPs. The analysis also revealed that possible under- and/or over-diagnosing of certain diseases occurred, both having potential medical consequences for the patient, as well as increasing healthcare expenditure...|$|R

A thematic content analysis segmented by IHN and cases with a triangulation of sources and analysists was carried out. Results:  COPD patients of all networks perceived that continuity of clinical management was existent due to clear distribution of roles for COPD care across levels, rapid access to care during exacerbations and referrals to secondary care when needed; nevertheless, patients of some networks highlighted too long waiting times to non-urgent secondary care.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Introduction: This report details {{findings}} {{from a study}} undertaken by the School of Primary Care, Severn Deanery and the School of Health and Social Care, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of the West of England, Bristol (UWE) between November 2008 and November 2009 to evaluate and develop GP appraisal processes in an area in the South West of England. A process of licensing for all doctors practising medicine in the UK is currently being implemented by the General Medical Council (GMC). All licensed doctors will need to demonstrate at regular intervals that their practice meets the generic standards set by the GMC, as described in Good Medical Practice (GMC 2006). Licensing will involve a process of revalidation for individual practitioners. It is planned to incorporate revalidation into the current appraisal processes for all medical professionals (GMC 2008). Although a statutory requirement, GP appraisal has until recently had primarily a formative, developmental purpose (DH 2002). Despite being obligatory, the uptake of GP appraisal has been problematic and inconsistent (Martin et al 2003). To date, only {{a limited amount of}} research or evaluation about GP appraisal has been published. However, there is recognised tension between the concept of appraisal as both a supportive developmental process and as a measure for judging fitness to practise. STUDY AIMA: This study set out to evaluate existing evidence submitted by GPs for the purposes of appraisal, and to explore how a model for appraisal could be developed that meets the needs of revalidation but also acts as a developmental process for individual GPs. METHODS: Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used for this study, in order to provide both breadth and depth to the evaluation. Quantitative data sources comprised all the appraisal evidence checklists used by appraisers in one Primary Care Trust (PCT) over the financial year April 2008 to May 2009 (n= 123). The evidence checklist provides a basic template for recording the types of evidence a GP appraisee submits for appraisal purposes, and whether the evidence submitted relates to an individual’s personal practice, or to organisational practice within the GP practice as a whole. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Comparative analysis of types of evidence was conducted for appraiser, appraisee age and appraisee status. Qualitative data were collected through 5 focus groups held with 23 attendees at a GP appraisal stakeholder event hosted by the Deanery, and through interviews with all the appraisal leads for PCTs within the Deanery’s geographical area (n= 7). Data were analysed thematically. The study was approved by a University research ethics sub-committee. MAIN FINDINGS AND POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION: Findings from this study raise particular points for consideration in relation to the appraiser role; the nature of evidence required for appraisal; the situation of sessional doctors; appraisee age; sharing expertise and experience; {{and the role of the}} Deanery in appraisal. Appraiser role: Most focus group and interview participants were adamant that appraisal should retain a strong developmental element. Clear definition of the role and appropriate national training were seen as essential factors contributing to the success of the process. Evidence required for appraisal: A notable feature of the focus group data was the confusion expressed by many participants about the nature and amount of evidence required for appraisal. Given the perception that appraisal for revalidation is extremely time-consuming for individual GPs, it was felt that having a clear brief about the evidence required is essential. The revised RCGP guidelines published after these data were collected (RCGP 2009, 2010) may go some way to ameliorating this problem, particularly with respect to the description of what constitutes audit for appraisal purposes. Sessional doctors: Many focus group participants and at least one appraisal lead were concerned that sessional doctors would have problems collecting the required evidence for appraisal. However, the data from this study also suggest that these problems can be addressed. The checklist data revealed very few substantive differences between principal and sessional doctors with regard to evidence submitted for appraisal. In particular, there was no statistically significant difference between the proportions of principal and sessional doctors who provided supporting information concerning their personal practice in relation to significant events, data or audit collection, multi-source feedback and complaints; this was notable, as these four areas have been identified as potentially problematic for sessional doctors (RCGP 2009, 2010). A number of the study participants were able to provide anecdotal evidence concerning innovative practice among sessional doctors with respect to the collection of evidence for appraisal, both at personal and collective levels. All these data, taken together, suggest that sessional doctors’ problems in this regard may be overstated, as long as appropriate support is provided by employing practices and PCTs. Appraisee age: The stereotype of the older GP, near retirement and not computer-literate, and not wishing to engage with appraisal, was present in the data. However, this was counterbalanced by examples of exceptions, and concern expressed about some younger, part-time GPs, whose personal circumstances do not support their involvement in appraisal. No differences were found in the checklist data between younger and older GPs with regard to the evidence they provided for appraisal. This applied to all GPs, and also only to locum GPs. It appears that difficulties encountered arise due to individuals’ particular circumstances or personalities, rather than because they belong to a defined category of appraisee. Sharing expertise and experience: A very strong feature of the qualitative data was the extent to which participants enthused about the benefits they experience when presented with opportunities for sharing expertise and experience. A number of suggestions concerning format were made, including both face to face and on-line media. The role of the Deanery in appraisal: There was no consistency with regard to participants’ opinions about the degree to which the Deanery should be involved in the co-ordination of the appraisal process. However, all the participants, both from the focus groups and the appraisal leads, were clear that the Deanery has a valuable role to play in training and preparation for appraisal for both appraisers and appraisees. They welcomed the idea that the Deanery could provide fora for sharing expertise and experience, as well as providing structured, dedicated preparation for appraisees. The Deanery was also thought to be well placed to help address any lack of consistency among appraisers through appropriate training. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Change the organisational culture of practices and trusts to encourage access for sessional and <b>locum</b> <b>doctors</b> to Clinical Governance, Significant Event, Audit and Data Collection, through meetings and improved communication. This could be accelerated by including locum access as a quality criterion to be reviewed at practice inspections by PCTs or by the Care Quality Commission. 2. Encourage, establish and facilitate fora and self directed groups for isolated locums and sessional GPs. 3. Provide examples of innovative ways of collecting evidence for this group. 4. Establish new tools designed specifically for this group, such as patient and colleague feedback...|$|R
