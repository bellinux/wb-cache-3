5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic <b>log</b> book. An ELD records the same information as a manual paper <b>log</b> book, and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper <b>log</b> book.|$|E
5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to measure how {{strongly}} different genes are expressed {{in a sample of}} biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the <b>log</b> ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a <b>log</b> ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by a <b>log</b> ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a <b>log</b> ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{track of}} a driver's HOS {{requires}} {{the use of}} a <b>log</b> book. A truck driver's <b>log</b> book is a legally defined form containing a grid outlining the 24-hour day into 15-minute increments. The driver must specify where and when he/she stopped between driving shifts, what duties were performed (if any), along with the driver's name, truck number, company info, and other information. The driver must also present his or her <b>log</b> book to authorities upon request, for inspection. In lieu of a <b>log</b> book, a motor carrier may substitute an electronic on-board recorder to record the driver's hours.|$|E
