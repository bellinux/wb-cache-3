40|$|A {{cylindrical}} liner z-pinch configuration {{has been}} used to drive converging radia- tive shock waves into different gases. Experiments were carried out on the MAGPIE (1. 4 MA, 250 ns rise-time) pulsed-power device at Imperial College London [1]. On application of the current pulse, a series of cylindrical shocks moving at typical velocities of 20 km s- 1 are consecutively launched from the inside <b>liner</b> <b>wall</b> into an initially static gas- ll. The drive current skin depth calculated prior to resis- tive heating was slightly less than the <b>liner</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and no bulk motion of the liner occurred. Axial laser probing images show the shock fronts to be smooth and azimuthally symmetric, with instabilities developing downstream of each shock. Evidence for a radiative precursor ahead of the first shock was seen in laser inter- ferometry imaging and time-gated spatially resolved optical spectroscopy. In addition to investigating the shock waves themselves, the timing of the shocks was used together with their trajectories to gain insight into launching mechanisms. This provided information on the response of the liner to the current pulse, which is useful for the benchmarking of magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) codes. A new load voltage diagnostic provided evidence for two phase transitions occurring within the <b>liner</b> <b>wall.</b> The voltage probe was also fielded on various other z-pinch loads for measurements of energy deposition and inductance.

40|$|MagLIF is {{a fairly}} new fusion concept using a puled-power {{generator}} as the main driver. This concept uses a Z-pinch configuration where the implosion {{is driven by the}} Z-machine using 27 MA of electrical current in 100 ns. Since the implosion time is long compared to the heat diffusion time of a non-magnetized plasma, MagLIF requires an initial axial magnetic of 30 T to reduce heat losses to the <b>liner</b> <b>wall.</b> Since the field needs to penetrate the transmission lines of the pulsed-power generator, as well as the liner itself, the rise time must exceed tens of microseconds. Any coil capable of producing such field on that long a pulse-length is inevitably bulky. The space required to house the coil near the liner increase the inductance of the load, which becomes problematic since the voltage at the load cannot exceed what the driver can already provide. Yet, the enormous amount of current that the Z-machine can provide could be used to produce the required 30 T by tilting the current posts surrounding the liner. However, the field penetration is limited by the skin effect of the <b>liner</b> <b>wall.</b> This paper shows that when current densities are large enough, the material generate resistivity gradients which forces the current to diffusive across the <b>liner</b> <b>wall</b> much fast than the skin time.

40|$|To {{increase}} the overall efficiency in aero engines {{as well as}} stationary gas turbines detailed information on flow field properties under realistic operating conditions are required. While conventional probe based technology is readily available and thoroughly tested, most of these techniques are point-wise. To gain insight into complex flow structures spatially and temporally resolved data is needed. Planar optical measurement techniques are capable of providing this type of data in a cost effective manner. The paper describes an image based filtered Rayleigh scattering (FRS) technique that, on frequency scanning a narrow linewidth light source, provides time averaged temperature (or density) fields. FRS uses molecular absorption to attenuate elastically scattered light from surfaces or particles in the flow. The filtered light is collected by a camera sensor at a multitude of light source frequencies allowing the temperature to be inferred from the pixel intensities.
