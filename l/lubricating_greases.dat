5|$|The {{third most}} common use of lithium is in greases. Lithium {{hydroxide}} {{is a strong}} base and, when heated with a fat, produces a soap made of lithium stearate. Lithium soap {{has the ability to}} thicken oils, and it is used to manufacture all-purpose, high-temperature <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases.</b>|$|E
5|$|Selected {{heavy metals}} {{are used as}} {{catalysts}} in fuel processing (rhenium, for example), synthetic rubber and fibre production (bismuth), emission control devices (palladium), and in self-cleaning ovens (where cerium(IV) oxide in the walls of such ovens helps oxidise carbon-based cooking residues). In soap chemistry, heavy metals form insoluble soaps {{that are used in}} <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases,</b> paint dryers, and fungicides (apart from lithium, the alkali metals and the ammonium ion form soluble soaps).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{traction}} {{behavior of}} high-speed <b>lubricating</b> <b>grease</b> 7007 was tested on a self-made test rig. The changes of traction coefficients with velocity, temperature and load were {{got from the}} experimental results. The rheological parameters were received {{on the basis of}} experimental data. The formula of traction force of high-speed <b>lubricating</b> <b>grease</b> 7007 was based on the correctional T-J model. The result shows that the traction coefficients of high-speed <b>lubricating</b> <b>grease</b> 7007 based on correctional T-J mode agree well with the experimental data...|$|R

5|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use {{was supported by the}} fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small demand for lithium soaps and <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases</b> was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the price rose rapidly {{as a result}} of {{increasing}} demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium, iron and steel. This was followed by a decline owing to increased world production, stabilized consumption, and the recessions of 1980 and 1981–82. In 1984, the price began to climb as consumption increased worldwide, especially in the United States and Japan. In the early 1990s, research began on the evaluation of bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in ceramic glazes, fishing sinkers, food-processing equipment, free-machining brasses for plumbing applications, <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases,</b> and shot for waterfowl hunting. Growth in these areas remained slow during the middle 1990s, in spite of the backing of lead replacement by the US Government, but intensified around 2005. This resulted in a rapid and continuing increase in price.|$|E
25|$|Soaps are key {{components}} of most <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases,</b> which are usually emulsions of calcium soap or lithium soap and mineral oil. Many other metallic soaps are also useful, including those of aluminium, sodium, and mixtures of them. Such soaps are also used as thickeners to increase the viscosity of oils. In ancient times, <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases</b> {{were made by the}} addition of lime to olive oil.|$|E

50|$|The NLGI {{consistency}} number (sometimes called “NLGI grade”) {{expresses a}} measure of the relative hardness of a grease used for lubrication, as specified by the standard classification of <b>lubricating</b> <b>grease</b> established by the National <b>Lubricating</b> <b>Grease</b> Institute (NLGI). Reproduced in standards ASTM D4950 (“standard classification and specification of automotive service greases”) and SAE J310 (“automotive lubricating greases”), NLGI’s classification is widely used. The NLGI consistency number is also a component of the code specified in standard ISO 6743-9 “lubricants, industrial oils and related products (class L) — classification — part 9: family X (greases)”.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLubricating greases undergo {{extensive}} deterioration {{under the}} operation conditions and storage. Hydrocarbon chain {{is one of}} the major factors resulting in loss of the base fluid quality by formation of products having negative effects on the physicochemical properties in particular the total acid number and dynamic viscosity. Antioxidants are major ingredients that protect the quality of <b>lubricating</b> <b>grease</b> by retarding oxidation reactions. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is a study on the preparation and evaluation of some compounds which act as antioxidants for prepared lithium <b>lubricating</b> <b>grease.</b> These additives are α-(2 -amino- 3 -cyano- 6 -pyridyl) o-hydroxyl cinnamic hydrazide (compound I), ethoxymethyl enamino derivative (compound II) and 3 -amino- 5 -hydroxyl- 4 phenylazo- 1 H-pyrazole (compound III). The structure of these compounds has been confirmed using elemental analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. On the other hand, lithium <b>lubricating</b> <b>grease</b> was prepared and evaluated according to the National <b>Lubricating</b> <b>Grease</b> Institute (NLGI) and Egyptian Standard (ES). The antioxidant compounds were tested for the prepared grease with concentration 0. 1 wt. %. The efficiency of these compounds has been determined using total acid number. It was found that the prepared lithium grease resists oxidation reaction in the presence of these compounds. A correlation between the chemical structure of these compounds and their efficiency as antioxidants additives was discussed. Data showed that the efficiency of these compounds as antioxidants decreases in the order: compound I>compound II>compound III...|$|R

50|$|Lithium metal is {{extremely}} soft, highly reactive, and flammable element. It is most frequently found in deposits such as spodumene and pegmatite minerals, with larger {{resources in the}} U.S., Canada, Australia, China, Zimbabwe, and Russia. Lithium possesses a unique chemical profile making it the lightest metal in the periodic table and the least dense solid element.

This alkali metal is probably best-known for its wide use in lithium batteries common {{in all sorts of}} electronics devices. Other industrial applications include manufacturing heat-resistant glass and ceramics, high-performance alloys used in aircraft, and <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases.</b> Lithium deuteride is used in staged thermonuclear weapons as a fusion fuel. Compounds of lithium are also used as mood stabilizing drugs in psychiatry. The breakdown of the global end-use lithium markets is estimated as follows: ceramics and glass, 31%; batteries, 23%; <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases,</b> 9%; air treatment, 6%; primary aluminum production, 6%; continuous casting, 4%; rubber and thermoplastics, 4%; pharmaceuticals, 2%; and other uses, 15%.|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the EU-FP 7 research project AddNANO, the environmental impacts and the resource consumption associated to the production of 1 kg of a <b>lubricating</b> <b>grease</b> were assessed through a from-cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

50|$|Soaps are salts of fatty acids. In the {{domestic}} setting, sodium-based and potassium-based soaps {{are commonly used}} as natural cleaning surfactants. The most useful of the non-detergent soaps are those based on lithium, as they are free of corrosive properties.
