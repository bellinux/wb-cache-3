In this paper, the glass of the P 2 O 5 -ZnO-SiO 2 system was used as matrix material, the matrix material was doped with yttrium aluminum garnet crystals containing Ce (YAG:Ce phosphors) and then were sintered for the preparation of the <b>luminescent</b> <b>glass.</b> Using X-ray diffraction and fluorescence spectrometer, the effects of the doping quantity, sintering temperature and sintering time on luminescent properties were studied. The results show that, for the P 2 O 5 -ZnO-SiO 2 glass, excitation at 340 nm and 468 nm, produced emission at 544 nm; Doping quantity, sintering temperature and sintering time affect intensity of emission peak, but do not affect the position of emission peak. ...|$|E

Silicate glasses containing copper are known to exhibit a broad luminescent band peaked around 500 nm, ascribed to 3 d 10 - 3 d 94 s 1 electronic transition of Cu+ ions; this band {{turns out to be}} much promising for the realization of down-shifting systems, being excited in the UV and neareUV region. <b>Luminescent</b> Cuedoped silicate <b>glass</b> sheets suitable as downeshifters to be used for covering solar cells have been prepared by thermal ion exchange.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that an oxygen divacancy center, or a twofold-coordinated Si center, in silica glass yields a singlet-to-singlet photoluminescence (PL) emission at 4. 4 [*]eV with a decay time of ∼ 4 [*]ns.

At {{the first step of}} the heat treatment nucleation centers were formed at 700 º C. At the second step there was an increase of Mg 2 SiO 4 : Cr crystalline phase. Crystalline phase composition and the crystals size were determined by X-ray diffractometer. It is shown that the crystalline phase of Mg 2 SiO 4 (forsterite) is precipitated during the heat treatment. Valency state and the chromium ion position in a forsterite or a glassy matrix are determined according to luminescence and absorption spectra. Identification of absorption and luminescence bands in initial and heat-treated samples is carried out. The dependence between spectral and luminescent properties of chromium and heat treatment modes is examined. The results demonstrate that ions of the trivalent and tetravalent chromium are transforming to the forsterite crystalline phase during the heat treatment, and a part of them remains in the glassy phase.

40|$|Melilite-related {{compounds}} {{of general}} formula X 2 T 1 T 22 O 7 (with X = large mono- to trivalent cations; T 1 and T 2 = small di- to tetravalent cations) are widespread over many classes of minerals and materials. Melilites are typical constituents of a some ultramafic rocks (e. g. alnöite and melilitites) and also occur in extra terrestrial materials (e. g. in carbonaceous chondrites). Their synthetic analogues have attracted considerable interest in different technological fields: ceramics, <b>glasses,</b> <b>luminescent</b> materials, low-dimensional magnets, etc. The (average) crystal structure of melilite-type compounds {{can be described}} in the P- 421 m space group. The presence of an incommensurately modulated (IC) structure in some melilite compositions (e. g. åkermanite) has received much attention and many studies have been devoted to its determination and to transitions from IC to normal (N) or lock-in phases as a function of temperature, pressure and chemistry. Much less {{attention has been paid to}} the occurrence of compounds having melilite stoichiometry but with reduced symmetry and, more important, different sheet topology compared to melilites [1]. Ba 2 MgSi 2 O 7 was suggested as a compound which could not crystallize with a melilite-type structure [2] but only with a Ba 2 CuSi 2 O 7 -type [3] monoclinic structure. This suggestion was later confuted by a single-crystal refinement of Ba 2 MgSi 2 O 7 in the s. g. P- 421 m [4]. Nevertheless, the same dichotomy was found for Ba 2 CoSi 2 O 7 where opposing claims for a P- 421 m [5] or C 2 /c [6] structure exist. Recently, monoclinic structure refinements of Eu:Ba 2 MgSi 2 O 7 have been also reported [7, 8]. However, none of the above reports attempted to solve the dichotomy, based on the different sheet topology. Aim of this contribution is to provide a better understanding of the relationships between the two polymorphs of Ba 2 MgSi 2 O 7 starting from a new Rietveld refinement of the monoclinic form. During a systematic synthesis and characterization work of Co-doped Sr- and Ba-melilites, we obtained a nearly monophasic sample of Ba 2 MgSi 2 O 7 whose structure was successfully Rietveld refined in the C 2 /c space group starting from the model of [6], with Mg replacing Co. Similarly to the melilite-type polymorph the monoclinic structure consists of Si 2 O 7 dimers connected by MgO 4 tetrahedra to form tetrahedral sheets parallel to the ac plane (vs. the ab plane in the P- 421 m structure). The first major difference between the two polymorphs is in the coordination polyhedron of Ba: a distorted square antiprism (4 ligands above + 4 below) in tetragonal and a 3 + 5 configuration in the monoclinic forms. More important is the difference in the sheet topology: only five-membered rings of tetrahedra in the tetragonal form while four- and six membered rings in the monoclinic one. This implies that the mechanism to switch between the two polymorphs must be of reconstructive nature and is not related to any IC-N or lock-in transition. We suggest that the misfit between the interlayer and tetrahedral sheets in Ba 2 MgSi 2 O 7 is reversed compared to that causing the IC structure in the tetragonal form. The monoclinic structure is the most stable form at low-T, always found in powders from solid state reactions (as in our case), while the tetragonal polymorph is a metastable form at low-T, quenched from high-T, usually found in single crystals obtained by a melt.

40|$|Chapter 1 : Supramolecular gels {{and their}} {{applications}} Gels are viscoelastic materials {{composed of a}} solid-like three dimensional fibrillar network that is embedded in a liquid. Supramolecular gels belong to a class of gels which are derived from low molecular weight compounds (typically < 1000). A variety of non-covalent interactions like H-bonding, π-π stacking, donor-acceptor, metal coordination, solvophobic and van der Waals interactions {{are involved in the}} formation of the self-assembled fibrous networks (SAFIN’s) in these gels. These non-covalent interactions are weak in nature and as a result, these gels can be reverted back to sol by heating and this process is reversible. These gels are further classified as hydrogels, organogels and aero/xerogels depending on the medium they encompass. Although low molecular weight gelators were known in the early part of the 20 th century, it is only in the last two decades that this field has generated widespread interest among scientists. In the 90 s, the investigations on these kinds of gels mainly focused on designing new gelator molecules. However, during the last decade, the research interest in this field has shifted more towards designing functional gels. Such gels Scheme 1. Various applications of functional supramolecular gels have been extensively utilized in the templated synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials, in making hybrid materials, as synthetic light harvesting systems, as sensors, in the field of biomaterials such as drug delivery, screening of enzyme inhibitors and tissue engineering and also in the field of organic optoelectronics. In this chapter a few selected examples from each of these fields are highlighted. Chapter 2 : Charge transfer induced organogels from 2, 3 dialkoxyanthracenes and 2, 4, 7 -trinitrofluorenone 2, 3 -Di-n-alkoxyanthracenes formed charge transfer (CT) interaction promoted organogels in the presence of electron acceptor 2, 4, 7 -trinitrofluorenone (TNF). These dialkoxyanthracences (in the absence of TNF) have been reported previously to form gels in a variety of organic solvents. The gelation property was found to be dependent on the chain length and the derivatives with C 6 -C 16 chains were found to be gelators. On the other hand derivatives with C 5 -C 1 chains were found to be non-gelators. It was found that TNF not only modulated the gelation property of the efficient organogelators, it also transformed the weak and non-gelators into efficient gelators. This charge transfer induced gelation was observed for the derivatives with C 10 -C 4 chains in alcoholic and hydrocarbon solvents whereas the shorter chain derivatives C 3 -C 1 did not form gels. Several other alkoxy and dialkoxy derivatives with substituents in other positions did not show gelation in the presence of TNF. These results suggested that two structural aspects are necessary for these derivatives to form CT gels- the alkoxy chain length and the position of the alkoxy substituents. The thermal stability of all these gels was found to be maximum with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry of the donor and the acceptor. The common observation, the intensification of color in going from the sol to the gel phase, supported the crucial role of the charge transfer interaction behind the formation of these gels. The rheological characterization of the gels demonstrated that they Figure 1. Chemical structures of 2, 3 -dialkoxyanthracenes and TNF (middle) and a fluorescence confocal microscopy image (left) and a photograph (right) of DDOA-TNF gel. behaved like viscoelastic soft solids. Chapter 3 : A new class of perfluorinated derivatives of bile acids: Synthesis and gelation properties A new class of bile acid based gelators was designed by connecting the side chains of the facially amphiphilic bile acid with perfluoroalkyl chains of different lengths through two different ester linkages-–O-(CO) -and –(CO) -OCH 2 -. All these three structural aspects i. e. the bile acid moiety, the fluoroalkyl chain length and the spacer were found to influence the gelation properties of the derivatives. Depending on them, there was a variation in terms of the nature of the solvent gelated, the CGCs, the mechanical properties of the gels, etc among the derivatives. The deoxycholic and lithocholic derivatives with the spacer –O-(CO) -formed gels in aromatic hydrocarbons and also in DMSO depending on the fluoroalkyl chain length. The mechanical properties of the gels formed in DMSO were found to be dependent on the bile acid moiety and the fluoroalkyl chain length. In general, the deoxy analogues showed higher elasticity, stiffness and yield stress values for their gels than the litho derivatives. The perfluorinated derivatives having the spacer –(CO) -OCH 2 -showed gelation properties in organic-aqueous media and in DMSO. Interestingly, organogelation was observed in the deoxy and lithocholic derivatives from both spacer series whereas in the literature most of the bile acid based organogelators are derived from cholic acid.

(a) Perfluorinated derivatives of bile acids, (b) photographs of a few DMSO gels and (c) TEM image of a xerogel of a deoxy derivative Chapter 4 : Composite aerogels and organogels from 2, 3 didecyloxyanthracene and bile-perfluoro derivatives Aerogels are unique materials among solids. They have extremely low densities (up to 95 % of their volume is air), large pores and high inner surface area. As a result aerogels have very interesting physical properties such as extremely low thermal conductivity, low sound velocity and high optical transparency. There are only a few reports of aerogel formation by low molecular weight gelators. We have investigated the aerogel formation ability of three long 7 chain perfluoroalkyl esters (two deoxycholic and one lithocholic derivative, chart 1) in supercritical CO 2. A deoxy derivative, formed aerogel in sc-CO 2. When mixed with DDOA (which has been reported previously to form good aerogels in sc-CO 2), the perfluoro compound formed aerogels of better quality. The mixed aerogels were characterized by the presence of very large fibers in the micron range (as observed in the aerogel formed by only the fluoro derivative) as well as fibers of smaller size observed in pure DDOA aerogel. We also investigated the behavior of the composite systems in organic solvents. It was found that in DMSO, another deoxy derivative, Figure 3. SEM images of a mixed aerogel of DDOA-DC 23 C 13 F 27 (left) and a mixed organogel (DMSO) of DDOA-DC 23 C 11 F 23 (right). DC 23 C 11 F 23 formed gels with higher thermal stability and improved mechanical properties compared to the native gels of the perfluoro compound or DDOA. Chapter 5 : Hydrogels from lanthanide(III) cholates: Tunable, multiple color luminescence from hydrogels and xerogels In this chapter, facile hydrogel formation by several lanthanide cholates is reported. When sodium cholate was added to aqueous solutions of Nd(III), Sm(III), Eu(III), Gd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III), Ho(III), Er(III), Tm(III) and Yb(III) and sonicated, the mixtures formed gels within a few seconds. The gels thus obtained were transparent/translucent and thermoirreversible. Rheological measurements showed that all of them could be classified as viscoelastic soft solids. A naphthalene derivative, 2, 3 -dihyroxynaphthalene was found to sensitize Tb(III) emission very efficiently in its cholate gel when doped in micromolar concentrations. The importance of the gel matrix behind sensitization of Tb(III) was demonstrated by the inefficiency of the same sensitizer DHN in an SDS micellar solution. In mixed gels of Tb(III) -Eu(III) doped with DHN, a energy transfer pathway was found to occur from the sensitized Tb(III) to Eu(III). By a simple tuning of the ratio of these two lanthanide ions, multiple color emissive gels could be made. The emissive properties of the hydrogels were retained in the xerogels and the suspensions of these xerogels in n-hexane were used for making <b>luminescent</b> coatings on <b>glass</b> surface.
