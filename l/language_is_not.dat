5|$|The AG {{has created}} various non-geographical {{language}} districts to serve immigrant communities whose primary <b>language</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> English. There are nine Spanish and two Korean language districts {{in addition to}} one each for Brazilian and German speakers. In 2009, the language districts oversaw 2,195 churches with a combined membership of 279,422.|$|E
5|$|The Nation Alliance Party was {{guided by}} a support for multiculturalism. Specifically, the party sought to {{increase}} translation services for people who could not read or speak English or people whose first <b>language</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> English, equivalency of academic standards, more supportive immigration services that assist transition into Canadian society, and better working conditions for recent immigrants and migrant labourers.|$|E
5|$|The Nation Alliance Party {{was founded}} in June 2007 by four people: realtor Wei Ping Chen of Delta, renovator Steven Lian from Surrey, tourism guide Randy Liu from Burnaby, and Simon Fraser University student Locan Wang. Party leader Wei Ping Chen had immigrated to Canada from Beijing, via Australia. He {{witnessed}} the challenges that recent immigrants faced once in a new country, and how uninvolved they were in politics. Contrasted to his experience in China, Wei Ping Chen {{was impressed with the}} political freedoms available in Canada and felt motivated to start a political party. He felt that political campaigns oriented towards recent immigrants and people whose first <b>language</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> English, would empower those communities to become more politically active.|$|E

These are all proper inclusions, meaning that there exist recursively enumerable <b>languages</b> that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> context-sensitive, context-sensitive <b>languages</b> that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> context-free and context-free <b>languages</b> that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> regular.|$|R

5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the <b>language</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E
5|$|This <b>language</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{from the}} Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, {{it is an}} almost direct {{quotation}} from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E

25|$|Although {{related to}} the more general problem {{of the origin of}} language, the {{evolution}} of distinctively human speech capacities has become a distinct and in many ways separate area of scientific research.
