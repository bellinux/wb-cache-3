2500|$|One area {{of concern}} is whether the {{auditing}} firm acts as both the independent auditor and management consultant to the firm they are auditing. This {{may result in a}} conflict of interest which places the integrity of financial reports in doubt due to client pressure to appease management. The power of the corporate client to initiate and terminate management consulting services and, more fundamentally, to select and dismiss accounting firms contradicts the concept of an independent auditor. [...] Changes enacted in the United States {{in the form of the}} Sarbanes-Oxley Act (following numerous corporate scandals, culminating with the Enron scandal) prohibit accounting firms from providing both auditing and management consulting services. Similar provisions are in place under clause 49 of Standard <b>Listing</b> <b>Agreement</b> in India.|$|E

5000|$|The {{flat fee}} MLS service is radically {{different}} from traditional real estate brokerage services. Because every State requires a <b>listing</b> <b>agreement</b> between {{a real estate broker}} and property owner, the rapid explosion of flat fee service providers has created a gap in the States developing laws governing flat fee services provided by real estate broker. In most real estate board / MLS systems, there are generally two types of listing agreements, although some Boards allow others. The first and most common is called an [...] "Exclusive Right to Sell" [...] listing, in which the seller will not only pay a commission if their property is sold through their listing broker or another MLS broker (buyers broker), but also if the seller finds their own buyer. In an [...] "Exclusive Right to Sell" [...] listing, the listing broker gets the commission specified in the <b>listing</b> <b>agreement</b> regardless of who actually finds the buyer. [...] The second type of <b>listing</b> <b>agreement</b> is called an [...] "Exclusive Agency" [...] <b>listing</b> <b>agreement.</b> This [...] "Exclusive Agency" [...] is one form of agreement {{that can be used to}} allow the seller to market their property [...] "By Owner" [...] and pay zero commission if they are successful in finding their own buyer. It is this [...] "Exclusive Agency" [...] <b>listing</b> <b>agreement</b> that forms the basis for many flat fee service provider's listing agreements. In essence, Flat Fee MLS listings are a logical progression of reduced-cost selling alternatives to property owners who are comfortable with managing part or all of the selling process, who believe the MLS will effectively [...] "advertise" [...] their property, and who are willing to pay a buyer's broker a commission.|$|E

[...] Clause 49, when it was first added, was intended to introduce some basic corporate governance practices in Indian companies and brought in a number of key changes in governance and disclosures (many of which we take for granted today). It specified the minimum number of independent directors required on the board of a company. The setting up of an Audit committee, and a Shareholders’ Grievance committee, among others, were made mandatory as were the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section and the Report on Corporate Governance in the Annual Report, and disclosures of fees paid to non-executive directors. A limit was placed on the number of committees that a director could serve on.|$|E

An exposure strategy is to set a listing price above estimated market value, and increase advertising and broker activity in order to generate more favorable offers. Pricing and exposure are competing strategies and may be revealed in listing contracts through the inclusion of a buyer-broker provision. Empirical results for the Washington, D.
