40|$|The"New Open Economy Macroeconomics"argues that: (a) {{non-monetary}} factors have gained importance in explaining exchange rate volatility, and (b) trade and financial openness {{may have a}} potential role of mitigating and/or amplifying real and nominal shocks to real exchange rates. The goal of the present paper {{is to examine the}} ability of trade and financial openness to exacerbate or mitigate real exchange rate volatility. The authors collected information on the real effective exchange rate, its fundamentals, and (outcome and policy measures of) trade and financial openness for a sample of industrial and developing countries for the period 1975 - 2005. Using instrumental variables techniques, the analysis finds that: (a) High real exchange rate volatility is the result of highly volatile productivity shocks, and sharp oscillations in monetary and fiscal policy shocks. (b) Countries more integrated with international markets of goods and services tend to display more stable real exchange rate fluctuations. (c) Financial openness seems to amplify the fluctuations in real exchange rates. (d) The composition of trade and capital flows plays a role in explaining the smoothing properties of trade and financial openness. Although the former is mainly driven by manufacturing trade, the latter depends on the share of debt (and equity) in total foreign liabilities. (e) Financial openness would attenuate (magnify) real exchange rate volatility, the greater the share of equity (debt) in foreign <b>liabilities.</b> (<b>f)</b> The composition of flows also matters for explaining the smoothing properties of trade and financial openness in periods of currency crisis.

40|$|This report {{comprises}} {{the output of}} Task 2 Exploring Liability and the Polluter Pays Principle of Project ME 1104 : Research and Support for Developing a UK Strategy for Managing Contaminated Sediments. The wider project produced a 'Synthesis' document (May 2010) : [URL] which {{formed the basis of}} a 'Draft Decision Framework' issued for consultation in August 2010 : [URL] Key Findings from the Task/Report include: The application of liability regimes, and the different variables, to particular fact patterns found in the CMS Case Studies suggests that there are no general answers to questions relating to the recovery and transfer of costs and liabilities incurred as a result of operational dredging activities to those who were responsible for historic contamination. Each set of facts will give rise to different considerations. It is possible, however, to identify some general points raised by the application of the polluter pays principle (‘PPP’) in the context of liability for the management, movement and disposal of historic CMS: A Costs and liabilities cannot be transferred or recovered unless there is some specific legal mechanism which allows them to be transferred or recovered. B The application of liability regimes and principles to CMS Case Studies suggests that liability on the part of ‘historic polluters’ will not be imposed in most cases of ‘Operational Management’ liabilities C Whilst liability for remedial works required to address CMS in situ might be more readily established, such cases are generally outside the scope of the project D Even where the requirements for establishing liability in law can be met, there may be significant legal and practical obstacles to actually securing money or actions from other parties E The application of the Environmental Liability Directive (‘ELD’) is limited to Contingent <b>Liabilities</b> <b>F</b> Consideration of the ‘Hypotheticals’ relating to novel operational management techniques suggests that the nature of Contingent Liabilities which might arise can be complex G Ownership of CMS sites, and disposal sites, is important as it can result in liability, but will not usually do so where remedial works are not required H The identity of the ‘polluter’ can be considered from different perspectives, including that of the person creating environmental risks, so that there are justifications for applying the PPP to those undertaking CMS Operational Management activities I A range of structures and techniques for the management of Contingent Liabilities can be employed in order to allocate and address legal risk...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the article is legal {{institution}} of contract liability as regulated in the Vienna Convention from 1980 on contracts o f international sale of wares. The Convention {{is an act of}} law which practical importance is hard to be overestimated: it concerns one of mostly concluded kind of contracts within economic relations and it has obligatory force in more than 50 countries (including also Poland). The article contains an extract of principal theses from the author’s book published under the title of “Liability o f exporter and importer for breach of a contract on international sale of wares”. The article is composed of three parts. Part one is devoted to relations between the Convention and national Polish law. Second part is devoted to a breach of an obligation as a pre-condition of exporter’s or importer’s liability. The object of the part three is the scope of this liability as designated by the following legal institution: a) claim for performance of an obligation, b) reduction of a price, c) interest, d) withdrawal from a contract, e) <b>liability</b> for damages, <b>f)</b> abstention from reciprocal performance...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the extent}} of medical care in France may be thought adequate, the same {{does not apply to}} the social {{medicine}} sector. The Assurance-maladie paid 87. 7 % of hospital health expenditure in 1994, whereas direct funding of home assistance amounted to only 9 %. In contrast, a recent Legos study (Bungener M. et al. Le bilan économique et financier du secteur médico social, Université de Paris IX, Legos, Janvier 1994) [1] estimated that home assistance costs represent 41 - 50 % of medical-social expenditure. When people are unable to manage because of the high costs of their invalidity, the social security system comes to their assistance, although only under Draconian conditions involving compulsory "family support commitments" and the state's claim on the inheritance of the beneficiary (total costs for hospital admission and boarding and the dual limits of 1000 <b>F</b> <b>liabilities</b> and 250, 000 F net assets for home assistance). The elderly well appreciate the severity of this problem and are deeply distressed by the thought of dependency. Many, however, live under the illusion that the social security system or, to a lesser extent, the mutual funds will come to their assistance, although the problems involved lie partly outside their remits. We therefore need to design new systems to allow the elderly to finance their costs should they become dependant. public funds private funds longterm care insurance...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis o <b>f</b> the <b>liability</b> {{of members}} of the Russian Federation of commercial corporate organisations for the obligations of those organisations requires focusing on three sets of rules: 1) the basic rules which usually determine the issue of the liability of the members of a given commercial organisation for its obligations, 2) the rules that deal with the <b>liability</b> o <b>f</b> members within the frames of the contributions that have not been actually made, 3) the rules that pertain to the liability of parent companies for the obligations of their daughter companies. Without a shadow o f a doubt, the first set of rules is of a primary character. Relying on the main of those rules, one may conclude that the liability of partners in general partnerships and members of limited liability companies and joint-stock companies is rather standardised - partners in general partnerships have unlimited liability, i. e. are liable with their all property, for the obligations of a partnership, while shareholders are not at all liable for the obligations o f companies. It {{is interesting to note that}} in a limited partnership, general partners are liable for the obligations of a partnership pursuant to the same rules as partners in general partnerships. Specific rules do not determine, however, the issue of liability of the limited partners. In connection therewith - based on the general rule - one should conclude that limited partners are not liable for the obligations of a partnership and, hence, the creditors of the latter may not direct their claims towards the personal estate of the limited partners. A rather unique situation exists in companies with supplementary liability and producer’s co-operatives, the participants of which (members or partners) are liable for the obligations of the organisation in a limited manner: in companies with supplementary liability - up to the level determined in the incorporation documents, which is based on the multiplication o f the contributions made, and in the producer’s co-operatives - up to the level determined in the Act on the Producer’s Co-operatives and in the statutes of a given co-operative...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} {{judgment of}} Mogoeng CJ in F v Minister of Safety and Security 2012 1 SA 536 (CC) purports to be a straightforward {{application of the}} reasoning of the Constitutional Court in K v Minister of Safety and Security 2005 6 SA 419 (CC), in which the court updated and constitutionalised the "standard test" for vicarious liability in deviation cases originally set out in Minister of Police v Rabie 1986 1 SA 117 (A) by holding that constitutional and other policy norms now {{play an important role}} in deciding questions of vicarious liability. However, it is respectfully submitted that a close reading of the majority judgment in F reveals that the judge misconstrues several key concepts related to the doctrine of vicarious liability. In particular, the judge seems to suggest that there are separate and different tests for vicarious liability in instances where an employee has plainly committed a delict in the course and scope of his employment, and where he has to some extent deviated from his employment duties. In fact, there is a single overarching test for vicarious liability - the course and scope rule - but various subsidiary tests are used by the courts to address difficult or borderline cases. It is also questionable whether F truly is a "typical deviation case", as the judge asserts. The judge then applies the constitutionalised test for vicarious liability originally set out in K in a manner which is subtly, but significantly, different from how it was deployed in that case. In particular, Mogoeng CJ's implication that it is not necessary for a court to consider the second leg of the Rabie test in circumstances where the employee wrongdoer has clearly subjectively intended to further the interests of his employer is undesirable and should not be supported. Furthermore, the judge identifies the question of whether or not there is an "intimate link" between the conduct of the employee wrongdoer and the business of his employer as one of the normative issues to be canvassed in order to determine the outcome of the second leg of the Rabie test. In fact, the "intimate link" question is the overall one to be decided in terms of the second leg of the Rabie test, which, in terms of the approach set out by O'Regan J in K, is to be answered by considering a range of factual and normative considerations in conjunction with one another. Moreover, the judge appears to construe the "intimate link" question in primarily factual terms. The discrepancies between the approaches of the courts in K and F are significant because they lead Mogoeng CJ to place a far heavier reliance on factual considerations in deciding whether the conduct of the employee wrongdoer was sufficiently closely related to the employer's business than would have been the case if he had more faithfully applied the test for vicarious liability set out in K. Although the judge devotes a considerable portion of the judgment to the normative issues which point to the need for the court to make a finding of vicarious liability, these do not seem to have been the immediate driver of his ultimate decision to impose vicarious liability in this instance. The reasoning of the majority in F becomes all the more problematic when one considers that the factual considerations linking the employee wrongdoer's conduct to the business of the SAPS are far more tenuous in this case than in K. A more compelling justification for imposing vicarious <b>liability</b> in <b>F</b> would have lain in the normative constitutional considerations that point towards the need to impose vicarious liability in this instance...|$|R
