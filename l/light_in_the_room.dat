5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E

6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. There is some one. There are <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and <b>the</b> door is ajar. Some one {{has been}} {{listening}} to every secret of my life. Arthur, what does this mean? ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly she {{was awakened}} to full {{consciousness}} by seeing a <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> No, {{it was not}} the maid putting away her dresses. It was Janet, bending over her mother's davenport.|$|E
6000|$|... "They want to know," [...] said Mrs. Muldoon, [...] "if the Fairy's in." [...] The Professor, {{with his}} back to the window, was reading. The <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was {{somewhat}} faint.|$|E
60|$|He seated {{himself by}} the side of the berth, lighted a cigar, and began to read a newspaper, {{although}} the <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was far from good owing to the blinds being closed.|$|E
2500|$|Gerbic and Edward {{were hired}} by Discovery Channel in 2011 to film a {{recreation}} of the Scole Séance experiences, during Weird or What? episode [...] "Life After Death".

5000|$|A {{music video}} to {{accompany}} the release of [...] "The Power of Love" [...] was first released onto YouTube on 9 November 2012. It shows Aplin in a room in a large house, playing a piano. Then, {{near the end of}} <b>the</b> video, fairy <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>light</b> up. <b>The</b> video was directed by Alexander Brown.|$|R
60|$|The only <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{came from}} the lamp upon the table at which I had been reading. Holmes edged his way round the wall and flinging the {{shutters}} together, he bolted them securely.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the second}} floor window some one {{standing}} between {{the window and the}} <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> threw a silhouette on the blind. It was one Tommy would have recognized anywhere! Tuppence was in that house! ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was dim. Antonia, {{crouching}} in a corner, rocked herself {{backwards and}} forwards, uttering feeble moans. Old Nelson had not much experience in {{various kinds of}} feminine laughter, but he was certain there had been laughter there.|$|E
60|$|When Jimmy {{got home}} that night he saw a <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lizard's <b>room</b> and entered.|$|R
50|$|A {{video for}} the song was made, {{featuring}} Del Naja {{in a series of}} sequences where his body is transformed into that of a wingless, dead moth while a live moth flutters its wings <b>in</b> time to <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> which themselves flash <b>in</b> time to <b>the</b> beat of the song. The video was directed by South African Daniel Levi.|$|R

6000|$|Before the wager {{could be}} {{accepted}} or declined, {{the door of}} the inner room was opened again. The tall, spare, black figure of a new personage appeared on the threshold, relieved darkly against the <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> behind him. He addressed the visitors in these words: ...|$|E
60|$|Her form drooped consolingly {{over the}} low {{casement}} towards the slave of the unlawful treasure. The <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> went out, and weighted with silver, the magnificent Capataz clasped her round her white neck {{in the darkness}} of the gulf as a drowning man clutches at a straw.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{movement}} of men turning and then a sudden stillness, as of their stiffening, for over in the corner on the wooden floor there was really a round spot of pale light. It was the only spot of <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The cigar had gone out.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no answer}} and the silence was just as ominous as before. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>room</b> had gone out.|$|R

60|$|One {{day it was}} {{observed}} by those who looked out of <b>the</b> window <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper deck that the water above them was clearer than they usually saw it, and when <b>the</b> electric <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> immediately under <b>the</b> window were turned out it was almost possible to discern objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Instantly {{there was a great}} stir on board the Dipsey, and observations soon disclosed {{the fact that there was}} nothing above the vessel but water and air.|$|R
60|$|Pleading fatigue, {{she retired}} early, {{and for a}} time Mrs. Savine and Helen sat silently in the glow of the great hearth upon which immense logs were burning. There was no other <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and each flicker of the fire showed that Helen's face was more than usually serious.|$|E
60|$|We {{found my}} lady with no <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> but the reading-lamp. The shade was screwed down {{so as to}} overshadow her face. Instead of looking up at us in her usual {{straightforward}} way, she sat close at the table, and kept her eyes fixed obstinately on an open book.|$|E
60|$|On {{the night}} {{following}} {{his release from}} prison, Ruby {{lay on his back}} in his hammock meditating intently on the future, and gazing at the ceiling, or rather at the place where he knew the ceiling to be, for it was a dark night, and there was no <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> the candle having just been extinguished.|$|E
5000|$|Evie and Donna {{normally}} {{keep the}} cube around the house, {{out of sight}} (often in Evie's bedroom), sometimes telling people it is an ornament or a talking clock.

60|$|Saddled and bridled Barbara {{led him to}} {{the rear}} of the {{building}} and thus, by a roundabout way, to the back of the office building.

60|$|Some one knocked gently at her door. She did not answer, she feigned sleep. Yet {{the door}} opened, she felt, though {{her eyes were}} shut and her back turned, {{that there was a}} <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> A tender step {{approached}} her bed. It could be but one person, that person whom she had herself deceived. She knew it was her father.|$|E
60|$|It was {{fascinating}} and horrible to Ursula. The curious, unliving <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> changed her character. She {{thought it was}} the rainy morning. Then she looked up again, because of the horrid feeling of being shut in a rigid, inflexible air, away from all feeling of the ordinary day; and she noticed that the windows were of ribbed, suffused glass.|$|E
50|$|Natalie {{comes home}} to find her father sitting alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, <b>in</b> tears.

Natalie tells him Diana has gone to stay with her own parents. Dan visits Doctor Madden hoping to talk about Diana, but Madden instead offers him the name of another mental-health worker.
