40|$|The article {{deals with}} the method of field {{curvature}} correction in wide-angle objectives and technique of its implementation. The correctional elements were used with definite values of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnification</b> along the chief ray {{to solve the problem}} of correcting components synthesis. Design parameters of these elements were related mathematically with its real aberration, in particular, the aberration of astigmatism. ...|$|E
40|$|We use {{the vector}} wedge product in {{geometric}} algebra {{to show that}} Poisson commutator brackets measure preservation of phase space areas. We also use the vector dot product to define the Poisson anticommutator bracket that measures the preservation of phase space angles. We apply these brackets to the paraxial meridional complex height-angle ray vectors that transform via a 2 x 2 matrix, and we show that this transformation preserves areas but not angles in phase space. The Poisson brackets here are {{expressed in terms of}} the coefficients of the ABCD matrix. We also apply these brackets to the distance-height ray vectors measured from the input and output sides of the optical system. We show that these vectors obey a partial Moebius transformation, and that this transformation preserves neither areas nor angles. The Poisson brackets here are expressed in terms of the transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnifications.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} issue of {{creating}} imagery on a screen that, when viewed by naked human eyes, will be indistinguishable from the original scene as viewed through a visual accessory. Visual accessories of interest include, for example, binoculars, stereomicroscopes, and binocular periscopes. It is the nature of these magnifying optical devices that the transverse (normal) <b>magnification</b> and <b>longitudinal</b> (depth-wise) <b>magnification</b> are different. That is why an object viewed through magnifying optical devices looks different from the same object viewed with the naked eye from a closer distance âˆ’ the object looks &quot;squashed &quot; (foreshortened) through telescopic instruments and the opposite through microscopic instruments. We rigorously describe the quantitative relationships that must exist when presenting a scene on a screen that stereoscopically simulates viewing through these visual accessories...|$|R
40|$|Consideration of {{the problem}} of {{distortion}} posed by a long-wavelength hologram as a three-dimensional display to be viewed by an observer who is included in the distortion problem. The effects of holographic distortion upon the observer's image perception are examined. The inclusion of the visual perception process into the description of holographic imagery necessarily complicates the analysis, {{but at the same time}} increases the degrees of freedom by which the image can be altered. It is shown that these additional degrees of freedom make it possible to overcome the problem of unequal <b>longitudinal</b> and lateral <b>magnification...</b>|$|R
