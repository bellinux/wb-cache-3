25|$|<b>Leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> was {{withdrawn}} from sale in Britain after 31 December 1999, {{seven years after}} EEC regulations signalled the end of production for cars using <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> in member states. At this stage, {{a large percentage of}} cars from the 1980s and early 1990s which ran on <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> were still in use, along with cars which could run on unleaded fuel. However, the declining number of such cars on British roads saw many petrol stations withdrawing LRP from sale by 2003.|$|E

40|$|Lead {{concentrations}} from an Antarctic snow pit {{show the}} pattern of Pb reaching the Antarctic atmosphere over the last 70 years. Between 1920 and 1950, the Pb concentration shows significant variations around a mean of about 2. 5 ng kg− 1. Between 1950 and 1980, {{there is a clear}} increase to 6 ng kg− 1, with an apparent reduction after that. A few high concentrations in the late 1970 s are probably due to local contamination from aircraft using <b>leaded</b> gasoline (<b>petrol).</b> Excluding these anomalously high values, the chronological pattern in lead concentrations can be reconciled with estimates of emissions from vehicles and metal production processes in the southern hemisphere...|$|R
500|$|GOI {{licenses}} the Gulf {{brand and}} logo in the UK to the Bayford group, {{one of the}} largest independent fuel distributors. Starting in 2001, a new Gulf network of independent stations is slowly reappearing across the UK. At present, many of these stations are notable for offering genuine <b>leaded</b> four-star <b>petrol,</b> for which Bayford has a special dispensation to sell. At the same time, Gulf Lubricants (UK) Ltd was set up to market Gulf products (mostly manufactured by the Gulf Netherlands operation) in the UK. This return by Gulf to the UK after a four-year absence used the slogan [...] "The Return of the Legend". The post-2001 Gulf presence in the UK is a wholly network-based operation. It involves almost no direct Gulf investment in fixed assets, corporate infrastructure, or manufacturing capability. This is a complete contrast to the pre-1997 presence.|$|R
500|$|Environmentalists have criticised the Delhi {{government}} {{for not doing}} enough to curb air pollution and to inform people about air quality issues. Most of Delhi's residents are unaware of alarming levels of air pollution in the city and the health risks associated with it; however, , awareness, particularly among the foreign diplomatic community and high-income Indians, was noticeably increasing. Since the mid-1990s, Delhi has undertaken some measures to curb air pollution – Delhi has the third highest quantity of trees among Indian cities and the Delhi Transport Corporation operates the world's largest fleet of environmentally friendly compressed natural gas (CNG) buses. In 1996, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) started a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court of India that ordered the conversion of Delhi's fleet of buses and taxis to run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and banned the use of <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> in 1998. In 2003, Delhi won the United States Department of Energy's first 'Clean Cities International Partner of the Year' award for its [...] "bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives". The Delhi Metro has also been credited for significantly reducing air pollutants in the city.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{application}} of multicriteria decision making techniques, PROMETHEE and GAIA, and receptor models, PCA/APCS and PMF, to data from an air monitoring site located {{on the campus of}} Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia and operated by Queensland Environmental Protection Agency (QEPA). The data consisted of the concentrations of 21 chemical species and meteorological data collected between 1995 and 2003. PROMETHEE/GAIA separated the samples into those collected when <b>leaded</b> and unleaded <b>petrol</b> were used to power vehicles in the region. The number and source profiles of the factors obtained from PCA/APCS and PMF analyses were compared. There are noticeable differences in the outcomes possibly because of the non-negative constraints imposed on the PMF analysis. While PCA/APCS identified 6 sources, PMF reduced the data to 9 factors. Each factor had distinctive compositions that suggested that motor vehicle emissions, controlled burning of forests, secondary sulphate, sea salt and road dust/soil were the most important sources of fine particulate matter at the site. The most plausible locations of the sources were identified by combining the results obtained from the receptor models with meteorological data. The study demonstrated the potential benefits of combining results from multi-criteria decision making analysis with those from receptor models in order to gain insights into information that could enhance the development of air pollution control measures...|$|R
40|$|The {{elemental}} composition, {{patterns of}} distribution and possible sources of street dust are not {{common to all}} urban environments, but {{vary according to the}} peculiarities of each city. The common features and dissimilarities in the origin and nature of street dust were investigated through a series of studies in two widely different cities, Madrid (Spain) and Oslo (Norway), between 1990 and 1994. The most comprehensive sampling campaign was carried out in the Norwegian capital during the summer of 1994. An area of 14 km 2, covering most of downtown Oslo and some residential districts {{to the north of the}} city, was divided into 1 km 2 mapping units, and 16 sampling increments of approximately 150 g were collected from streets and roads in each of them. The fraction below 100 μm was acid-digested and analysed by ICP-MS. Statistical analyses of the results suggest that chemical elements in street dust can be classified into three groups: “urban” elements (Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Mg, Pb, Sb, Ti, Zn), “natural” elements (Al, Ga, La, Mn, Na, Sr, Th, Y) and elements of a mixed origin or which have undergone geochemical changes from their original sources (Ca, Cs, Fe, Mo, Ni, Rb, Sr, U). Soil resuspension and/or mobilisation appears to be the most important source of “natural” elements, while “urban” elements originate primarily from traffic and from the weathering and corrosion of building materials. The data for Pb seem to prove that the gradual shift from <b>leaded</b> to unleaded <b>petrol</b> as fuel for automobiles has resulted in an almost proportional reduction in the concentration of Pb in dust particles under 100 μm. This fact and the spatial distribution of Pb in the city strongly suggest that lead sources other than traffic (i. e. lead accumulated in urban soil over the years) may contribute as much lead, if not more, to urban street dust...|$|R

These compounds are stored in the body's fat, and when the fatty tissues are used for energy, the compounds are released and cause acute poisoning.|$|E

50|$|In all, 436,000 Montegos {{were sold}} in the UK between 1984 and 1995. In August 2006, a survey by Auto Express {{revealed}} that the Montego was Britain's eighth-most scrapped car, with just 8,988 still in working order. Contributing to this, areas of the bodywork that were to be covered by plastic trim (such as {{the front and rear}} bumpers) were left unpainted and thus unprotected. In addition, pre-1989 models fitted with the A and S-series engines cannot run on unleaded petrol without the cylinder head being converted or needing fuel additives. This led to many owners simply scrapping the cars, as <b>leaded</b> <b>petrol</b> was removed from sale in Britain after 1999, and by 2003 most petrol stations had stopped selling LRP (lead replacement petrol) due to the falling demand for it.|$|E
