40|$|Proximal {{interphalangeal}} joint replacement is {{an effective}} treatment for painful arthritis affecting the joint. However, the complication rate is relatively high, with many of these complications related to soft-tissue imbalance or instability. Volar, dorsal, and lateral approaches have all been described with varying results. We describe a new simplified <b>lateral</b> <b>hinge</b> approach that splits the collateral ligament to provide adequate exposure of the joint. Following insertion of the prosthesis the collateral ligament is simply repaired, side-to-side, which stabilizes the joint. As the central slip, opposite collateral ligament, flexor and extensor tendons have not been violated, early active mobilization without splinting is possible, {{and the risk of}} instability, swan-neck, and boutonniere deformity are reduced. The indications, contraindications, surgical technique, and rehabilitation protocol are described. Bain, Gregory I., McGuire, Duncan T., McGrath, Aleksandra M...|$|E
30|$|The {{assessment}} {{was based on}} crack initiation only and hence complete dislocation was not investigated here. But as the wall thickness from the drilled hole to the outer surface of the bone is small, {{it can be concluded}} by simple engineering reasoning that complete rupture of the opposite cortex follows soon after crack initiation. These data suggest that the hinge pin offers no relevant benefit for the treatment of malalignment since the need for correction in patients with varus alignment is frequently above 8 ° of correction. It is well documented that the risk of revarisation {{in the presence of the}} opposite cortex fracture increases with every degree of valgus correction (Pape et al. 2004 a, 2004 b). Obviously, the current study suggests that the cortex-preserving hinge pin effect is absent in larger corrections exceeding 5 °. This observation is confirmed in an experimental study by Reyle et al. (2017), which used human cadaver tibial bone, artificial Synbones and Sawbones to investigate the fracture of the <b>lateral</b> <b>hinge</b> in an open-wedge HTO with and without a hinge pin.|$|E
40|$|Surgical {{correction}} of bowed legs {{should be performed}} as early as possible. Overload osteoarthritis, even without significant varus deformity of the knee, is a further indication for open-wedge high-tibial osteotomy. Progression of damage to the joint surfaces due to overloading can be significantly retarded by realigning the extremity with the aim to, at least, reduce overload on the medial compartment to a value close to physiological. Significant improvement to open-wedge high-tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) has been made on two fronts: (a) {{by the use of}} a more appropriate surgical technique and (b) by promoting osteogenesis through an angular-stable fixation device with just the correct amount of elasticity. A retrospective study of 53 consecutive cases in which no interposition material was used to fill the wedge, with gap openings between 5  mm and 20  mm, showed that ossification of the gap always progressed from the <b>lateral</b> <b>hinge</b> towards the medial side. Standard radiographs showed 75 % of the gap filled in with new bone within 6 − 18  months. In conclusion, we believe that open-wedge high-tibial osteotomy using the TomoFix® plate has proved to be successful in treating unicompartmental gonarthrosis, even without bone grafts or bone-substitute material...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Tibial Tubercle Osteotomy {{has shown}} much promise in {{revision}} total knee replacement. Methods of repair previously described include screw and wire fixation. Both methods have significant complications. Methods This article describes suture fixation of the osteotomy using Ethibond sutures placed medially with a <b>lateral</b> periosteal <b>hinge.</b> Results This method of fixation relies upon an adequate osteotomy segment including the entire insertion of the patella tendon. The <b>lateral</b> periosteal <b>hinge</b> is maintained and {{adds to the}} stability of the construct. A minimum of two number 5 Ethibond sutures are passed medially through drill holes to secure the osteotomy segment. No post-operative immobilisation is required.

30|$|French-door laminoplasty {{was first}} {{described}} by Kurokawa et al. in 1980 {{to address the}} limitations of single-door expansile laminoplasty. The midline spinous process split prevented asymmetry of extensor spinal musculature and minimised excessive epidural bleeding [16, 17]. The two <b>lateral</b> <b>hinges</b> opened the cervical canal like a French-door with plastic deformation/greenstick fracture of the troughs and a spacer material (bone graft or bone graft substitute) was placed in between the opened spinous processes to prevent re-closure [18]. Dislodgement of the spacers was a commonly reported complication of the procedure and was described by other authors as well [19]. More recently, several modifications of the original technique have been reported while clinical {{research has focused on}} developing instrumentation devices to provide extra stability to the graft and ensure spinal canal patency (i.e., hardware-augmented laminoplasty). Our technique of hardware-augmented French-door laminoplasty consists of fixing the bone graft spacer in between spinous processes to the lamina and lateral masses with maxillofacial titanium miniplates. We have been using this technique for the past 7  years and report our clinical outcomes with this procedure.|$|R
30|$|Compared {{to other}} biomechanical studies (Agneskirchner et al., 2006; Diffo Kaze et al., 2015; Maas et al., 2013; Spahn & Wittig, 2002; Stoffel et al., 2004; Watanabe et al., 2014; Han et al., 2014) that {{reported}} fracture of the lateral cortex, the finding (5) {{of the present}} study indicates that the lateral cortex is the weakest point of the open wedge HTO. Beside smokers, patients with a fracture of the lateral cortex after HTO exhibit delayed union (Schröter et al., 2015; Takeuchi et al., 2012). This highlights the importance of using an implant that will avoid fracture of the cortical <b>lateral</b> <b>hinge</b> prior to the beginning of gap healing, which takes approximately 3 to 8  weeks (Marsell & Einhorn, 2011). In the cyclic loading fatigue test, the highest strength, i.e. the highest number of cycles prior to failure of the lateral cortex, was found in the Contour Lock group followed by the Activmotion group (Fig.  9). Considering the fact that a healthy active person performs 1 million loading cycles of their limb per year (Baleani et al., 2003; Bergmann et al., 2001; Thielen, 2009), all the plates, except the PEEKPower, would preserve a safe lateral cortex for at least 4 weeks, corresponding to about 80, 000  cycles (Table 6), bearing in mind that soft callus formation starts about 2 weeks after fracture (Keita & Perren, 2017).|$|E
30|$|Cervical laminoplasty {{was first}} {{described}} by Oyama et al. in the 1970 s {{with the intent}} of overcoming the limitations of a standard laminectomy procedure. Recurrence of compression on the spinal cord, post-laminectomy instability and kyphosis are well-known complications of laminectomy in the cervical spine [10 – 12]. Supplementation of laminectomy with a fusion can prevent development of post-laminectomy instability but at the cost of increased rates of adjacent segment degeneration and higher rates of complications related to implant malpositioning [13 – 15]. Moreover, treatment of CSM in younger patients represents a particular challenge in view of the importance of motion preservation in this particular subgroup of patients. Cervical laminoplasty is a technique designed to allow multiple level posterior decompression of the spinal canal while maintaining spinal alignment and stability through preservation of the posterior elements. Many different laminoplasty techniques have been described but they all share the same principle of achieving decompression of a stenotic spinal canal through the expansion of the posterior arch, the conservation of the posterior elements, and preservation of segmental motion. The techniques can be broadly divided into unilateral hinge, z-laminoplasty, and bilateral hinges (i.e., French-door laminoplasty or two <b>lateral</b> <b>hinges</b> with intact spinous processes). The fundamental aim of all these techniques is to achieve and maintain an expanded spinal canal while preserving motion and alignment of the cervical spine.|$|R
30|$|During {{the static}} loading to failure test, the average {{ultimate}} {{force of the}} Activmotion prior to fracture of the <b>lateral</b> cortical <b>hinge</b> was 8.2 kN, a value which is higher compared to the average values from our previous studies, namely 5.5 kN, 5.3 kN, 4.4 kN, 3.6 kN and 3.4 kN for the iBalance, the TomoFix std., the PEEKPower, the Contour Lock and the TomoFix sm group respectively. Hence, the size 2 Activmotion was superior regarding the static force. The iBalance implant showed the smallest mean lateral displacement (1.9  mm) compared to the Activmotion plates, with a lateral displacement of 3, 8  mm.|$|R
30|$|Stiffness {{has been}} {{introduced}} into this study as an additional damage indicator; furthermore, a high stiffness of the lateral side of the bone-implant construct suggests a stable <b>lateral</b> cortical <b>hinge.</b> The size 2 Activmotion plate showed the highest lateral stiffness (4763  N/mm) {{compared to the other}} implants. It is important to highlight at this level the anterior medial positioning of the Activmotion plate, which is different to the positioning of all the other implants investigated in the present study, which are all centred on the medial side of the proximal tibia. Blecha et al. (Blecha et al., 2005) investigated the plate positioning by means of finite element method and reported that MOWHTO with medial plate position supports smaller loading than MOWHTO with anteromedial plate position.|$|R
40|$|Purpose Opening wedge high tibial {{osteotomy}} (HTO) is {{an accepted}} treatment option for medial compartment knee osteoarthritis with associated varus lower limb axis in younger, more active patients. A {{concern with the}} use of this technique is that posterior tibial slope (PTS) and tibial rotation can be altered. We hypothesized that {{there is a tendency to}} increase the PTS and internal rotation of the distal tibia during the procedure and that certain intra-operative parameters may influence the amount of change that can be expected. Methods A cadaveric model and surgical navigation system were used to evaluate the influence of certain intra-operative factors of the degree of PTS and tibial rotation change observed during medial opening HTO. Parameters evaluated included: degree of osteotomy opening, knee flexion angle, location of limb support (thigh versus foot), performance of a posteromedial release, the status of the <b>lateral</b> cortical <b>hinge,</b> and the degree of osteoarthritis present in the knee. Results Combining measurements of all specimens and parameters, a mean PTS increase of 2. 7 ° ± 3. 9 ° and a mean tibial internal rotation of 1. 5 ° ± 2. 9 ° were observed. Clinically, significant changes in tibial slope (> 2 °) occurred in 50. 4 % of corrections, while significant changes in tibial rotation (> 5 °) occurred in only 11. 9 % of corrections. Patients with significant osteoarthritis and concomitant flexion contracture, cases where large corrections were required, and procedures in which the <b>lateral</b> cortical <b>hinge</b> was disrupted were associated with increased PTS change. The other factors evaluated did not exert a significant influence of the degree of PTS change observed. Conclusions Surgeons should be vigilant for possible PTS change, particularly in high-risk situations as outlined above. Routine use of an intra-operative measure of PTS is recommended to avoid inadvertent slope change...|$|R
30|$|After wedge removal, the resected wedge is {{inspected}} for completeness as remaining bone fragments {{may cause}} incomplete closure and fracture of the medial cortical hinge during closure. If this is found, additional bone removal and {{weakening of the}} hinge (with help of a special bone impaction instrument—a blunt chisel) are then indicated. Closure of the wedge must be performed gradually and with a gentle valgus force. It may take several minutes to enable plastic deformation of the medial cortex to close the osteotomy gap. It {{should be noted that}} the medial cortex of the distal femur in general is weaker and the hinge point of the osteotomy will fracture more often as compared to the <b>lateral</b> cortex <b>hinge</b> point in a medial closing-wedge osteotomy. An intact medial cortex after osteotomy closure provides for higher axial and rotational stability.|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionValgus tibial {{osteotomy}} (VTO) is {{a well-known}} procedure {{for the treatment of}} medial compartment femoro-tibial osteoarthritis. Good and very good results have been reported with calcium phosphate wedges, which avoid the inconveniences of autologous grafts use. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} with equivalent results in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, the use of calcium phosphate wedges (BMCaPh) to fill the bone defect created by osteotomy would result in fewer specific complications and less pain associated with autologous grafts (AUTO) harvesting. Patients and methodsThis prospective, controlled, randomised study included one arm that received a macroporous, biphasic calcium phosphate wedge (BMCaPh group) and one arm that received an autologous tricortical graft (AUTO group) for filling. The same plate with locked screws was used for fixation in all cases. All patients underwent at least two years of clinical and radiographic post-operative follow-up. ResultsForty patients were included. Loss of correction occurred in six of the twenty-two patients in the BMCaPh group (27 %), resulting in three early surgical revisions, compared to one loss of correction in the AUTO group. <b>Lateral</b> cortical <b>hinge</b> tears were a risk factor for loss of correction for the entire cohort and in the BMCaPh group. (relative risk 13. 3 [1. 9 – 92]. Moreover, union took significantly longer and pain lasted significantly longer in the BMCaPh group, although results were comparable at 6  months. DiscussionA significant number of undesirable events (loss of correction) occurred in this study, limiting the number of included patients. Nevertheless, the results show that although there was no difference in the two groups for overall complications, number of revisions all causes combined, or clinical results, filling with BMCaPh was less tolerated and increased the risk of loss of correction when local mechanical conditions of the knee were unfavourable (<b>lateral</b> cortical <b>hinge</b> tears). Moreover, although it is not possible to draw a conclusion because of methodology bias in this study, early weight-bearing resumption on the knee also seemed to favour these complications.

3000|$|Valgus-producing high tibial {{osteotomy}} {{is recognized}} as an effective surgical procedure {{for the treatment of}} unicompartmental osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee in the presence of axial malalignment in active patients. Precise preoperative planning (Pape et al. 2004 a, 2004 b) and a high primary stability of the implant-bone-construct are required for a good result. An intact <b>lateral</b> cortical <b>hinge</b> is important for the stability of an opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) because fractures have been reported to cause loss of correction and poor clinical results (Agneskirchner et al. 2006; Stoffel et al. 2004; van Raaij et al. 2008; Türkmen et al. 2016; Jo et al. 2017). In order to prevent the fracture of the medial cortical hinge while performing closing wedge high tibial osteotomy (CWHTO), Kessler et al. terminated the osteotomy cut with a 5 -mm diameter bored hole in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction; which allowed a significant increase of the correction angle compared with the same osteotomy without a drill hole (Kessler et al. 2002). The present study aimed to investigate mechanically the effect of such a potentially stress relieving drill hole in the AP direction {{at the end of the}} horizontal osteotomy cut while performing an OWHTO by comparing the static strength of the lateral cortical bone in cases of osteotomies with or without a drill hole. Two approaches were used to achieve this objective: (1) Assessing the static strength using local stresses following the ideas of the FKM guidelines “Analytical Strength Assessment of Components”, commonly known as the FKM guidelines (Rennert et al. 2012), and (2) limiting the total strain to the elongation at break during the opening of the osteotomy wedge. FKM is an abbreviation of the german expression [...] "Forschungskuratorium Maschinenbau" [...] (Rennert et al. 2012). The first approach was designated “FKM approach” and the second “strain approach”. Both approaches rely on non-linear finite element analyses. The assessment was based on crack initiation only, hence complete rupture and dislocation was not investigated here. To our knowledge, no study investigated so far the mechanical effect of a drill hole in medial HTO. Does a drill hole at the end of the osteotomy cut increase the correction angle without fracture of the <b>lateral</b> cortical <b>hinge</b> in high tibial osteotomy? It was hypothesised that in spite of drilling a hole and significant stress relief crack initiation takes place between 2 and 5 ° depending on the bone ductility.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} develop and assess biomechanical methods {{to assist in the}} {{evaluation}} of medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO). Five studies using diverse methods were performed, including three-dimensional (3 D) gait analysis, materials testing of HTO fixation plates, and dynamic radiography in patients after surgery. Study 1 compared external knee joint moments during walking before and after varus or valgus producing osteotomy in patients with lateral or medial compartment osteoarthritis, and in healthy participants. The results highlighted the importance of alignment on gait biomechanics with changes in frontal plane angular impulse highly correlated to changes in mechanical axis. Study 2 compared the 3 D external knee moments before and after medial opening wedge HTO during level walking and during stair ascent. Long-term changes in knee moments after HTO were observed during both activities, with decreases in the peak knee adduction and internal rotation moments. Study 3 developed and tested a multi-axis fixation jig placed within a materials testing machine for assessing HTO fixation plates in a manner more representative of walking. The need to incorporate gait data into materials testing studies was highlighted, showing the importance of including a frontal plane moment during testing. Study 4 used this multi-axis fixation jig to compare flat to toothed HTO fixation plates under cyclic loading conditions. Preliminary results suggested little difference in the load at failure between the plates; however, the potential for the tooth to increase micro-motion across the osteotomy site and strain on the <b>lateral</b> cortical <b>hinge</b> should be a focus of future testing. Study 5 was a proof-of-concept study to test dynamic single-plane flat-panel (FP) radiography for use in detecting in-vivo micro-motion after medial opening wedge HTO. Preliminary results suggested dynamic FP radiography has the potential to assess fixation stability; however, results also suggested modifications in the registration algorithms may be required to increase confidence in distinguishing true motion from registration error. Overall, this thesis demonstrates that a mix of biomechanical methods can be used to advance medial opening wedge HTO, with particular focus on informing future methods of investigation to improve HTO fixation designs...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionOsteotomy of the {{anterior}} tibial tubercle (TT) {{is well known}} as the approach to difficult knees, in particular those with a low patella, {{but it has a}} poor reputation. Patients and methodsThis technique was used 21 times in 20 patients (10  males and 10  females) {{with a mean age of}} 71 years (range, 42 – 90 years) for 14 prosthesis revisions (three for septic loosening, 11 for aseptic loosening) and seven knees that had not anteriorly received prior implants (three osteotomies, one synovectomy). The surgical technique included a long (7 cm), thick (> 1 cm) fragment retaining its <b>lateral</b> muscle <b>hinge</b> with compression fixation using two screws. In cases with a low patella, the TT was proximally displaced, with amplitude limited by the tibial baseplate. Follow-up was clinical and radiological, lasting a mean 54 months (range, 8 – 195 months). The clinical results were assessed using the IKS score and the radiological results using the measurement of the patellar index according to the protocol described during the Lyon Knee Days. ResultsThe mean preoperative IKS scores were: knee, 57. 5 ± 22. 4; function, 42. 6 ± 21. 5 (total, 100 ± 33. 9); postoperative scores: knee, 84 ± 11. 6; function 65 ± 28 (total, 149 ± 32. 9). The joint range of motion increased from 73 ± 34. 9 to 88 ± 21. 1 for a mean gain of 15 ± 23. 1. We found a traumatic nondisplaced tibia fracture around a tibial stem, treated conservatively, two stress fractures of the immediate proximal part overhanging the TT with no consequences, one case of stiffness (not related to the osteotomy), and one case of localized skin necrosis on a knee that had undergone several surgeries (secondary scarring). No cases of malunion or migration of the TT were noted. The mean deliberate proximal migration obtained was 13 mm± 6 (range, 8 – 33 mm). The patellar index increased from 0. 18 ± 0. 20 (range, − 0. 39 to 0. 57) to 0. 33 ± 0. 19 (range, − 0. 13 to 0. 60). DiscussionThis series shows that the indications are rare but invaluable, facilitating the approach and most particularly making it possible to modify the position of the patella, thus contributing to increasing the joint range of motion. Fixation with two screws carries no risk of disassembly if the technique is rigorous. Patellar translation is limited by the tibial tray. Type of studylevel 4, retrospective study...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The opening wedge {{approach}} to high tibial osteotomy (HTO) {{is perceived to}} have some advantages relative to the closing wedge approach {{but it may be}} associated with delayed and nonunions. Because nonunions evolve over months, it would be advantageous to be able to identify risk factors for and early predictors of nonunion after medial opening wedge HTO. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We sought to determine whether (1) preoperatively identifiable patient factors, including tobacco use, body mass index > 30 kg/m(2), and degree of correction, are associated with nonunion, and (2) a modified Radiographic Union Score for Tibial Fractures (RUST) score, taken at 6 weeks and 3 months, would be predictive for delayed or nonunion after medial opening wedge HTO. METHODS: The medical records and radiographs of 185 patients, 21 bilateral cases, treated with a medial open wedge HTO using the TomoFix((R)) device were retrospectively evaluated. For all patients, demographic data regarding risk factors were collected from their records. Diagnosis for delayed or nonunion was already done earlier for standard medical care by the orthopaedic surgeon based on clinical and radiographic grounds. For the retrospective radiographic evaluation, a modified RUST score was used in which each tibial cortex is scored by one observer. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify preoperative and postoperative predictive factors for developing delayed or nonunion. In the series, a total of 19 patients (9. 2 %) developed clinically delayed/nonunion of whom 10 patients (4. 9 %) developed a nonunion. RESULTS: Smoking was identified as a risk factor for developing delayed/nonunion (19 % for smokers versus 5. 4 % for nonsmokers; p = 0. 005; odds ratio, 4. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 5 - 10. 7). By contrast, body mass index, <b>lateral</b> cortical <b>hinge</b> fracture, age, infection, and degree of correction were not risk factors. Patients with delayed/nonunion had lower RUST scores at all time points when a radiograph was taken compared with the total study group. CONCLUSIONS: The RUST score at 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery and the use of tobacco were identified as predictive factors for development of delayed union and nonunion after open wedge HTO. Based on these results, we now actively try to stop patients from smoking and these data are helpful in doing that. The RUST score may be of use to identify which patients are at risk for developing a delayed union so that interventions may be offered earlier in the course of care.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide a correct {{aerodynamic}} simulation of a vehicle travelling along the ground, models are tested using rotating wheels in a wind tunnel with a moving ground. In {{the most common of}} moving ground configurations the model is supported by an overhead strut, usually designed as an aerofoil profile to minimise interference, with the wheels supported by <b>lateral</b> stings <b>hinged</b> to mounts outside the span of the moving ground plane. ๒ using this type of configuration it is assumed that the presence of the intruding supports do not markedly affect the aerodynamic behaviour of the model, but this assumption is not always valid. In order to quantify interference effects from model supports, a range of models were tested over a stationary ground plane mounted to an under floor balance. Each model was tested with and without mock struts and stings, which do not actually support the model. Comparisons were made between configurations with and without the mock supports in order to quantify their aerodynamic effects and investigate any changes in flow structure. Force and moment measurements show significant effects on both drag (up to 25 counts / 7 % of total drag) and lift (up to 170 counts) due to a vertical strut for all vehicle types. Motor Sport models, whose performance relies greatly on the underside flow, are largely affected (26 counts / 3 % on drag and up to 250 counts on lift) by the presence of lateral stings. Passenger vehicle models with larger ride heights were not as sensitive to the use of stings. Further investigation into the flow mechanisms that create these effects were carried out in the form of pressure and velocity measurements in the model and support wakes, surface oil flow visualisations, and surface static pressure readings. Results showed that the strut wake impinged on the rear wings of the motor sport vehicle models and the backlight of the passenger vehicle models as expected, but its influence was more wide ranging than this, extending to the model under floor. To explore changes in flow structure local to the strut-model junction, the junction is simplified as an aerofoil intersecting a flat plate and modelled in Fluent. Comparisons were made between configurations with and without the presence of six different aerofoil profiles for four different boundary layer thicknesses. Results found a noticeable interference on the plate from the union of the aerofoil, but showed that when the magnitude of the interference effect was recalculated using model frontal area the portion of the interference local to the junction affecting the model was small and in some cases insignificant. It was determined that deficiencies {{in the wake of the}} supports and their complex interference flow fields were creating a much greater amount of the overall effect by interfering with vehicle features downstream. Due to the complexity of interactions between struts, stings, and the model, the effect of combining them for a common moving ground configuration was highly vehicle dependent, precluding the possibility of developing a reliable correction for interference effects. The results do, however, lead to suggestions for support-model coupling methods that minimise the magnitude of the effect and offer guidelines for the expected magnitudes of effects for the different vehicle types and struts tested.
