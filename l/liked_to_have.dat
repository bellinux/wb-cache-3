His father Angelo Lavelli was a {{blacksmith}} who made shoes for horses on nearby farms. As a child, he practiced catching by throwing baseballs against walls and trying to catch them when they bounced back. He <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> friends throw ping-pong balls at him {{to see if he could}} catch them.|$|E
5|$|Barrel Roll {{was one of}} {{the most}} closely held secrets and one of the most unknown {{components}} of the American military commitment in Southeast Asia. Due to the ostensible neutrality of Laos, guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954 and 1962, both the U.S. and North Vietnam strove to maintain the secrecy of their operations and only slowly escalated military actions there. As much as both parties would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> publicized their enemy's own alleged violation of the accords, both had more to gain by keeping their own roles quiet. Regardless, by the end of the conflict in 1975, Laos emerged from nine years of war just as devastated as any of the other Asian participants in the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|The post-Taylor {{capacity}} of Highbury {{was limited to}} 38,419, while Arsenal's success during the 1990s and 2000s meant that virtually every home match was filled to near capacity. Restrictions, such as the East Stand's status as a listed building and the fact the stadium was surrounded on all sides by a residential area, made any future expansion of Highbury difficult and expensive, although the club's directors would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> kept Arsenal at a modernized and expanded Highbury. In October 1998, just after Arsenal started playing Champions League games at Wembley, the club made an unsuccessful bid to buy the stadium and make it their permanent home {{to share with the}} England national football team, although at the time Wembley was two years away from closure for a redevelopment which was not completed until more than six years later.|$|E

5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings {{and the fact that the}} deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you look at what we paid it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E

The minimum economic cost is the main consideration in bus dispatching when considering as a country. When there is a mechanism to find out an average headway for a route for a day considering above four factors and economic cost to the country while satisfying all parties involved, then regulators can apply that mechanism to decide average headways on a route. As a mechanism of finding average headway for a route for a day, an improved dispatching process was introduced in this study to find out the average headway considering the financial costs, economic costs, overloading and crew deployment hours involved in bus dispatching.

25|$|The album's {{front cover}} {{is taken from}} {{photographer}} Peter Sutherland's Sightings series. Sutherland has described his photograph as being a chance encounter with a wild fox that momentarily stopped and stared straight into his lens {{while he was in}} the back garden at a friend's wedding party. Lacey acknowledged that the decision to use Sutherland's fox photograph reflected a running theme of darkness and nature that had subconsciously crept into the album. Additional photographs were provided by Alexa Lambros and Accardi, while Lacey worked with Jason Noto of Morning Breath Inc. on the packaging and layout of the album. Due to an increased popularity in vinyl, the band's label rush released production of the vinyl, leaving the band out of the process - with Lacey later commenting that he would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> made the release differ from the CD version.|$|E
25|$|Inge King (née Ingeborg Viktoria Neufeld) {{was born}} in Berlin on 26 November 1915, the {{youngest}} of four girls in a well-to-do Jewish family. Her early childhood was typical one for a child of her class and time in a European city. But after World War I, conditions in Germany became increasingly difficult. The period of the Weimar Republic (1918–1933), though a culturally stimulating time, was never stable. Conditions were made more difficult by the hyper-inflation of the early 1920s and the depression of 1929. During that time, things became increasingly difficult for the Neufeld family. By the time King's father died in 1930, when she was 14, the family had lost most of its money. Her older sisters supported her to stay at school until she finished, in 1932, which enabled her {{to get a good}} education. She would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> gone on to university, possibly to study medicine, but, financially, that was out of the question.|$|E
