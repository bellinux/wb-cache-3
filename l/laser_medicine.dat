The gradual attenuation of laser beam is required in many laser systems and applications: LADAR, LIDAR, beam stirrers, etc. Photo-Thermo-Refractive Glass allows achieving high diffraction efficiency above 95 % combined with low optical losses and high value of laser induced threshhold. High efficient diffractive filters have been recorded for visible and near IR region. Gradual attenuation of incident light {{for more than one}} order of magnitude was achieved without beam profile distortions. Spectral selectivity of those filters is less than 0. 5 nm. Thus, the robust and compact adjustable filters based on three-dimensional Bragg grating recorded in PTR glass are created. Such filter could serve not only as adjustable filter but as a narrow-band filter as well. 1...|$|R

Advantages of holographic filters in inorganic glass for laser power attenuation are discussed. © 2003 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (230. 1480) Bragg reflectors, (050. 7330) Volume holographic gratings Bragg gratings are the key components in various optical systems applied in optical communication, <b>lasers,</b> <b>medicine,</b> aerospace, etc., because of their high spectral selectivity. To realize all advantages of volume holograms, {{it is necessary to}} use the materials allowing an achievement of high diffraction efficiency coupled with low optical losses. These properties are demonstrated in optical fibers where Bragg gratings are used for the multiplexing of closely spaced spectral channels (DWDM technology). They are fabricated by the UV irradiation of fiber through a phase mask or by interference patterns [1]. However, this process requires large dosage of UV irradiation, and it is restricted by one-dimensional geometry. The advantages of Bragg gratings recorded in photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass are very low dosage of UV exposure in the range of hundreds of millijoules, real three-dimensional geometry of grating, very high stability, i. e...|$|R

40|$|The present master thesis {{addresses}} two {{topics in}} <b>lasers</b> in <b>medicine.</b> Chapter 1 gives a short introduction {{into the field}} {{of the use of}} <b>lasers</b> in <b>medicine,</b> with emphasis on the basics of light propagation in tissue. Chapter 2 discusses the possibilities and problems of using an infrared diode-laser to coagulate a dye-enhanced solder to join cartilage tissue. Up to now only a few research groups have attempted to solder cartilage by using a laser. Articular cartilage is a complex tissue, that once damaged, has little capacity for permanent repair. The goal {{of the study was to}} evaluate the influence of laser parameters and solder ingredients on the tensile strength and the thermally induced cartilage damage of a bond between cartilage and an implant. The implant consisted either of native articular cartilage or of artificial cartilage made of collagen fibers. Chapter 3 finally focusses on the use of a pulsed Er:YAG (erbium doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser for ablation and cutting of calcified tissue. Removal of calcified tissue, especially aortic valve replacement is generally accomplished by a major surgical procedure. To lessen the costs and to iv reduce the implications such a major surgery has on the patient, an endovas-cular procedure for valve replacement provides an alternative to open heart surgery. The presented work was intended to evaluate the feasibility of cut-ting calcified heart valves with an Er:YAG laser in view of an endovascular procedure...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Laser</b> medicine: <b>medicine</b> and {{especially}} dentistry have found many new uses for diode lasers. The shrinking size {{and cost of}} the units and their increasing user friendliness makes them very attractive to clinicians for minor soft tissue procedures. Diode wavelengths range from 810 [...] to 1,100 nm, are poorly absorbed by soft tissue, and are not used for cutting or ablation. Soft tissue is not cut by the laser’s beam, but is instead cut by contact with a hot charred glass tip. The laser’s irradiation is highly absorbed at the distal end of the tip and heats it up to 500°C to 900°C. [...] Because the tip is so hot, {{it can be used}} to cut soft-tissue and can cause hemostasis through cauterization and carbonization. Diode lasers when used on soft tissue can cause extensive collateral thermal damage to surrounding tissue.|$|R
