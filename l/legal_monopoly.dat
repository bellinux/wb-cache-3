25|$|During World War I era, the UGT {{followed}} a tactical line of close relationship and unity of action with the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT, National Labour Confederation). This era {{came to a}} sudden end {{with the advent of}} the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, who gave a <b>legal</b> <b>monopoly</b> on labor organizing to his own government-sponsored union. While the CNT opted for a radical confrontation with the regime, and were prohibited on this account, the UGT, although in disagreement with the dictatorship, adopted a collaborative attitude in order to continue to operate legally. The radicalization during the period of the Second Spanish Republic of the wing led by Francisco Largo Caballero, when the UGT surpassed a million members, and the bloody breakout of the Spanish Civil War deepened the internal fissures that resulted in the departure of Largo Caballero from the position of UGT secretary general in 1937.|$|E

50|$|Jurisdictions have {{at various}} times imposed <b>legal</b> <b>monopolies</b> on various commodities, {{including}} salt, iron and tobacco. The Statute of Monopolies of 1623 was an early step in an English movement to convert letters patent from a method of rewarding royal favourites at other than royal expense, to a method of encouraging inventors.|$|R
25|$|In the {{economic}} and technological circumstances of the time such an entrepôt (or to use the Dutch term: stapelmarkt) fulfilled important functions. The word has connotations of a duty-free port, but in an economic sense, a stapelmarkt {{was a place where}} commodities were temporarily physically stocked for future reexport. This was viable because of a <b>legal</b> <b>monopoly</b> for stockpiling a single commodity (wool), granted by a political ruler (like the staple ports designated by the kings of England in medieval times), but also more generally because of technical and economic reasons that still give certain advantages to a spoke-hub distribution paradigm. An important ancillary function of such a physical stock of commodities is that it makes it easier for merchants to even out supply fluctuations, and hence to control price gyrations in thin and volatile markets. Finally, where a physical market forms, market information can more easily be gathered. This was actually the most important economic function of a stapelmarkt in the primitive circumstances of the late 16th century.|$|E

500|$|Trade {{through the}} East Indies was a vital {{component}} of the economy of Great Britain during the late eighteenth century. The East India Company, which maintained trading ports throughout the region, most notably in British India at Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta, had a <b>legal</b> <b>monopoly</b> on the trade. The bulk of this was carried on large merchant ships known as East Indiamen, which had burthens between 500 and 1200 tons (bm), and carried up to 36 cannon. Due to their size and weaponry they could be mistaken for ships of the line, standard large warships of the period, a deception usually augmented by paintwork and dummy cannon. Despite their appearance however they could not fight off an enemy frigate or ship of the line as their guns were lighter in weight and weight of shot than those of similarly-sized warships, and their crew smaller and less well trained than those on a naval ship, and largely composed of lascars.|$|E

500|$|According to a {{story by}} Procopius, {{it was not until}} 552 CE that the Byzantine emperor Justinian {{obtained}} the first silkworm eggs. He had sent two Nestorian monks to Central Asia, {{and they were able to}} smuggle silkworm eggs to him hidden in rods of bamboo. While under the monks' care, the eggs hatched, though they did not cocoon before arrival. The church manufacture in the Byzantine Empire was thus able to make fabrics for the emperor, with the intention of developing a large silk industry in the Eastern Roman Empire, using techniques learned from the Sassanids. These gynecia had a <b>legal</b> <b>monopoly</b> on the fabric, but the empire continued to import silk from other major urban centres on the Mediterranean. The magnificence of the Byzantine techniques was not a result of the manufacturing process, but instead of the meticulous attention paid to the execution and decorations. The weaving techniques they used were taken from Egypt. The first diagrams of semple looms appeared [...] in the 5th century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exclusive}} {{privilege of}} a guild to produce certain goods or provide certain services was similar in spirit and character {{with the original}} patent systems that surfaced in England in 1624.

2500|$|The Patriots, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Henry Grattan, had been greatly strengthened by the American Revolution and demanded more and more self-rule. The so-called [...] "Grattan's Parliament" [...] forced the reversal of the mercantilist prohibitions against trade with other British colonies. The king and his cabinet in London could not risk another revolution on the American model, so they made a series of concessions to the Patriot faction in Dublin. Mostly Protestant [...] "Volunteer" [...] units of armed men were set up to protect against the possibility of an invasion from France. [...] As happened in America, in Ireland the king no longer had a <b>legal</b> <b>monopoly</b> of violence.|$|E
50|$|Merchants grew {{increasingly}} powerful during this period. Wealthy merchant houses arose to organize distributors and hold <b>legal</b> <b>monopolies.</b> As their wealth grew, merchants wanted to consume and display their {{wealth in the}} same manner as the samurai, but laws prevented them from doing so overtly. Still, their consumption combined with that of the samurai served to reinforce the growth of the merchant and artisan classes.|$|R
40|$|When {{considering}} the proper {{scope of the}} U. S. <b>legal</b> profession’s <b>monopoly,</b> regulators and commentators may find it useful to compare {{the scope of the}} U. S. <b>monopoly</b> with the <b>legal</b> profession <b>monopolies</b> found in other countries. This Article surveys what we know—and do not know—about the scope of the monopoly in countries other than the United States. The Article finds that the state of knowledge on this topic is relatively undeveloped, that the scope of the U. S. <b>legal</b> profession’s <b>monopoly</b> appears to be larger than the scope of the monopoly found in some other countries, but that the “conventional wisdom” may be incorrect with respect to the scope of the <b>legal</b> profession’s <b>monopoly</b> outside of the United States. It discusses some relatively new developments that may contribute to our knowledge in this area, including reports from the World Trade Organization, the European Union, and the International Bar Association. It also suggests that relatively new organizations, such as the International Conference of Legal Regulators and the International Association of Legal Ethics, might contribute to our knowledge about legal regulation around the world...|$|R

2500|$|As {{doctors and}} medical {{associations}} {{pushed for a}} <b>legal</b> <b>monopoly</b> on obstetrical care, midwifery became outlawed or heavily regulated throughout the United States and Canada. Despite accusations that midwives were [...] "incompetent and ignorant", some argued that poorly trained surgeons were far more of a danger to pregnant women. The argument that surgeons were more dangerous than midwives lasted until the study of bacteriology became popular in the early 1900s. Women began to feel safer {{in the setting of}} the hospitals with the amount of aid and the ease of birth that they experienced with doctors. “Physicians trained in the new century found a great contrast between their hospital and obstetrics practice in women’s homes where they could not maintain sterile conditions or have trained help.” German social scientists Gunnar Heinsohn and Otto Steiger theorize that midwifery became a target of persecution and repression by public authorities because midwives possessed highly specialized knowledge and skills regarding not only assisting birth, but also contraception and abortion.|$|E

50|$|In a {{case history}} of England, Marx {{described}} how the serfs became free peasant proprietors and small farmers, who were, over time, forcibly expropriated and driven off the land, forming a property-less proletariat. He also claimed {{that more and}} more legislation was enacted by the state to control and regiment this new class of wage workers. In the meantime, the remaining farmers became capitalist farmers operating more and more on a commercial basis; and gradually, <b>legal</b> <b>monopolies</b> preventing trade and investment by entrepreneurs were broken up.|$|R

50|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>{{monopolies}}</b> {{on alcohol}} remain commonplace, {{both as a}} source of public revenue and as a means of control, and the monopolies on opium and cocaine, formerly important for revenue, were converted or reinstituted during the twentieth century to curb the abuse of controlled substances. For example, Mallinckrodt Incorporated is the only legal supplier of cocaine in the United States. The regulation of gambling in many places includes an official monopoly national lottery or state lottery. Where private operation is allowed, for example in horse racing, off-track betting and casinos, the authorities may license only one operator.|$|R

40|$|Optimal price {{regulation}} for natural and <b>legal</b> <b>monopolies</b> is an impossible task. The still difficult. task of good {{price regulation}} can be systematized by considering separately price level and price {{structure of the}} regulated firm. Various methods of price level and price structure regulation are evaluated and then considered for the regulation of electricity transmission, both {{in the context of}} an independent transmission company and of vertical integration between transmission and most of the generation capacity. The regulatory approach suggested uses price caps defined on two-part tariffs. This way, flexibility for short-term capacity utilization can be combined with incentives for investments in new transmission capacity. ...|$|R
40|$|Spain is {{the only}} large European country in which airport {{management}} is strictly centralized and publicly owned. This peculiar institutional setting prevents competition among Spanish airports, and policy makers and bureaucrats {{in charge of the}} system regularly justify it on grounds of interterritorial solidarity. This paper tests whether allocation of investments in airports is effectively based on redistributive purposes, as claimed and looks at other factors to explain such allocation. Our empirical analysis suggests that neither a progressive redistribution target nor the scale economies criterion explain allocation decisions. Instead, we find that political factors have significant influence on the allocation decisions made by the government.

50|$|In some cases, authors can {{be granted}} limited <b>legal</b> <b>monopolies</b> on {{the manner in}} which certain works are expressed. This is known colloquially as copyright, {{although}} the term intellectual property is used mistakenly in place of copyright. Copyright law regulating the aforementioned monopolies generally does not cover the actual ideas. The law does not bestow the legal status of property upon ideas per se. Instead, laws purport to regulate events related to the usage, copying, production, sale and other forms of exploitation of the fundamental expression of a work, {{that may or may not}} carry ideas. Copyright law is fundamentally different from patent law in this respect: patents do grant monopolies on ideas (more on this below).|$|R
