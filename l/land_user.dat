It is widely acknowledged in the scholarly debate and in practice of flood risk management that traditional flood protection measures such as dikes need to be complemented with measures to increase the resilience of cities. For cities to become flood-resilient, actions by <b>land</b> <b>users</b> (and homeowners) are required. Currently, <b>land</b> <b>users</b> insufficiently implement measures to mitigate flood-induced damages. Reasons for this include the lack of knowledge about potential measures and the benefits as well as lack of tailored information on flood risk. In this paper, a tool is discussed that addresses these two issues: the German Flood Label for buildings (Hochwasserpass). It is discussed how such a tool can create awareness by <b>land</b> <b>users</b> and how it can trigger the realization of precautionary damage mitigation measures. It will then be discussed how such a tool needs to be embedded in a strategic governance arrangement between <b>land</b> <b>users,</b> water authorities and insurance companies to ultimately achieve flood-resilient cities...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to clarify how the rural {{decision}} making process operates in New Zealand. This will be achieved by investigating the formal legislative restraints that <b>land</b> <b>users</b> have to adhere to and by examining the informal links that exist between the rural institutions and the land managers (eg financial, consultancy links). To investigate these formal and informal links it has been necessary to study a major land use issue. The issue selected for the study was land preservation. By using land preservation it has been possible to demonstrate how Government agencies are able to compel <b>land</b> <b>users</b> to adopt environmental land use guidelines and how private institutions are able to use negotiation to get <b>land</b> <b>users</b> to accept their land management advice. The {{research has found that}} New Zealand has a complex rural decision making framework. Unlike many overseas countries the Government can not simply impose new land use guidelines. Government agencies have to negotiate with <b>land</b> <b>users</b> before they attempt to introduce new land preservation/land management practices.

40|$|There {{have been}} few {{attempts}} to develop, test or apply sustainability indicators for natural resource management at a farm-level, and even fewer have fully consulted land users from the initiation of this process. While environmental sustainability indicators need to be accurate and reliable, land users also need them to be rapid, cost-effective and easy to use, {{in addition to being}} linked to management objectives such that they can be targeted at community empowerment and sustainable natural resource management. In order to develop farm-level sustainability indicators that meet these criteria, a framework for participatory indicator development has been constructed that integrates <b>land</b> <b>user</b> knowledge with biogeographical information. Integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches incorporating biogeographical evaluation of <b>land</b> <b>user</b> indicators in the context of initial livelihoods analyses may lead to a more concise and useable list of the most effective indicators. Case study material shows that Kalahari pastoralists in South West Botswana use over eighty sustainability indicators for natural resource management. However, indicator knowledge is sparsely dispersed and varies between different social groups in the community, and consequently there is little consensus over which are most effective. Dissemination of sustainability indicator information is proposed through the distribution of rangeland evaluation guidebooks through the Ministry of Agriculture that integrate participatory rangeland condition assessment with management strategy advice. In this way, {{it may be possible to}} empower communities to effectively monitor and respond to rangeland degradation to enhance the sustainability of natural resource management.

30|$|Africa {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the Fire Continent, and fire is recognised as a natural factor of the environment due to the prevalence of lightning storms and an ideal fire climate in the less arid regions with seasonal drought. On a global scale, the most extensive areas of tropical savanna, characterized by grassy under stories that become extremely flammable during the dry season, occur in Africa. The use of fire in Africa to manage vegetation for domestic livestock and indigenous wildlife is widely recognized by both commercial and communal <b>land</b> <b>users.</b> Research on the effects of fire has been conducted throughout the grassland and savanna areas since the early twentieth century, resulting in the development of effective and practical guidelines for prescribed burning for domestic livestock and wildlife management systems. Generally, the reasons for prescribed burning in Africa are similar for both commercial and communal <b>land</b> <b>users,</b> namely, to remove moribund and or unacceptable plant material and to control the encroachment of undesirable plants negatively affecting domestic livestock and wildlife. In addition, commercial operators use fire to manage wildlife conservation areas. Prescribed burning to control ticks is also widely used in communal communities but is generally not recognised in commercial livestock enterprises. However, research has shown that tick populations can be reduced using fire to alter the micro-habitat for these organisms. Until recently, commercial and communal <b>land</b> <b>users</b> held differing views on the appropriate season for prescribed burning, with the former igniting fires shortly after the first spring rains and the latter burning throughout the dry winter period. Subsequent research has shown that both seasons of burn have similar effects; the key requirement being that the grass sward is dormant at the time of burning to minimise the negative effects on the vegetation. A valuable tentative comparison has been made between fire management practices applied by commercial <b>land</b> <b>users</b> and communal <b>land</b> <b>users,</b> and provides an exciting opportunity for further and essential research to be conducted to gain greater insight into how communal African communities use fire. Based on extensive experience, my aim is to provide a personal perspective on the use of fire by commercial and communal <b>land</b> <b>users</b> for managing rangelands in southern and east African regions of the continent.|$|R

Foreword Food security and the preservation of natural resources count among the prime objectives of German development cooperation. The link between them are soil resources, the basis for plant and animal production. Despite their vital importance for a sustainable agricultural and rural development, soil resources are degrading worldwide at an alarming pace. There are many reasons why soils are overexploited and even destroyed; why farmers and other <b>land</b> <b>users</b> do not undertake adequate and appropriate measures to protect soil resources and maintain soil productivity. One of them is poverty. <b>Land</b> <b>users</b> are apprehensive about the high investment costs necessary, either in form of labour or capital, which show their benefit only in the long run. Because of this, real success stories of sustainable soil management in development projects are rare. <b>Land</b> <b>users</b> often abandon protective measures after the expiration of development projects and the accompanying assistance and encouragement offered by them.

40|$|In many countries, {{authority}} for maintaining records of land ownership lies with national or state institutes, called 'cadastres' or 'land registries'. The emergence of volunteered geographic information (VGI) and crowdsourcing potentially challenges this state based authority, enabling {{the construction of}} 'neo'-cadastres (using the analogy of 'neo'geography). Individual citizens can themselves map and record land tenure rights. This paper explores if and how VGI and crowdsourcing may redefine the state based cadastres and land registries, and the roles of <b>land</b> <b>users</b> who claim <b>land</b> rights outside of the state based institutions. Using theories of institutions and isomorphism we hypothesise that a parallel exists between emerging open systems and situations where no state-based cadastre exists: participants in both situations will position themselves to protect their interests. Three cases from Ghana, Canada, and Indonesia demonstrate how <b>land</b> <b>users</b> indicate their <b>land</b> tenure right boundaries based on personal views (the neo-cadastre), rather than on rules stipulated by a national authority (the traditional cadastre). In each case <b>land</b> <b>users</b> root their behaviour partly in local dependency relations and social advocacy networks. These locally embedded rules may not necessarily coincide with hierarchical institutional relations. Even in participatory adjudication activities conducted {{under the authority of}} national cadastres, <b>land</b> <b>users</b> are not completely free in providing their land boundaries. Instead, they adhere to certain locally embedded microsocial conventions. We conclude that VGI and crowdsourced based neo-cadastres will likely redefine, from passive to active, the roles of <b>land</b> <b>users</b> in cadastres. This creates an opportunity for citizens, but also a potential risk. Where implicit rules of the neo-cadastre do not co-evolve with traditional cadastral institutions, conflicts of land information and access to land may emerge. Neo-cadastres will be an artefact of this dissatisfaction, and may reflect new directions for cadastral institutions. Neo-cadastres will not be a direct trigger for wider cadastral change, but a piece of evidence that change and resistance are occurrin...|$|R
