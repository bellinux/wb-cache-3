40|$|Approximately a {{third of}} the {{population}} of Calcutta live in slums and an estimated 43 % live below the poverty level. This work examines the connections between three types of slums or low income settlements within the metropolitan area and investigates how recent attempts at improving one type, the Calcutta bustees, has affected the urban poor. Bustees are <b>rented</b> rooms in <b>legal,</b> traditionally designed, single storey buildings within the city. Since 1971 a large scale improvement Metropolitan programme has been implemented by the Calcutta Development Authority with the objectives of improving the health and sanitation, as well as the employment prospects, of bustee dwellers. However the bustees occupy valuable urban land in a city of severe shortage. Intra-urban migration, created by the natural increase of bustee tenants, is exacerbated by increasing land prices. Rent control exists but rather than offer protection it appears to be driving the real cost of obtaining accommodation underground, demands for large key money payments and evictions of sitting tenants have been reported. Some bustee landlords are rebuilding their properties into expensive, middle class apartment blocks. This has meant that those who were targeted for help have actually moved out of the area, often to settlements with far worse facilities than the bustees. Some moved to suburban slums far away from their work, while others became illegal squatters in the city close to job opportunities. Poor people are therefore moving out of the city to peripheral, <b>legal,</b> <b>rented</b> slums where there is space - but no employment, infrastructure, or services. As they seek accommodation in the suburbs, rents there are beginning to rise sharply. Suburban residents are suffering from the 'domino effect' of rising costs. They are priced out of the area and join the illegal squatter settlements back in the city.

50|$|From {{the passage}} of the Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997 to the Rent Act of 2011, rent {{stabilization}} was restricted to apartments where the <b>legal,</b> or stabilized, <b>rent</b> was under $2,000 per month.

Based on the authors' long-term and extensive working experience in the APS sectors in the Pearl River Delta, combined with in-depth interviews with senior officers of companies who are APS providers in Hong Kong in 2009, this paper will examine the factors, both tangible and intangible as in institutional and non-institutional, regulatory and non-regulatory, as well as legal, governmental, social and cultural, which affect and resist APS integration between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The {{findings suggest that the}} integration of APS between Hong Kong and Shenzhen has been greatly impeded by unfavourable institutional factors that have overwhelmed locational advantages.

Given the fact that renting a house is also {{under the protection of}} the rental housing from 1 st January 2014, this is a topical topic. The diploma thesis is divided into Introduction, Conclusion and five main chapters, which are further divided into subchapters. The thesis is based on legal regulations and, where necessary, supplemented by case law. In the first chapter I deal with the historical development of rental housing from the period of the Roman Empire through the Middle Ages to the period of the force of the ABGB to the period after 1989. At the beginning of the second chapter I explain the difference between rent and tenure, but the key topic is renting a house and its origination with emphasis on the creation of a house lease under a contract. In the third chapter, I discuss rents, including detailed handling of rental issues, and other payments associated with renting a house, such as housekeeping and security. The fourth chapter is the most extensive and consists of the rights and obligations of the lessee and the lessor arising from the rental relationship. These are, in particular, the most essential and fundamental rights and obligations in the [...] ...|$|R

The topic concerned is the (analysis of the) fundamental rights of minorities. The article starts with a long account of the flaws in the cur- <b>rent</b> <b>legal</b> analysis of the European Court of Human Rights regarding minorities’ rights, particularly the reduction in its analysis and the related failure to properly identify and weigh all relevant interests and variables. This ‘prelude’ pro- vides crucial insights in the causes of the flaws in the Court’s jurisprudence: lack of knowledge (about the relevant inter- ests and variables) and concerns with the Court’s political legitimacy. The article goes on to argue for the need for multi-discipli- nary legal research to tackle the lack of knowledge: more particularly by drawing on sociology (and related social sci- ences) and political philosophy as auxiliary disciplines to identify additional interests and variables for the rights anal- ysis. The ensuing new analytical framework for the analysis of minorities’ rights would benefit international courts (adju- dicating on human rights) generally. To operationalise and refine the new analytical framework, the research should furthermore have regard to the practice of (a selection of) international courts and national case studies...|$|R
500|$|The {{theories}} {{attempted to}} link Druitt with Clarence, Gull and Stephen through {{a network of}} mutual acquaintances and possible connections. Reginald Acland, the brother of Gull's son-in-law, had legal chambers in King's Bench Walk near Druitt's, as did Harry Stephen, who was James Stephen's brother. Harry Stephen was good friends with Harry Wilson, who had a house in Chiswick, [...] "The Osiers", near to where Druitt's body was found. Wilson and James Stephen were close friends of Clarence, and were both members of an exclusive society called the Cambridge Apostles. As a schoolboy, Druitt had played cricket against two of Wilson's friends, Kynaston Studd and Henry Goodhart, who {{was also one of}} the Apostles. Another potential connection between Druitt and Wilson is through John Henry Lonsdale. Lonsdale's name and Blackheath address are written in a diary belonging to Wilson now in the possession of Trinity College, Cambridge. Lonsdale's address is a few yards from the school at which Druitt worked and lived, and Lonsdale had been a barrister and had also <b>rented</b> <b>legal</b> chambers in King's Bench Walk. In 1887, Lonsdale entered the church and was assigned as curate to Wimborne Minster, where the Druitt family worshiped. Lonsdale and Macnaghten were classmates at Eton, and so theorists argue that Lonsdale might have been in a position to provide [...] "private information" [...] to Macnaghten regarding Druitt. The connections between the Apostles and Druitt led to the suggestion that he was part of the same social set. Druitt, his mother, and his sister Georgiana, were invited to a ball in honour of Clarence at the home of Lord Wimborne on 17 December 1888, although they did not attend because by that time Montague was dead, his mother was in an asylum, and his sister was expecting her second child. Clarence, Stephen, Wilson, Studd, and Goodhart are suggested to have been homosexual, although this is contested by historians. John Wilding's 1993 book Jack the Ripper Revealed used the connections between Druitt and Stephen to propose that they committed the crimes together, but reviewers considered it an [...] "imaginative tale... most questionable", an [...] "exercise in ingenuity rather than... fact", and [...] "lack evidential support".|$|R
30|$|The total tax revenues-to-GDP ratio (TAX_Y); {{the public}} debt-to-GDP ratio (BY); the VAT {{efficiency}} index, i.e., {{the ratio of}} the VAT effective tax rate to the standard VAT rate (VEF). And, last but not least, the twin deficits: the Government Deficit to GDP ratio (DEFY) and the Current Account Deficit to GDP ratio (CAY). The first two variables (TAX_Y, BY) are associated with the resources available to IOS in order to finance wages, tax breaks, and maintain and develop the underlying public sector infrastructures. As already mentioned, the insider–outsider society relates to the debt sustainability issue, for it explains chronic public deficits along with relatively low growth. 15 Also, it relates to the “common pool property” of public finances, whereby there is an inherent bias towards higher government spending (lower tax revenues), due to the externality present in the financing of specific government goods and services (tax cuts). 16 This externality is generated by the fact that those that enjoy the benefits of specific government benefits (tax cuts) are fewer and possibly different than those that pay for these benefits (share the cost of no tax cuts, such as with debt financing). And, as a result, there is higher demand for spending (tax cuts). In a way, the insider–outsider society incorporates the common pool problem, as the reason that an outsider does not react to the insider behavior, is also due to the free rider apathy of those that share the cost of insiders’ benefits. VEF {{is a measure of the}} efficiency of the tax collection mechanism, related to tax avoidance, especially of professionals’ groups. Prima facie, VEF has a dual relationship with IOS. Presumably, to the extent that higher efficiency implies more funds for state coffers, it benefits insiders. On the other hand, if tax inefficiencies are brought about by tax avoidance, this may be an indication of tax avoiding professionals. Finally, the inclusion of CAY and DEFY reflect the link between IOS and twin deficits. As emphasized in Kollintzas et al. (2012), the workings of the insider–outsider society explain the “twin deficits” formation, as a consequence of demand-side as well as supply-side effects. The former depend on the dominance of income and wealth effects on consumption and therefore imports, possibly associated with <b>legal</b> and illegal <b>rents</b> of insiders, over general Ricardian-type effects. The latter are associated with rents of insiders that may or may not be associated with the budget deficit. For example, high wages in heavily unionized public sector enterprises directly affect the budget deficit and at the same time drive up cost of intermediate products to the private sector and put upward pressure on private sector wages, as well. And, high fees in regulated professions (e.g., lawyers, engineers, architects, pharmacists, notary publics, certified accountants) drive up production costs in the non-traded and, worst, in the traded goods sectors, jeopardizing the competitiveness of the economy and therefore reducing exports.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{case law}} shows that vulnerable, {{previously}} disadvantaged private sector tenants are currently facing eviction orders – and consequential homelessness – {{on the basis}} that their leases have expired. In terms of the case law it is evident that once their leases have expired, these households {{do not have access to}} alternative accommodation. In terms of the Constitution, this group of marginalised tenants have a constitutional right of access to adequate housing and a right to occupy land with legally secure tenure. The purpose of this article is to critically analyse a number of legislative interventions, and specifically rent control, that were imposed in various jurisdictions in order to provide strengthened tenure protection for tenants. The rationale for this analysis is to determine whether the current South African landlordtenant regime is able to provide adequate tenure protection for vulnerable tenants and therefore in the process of transforming in line with the Constitution. The <b>legal</b> construction of <b>rent</b> control was adopted in pre- 1994 South Africa, England and New York City to provide substantive tenure protection for tenants during housing shortages. These statutory interventions in the different private rental markets were justified {{on the basis that}} there was a general need to protect tenants against exploitation by landlords. However, the justification for the persistent imposition of rent control in New York City is different since it protects a minority group of financially weak tenants against homelessness. The English landlord-tenant regime highlights the importance of a well-structured social sector that can provide secure, long-term housing options for low-income households who are struggling to access the private rental sector. Additionally, the English rental housing framework shows that if the social sector is functioning as a "safety net" for low-income households, the private sector would be able to uphold deregulation. In light of these comparisons and the fact that the South African social sector is not functioning optimally yet, the question is whether the South African private sector is able to provide the required level of tenure protection for struggling tenants. Recent case law shows that tenants are at liberty to lodge unfair practice complaints with the Rental Housing Tribunals on the basis that the landlords' ground for termination of the lease constitutes an unfair practice. The Court defined an unfair practice as a practice that unreasonably prejudices the tenants' rights or interests. This judicial development signifies some transformation in the private sector since it allows the Tribunals to scrutinise landlords' reasons for termination of tenancies in light of tenants' personal and socioeconomic circumstances. The Tribunals are therefore empowered to weigh the interests of both parties and decide whether to confirm termination of the lease or set aside such termination. In light of this recent development, the Tribunals can provide strengthened tenure protection for destitute tenants on a case by case basis, which incorporates a flexible context-sensitive approach to the provision of secure housing rights in the landlord-tenant framework. This methodology is similar to the German approach. Even though this judicial development is welcomed, it raises some concerns with regard to landlords' property rights and specifically landlords' constitutional property rights since Tribunals are now at liberty to set aside contractually agreed grounds for termination of leases without any statutory guidance. The legislation fails to provide any information regarding legitimate grounds for termination, which might have to be rectified in future. The grounds listed in the rent control legislation should serve as a starting point to determine which grounds for termination of a lease should generally be upheld. However, German landlord-tenant law shows that a statutory ground for termination of a lease should not be imposed in an absolutist fashion but rather place a heavier burden on the tenant to prove why the lease should not come to an end...|$|R

Tutkimuksen keskipisteenä on, miten eri säännökset ohjaavat ja rajoittavat ulkoistamisia sekä mitä vaatimuksia ulkoistamisille on asetettavissa. Tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan myös eri palveluntuottamismuotoja. Esimerkiksi erilaiset variaatiot tilaaja-tuottajamallista ovat yleistyneet. Tutkimuksessa arvioidaan kuntalaisten roolin muutosta asiakkaana esimerkiksi oikeusturvan näkökulmasta sekä luottamushenkilöiden rooleja eri toimintamuodoissa. Luottamushenkilöiden rooli on kehittynyt etenkin niissä kunnissa, joissa on siirrytty tilaaja-tuottajamalliin. Uudentyyppiset toimintatavat ovat tuoneet kunnat uusien oikeudellisten kysymysten eteen, koska ulkoistamisissa liikutaan monella eri oikeudenalalla. Myös ulkoistamista koskeva sääntely on lisääntynyt ja hajanaistunut. Mikko Komulainen käy laajassa tutkimuksessaan läpi ulkoistamisiin välittömästi ja välillisesti liittyviä näkökulmia ja ilmiöitä ja avaa eri toimintamallien sisältöä ja käsitteitä. Kuntien vaikutus- ja päätösmahdollisuudet ovat saaneet ulkoistamisten määrän ja koon kasvaessa aivan uusia elementtejä. Ongelmaksi kunnallisten palvelujen tuottamisessa nousee luottamushenkilöiden ja viranhaltijoiden ohjaus- ja valvontafunktion muutos, mikä ilmenee myös eri toimintamallien toimivuutena tai toimimattomuutena. Lisäksi ulkoistamisprosessin eri vaiheissa joudutaan tasapainoilemaan sen kanssa, mitkä asiat pitäisi ratkaista puhtaasti oikeudellisen tarkastelun pohjalta ja milloin pitäisi huomioida poliittisia linjoja. Tutkimuksen perusteella ulkoistusten vaikutukset ovat moninaisia. Ulkoistamisen eri muodoissa on oikeudellisia, toiminnallisia sekä taloudellisia eroja. Ulkoistamisen muotoja on säännelty tarkasti, ja demokraattisen päätöksenteon liikkumatila aitoine vaihtoehtoineen joutuu monessa suhteessa entistä ahtaammalle. Tämä merkitsee vastuu-, johtamis-, ohjaus- ja palveluntuottamiskysymysten selkeyttämistä ja erottamista. Kunnanvaltuustolla on viime kädessä päätösvalta ainakin mittavissa kokonais- ja osittaisulkoistuksissa. Toisaalta eri palvelutuottamistavat, kuten monipalvelutuottajamallit, voivat tukea myös kunnan itsehallinnollista asemaa.

(Outsourcing in Finnish municipalities. A {{judicial}} {{study on}} the different forms and impacts of outsourcing, and the restrictions and demands placed on outsourcing as one form of local government service provision). Acta Publications No. 222. The Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities. Helsinki. Since {{the turn of the}} 2000 s, municipalities have increasingly outsourced their services, which has emphasized the change in their role from service producers to that of service providers. The focus of this study is on how regulations direct and constrain outsourcing and what requirements must be imposed upon it. For the purposes of this study, I have divided outsourcing into three categories: total outsourcing, outsourcing of subareas and partial outsourcing. This makes it possible to establish how outsourcing manifests itself in municipalities. Moreover, this study explores what is meant by outsourcing, what effects it has and what problems are associated with its various manifestations. There is variation in the judicial, operational and economic perspectives of the various forms of outsourcing. To put it concisely, total outsourcing can be taken to be a decision by a municipality to transfer a certain function as a whole to be produced by an external actor. One of the main judicial features of total outsourcing is that the service producer is a legally competent and independent organ. Outsourcing of subareas refers mainly to the transfer of an operatively and judicially distinguishable entity into the hands of an external actor. The supervision and monitoring of a detached part is frequently more problematic unless the isolation of the subarea in question can the operationally achieved in as unambiguous a manner as possible. In the case of partial outsourcing a public organ or municipality produces the service in collaboration with a private organ. There may be several interfaces and legal liability may be less clear than in the other forms of outsourcing. Partial outsourcing is the judicially most unstable form of outsourcing because the service producer need not be an independent body; it is suffi cient that it is operationally and economically separate and an independent unit. Along with these new modes of operation, municipalities have been confronted with new legal issues because the various forms of outsourcing fall within many diffe 16 <b>rent</b> <b>legal</b> areas; also, the regulation governing outsourcing has increased and become more fragmentary. I will also use the classifi cation adopted for the study to examine the concepts directly and indirectly associated with outsourcing. While various combinations of the purchaser-provider model have become widespread, the various forms of outsourcing do not of themselves require one single action model or form of legal body. The role of elected representatives has changed, especially in those municipalities which have adopted the purchaser-provider model. In a genuine purchaser-provider model the roles of elected representatives are more clear-cut. It is simpler to concentrate on monitoring and developing the outsourced service when ordering and producing are not the responsibility of the one and the same body. Applying different aspects of law is problematic from the perspective of legal administration. In spite of delineations it is necessary at various stages of the outsourcing process to take account of the basic elements of the different areas of law. The analysis of the adequacy of the classifi cation of outsourcing contracts also provides an evaluation of what limitations and requirements these contracts should entail. In the regulation of outsourcing the focus appears to be shifting increasingly from the regulations governing municipal governance in general to regulations governing competitive bidding and contractual arrangements. Examination of the regulations constraining and enabling outsourcing revealed an interaction of different legal provisions than in other forms of service provision in the municipality. With the increase in the extent and size of outsourcing the power of municipalities to exert infl uence and take decisions has acquired totally new dimensions. Correct outsourcing is largely governed by norms. Special legal provisions with dual signifi cance can be deemed as strongly binding: On the one hand they place very detailed demands and legal obligations on both purchaser and provider. On the other hand they can be deemed to enable outsourcing, especially in situations in which the activity in question cannot be produced in-house. The municipality cannot outsource functions that do not fall within its competence. The tasks and functions which fall within the sphere of municipal autonomy, however, do indeed create the fi nal framework for outsourcing within which partial outsourcing measures can be considered. Different service production methods support municipal autonomy, and, for example, the outsourcing of certain subareas does not of itself undermine municipal decision-making or the potential to exert infl uence. In all action models and outsourcing stages attention should be paid not only to the requirements set by regulations but also to democratic considerations so as to ensure optimal preconditions for municipal autonomy regardless of the municipality s mode of operation. Additionally it should be legally possible for municipalities to take a function whether total, partial or a subarea back in-house after a certain period of time. A problem emerging in the production of municipal services is the change in the supervision and monitoring function by elected representatives and offi ce-holders, which fi ts poorly with traditional municipal administration. It is not unequivocally clear what problems are attributable to the municipality s transformation from a producer of services to a provider of services and what are due to other operational or legislative interpretations because failure to implement outsourcing may be due to factors both within and outside the operating environment. From the perspective of residents the private organ to which the functions have been delegated may not in all ways follow the same regulations or obligations as personnel under an offi cial obligation by virtue of their employment. In ambiguous contracts concerning total or subarea outsourcing there is a danger that the limits of public power will become blurred and issues of liability become complex. One key issue in the outsourcing process from the perspective of residents is that the provisions for legal security are not compromised. The extent and content of the concept performance of functions included in Section 2 (3) of the Finnish Local Government Act is assessed from the perspective of outsourcing. This provision also entails the concept obligation to provide which in certain aspects is legally problematic. I will also examine statutory tasks whose outsourcing is restricted or which may not be delegated beyond the municipality or offi cial organization. In the various stages of outsourcing a balance must be found regarding what matters should be resolved on the basis of purely legal considerations and at what stages political directions should be taken into account. There would appear to be two types of effects of outsourcing. At least in major total outsourcing and partial outsourcing issues the ultimate power of decision rests with the municipal council. However, all forms of outsourcing are strictly regulated and the leeway for democratic decision-making with genuine alternatives is often limited. At the beginning of the outsourcing process political and legal liability should be separated and kept more distinctly separate than before...|$|R
