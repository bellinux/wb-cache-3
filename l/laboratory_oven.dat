Factorial designs assume independence of error term so that each experiment must be performed one at a time.

The temperature levels assigned to each oven are different. The experiment may be replicated (blocking factor) during three different tours (shifts). This is not a factorial design with blocking factors, because annealing is performed simultaneously (whole-plots) on different metal samples (sub-plots).
