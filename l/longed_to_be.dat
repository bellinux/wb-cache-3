5|$|The divorce proved {{difficult}} for Jackson, who spent several weeks lamenting his loss. Presley {{was the first}} person with whom he had connected on such a high level. She had supported him as he faced allegations and became dependent on pain medication. It was also {{the first time that the}} pop singer had had a sexual chemistry with another. Presley was able to make him open up and express himself through their physically intimate moments together. At the time, Jackson was afraid there would never be another who made him feel the way his ex-wife had. He eventually realized he had to move on; he had a world tour coming up and music to work on. Jackson also knew that Presley would never make him a father, which he <b>longed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E

500|$|It was in Sydney that Anderson met {{her first}} husband, Ross McGill, {{with whom she}} lived for three years before their {{marriage}} in 1940. Anderson described McGill as [...] "a commercial artist who <b>longed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a painter." [...] Tragically, nearly all of his works were destroyed in a fire, and Anderson was left {{with only a few}} drawings of his that he had given to a mutual friend, who then generously shared them with Anderson.|$|E

500|$|Gian Gastone was {{consuming}} {{money at}} a rapid pace in Bohemia, wracking up titanic debts. The Grand Duke, alarmed, sent the Marquis Rinnuci to scrutinise the Prince's debts. Rinnuci was abhorred to discover that Jan Josef, Count of Breuner and Archbishop of Prague, was among his creditors. In an attempt to salvage Gian Gastone from shipwreck, Rinnuci tried to coerce Anna Maria Franziska to return to Florence, where Gian Gastone <b>longed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> She blankly refused. Her confessor, hoping to keep her in Bohemia, regaled her with tales of the [...] "poisoned" [...] Eleanor of Toledo and Isabella Orsini, other Medici consorts.|$|E
500|$|Van Gogh {{returned}} to Etten in April 1881 {{for an extended}} stay with his parents. He continued to draw, often using his neighbours as subjects. In August 1881, his recently widowed cousin, Cornelia [...] "Kee" [...] Vos-Stricker, daughter of his mother's older sister Willemina and Johannes Stricker, arrived for a visit. He was thrilled and took long walks with her. Kee was seven years older than he was, and had an eight-year-old son. Van Gogh surprised everyone by declaring his love to her and proposing marriage. She refused with the words [...] "No, nay, never" [...] ("nooit, neen, nimmer"). After Kee {{returned to}} Amsterdam, Van Gogh went to The Hague to try to sell paintings and to meet with his second cousin, Anton Mauve. Mauve was the successful artist Van Gogh <b>longed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Mauve invited him to return in a few months, and suggested he spend the intervening time working in charcoal and pastels; Van Gogh went back to Etten and followed this advice.|$|E
500|$|Wullschlager {{observes that}} in [...] "The Princess and the Pea" [...] Andersen blended his {{childhood}} {{memories of a}} primitive world of violence, death, and inexorable fate, with his social climber's private romance about the serene, secure and cultivated Danish bourgeoisie, which did not quite accept {{him as one of}} their own. Researcher Jack Zipes said that Andersen, during his lifetime, [...] "was obliged to act as a dominated subject within the dominant social circles despite his fame and recognition as a writer"; Andersen therefore developed a feared and loved view of the aristocracy. Others have said that Andersen constantly felt as though he did not belong, and <b>longed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of the upper class. The nervousness and humiliations Andersen suffered {{in the presence of the}} bourgeoisie were mythologized by the storyteller in the tale of [...] "The Princess and the Pea", with Andersen himself the morbidly sensitive princess who can feel a pea through 20mattresses.|$|E

500|$|Gian Gastone's once {{acclaimed}} complexion {{and weight}} were ruined by {{the course of}} dissipation he pursued in Prague, becoming blotchy and bloated respectively. Dami acted as a pimp for the Prince, soliciting countless young men for his master's enjoyment. The Prince frequently gambled, racking up exorbitant debts, losing, on one occasion, 150,000 crowns. His ruinous behaviour was relayed to Florence by the Electress Palatine. Gian Gastone replied to Cosimo's ensuing admonishments with an account of his married life, blaming Anna Maria Franziska's [...] "capriciousness, peevish faces and sharp words" [...] for his desperate conduct. Considering summoning him to Florence, Cosimo sent the Marquis Rinuccini to scrutinise his younger son's debts. Rinnucci was horrified {{to learn that the}} Archbishop of Prague was among his creditors. Anna Maria Franziska greeted Rinuccini warmly, and implied that Gian Gastone pawned some of her jewels to ameliorate his gambling debts. The Marquis concluded that nothing—not even the Holy Roman Empress's reproaches—could compel Anna Maria Franziska to Florence, where Gian Gastone <b>longed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Forced once again to quell his enmity towards his wife, Gian Gastone returned to Reichstadt as per the Holy Roman Emperor and Holy Roman Empress's advice. Nevertheless, their reconciliation was brief, and Gian Gastone left for Hamburg in October 1703, only to return to Prague the next February.|$|E
2500|$|Curtis's {{choice to}} stay in Wildwood leaves behind a grieving family in Portland. Meloy said that reading fantasy stories growing up, about [...] "kids going to other worlds or {{crossing}} over to another place, it would invariably involve them coming back at the end," [...] and [...] "Whenever that character made a choice to come back, it didn't feel true to me for some reason." [...] Meloy wanted to experiment with a character who did what Meloy wanted to do, {{even though he had}} a happy childhood and loving family. [...] Meloy was able to connect with Curtis: [...] "I think of Curtis as being a version of myself." [...] As a child, Meloy [...] "desperately <b>longed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken away to another world." ...|$|E
2500|$|An entirely {{different}} type of person was Virendranath Chattopadhyay, member of a famous family in India. Popularly known as Chatto {{he was a very}} able and a very delightful person. He was always hard up, his clothes were very much the worse for wear and often he found it difficult to raise the wherewithal for a meal. But his humour and light heartedness never left him. He had been some years senior to me during my educational days in England. He was at Oxford when I was at Harrow. Since those days he had not returned to India and sometimes a fit of homesickness came to him when he <b>longed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back. All his home-ties had long been severed and it is quite certain that if he came to India he would feel unhappy and out of joint. But in spite of the passage of time the home pull remains. No exile can escape the malady of his tribe, that consumption of the soul, as Mazzini called it ... Of the few I met, the only persons who impressed me intellectually were Virendranath Chattopadhyay and M.N. Roy. Chatto was not, I believe, a regular communist, but he was communistically inclined.|$|E
