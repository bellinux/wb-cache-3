40|$|The bin packing {{problem has}} been the corner stone of {{approximation}} algorithms and has been extensively studied starting from the early seventies. In the classical bin packing problem, we are given a list of real numbers in the range (0, 1], {{the goal is to}} place them in a minimum number of bins so that no bin holds numbers summing to more than 1. In this thesis we study approximation algorithms for three generalizations of bin packing: geometric bin packing, vector bin packing and weighted bipartite edge coloring. In two-dimensional (2 -D) geometric bin packing, we are given a collection of rectangular items to be packed into a minimum number of unit size square bins. Geometric packing has vast applications in cutting stock, vehicle <b>loading,</b> <b>pallet</b> packing, memory allocation and several other logistics and robotics related problems. We consider the widely studied orthogonal packing case, where the items must be placed in the bin such that their sides are parallel to the sides of the bin. Here two variants are usually studied, (i) where the items cannot be rotated, and (ii) they can be rotated by 90 degrees. We give a polynomial time algorithm with an asymptotic approximation ratio of (1. 5) + 1 ≈ 1. 405 for the versions with and without rotations. We have also shown the limitations of rounding based algorithms, ubiquitous in bin packing algorithms. We have shown that any algorithm that rounds at least one side of each large item to some number in a constant size collection values chosen independent of the problem instance, cannot achieve an asymptotic approximation ratio better than 3 / 2. In d-dimensional vector bin packing (VBP), each item is a d-dimensional vector that needs to be packed into unit vector bins. The problem is of great significance in resource constrained scheduling and also appears in recent virtual machine placement in cloud computing. Even in two dimensions, it has novel applications in layout design, logistics, loading and scheduling problems. We obtain a polynomial time algorithm with an asymptotic approximation ratio of (1. 5) + 1 ≈ 1. 405 for 2 -D VBP. We also obtain a polynomial time algorithm with almost tight (absolute) approximation ratio of 1 +(1. 5) for 2 -D VBP. For d dimensions, we give a polynomial time algorithm with an asymptotic approximation ratio of (d/ 2) + 1. 5 ≈ d+ 0. 81. We also consider vector bin packing under resource augmentation. We give a polynomial time algorithm that packs vectors into (1 +ϵ) Opt bins when we allow augmentation in (d - 1) dimensions and Opt is the minimum number of bins needed to pack the vectors into (1, 1) bins. In weighted bipartite edge coloring problem, we are given an edge-weighted bipartite graph G=(V,E) with weights w: E → [0, 1]. The task is to find a proper weighted coloring of the edges with as few colors as possible. An edge coloring of the weighted graph is called a proper weighted coloring if the sum of the weights of the edges incident to a vertex of any color is at most one. This problem is motivated by rearrangeability of 3 -stage Clos networks which is very useful in various applications in interconnected networks and routing. We show a polynomial time approximation algorithm that returns a proper weighted coloring with at most 2. 2223 m colors where m is the minimum number of unit sized bins needed to pack the weight of all edges incident at any vertex. We also show that if all edge weights are > 1 / 4 then 2. 2 m colors are sufficient. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|In most {{distribution}} centers, {{products are}} {{received from the}} suppliers in units of pallet, stored in a rack, moved to the picking area for replenishment, picked according to customer orders, and shipped to customers. In some distribution centers, however, replenishment is made in not a whole pallet but {{only a portion of}} a <b>pallet</b> <b>load,</b> mainly due to the limited space in the order-picking area; as a result, partially <b>loaded</b> <b>pallets</b> occupy cells in the rack. As the number of slow-moving items increases, more cells are occupied by partially <b>loaded</b> <b>pallets</b> so that fewer empty cells are available for storing full, incoming pallets. This will necessitate the construction or leasing of additional storage space, which will entail significant cost. As an alternative, we propose pallet consolidation, which involves moving a partial load to another partially-loaded pallet in order to create one empty cell in the rack. In this paper, we define three pallet consolidation problems; formulate each problem as a binary integer programming model; and present heuristic algorithms for the problems. The average performance of each of the proposed heuristics is evaluated using simulation...|$|R

30|$|The pallet input object {{presented}} in Table  1 contains three physical and four temporal data fields. The pallet object physical data fields detail an identification {{number and the}} height and weight of the <b>loaded</b> <b>pallet</b> which indicate whether a pallet feasibly fits into an aircraft’s pallet position. Utilization of the military standard 463 L pallet system removes the necessity of including length and width dimensions for a <b>loaded</b> <b>pallet,</b> which are 108 ″ ×  88 ″. The <b>pallet’s</b> available <b>load</b> date corresponds to the earliest date available for loading on an aircraft; as such, it is strictly enforced by DALP-TS. Violations of the remaining three temporal fields are allowed but penalized. Pallets reaching the APOD prior to the earliest arrival date may arrive before the necessary equipment and/or personnel required for cargo unloading are in place and may also cause port congestion issues (i.e., exceeding airfield storage capacity) at the APOD. The pallet latest arrival date and pallet required delivery date are very similar and often identical. The latest arrival date is the latest date by which the pallet should arrive at the APOD to enable proper unloading and assembly; the required delivery date is the latest date by which the pallet must arrive at the APOD prior to the deploying force departing the APOD.|$|R
