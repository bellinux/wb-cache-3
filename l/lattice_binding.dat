30|$|The isotopic {{fractionation}} {{of water}} ice during sublimation on planetary bodies {{has been considered}} a simple temperature-driven process in which colder ices tended to fractionate more heavily than warmer ones due to the differences in <b>lattice</b> <b>binding</b> energy between H 2 O and HDO [12 – 16]. This energy difference results in lower equilibrium sublimation pressures for HDO, the more refractory form of water, and intensifies at lower temperatures, increasing the relative refractory nature of HDO compared to H 2 O. Typically, when this information is applied to planet-scale analyses, either just this equilibrium value has been used [17] or is first combined {{with the concept of}} a static lattice in which no fractionation occurs due to a buildup of the more refractory isotope on the surface until the ice sublimates at the bulk ratio [18].|$|E

40|$|SummaryMicrotubule (MT) plus-end {{tracking}} proteins (+TIPs) preferentially localize to MT plus ends. End-binding proteins (EBs) are master regulators of the +TIP complex; however, it {{is unknown}} whether EBs are regulated by other +TIPs. Here, we show that cytoplasmic linker-associated proteins (CLASPs) modulate EB localization at MTs. In CLASP-depleted cells, EBs localized along the MT lattice in addition to plus ends. The MT-binding region of CLASP was sufficient for restoring normal EB localization, whereas neither EB-CLASP interactions nor EB tail-binding proteins are involved. In vitro assays revealed that CLASP directly functions to remove EB from MTs. Importantly, this effect occurs specifically during MT polymerization, but not at preformed MTs. Increased GTP-tubulin content within MTs in CLASP-depleted cells suggests that CLASPs facilitate GTP hydrolysis to reduce EB <b>lattice</b> <b>binding.</b> Together, {{these findings suggest that}} CLASPs influence the MT lattice itself to regulate EB and determine exclusive plus-end localization of EBs in cells...|$|E

The thermodynamically rigorous fluorescent titration technique {{has been used to}} obtain true binding isotherms, independently of the assumptions of any relationships between the observed quenching of protein fluorescence and the degree of nucleotide binding. Fluorescence titrations using several MANT derivatives of nucleoside diphosphates (MANT-ADP, 3 ', 2 '-O-(N-methylantraniloyl) adenosine- 5 '-diphosphate; MANT-GDP, 3 ', 2 '-O(N-methylantraniloyl) guanosine- 5 '-diphosphate; MANT-CDP, 3 ', 2 '-O-(N-methylantraniloyl) cytidine- 5 '-diphosphate; MANT-UDP, 3 ', 2 '-O-(N-methylantraniloyl) uridine- 5 '-diphosphate) have shown that the DnaB helicase has a preference for purine nucleotides. Binding of all modified nucleotides is characterized by similar negative cooperativity, indicating that negative cooperative interactions are base-independent. Thermodynamic parameters for the interactions of the unmodified nucleotides (ADP, GDP, CDP, and UDP) and inorganic phosphate (P(i)) have been obtained by using the competition titration approach.

If the total <b>lattice</b> <b>binding</b> energy 2 ε 1 (per DA pair) gained in ionizing a DA lattice exceeds the cost 2 ε o of ionizing each DA pair, ε 1 + ε o less than 0, then the lattice is holoionic. The charge-transfer (CT) band in crystals and in solution can be explained, following Mulliken, by a second-order mixing of states, or by any theory that makes the CT transition strongly allowed, and yet due to a small change in the ground state of the non-interacting components D and A (or D + and A -).

Considering the structural similarities with bulk materials, the optical properties of M(L-cysteinate) were studied and indicate blue shifts of the band gap with respect to the bulk MS structures, due to the low dimensionality of the metal-sulphur arrangement.

40|$|AbstractBinding events {{involving}} the reversible association of ligands with polymeric <b>lattices</b> of <b>binding</b> sites {{are common in}} biology and frequently exhibit significant cooperativity in binding. Positive and negative cooperativity in binding may be detected by characteristic changes in binding curves for multiple binding, compared to the binding expected for simple, independent binding events {{that are based on}} combinatorial considerations only. Cooperativity arises from ligand-dependent interactions distinct from binding per se. Ligand-dependent nearest neighbor interactions may be of two types referred to as ligand-lattice (which can only occur if a bound ligand is unneighbored) and ligand-ligand (which can occur if two or more bound ligands are adjacent). The molecular mechanisms underlying these two sources of cooperativity are not the same. Identical cooperative binding curves may be produced by changes from unity in parameters representing either one or both of these interaction types. Positive cooperativity may equally result from destabilizing ligand-lattice interactions that disfavor initial, unneighbored binding, stabilizing ligand-ligand interactions that favor subsequent, neighbored binding, or both.

40|$|Microtubules (MTs) are {{essential}} {{components of the}} eukaryotic cytoskeleton. They form by the polymerization of tubulin into cylindrical polymers composed of protofilaments. MTs {{are involved in a}} diverse array of cellular functions due to their dynamic instability, which is modulated by many factors in vivo and in vitro. Agents that modulate MT dynamics include MT associated proteins (MAPs) and naturally occurring compounds known as MT stabilizing agents (MSAs). A number of MSAs have demonstrated or predicted potential as anticancer agents, but a detailed structural basis for their mechanism of action is still lacking. We have used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to study the structural basis of action of zampanolide, a taxane-binding site (TBS) MSA, as well as several proteins known to stabilize MTs, with main focus on tau. We have obtained a high-resolution (4. 2 Å) cryo-EM reconstruction of microtubules stabilized by zampanolide and have compared it to Taxol, which binds to the same pocket on β-tubulin. We find that each TBS MSA has distinct structural effects on the microtubule (MT) <b>lattice.</b> <b>Binding</b> of Taxol or zampanolide both induce MT heterogeneity, but each affects the longitudinal interface differently. Tau is the prominent neuronal MAP and it has been implicated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Tau is known to bind and stabilize MTs in the axons but its binding mode and stabilizing mechanism are not well understood. Our study shows that tau binds exclusively to the external surface of MTs along protofilaments and that it remains in an extended confirmation. In addition, in the presence of kinesin, full length tau (FL-tau) dissociates from MTs allowing kinesin binding. Surprisingly, sub-stoichiometric amounts of tau result in the formation of GDP-tubulin double rings that disappear upon increasing the amounts of tau added to MTs. FL-tau and minimal 2 -R or 4 -R tau constructs result in the formation of sleeve-like structures around MTs, suggesting that tau binds to tubulin dimers as well as to fully polymerized MTs. Thus, we hypothesize that tau functions by oligomerizing tubulin dimers leading to a compacted MT lattice that could reinforce the interactions across the longitudinal MT interface. Furthermore, we identified amino acids on the surface of tubulin that could interact with tau. Tau binds to MTs near the C-terminus, and the sequestering of the acidic C-terminus of tubulin could contribute to the stability of MTs in the presence of tau...|$|E
40|$|TOG-family polymerases track {{microtubule}} plus {{ends and}} modulate dynamics in vivo. In vitro XMAP 215 and Stu 2 {{have been shown}} to exhibit opposing activities, which led to conflicting proposals for molecular mechanisms. To understand more about these apparently contradictory findings and to test candidate models in more detail, I used an in vitro system in which all the components derived from the same organism, Sacchammyce pombe. Deletion mutants of Alp 14 and Dis 1, the XMAP 215 orthologues in S. pombe, show defects in microtubule assembly, consistent with an effect on microtubule dynamics. I have expressed and purified Alp 14 and Disl and the TACC-protein Alp 7 using a baculovirus system and reconstituted their activities in vitro using dynamically unstable single micro tubules built from purified single isoform (cd and (3)) S. pombe tubulin. In this work I show that Alp 14 accelerates the shrinkage of GMP-CPP stabilized microtubules 2 x while it accelerates the assembly of GTP-S. pombe tubulin into micro- tubules J Ox. Growth rates change within a growth phase, corresponding to different amounts of Alp 14 at the tip. The growth rate acceleration by Alp 14 causes a decrease in catastrophe frequency consistent with the extension of the GTP-cap. Remark- ably, although Alp 14 binds to mammalian brain tubulin, it does not accelerate the growth rate of mammalian brain micro tubules, and instead is competitively inhibited by 10 % mammalian brain tubulin, indicating a catalytic mechanism for Alp 14. Catalytic activity and tip tracking are tightly coupled, but separable. Alp 14 loses its tip tracking ability upon the addition of 10 % mammalian brain tubulin. The TACC-protein Alp 7 can restore the tip-tracking ability of Alp 14 in the presence of mammalian brain tubulin but not its activity, consistent with reports that Alp 7 is a localization factor of AJp 14 in vivo. On dynamic S. pombe microtubules Alp 7 increases the processivity of Alp 14 and suppresses the catastrophe frequency. Growth rates are not further elevated by the addition of Alp 7. In contrast, Disl has no TACC-protein interacting partner. Like Alp 14 it disassembles GMP-CPP microtubules and increases the growth rate of S. pombe microtubules. Likewise it binds to mammalian brain tubulin without the ability to increase the growth rate of mammalian brain microtubules. However, unlike Alp 14, Dis 1 is able to tip-track on dynamic mammalian brain microtubules. As both Alp 14 and Disl function as S. pombe microtubule polymerases, but not as mammalian brain microtubule polymerases, I concluded that not only the association of tubulin to XMA P 215 -family members is important for proper function but also that the ready dissociation of tubulin is just as important. Slow dissociation inhibits the activity of XMAP 215 -family member, supporting a catalytic model. Furthermore I found that higher affinity to the microtubule lattice did not enhance the catalytic activity of Alp 14. Instead the higher affinity to the microtubule lattice of Alp 14 in the presence of Alp 7 increased the residence time of Alp 14 at the tip. In return this decreased the catastrophe frequency, enhancing the effectiveness of Alp 14 as a polymerase at the microtubule tip. Disl possesses an intrinsic high affinity to the microtubule lattice, tracking the microtubule end readily, but does not exhibit higher polymerase activity than Alp 14. On the basis of these data, I propose an assembler model for the molecular mechanism of Alp 14 -Alp 7 and Dis l, in which both XMAP 215 - family members enhance the growth rate of S. pombe microtubules by accelerating the exchange reaction of GTP-tubulin. High processivity and in return high effectiveness of the catalysts are mediated by Alp 7 in the case of Alp 14 and by internal microtubule <b>lattice</b> <b>binding</b> regions in the case of Disl.

I consider the scattering problem in a tight-binding lattice, as a simple way to understand the relation between M-functions and Greens functions and to investigate the connectivity dependence of Wigner delay times. To analyse delay times in bipartite <b>lattices,</b> tight <b>binding</b> calculations are used and a new computer code is developed to verify analytical predictions. In particular, Green’s functions and a mid-gap theory are used to calculate Wigner delay times for different connectivities in graphene like molecules. One interesting and counterintuitive result is that in the weak coupling limit at the middle of HOMO and LUMO gap, the Wigner delay time does not depend on the distance between the connections to external reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{theoretical}} {{models for the}} cooperative binding dynamics of ligands to substrates, such as dimeric motor proteins to microtubules or more extended macromolecules like tropomyosin to actin filaments. We {{study the effects of}} steric constraints, size of ligands, binding rates and interaction between neighboring proteins on the binding dynamics and binding stoichiometry. Starting from an empty <b>lattice</b> the <b>binding</b> dynamics goes, quite generally, through several stages. The first stage represents fast initial binding closely resembling the physics of random sequential adsorption processes. Typically this initial process leaves the system in a metastable locked state with many small gaps between blocks of bound molecules. In a second stage the gaps annihilate slowly as the ligands detach and reattach. This results in an algebraic decay of the gap concentration and interesting scaling behavior. Upon identifying the gaps with particles we show that the dynamics in this regime can be explained by mapping it onto various reaction-diffusion models. The final approach to equilibrium shows some interesting dynamic scaling properties. We also discuss the effect of cooperativity on the equilibrium stoichiometry, and their consequences for the interpretation of biochemical and image reconstruction results.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{magnetic}} (S= 1 / 2) impurity coupled to a 2 D system of correlated electrons (described by the t [...] J model) is studied by exact diagonalisations. It is found that, if the exchange coupling of the impurity with the neighboring spins is ferromagnetic or weakly antiferromagnetic, an extra hole can form bound states of different spatial symmetries with the impurity extending to a few <b>lattice</b> spacings. The <b>binding</b> energy is maximum when the impurity is completely decoupled (vacancy) and vanishes for an antiferromagnetic coupling exceeding ∼ 0. 3 J. Several peaks appear in the single hole spectral function below the lower edge of the quasiparticle band as signatures of the d-, s- and p-wave boundstates.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} rotation on the excited bands of a tight <b>binding</b> <b>lattice,</b> focusing particulary on the first excited (p-) band. Both the on-site energies and the hopping between lattice sites are modified by the effective magnetic field created by rotation, causing a non-trivial splitting and magnetic fine structure of the p-band. We show that Peierls substitution can be modified to describe p-band under rotation, and use this method to derive an effective Hamiltonian. We compare the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian with a first principles calculation of the magnetic band structure and find excellent agreement, confirming the validity of our approach. We also discuss the on-site interaction terms for bosons and argue that many-particle phenomena in a rotating p-band can be investigated starting from this effective Hamiltonian.

40|$|We {{consider}} local magnetic moments {{coupled to}} conduction electrons with on-site attraction, {{in order to}} discuss the interplay between pairing and magnetic order. We probe the ground state properties of this model on a one-dimensional <b>lattice</b> through pair <b>binding</b> energies and several correlation functions, calculated by means of density-matrix renormalization group. A phase diagram is obtained (for fixed electron density 1 / 3), from which we infer that coexistence between magnetic order and superconductivity is robust, at the expense of a continuous distortion of the magnetic arrangement of the local moments, as evidenced by a strong dependence of the characteristic wave vector k* with the coupling constants. This allows us to understand some trends of the coexistence, such as the influence of the rare earth on k*, as observed experimentally in the borocarbides.

40|$|Tight <b>binding</b> <b>lattices</b> offer {{a unique}} {{platform}} in which particles may be either static or mobile {{depending on the}} potential barrier between the sites. How to harness this mobility in a many-site lattice for useful operations is still an open question. We show how effective linear optics-like operations between arbitrary lattice sites can be implemented by a minimal local control which introduces a local impurity {{in the middle of}} the lattice. In particular we show how striking is the difference of the two possible correlations with and without the impurity. Our scheme enables the observation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect between distant wells without moving them next to each other with, e. g., tweezers. Moreover, we show that a tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometer is implemented adding a step-like potential, and we prove the robustness of our linear optics scheme to inter-particle interactions.

40|$|The {{restriction}} factor Fv 1 confers {{resistance to}} {{murine leukemia virus}} (MLV), blocking progression of the viral life cycle after reverse transcription, but before integration into the host chromosome. It is known that the specificity of restriction is determined by both the restriction factor and the viral capsid (CA), but a direct interaction between Fv 1 and MLV CA {{has not yet been}} demonstrated. With the development of a previously unexplored method for in vitro polymerization of MLV CA, it has now been possible to display a binding interaction between Fv 1 and MLV CA. C-terminally His-tagged CA molecules were assembled on Ni-chelating lipid nanotubes, and analysis by electron microscopy revealed the formation of a regular <b>lattice.</b> Comparison of <b>binding</b> data with existing restriction data confirmed the specificity of the binding interaction, with multiple positions of both Fv 1 and CA shown to influence binding specificity...|$|R
