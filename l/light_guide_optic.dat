40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the degree of conversion and hardness of different composite resins, photo-activated for 40 s with two different <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> tips, fiber <b>optic</b> and polymer. Methods: Five specimens were made for each group evaluated. The percentage of unreacted carbon double bonds (% C=C) was determined from the ratio of absorbance intensities of aliphatic C=C (peak at 1637 cm- 1) against internal standard before and after curing of the specimen: aromatic C-C (peak at 1610 cm- 1). The Vickers hardness measurements were performed in a universal testing machine. A 50 gf load was used and the indenter with a dwell time of 30 seconds.

40|$|Abstract Background Intrinsic optical signals (IOS), which reflect {{changes in}} {{transmittance}} and scattering light, {{have been applied}} to characterize the physiological conditions of target biological tissues. Backscattering approaches allow mounting of the source and detector {{on the same side}} of a sample which creates a more compact physical layout of device. This study presents a compact backscattering design using fiber-optic <b>guided</b> near-infrared (NIR) <b>light</b> to measure the amplitude and phase changes of IOS under different osmotic challenges. Methods High-frequency intensity-modulated <b>light</b> was <b>guided</b> via <b>optic</b> fiber, which was controlled by micromanipulator to closely aim at a minimum cluster of cortical neurons. Several factors including the probe design, wavelength selection, optimal measuring distance between the fiber-optical probe and cells were considered. Our experimental setup was tested in cultured cells to observe the relationship between the changes in backscattered NIR light and cellular IOS, which is believed mainly caused by cell volume changes in hypo/hyperosmotic solutions (± 20, ± 40 and ± 60 mOsm). Results The critical parameters of the current setup including the optimal measuring distance from fiber-optical probe to target tissue and the linear relationship between backscattering intensity and cell volume were determined. The backscattering intensity was found to be inversely proportional to osmotic changes. However, the phase shift exhibited a nonlinear feature and reached a plateau at hyperosmotic solution. Conclusions Our study indicated that the backscattering NIR <b>light</b> <b>guided</b> by fiber-optical probe makes it a potential alternative for continuous observation of intrinsic optical properties of cell culture under varied physical or chemical challenges. </p...|$|R

The power density was 653 mW cm− 2 when using the fiber optic light tip and 596 mW cm− 2 with the polymer. After storage in distilled water at 37 ± 2 "C for seven days, the samples were subjected to mechanical testing of compressive strength in an EMIC universal mechanical testing machine with a load cell of 5 kN and speed of 0. 5 mm min− 1. The statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA with a confidence interval of 95 % and Tamhane’s test. The results showed that the mean values of compressive strength were not influenced by the different light tips (p > 0. 05). However, a statistical difference was observed (p < 0. 001) between the microhybrid composite resin photo-activated with the fiber optic light tip and the nanofilled composite resin. Based on these results, it can be concluded that microhybrid composite resin photo-activated with the fiber optic light tip showed better results than nanofilled, regardless of the tip used, and the type of the light tip did not influence the compressive strength of either composite. Thus, the presented results suggest that both the fiber <b>optic</b> and polymer <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> tips provide adequate compressive strength to be used to make restorations.

This detector can be used to detect charged particles emitted in fusion evaporation reactions. In this work, several UoYTube prototypes were designed, fabricated and characterised/tested. These included prototypes with different scintillator crystals (Caesium Iodide and plastic), prototypes with different geometries (truncated pyramid and cuboid), and prototypes that included different types of <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> (Acrylic and 3 D Printed). These prototypes were characterised in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio, the optimum bias value, the energy resolution, the Acrylic versus 3 D-Printed <b>light</b> <b>guides,</b> the number of counts and the optimum amplifier shaping time. Two different methods used to fabricate <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> (one 3 D Printed and the other with the HURCO VMX 60 m Machining Centre), are also described. The <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> were then characterised and compared to each other in terms of their light output, energy resolution, and the optimum shaping time. Using these results, it was inferred that the plastic scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry) demonstrated the highest signal-to-noise ratio. The plastic scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry) and Caesium Iodide scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry), demonstrated a range of the optimum bias values, over which there was little variation in the measured signal-to-noise ratio. The Caesium Iodide scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry), demonstrated good energy resolution.

In this paper, {{a special}} {{lighting}} system that uses seamless prism <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> as main <b>lighting</b> component {{and application of}} the system in a high-humidity room is introduced. Experimental {{results show that the}} illuminance level and uniformity in the room has been improved greatly by the application of the guide. The average horizontal and vertical illuminance on main working plan created by the seamless <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> system is individually 74. 1 % and 101. 8 % higher than that created by the original lighting fixtures. The application of the seamless <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> system also makes the maintaining work become easier and safer...|$|R
