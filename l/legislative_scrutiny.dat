5|$|The {{existence}} of parliamentary committees is mentioned in section 49 of the Constitution of Australia, which makes reference to 'The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate {{and of the}} House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House...' However, the Senate had few committees, engaged in limited activities, until 1970. A number of domestic committees had operated since {{the establishment of the}} parliament, but prior to 1970 the only significant committee to be established was the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in 1932, one of the <b>legislative</b> <b>scrutiny</b> committees (see below).|$|E
5|$|These {{reforms were}} also {{significant}} {{in that they}} gave to Senate committees the role of examining the budget (what {{is referred to as}} the estimates process or estimates hearings), which had hitherto been confined to the Senate and its committee of the whole. The role of the committees was enhanced by three subsequent developments. First, in 1982 the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was established, which, in examining all bills, played a role that complemented that of the examination of all delegated legislation by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic referral of bills to committees, increasing the level of <b>legislative</b> <b>scrutiny</b> taking place within parliament. Third, in 1993, the committees adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial budget estimates hearings. These second hearings are referred to as supplementary budget estimates. Though the committee system was restructured in 1994, 2006 and again in 2009, the range of functions has remained essentially the same.|$|E

50|$|By 1974 the {{investment}} climate had cooled and in 1975 Governor Hugh Carey asked the Legislature to appropriate $178 {{million for the}} UDC, and by 1977 the UDC was able to reenter the financial markets. In 1975, the Corporation was reorganized and its mission expanded from developing housing to economic development. The finances were reorganized and the corporation assumed a less aggressive development stance, and its mission was refocused to finance other ambitious state projects and has been used frequently by governors to implement projects that circumvent formal <b>Legislative</b> or voter <b>scrutiny.</b>|$|R
40|$|With the {{high-profile}} corporate collapses {{in the period}} 2000 to 2002, the demise of Arthur Andersen, and the intense <b>legislative</b> and media <b>scrutiny</b> that followed, we expect auditors {{were more likely to}} issue going-concern audit opinions in the subsequent period. The convergence of these events potentially impacts both the client’s risk and the auditor’s reporting decision. We find that after controlling for the probability that clients are likely to receive a going-concern opinion, auditors are more likely to issue a going-concern audit opinion in 2003 than in 1999. The results suggest that the increase in going-concern modification rates is due to the increase in the auditors’ propensity to issue a going-concern opinion rather than the changes in client risk. We also examine non-audit service fees paid to the incumbent auditors and the results do not support the view that the provision of non-audit services per se has compromised auditors’ independence. 44 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|State {{parties to}} the ICESCR are {{required}} to take [...] "progressive action" [...] towards fulfilment of the ICESR rights. While immediate fulfilment may not be possible due to the economic situation of a country, postponement of proactive action is not permitted. State parties must show genuine efforts to secure the economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in the ICESCR. The burden of proof for progressive action is considered on be with the state party. The prohibition on discrimination in relation to economic, social and cultural rights is regarded as having immediate effect. State parties must abolish laws, policies and practices which affect the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and take action to prevent discrimination in public life. All state parties, regardless of the economic situation in the country or resource scarcity, are required to ensure respect for minimum subsistence rights for all. State parties must also ensure that available resources are accessed and used equitably. Therefore, government decisions on how to allocate resources should be subject to <b>scrutiny.</b> <b>Legislative</b> measures alone are not sufficient to ensure compliance with the ICESCR and state parties are expected to provide judicial remedies in addition to taking administrative, financial, educational and social measures.|$|R

50|$|In 2016, TOPS {{came under}} greater <b>legislative</b> <b>scrutiny</b> in an {{environment}} of declining state revenues and higher taxes pushed by Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards. In its initial year of 1989, TOPS funded $54 million in tuition for 24,163 students; in the 2014-2015 academic year, the program cost $270 million for the benefit of more than 50,000 students. Forty percent of the recipients attend LSU. The next cost estimate is $300 million annually. The Taylor Foundation, located in a three-story offices on Lee Circle in downtown New Orleans, is managed by Taylor's widow, the former Phyllis Miller (born September 1941). It is financed by company oil holdings and accents higher education in Louisiana in general and preservation of the TOPS program in particular.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of Alberta Eugenics Board activities {{were conducted in}} secret, sheltered from public criticism and <b>legislative</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> This secrecy and lack of transparency, combined {{with the cooperation of}} the provincial government and feeder institutions, resulted in the Board pursuing illicit activities not encompassed by the Act. The fact that the Board approved 99% of all presented cases calls into question the validity and accountability of its procedures. Some cases were approved even when patients' IQ scores were above the criterion score established by the Board for sterilization. At times, surgeons performed operations without the Board's approval. Sterilization procedures were also ordered for individuals who were already infertile - most notably, a group of 15 boys with Down syndrome where testicular biopsy tissue was surgically removed for the purpose of medical research.|$|E

[...] In the case, a majority of the Supreme Court, including the Court's President Lord Phillips and the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge reversed an earlier ruling of the High Court of Justice and found that the police force's policy of retaining DNA evidence in the absence of 'exceptional circumstances' was unlawful and a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

50|$|In dictatorships and {{absolute}} monarchies the leader can make law essentially by {{the stroke of}} a pen, {{one of the main}} objections to such an arrangement. However, a seemingly-analogous event can occur even in a democracy where the executive can make executive orders which have the force of law. In some instance, even regulations issued by executive departments can have the force of law. Libertarians, in particular, are known for denouncing such actions as being anti-democratic, but they have become such a salient feature of modern governance {{that it is hard to}} picture a system in which they no longer exist, because it is hard to picture the time involved in every regulation being debated prior to becoming law. That, say libertarians, is precisely the point: if such executive orders and regulations do not stand up to <b>legislative</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> they should never be implemented. In response to this, limits on regulatory authority have been made legislatively, and libertarians still contend for, if not the abolition of executive orders altogether, then their automatic sunset after a fixed period if not legislatively reviewed and confirmed; this policy has been adopted in some jurisdictions.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} there is a significant deficiency in the pre-legislative and <b>legislative</b> <b>scrutiny</b> processes in St. Lucia, caused by the failure of Parliament to utilize the Standing Orders {{in the manner in which}} they were intended and develop and follow a more systematic scrutiny process.

40|$|The role of legislatures in scrutinising {{executive}} patronage {{has received}} scant {{attention in the}} context of parliamentary democracy. This article addresses this lacuna by focusing on the parliamentary scrutiny of public appointments in the UK. Presenting the results of an extensive programme of research, it reveals how select committees have accrued increasing powers to challenge ministerial appointments, and how this has resulted in a series of unintended consequences that raise critical concerns regarding the overall added-value of pre-appointment scrutiny. The article is therefore of comparative significance for theories of <b>legislative</b> <b>scrutiny</b> in particular and executive–legislature dynamics more broadly...|$|E

Using an original data set of legislative vetoes of Commission acts by both European legislators from December 2009 - April 2017, the contribution shows that levels of the formal exercise of the legislative veto to overrule the Commission’s regulatory policies are very low.

40|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} (CRAs) {{play a key}} role in financial markets by helping to reduce the informative asymmetry between lenders and investors, on one side, and issuers on the other side, about the creditworthiness of companies or countries. CRAs´ role has expanded with financial globalization and has received an additional boost from Basel II which incorporates the ratings of CRAs into the rules for setting weights for credit risk. Ratings tend to be sticky, lagging markets, and overreact when they do change. This overreaction may have aggravated financial crises in the recent past, contributing to financial instability and cross-country contagion. The recent bankruptcies of Enron, WorldCom, and Parmalat have prompted <b>legislative</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of the agencies. Criticism has been especially directed towards the high degree of concentration of the industry. Promotion of competition may require policy action at national and international level to encourage the establishment of new agencies and to channel business generated by new regulatory requirements in their direction. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{defamation}} tort is {{the common}} law 2 ̆ 7 s established remedy for false speech that causes reputational and emotional injury. That tort is subject to intricate constitutional, legislative, and common law rules that have evolved over decades. The false light invasion of privacy tort also provides a potential cause of action in response to injurious falsehood. False light, however, has been subject to much less judicial and <b>legislative</b> <b>scrutiny</b> than defamation. As a result, courts often are uncertain about the proper limits on false light and, in some cases, have countenanced false light claims that would have failed if filed as defamation claims. Allowing such claims conflicts with two important legal principles: (1) the common law principle disfavoring novel causes of action that duplicate established torts, and (2) the constitutional rule of Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. These important legal principles require that courts reject false light claims that challenge defamatory speech but fail to meet defamation law 2 ̆ 7 s standards...|$|E
40|$|Bill {{committees}} {{have long}} been a fundamental feature of <b>legislative</b> <b>scrutiny</b> in the British House of Commons. The recent introduction of oral evidence sessions as a standard bill committee procedure has further underlined their importance. 1 Yet despite their prominence in parliamentary life, bill committees have been some-what under-studied. A comparison of bill committee activity {{in the first decade}} of the twenty-first century with the last comprehensive examination undertaken in 1974 shows that significant changes have taken place; bill committees appear to be working harder than ever before but this is not reflected in terms of the rela-tive impact they are making on government legislation. AMember of Parliament from the late nineteenth century would be quite familiar with a contemporary House of Commons bill committee. 2 Despite procedural innovations 3 and changes in the size and membership of committees, the proce-dures and terminology used when moving, withdrawing and voting upon amend-ments has not changed from that established by William Gladstone. 4 The last comprehensive study of government legislation undertaken by John Griffith i...|$|E

The members of the committee had expressed an interest in speaking directly to senators about what an elected chamber looked like in practice, given the Senate’s prominence (and pre-eminence) as an elected upper house in Commonwealth circles. Consideration of legislation under time limits Any observer watching the Senate this week, however, may not have gained the most favourable impression of the Senate’s operation as an exemplar of thorough <b>legislative</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> The Senate operated under a limitation of debate for the week (see Bulletin No. 257) and all legislation apart from one bill (the Deterring People Smuggling Bill 2011, considered at the end of other proceedings) was considered under time limits.

40|$|Reforming {{budgetary}} {{institutions for}} effective {{government is a}} critical task for emerging economies. Strengthening the role of parliament in the budget process {{is an integral part}} of the restoration of democracy throughout Latin America, which requires a re-equilibration of executive and legislative prerogatives in public policy. The role of legislatures in public budgeting and public finance management has nevertheless been largely overlooked in the first stage of economic reform. This is starting to change, as the contribution of legislatures to the budgetary process is currently being re-evaluated, both in developed and, more recently, in developing countries. 1 It is increasingly being recognised that parliaments have a critical role to play to strengthen economic governance, improve transparency in public finances and ensure government accountability. Enhancing <b>legislative</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of the budget and oversight of its execution is increasingly considered as a means to strengthen government accountability and curb corruption (OECD, 2002; G 8, 2003). 2 The international financial institutions are particularly keen to promote greater transparency in public finance management and to improve governmental financial information systems in emerging economies [...] . ...|$|E
