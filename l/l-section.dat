The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to steel plates for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig iron to steel by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (<b>L-section)</b> steel, rolled joists and girders for shipbuilding. For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and girders per week.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} view is {{that the}} voltage at the top of R2 is set by the emitter current of the output transistor. That view leads to an entirely passive feedback network made up of R2 and Rf. The variable controlling the feedback is the emitter current, so the feedback is a current-controlled current source (CCCS). We search through the four available two-port networks and find the only one with a CCCS is the g-parameter two-port, shown in Figure 4. The next task is to select the g-parameters so that the two-port of Figure 4 is electrically equivalent to the <b>L-section</b> made up of R2 and Rf. That selection is an algebraic procedure made most simply by looking at two individual cases: the case with V1 = 0, which makes the VCVS {{on the right side of}} the two-port a short-circuit; and the case with I2 = 0. which makes the CCCS on the left side an open circuit. The algebra in these two cases is simple, much easier than solving for all variables at once. The choice of g-parameters that make the two-port and the <b>L-section</b> behave the same way are shown in the table below.|$|E

The factor of two is introduced for mathematical convenience, since it is usual to work in terms of half-sections where it disappears.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{for the design}} of allpole filters with low sensitivity to component tolerance is presented. The filters are based on resistance [...] capacitance (RC) ladder structures combined with single operational amplifiers.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new design procedure for low-sensitivity filter sections, which have a symmetrical passive-RC network in the operational amplifier (opamp) feedback loop. In the design procedure we apply impedance scaling to the symmetrical bridged-T and twin-T networks; they become "potentially symmetrical " [1]. The design of low-sensitivity allpole active-RC filters, which have an RC-ladder network in the opamp feedback loop, has already been published [2]. There, successive <b>L-sections</b> of the ladder structure are impedance scaled upwards, from the driving source to the positive opamp input; we {{refer to it as}} "impedance tapering". In both cases we reduce the filter's magnitude sensitivity to variations of the passive components of a circuit. The new design concept will be demonstrated by designing two very popular and often used filter sections: a band-pass realized by the Deliyannis SAB, and a band-rejection filter with a Twin-T. The sensitivity analysis is examined analytically and double-checked using PSpice Monte Carlo runs. I...|$|R
40|$|An {{asymmetric}} DGS {{consisting of}} two square headed slots connected transversely with a rectangular slot is etched in the ground plane underneath a high-low impedance microstrip line.   It provides a band-reject filtering characteristics with sharp transition. Thus, it may be modeled as m-derived filter section. Accordingly, T-type LC equivalent circuit is proposed and LC parameters are extracted. A planar composite lowpass filter is designed by image parameter method and implemented by different DGS units. A composite filter requires at least three filter sections, of which two m-derived sections and one constant k-section. In proposed scheme, one such m-derived section is directly replaced by proposed DGS unit, whose cut-off frequency is {{same as that of}} designed m-derived section. The other m-derived section implemented by proposed DGS unit divided into equivalent two <b>L-sections</b> which will act as a termination for impedance matching. A constant k-section has been realized by a dumbbell shaped DGS having same cutoff frequency. Here lumped LC parameters are directly replaced by the equivalent LC values of the DGSs and therefore, produce almost ideal filter characteristics by overcoming the limitations of microstrip technology...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the results}} of {{intensive}} electrical characterization, modeling and the design of hardware with thin film tunable capacitors, i. e., dielectric varactors, has been presented and discussed. Especially the quality factor Q and the tuning ratio of the tunable capacitors have been studied, since these are crucial parameters for reconfigurable RF front-end applications for mobile phones. In Chapter 2, a literature survey was summarized describing {{the state of the}} art Q and for different tunable capacitor technologies based on varactor diodes, dielectric varactors, semiconductor-switched capacitors, and micromachined electro mechanical systems. The Q() relations were described separately by using basic physical models. However, the relations could be described with a single Q() formula. The study concludes that RF microelectro- mechanical switches have the highest tuning potential with a high Q, but are relatively large in size. For continuous, moderate tuning ranges highly doped GaAs varactor diodes could offer the best performance. Dielectric varactors will be most attractive for small physical size and low cost devices. In Chapter 4, it was discussed how RF tunable capacitors based on thin film barium strontium titanate (BST) were designed, fabricated, and measured. In addition, a dedicated analysis technique was developed to separate the electrical dissipation in the resistive electrodes from the dissipation in the dielectric oxide films. In Chapter 5 it was shown how voltage-dependent impedance measurement errors, using a commercial wide-band bias-tee, could be prevented in RF C(Vdc) measurements by an additional open calibration or by employing a custom-made wide-band bias-tee. In Chapter 6, the Q and were studied as a function of barium to strontium composition and doping in the BST films. A higher Q and a lower was measured for a lower barium content in the BST films. Cation doping in the BST films can have a similar effect. The electrical characterization results were utilized as an input to further improve the capacitors RF performance. In Chapter 7, a ferroelectric capacitor model has been implemented as a new component in the design environment ADS. The model can describe a C(Vdc) measurement by incorporating only 4 fit parameters. In Chapter 8, a 2 nd order bandpass transmit filter and a low-pass impedance matching network was designed and simulated in ADS, to obtain the Q() requirements for ferroelectric capacitors. A very high Q was required in the filter for the inductor and capacitor components to fulfill the customer specifications. Furthermore, an adaptive antenna impedance matching network was designed and simulated for a user, which covers the antenna with his hand resulting in a de-tuned antenna. Two cascaded low-pass <b>L-sections</b> improved the antenna impedance matching. The simulation results, using practical feasible values for the components, for the latter networks pointed out that tunable ferroelectric capacitors are promising components. Summarizing this thesis, the simulations and device characterization provided the link between the applications and the performance requirements of tunable capacitors. This could be the basis to optimize the ferroelectric materials and devices for RF applications...|$|R
