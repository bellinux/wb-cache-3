50|$|Rochdale rose to {{prominence}} during the 19th {{century as a}} major mill town and centre for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and amongst the first ever industrialised towns. The Rochdale Canal—one of the major navigable broad canals of the United Kingdom, which opened between 1798 and 1804—was a highway of commerce during this time. It {{was used for the}} haulage of cotton, wool and coal to and from the area.Rochdale's early industry was the production of <b>woollen</b> <b>flannel,</b> and the cotton industry grew up alongside it. Water-powered cotton spinning mills were built on the Roch in the 1780s and 1790s, but as late as 1818 there were only seven cotton mills in Rochdale itself. By the 1840s, however, cotton had overtaken wool in importance, although the wool industry enjoyed a resurgence during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of the 1860s.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Because {{clinical}} clerkship {{grades are}} associated with resident selection and performance and are largely based on residents'/attendings' subjective ratings, {{it is important to}} identify variables associated with clinical clerkship grades. METHODS: U. S. medical students who completed > or = 1 of the following required clinical clerkships [...] internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, neurology and psychiatry [...] were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey, which inquired about demographics, degree program, perceived quality of clerkship experiences, assertiveness, reticence and clerkship grades. RESULTS: A total of 2395 medical students (55 % women; 57 % whites) from 105 schools responded. Multivariable logistic regression models identified factors independently associated with receiving <b>lower</b> clerkship <b>grades</b> (high pass/pass or B/C) compared with the highest grade (honors or A). Students reporting higher quality of clerkship experiences were less likely to report <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in all clerkships. Older students more likely reported <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in internal medicine (P = 0. 02) and neurology (P < 0. 001). Underrepresented minorities more likely reported <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in all clerkships (P < 0. 001); Asians more likely reported <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in obstetrics/gynecology (P = 0. 007), pediatrics (P = 0. 01) and neurology (P = 0. 01). Men more likely reported <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in obstetrics/gynecology (P < 0. 001) and psychiatry (P = 0. 004). Students reporting greater reticence more likely reported <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in internal medicine (P = 0. 02), pediatrics (P = 0. 02) and psychiatry (P < 0. 05). Students reporting greater assertiveness less likely reported <b>lower</b> <b>grades</b> in all clerkships (P < 0. 03) except IM. CONCLUSIONS: The independent associations between <b>lower</b> clerkship <b>grades</b> and nonwhite race, male gender, older age, lower quality of clerkship experiences, and being less assertive and more reticent are concerning and merit further investigation...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the study was to {{determine}} if a parenting program would affect the reading achievement scores of single-parent children. Secondary purposes were to determine if male and female students were affected differently and if middle school students were affected differently than elementary students. Ninety-three students from a rural school district in northern Shelby County, Indiana, were identified to participate in the program. Forty-seven experimental children, were instructed in the parenting program twenty-one weeks, twenty-five minutes, two times a week. Forty-seven control students remained in the classroom. Multivariate analysis of covariance was done to test the null hypotheses. The criterion for rejecting or retaining the null hypothesis was set at the. 05 level of probability. Data collected from the pre- and post-test reading scores of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale, the Martinek-Zaichkowsky Self-Conce t Scale for Children, and the Behavioral Characteristics of Single-Parent Children Checklist were analyzed. Findings were: 1. There was not a significant difference between experimental and control groups or gender;however, the following differences did exist:a. The experimental group scored higher in reading than the control group, with the exception of the <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> control females, who scored higher than the experimental <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> females. b. The females of both groups had higher gain scores than the males. 2. There was a significant difference at the. 05 level in reading for the variable <b>grade</b> with <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> students making larger positive gains than the upper grade students. 3. There were significant differences in self-concept between the control and experimental groups in the area of anxiety, school status, happiness and athletics. a. The <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> experimental, upper grade control, and male students (of both groups) were less anxious. b. The <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> students felt better about school and were happier than the upper grade students. c. The second grade control group felt more confident about ability in athletics than the experimental group. 4. The teachers perceived the experimental students as needing less discipline, having higher general achievement and better reading comprehension. Conclusions based on the findings were: 1. The group or the gender did not make a significant difference:a. However, the upper grade experimental group did perform better than the upper grade control group. b. The lower control females performed better than the <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> experimental females, but the <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> experimental males out performed the <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> males in comprehension. 2. The <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> students performed significantly better than the upper grade students in reading vocabulary and comprehension. 3. The <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> experimental students, the upper grade control students and the male students were significantly less anxious. 4. The <b>lower</b> <b>grade</b> students felt significantly better about school than the upper grade students. 5. Teachers perceptions of experimental students were higher in classroom behavior, general achievement, and reading comprehension. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
