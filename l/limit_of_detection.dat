The spray is then ionised by extractive electrospray ionisation (EESI) and analysed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). An analysis requires 30 seconds per sample.

2500|$|Morphine {{levels in}} poppy seeds range between 4–200mg/kg. According {{to an article}} {{published}} in the Medical Science Law Journal, after ingesting [...] "a curry meal or two containing various amounts of washed seeds" [...] where total morphine levels were in the range 58.4 to 62.2µg/g seeds, the urinary morphine levels were found to range as high as 1.27µg/mL (1,270ng/mL) urine. Another article in the Journal of Forensic Science reports that concentration of morphine in some batches of seeds may be as high as 251µg/g. In both studies codeine was also present in the seeds in smaller concentrations. Therefore, it is possible to cross the current standard 2,000ng/mL <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection,</b> depending on seed potency and quantity ingested.

40|$|Nowadays, arsenic is {{becoming}} an important pollutant in the environment. Chronic exposure to arsenic can cause number of serious diseases. Therefore, a development of analytical methods for trace and ultratrace speciation analysis- analysis of individual forms or phases in which As {{is found in the}} sample - is fully in place. This Thesis compares four methods of trace speciation analysis, with focus on <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> and quantification, and on comparison of results of analysis of river and sea water reference materials. Methods based on hydride generation with preconcentration by cryotrapping and AAS or ICP-MS <b>detection,</b> with <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> in ng or tenths of ng·dm- 3, are compared with procedures employing HPLC, with ICP-MS detection. The Thesis includes development and optimization of a pre-reduction step of postcolumn hydride generation with on-line pre-reduction of pentavalent arsenic species, in order to improve sensitivity <b>of</b> this method. <b>Limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> around 10 ng·dm- 3 are achieved.

2500|$|In addition, {{poppy seed}} {{consumption}} does {{not serve as}} a defense for heroin consumption. [...] This is because a unique metabolite (6-monoacetylmorphine) is produced from heroin use that is never produced from consuming any other substance, even other opiates like the ones present in poppy seeds. [...] Modern tests can thus readily determine whether it was heroin or some other opiate that was ingested, should someone who had used heroin try to claim he or she merely ate poppy seeds. It is widely believed {{that there is no}} way to distinguish between poppy seeds and any other kind of opiate. However a study published by the University of Connecticut's Department of Chemistry, proposed that Thebaine could be used as a marker of poppy seed consumption. They examined the urine of test subjects given 11grams of poppy seeds, the urine of heroin users and clean urine spiked with thebaine, as a reference for GC-MS. They also tested street heroin, 1 morphine tablet and 1 codeine tablet. Urine specimens were screened by EMIT and confirmed for thebaine by GC-MS using a solid-phase extraction method. Only the subjects who had consumed the poppy seeds had thebaine in their urine, with concentrations ranging from 2 to 81ng/mL with a <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> of 0.5ng/mL.

The electrochemical behavior of the compounds depends mainly on pH of the solution; the best results are obtained in acidic medium.
