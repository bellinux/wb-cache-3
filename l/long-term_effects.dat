5|$|In 1976, {{thousands}} of inhabitants of Seveso, Italy {{were exposed to}} TCDD after an accidental release of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. A number of animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of chloracne. <b>Long-term</b> <b>effects</b> seem to include a slight excess of multiple myeloma and myeloid leukaemia, {{as well as some}} developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth and excess of girls born to fathers who were exposed as children.

5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} the <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> of large-scale projects on organisational effectiveness is investigated {{with respect to}} organisational structure, -culture and working approach. This study is potentially relevant for the Port Authorities of Rotterdam and Antwerp, for organisations inspired by Industrial Ecological solutions and for organisations in general that aim for effectiveness improvement. The Port of Rotterdam and Port of Antwerp are international seaports that are crucial for world economy; however both have a high potential for environmental impact. Over the recent years, the awareness about this impact {{and the number of}} related initiatives have been increasing within the Port Authorities. Meanwhile, dynamics of international trade drove the Port Authorities to expand their port capacity via respectively the Maasvlakte 2 and Deurganckdok. However, they experienced unfavourable but inescapable resistances, such as rejection(s) by the Council of State. Internal organisational changes took place within the Port Authorities to anticipate on the high level of project complexity and to further execute the project strategies. Specific focus was on environmental impact and stakeholder involvement. Better understanding about organisational characteristics might contribute to improvement of such anticipation in case of further port development and to the yielding of successes from internal organisational strengths. This research provides a methodological framework to identify these organisational characteristics (via typification of the organisational structure and -culture) and subsequently investigate the <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> of a large-scale development project on the organisational effectiveness (via analysing the change in organisational characteristics and in working approach, and the relation between them). This framework is conceived from a range of acknowledged methods, which are selected from a literature study performed within a prior determined scope. It is applied to the Port of Rotterdam and Port of Antwerp Authorities regarding respectively the Maasvlakte 2 and Deurganckdok project. Results show that the Maasvlakte 2 project had significant <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> in organisational structure, no apparent <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> in organisational culture and significant <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> in working approach. The Deurganckdok project had significant <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> in organisational structure, apparent <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> in organisational culture and clearly visible <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> in working approach. Recommendations with respect to performed research include improvement of the organisational typifications representativeness and further integration of the different framework elements. Those with respect to further research include the performance of further empirical testing of the framework usability, the integration of external factors able to influence organisational effectiveness and the investigation of framework potential as a tool along strategy development.

5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E
5|$|Nonpolar {{antioxidants}} such as eugenol—a {{major component}} of oil of cloves—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the misuse of undiluted essential oils. Toxicity associated with high doses of water-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in urine. More seriously, very high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful <b>long-term</b> <b>effects.</b> The beta-carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer. Subsequent studies confirmed these adverse effects.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher's premiership {{was also}} marked by periods of high {{unemployment}} and social unrest, and many critics {{on the left}} of the political spectrum fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by mass unemployment as well as her monetarist economic policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as drug abuse and family breakdown. Unemployment did not fall below its 1979 level during her tenure, although in June 1990 the recorded rate (5.4%) was lower than the rate in April 1979 (5.5%). The <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.|$|E

5|$|Australian {{operations}} in Phuoc Tuy province continued throughout {{the remainder of}} 1967, and although they were largely successful at the tactical level, the Viet Cong continued {{to be able to}} enter most of the villages in the province, and were causing increasingly heavy Allied casualties with mines lifted from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians. Operation Santa Fe, a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place between October and November, but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to the resources committed. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> of Australian {{operations in}} the province which had increased the population's sense of security. As a result, 1 ATF now turned its attention to expanding its area of operations.|$|E
5|$|Because of the <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> of inflation, {{notably the}} {{significant}} increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while {{commonly found in}} the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E
5|$|Children with RAD are {{presumed to}} have grossly {{disturbed}} internal working models of relationships {{that may lead}} to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of <b>long-term</b> <b>effects,</b> and {{there is a lack of}} clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.|$|E
