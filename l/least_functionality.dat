40|$|In {{order to}} {{minimize}} human interference, an Automated Wireless Identification System (AWIS) is proposed to monitor individual animals ’ interactions in the wild. This {{is based on a}} Bluetooth enabled collar (device) fitted to each animal. When one device comes into the 10 meter range of another device, a peer-to-peer interaction or “Encounter ” is logged. Application developers can utilise the underlying capabilities of the Bluetooth Protocol Stack via an API – Application Programming Interface. The Bluetooth Specification makes no mention of how a simple exposed API is defined, leading many manufacturers to add their own unique APIs. This project investigated Bluetooth Microsoft APIs (Winsock and Virtual Serial Ports) and a proprietary API from Widcomm, with a view to evaluate their support for monitoring mobile device Encounters in real time for the AWIS. In order to compare Bluetooth APIs, it was necessary to use the tools available directly, to observe how the APIs enable Bluetooth development. Winsock and Virtual Serial Ports are the recommended Windows APIs and Widcomm {{is one of the many}} available proprietary APIs. Experimental applications were written to test the most suitable API to use in an AWIS application. A criterion is used for testing was the functionality required by the AWIS device discovery, service discovery and data-transfer, as well as flexibility and enabling rapid prototyping. The Widcomm API was found to be the most suitable API for the AWIS implementation as it allows for a great deal of low-level functionality while hiding any unnecessary detail from the developer. Virtual Serial Ports provided limited functionality and flexibility, and Winsock provided the <b>least</b> <b>functionality...</b>|$|E

In a relational DBMS, views are defined by queries. However, they can not be freely updated. We describe concepts of an object model and query language that are necessary for object view definitions. We show that updating object views is much more feasible than in the case of relational views. The key property of a query language leading to this result is object preserving operator semantics.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of an earthquake {{it is essential that}} drinking Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and the relative distribution network keep their full, or at <b>least,</b> partial <b>functionality.</b> Indeed, a complete failure of such systems, associated to a long restoration time can result in serious damages to facilities and services depending on water supply as well as harmful consequences for the population. Actually, a WTP shutdown can amplify the damages caused by an earthquake in terms of economical and human losses by failing the supply of fire fighting network and consequently the extinguishment of potential fires, as well as getting worse the hygienic and sanitary conditions of population affected by the natural events, thus favouring the outbreaks of epidemics as it happened in Haiti, where cholera killed {{hundreds of thousands of people}} after the earthquake of January 12 th, 2010. This paper deals with the assessment of seismic vulnerability of WTPs that constitute the first element of the water distribution network by analyzing the effects of past earthquakes on them with the aim of determining the main causes of damage (ground failure, sloshing phenomenon, structural weakness, etc…) as well as the weaker elements and then, on the base of risk analysis theory, drawing fragility curves that can be useful tools for designing reliable new WTPs and controlling the resilience of those already in service...|$|R

On the other hand, known protocols tolerating an arbitrary number of corruptions do not guarantee fairness or output delivery even if only a single party is dishonest. It is natural to wonder whether it is possible to achieve the “best of both worlds”: namely, a single protocol that simultaneously achieves the best possible security in both the above settings.

In general access to this data is provided through catalogues enabling searching for products, retrieving their metadata, providing order options and ordering them. One challenge of designing catalogues is to address the very diverse demands of a broad variety of users. Beneath referring to the graphical user interface, those demands include at a major extend the need of integrating or combining the functionalities of specific catalogues into external systems, requiring catalogues to provide accessibility through a variety of protocols like CIP, SOAP, OpenGIS, etc. Further catalogues must be extensible to support future missions and therefore new types of products including new metadata structures. At <b>least</b> the <b>functionalities</b> for ordering products must be generic to be adaptable for future requirements as well. This paper gives a more detailed overview about the challenges going along with designing catalogue implementations and describes a generic structure applicable for new catalogues considering the earth observation data catalogue EOWEB® (Earth Observation on the WEB) provided by the DLR as a reference implementation. The focus will be the modelling of metadata structures and the generation of protocol specific functionality for accessing the metadata of products directly without a protocol translation. Further this paper will show up possibilities for providing protocol independent order option retrieval mechanisms and ordering facilities.

40|$|The {{detection}} {{and control of}} microorganisms such as bacteria is important {{in a wide range}} of industries and clinical settings. Detection, binding and removal of such pathogenic contaminants can be achieved through judicious consideration of the targets which are available at or in the bacterial cell. Polymers have the ability to present a number of binding ligands for cell targeting on one macromolecule and so avidity of interaction can be greatly increased. The goal of the project was to test whether polymers generated with bacteria in situ would have their composition significantly altered to determine if a templating process was occurring. It was also anticipated that the templated polymers would have better re-binding properties than those produced in the absence of bacteria. A series of chemical functionalities were analysed for their binding properties to bacteria. The functionalities were chosen with consideration to the cell surface characteristics. Further to identification of the most binding and <b>least</b> binding <b>functionalities</b> the polymers were tested for their cytotoxicity aga. inst bacteria and human epithelial cells. Concentration ranges were determined which could facilitate bacterial binding and templating yet minimise the lethality of the processes. Templated polymers of the bacteria were generated using a novel method of atom transfer radical 27 polymerisation (ATRP) which we have termed bacterial activated atom transfer radical polymerisation (b-ATRP). This polymerisation method has maximised the potential for templating processes to occur during the polymerisation. Templated polymers differed in both their composition and their binding behaviour to non-templated polymers. The bacterial organic reduction process has also been demonstrated to have greater scope for use within the organic chemistry field as demonstrated by the use of this system to enable in "click-chemistry" via the reduction of copper. 28 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Unfortunately, this scheme allows these third parties to track individual users across the web, creating privacy concerns and leading to reactions to prevent tracking via blocking, legislation and standards. While improving user privacy, these efforts {{do not consider}} the functionality third-party tracking enables publishers to use: to obtain aggregate statistics about their users and increase their exposure to other users via online social networks. Simply preventing third-party tracking without replacing the functionality it provides cannot be a viable solution; leaving publishers without essential services will hurt the sustainability of the entire ecosystem. In this thesis, we present alternative approaches to bridge this gap between privacy for users and functionality for publishers and other entities. We first propose a general and interaction-based third-party cookie policy that prevents third-party tracking via cookies, yet enables social networking features for users when wanted, and does not interfere with non-tracking services for analytics and advertisements. We then present a system that enables publishers to obtain rich web analytics information (e. g., user demographics, other sites visited) without tracking the users across the web. While this system requires no new organizational players and is practical to deploy, it necessitates the publishers to pre-define answer values for the queries, {{which may not be}} feasible for many analytics scenarios (e. g., search phrases used, free-text photo labels). Our second system complements the first system by enabling publishers to discover previously unknown string values to be used as potential answers in a privacy-preserving fashion and with low computation overhead for clients as well as servers. These systems suggest {{that it is possible to}} provide non-tracking services with (at <b>least)</b> the same <b>functionality</b> as today’s tracking services...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on the determinants of health, including alcohol consumption, has focussed on differences in individual socio-economic status as a primary risk factor. However, {{it has been shown that}} variation in health between places can be attributed to both the characteristics of the people who live in those places (composition) and also to the characteristics of the places where people live (context). From the 1990 s, there has been considerable interest in the role of neighbourhoods, specifically whether their social and physical characteristics are important in explaining inequalities in health. The main aim of this thesis is to determine the influence of ‘place’ effects on alcohol-related behaviour and health and social outcomes in New Zealand. To achieve this, data was obtained for hospitalisation and mortality directly related to alcohol consumption. Age standardised rates of alcohol related hospitalisation and mortality were calculated for different census areas units over time. Secondly, a database of all alcohol outlets including type and category was obtained from the Liquor Licensing Authority and geocoded for all meshblocks in New Zealand. Using ArcGIS road network <b>functionality,</b> <b>least</b> cost distance to nearest alcohol outlets was calculated. In addition, two buffers (800 and 3000 metres) were created around the population weighted centroids of each meshblock. Statistical analysis was undertaken to examine the distribution of alcohol outlets in areas of differing socio-economic status. Thirdly, binary logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between various access measures developed and individual alcohol related behaviour from the New Zealand Health Survey (2006 / 07). Lastly, Ordinary Least Squares regression was used to establish the association between the density of alcohol outlets and crime, and alcohol related hospitalisation. The results reveal there is increasing geographic inequality of both hospitalisation and mortality between the most and the least deprived areas in New Zealand. Secondly, the results consistently show there is inequity in the availability of alcohol outlets; there are clear social patterns in the distribution of alcohol outlets with disproportionately high numbers in more socially deprived neighbourhoods. Thirdly, at the national level, after controlling for potential confounding factors, there was no association between either hazardous or frequent consumption of alcohol and access to alcohol outlets. However, there was an association for particular sub-populations in regards to hazardous and frequent consumption and access to alcohol outlets. Fourthly, although the explained variance was often quite low in outcome models for crime and hospitalisation, nevertheless most of the variance for crime was predicted by the density of alcohol outlets. A number of important theoretical and policy implications flow from this study. Alcohol outlets are modifiable structures in the environments that are amenable to policy interventions at a community and national level. Interventions could concentrate on three aspects to reduce excess consumption; zoning ordinances, reducing alcohol outlets in deprived areas and increased alcohol taxation. Starting with the first proposed intervention, zoning ordinances provide communities and local governments with the opportunity to regulate outlet numbers and locations as well as their trading hours. This intervention has the potential to reduce opportunities for obtaining alcohol. Secondly, a reduction in the number of alcohol outlets is likely to reduce consumption and consequently improve health and social outcomes. Finally, higher alcohol prices via increased taxation is likely to be a deterrent to excess consumption and related health outcomes. Three priority areas are identified and recommended for future research. Studies using a mixture of both qualitative and quantitative methods, to better understand the association between local purchases of alcohol, consumption and proximity to alcohol outlets would be beneficial. In addition, the use of qualitative methods to examine the influence of social capital and cohesion, culture and norms on alcohol consumption in areas with higher densities of, and better access to alcohol outlets, is imperative. Lastly, longitudinal studies are also recommended to investigate increases or decreases in the number of alcohol outlets over time and the impact of such changes on the consumption patterns of different sub-populations...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) D=E Q can {{be thought}} of as a logo for the research. It is not meant to be {{directly}} interpreted as an equation, rather as a thought provoking visual statement “Design = Energy to the power of ‘Q’ the question asked”. This visual statement refers to the theorising of Dilnot (1999) and Jonas (2000) who argue that the domain of design is ‘artefact’ centric, positioned in one corner of a triangular model of knowledge creation (Archer, 1979). The other two corners of Archer’s triangle are occupied by the humanities, which use ‘words’ in one corner and the sciences, which uses ‘numbers’ in the other. In their theorising, design occupies the third corner and uses artefacts as its major form of communication. D=E Q is an artefact. A symbolic representation of the research but how does it communicate? How does any artefact communicate? This research undertakes a process, which aims to reveal the 'silent language' of design through a systemised analysis of the three artefacts designed for this study. Each design will have at <b>least</b> the nominal <b>functionality</b> of a source of lighting but they (both individually and as a set) will be more. Their real purpose is to reveal the logos of the logo. They facilitate a discourse on the relationship between theory and practice. They probe the relationship between text and artefact, and they are examples of artefacts designed from, for and of questions. To achieve this, a review of seminal thinkers in design theory was undertaken which identifies a heart of darkness at the core of the relationship between theory and practice. This is followed by a short review of education literature to uncover if the heart of darkness phenomena has implications in Design domain educational settings. As a result of the review a research plan was formulated which utilises a mixture of practice led and case study methodologies to further the exploration of the relationship between the text and artefact through the imposing of an experimental context to the undertaking of three designs, which are nominally lights. The experimental parameters developed as the study progresses were: Artefact before text - Text before artefact - Text and artefact in unison. How this could be achieved was not known at the start of the research and its success in many respects is for the reader to judge. But the experiment was undertaken and the results set out in this document. That the designs were lights was not an arbitrary decision. The intrinsic nature of the function of lighting complements the study and is highly symbolic of the research intent. To illuminate that which cannot be seen, that which was not known. Structurally the light parameter provides the intellectual focus and the constraints required to allow the act of design to take place. The procedure for undertaking the three individual designs is set out below. The first light can be viewed as a control. It follows a relatively standard approach within design practice. The artefact itself was the focus, generated out of a desire to create, with the analysis of the object being a post analyses. Not so typically this post analysis utilises the literary style of story telling to expose the now silent message embedded in the artefacts creation but post analysis of artefacts in its many text centric forms is highly typical within design. The second case study was a design undertaken after the recording of an experience in the form of a text-based document. This is in contrast to the method of design utilised for the first light design where the design was produced before the recording of a text. The experience to be explored is participation in a jury. The text produced was rich with thoughts and emotions. The text also recorded a discernable unit of experience, which can be argued to be discrete from the typical manifestation of design practice. The text exists before the artefact and the text is used as the starting point for the creation of a light design. The undertaking of this case study also provides the opportunity to contemplate the role of judgement in the design process. The third design is another exploration into the relationship between artefact and text but this time artefact and text are treated simultaneously and not separately. The experiment will be undertaken to complete the triptych of designs, which explore the theoretical implications of theory and practice, artefact and text in relation to Archer’s model. The third design also provides a triangulation of the results in relation to the original design and second light design created for this research. The line of enquiry will conclude by returning to D=E Q. The artefact located at the starting point for this research. The logos of the logo is discussed, as are the results of the three case studies, in relation to what they reveal about the relationship between theory and practice, text and artefact. The conclusion is not an empirical finding. This thesis demonstrates the creation of a logo, a myth, and an innovative approach to addressing the theory practice relationship through the constructing of a practice led enquiry that experiments with the positioning of text and artefact in the design process. The results of the enquiry reveal that theory and practice in design have a difficult relationship but they are not opposites and that questions have a powerful influence on design. That exploring the logos of the logo of this study can further the design disciplines understanding of the relationship between theory and practice...|$|R
