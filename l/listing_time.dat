50|$|Listing a {{property}} commonly incurs certain {{expenses for the}} listing broker and takes some time and effort for the listing salesperson. To make it worthwhile, they want a certain minimum <b>listing</b> <b>time</b> period {{to have a good}} chance of selling the property. However, the listing contract must have an expiration date. A typical listing period is often three to six months. If the property is not sold or under a purchase contract by then, the seller may decide to re-list the property, perhaps with a different listing price, with the same or a different broker or agent, or not list it at all. The listing of the property can start at a date later than the date the listing contract is signed to allow the seller time to prepare the property for showing or sale.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to test the influence factors underpricing shares at initial public offerings (IPO). At initial public offerings there are tendency that underpricing could happen. Underpricing is a circumstance where a share price is lower at initial public offerings compared to when it is commercialized in secondary market. There are 111 companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) during year 2000 to 2008. Sample is taken by using purposive sampling. Data are analysed using multiple regression to test relation between underpricing and the company size, company age, <b>listing</b> <b>time,</b> retained capital and return on asset. The result of this thesis, underpricing is influenced significantly by retained capital and return on asset. But company size, company age and <b>listing</b> <b>time</b> are fail to show significant influence to underpricing...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{contains}} an empirical study designed to reveal why {{initial public offerings}} (IPO) of common stocks (A-share) in China are on average under-priced from alternative angles as opposed to more established theories, using a dataset of 880 IPOs from January 1996 to December 2003. A much higher degree of under-pricing compared to developed markets and even other emerging markets is a distinct feature of China’s A-share IPOs. Previous literatures based on classical hypotheses {{have not been able}} to fully explain such high level of under-pricing. Hence, alternative explanations have been put forward by academics as well as practitioner. It is said that the Chinese government has big influences in China’s primary market through tightly controlled issuing system and opaque regulatory constraints. People speculate that such influences have been both intentionally and unintentionally exerted, causing IPO under-pricing. A major contribution of the thesis is to test some new hypotheses based on three untested statements in China’s IPO literatures i. e. speculation effect, “Western Region Development” policy effect and government protection effect, which are all associated with government direct or indirect influences. More specifically, speculation effect hypotheses assume that the government constraints and regulator drawbacks have caused high level of speculation, which in turn drives the IPO under-pricing. “Western Region Development” policy effect hypotheses claim that government intentionally uses IPO under-pricing to lure investments into less developed and thus less favourable western region companies. Government protection effect hypotheses conjecture that IPO under-pricing is a compensation for investors’ concern of potential government interference in the government-protected firms. The thesis finds that speculation effect hypothesis is largely supported by empirical data while the other two are not. The thesis has also re-tested hypotheses advanced in previous literatures including classical information asymmetry hypotheses, ex ante uncertainty hypotheses, investors’ behaviour hypotheses as well as existing China-specific hypothesis such as <b>listing</b> <b>time</b> lag hypothesis. Proxies such as government retention rate that have emerged in privatisation IPO literatures are also borrowed by Chinese researchers looking into China-specific institutional settings such as dominant government control. The thesis finds that information asymmetry hypotheses in general show more strength in explaining China’s IPO under-pricing while empirical evidence for other hypotheses are either mixed or weak. In the end, the thesis finds that alternative angles emerging from the tests of the three statements combined with some classical hypotheses supported by empirical data have a greater power to explain China’s high IPO under-pricing. The so-called “floatation game” hypothesis has been put forward by researchers such as Tian (2003) who claims that the Chinese government makes use of IPOs with different lengths of IPO <b>listing</b> <b>time</b> lag i. e. the time lag between IPO announcement date and actual listing date to adjust the equity market cycle. In other words, the government let go public the IPOs with longer <b>listing</b> <b>time</b> lag thus more likely higher initial returns in the bear market and vice versa. The thesis does not find support to the “floatation game” hypothesis, although the thesis does find that the market cycle is closely related to the IPO under-pricing and the number of IPOs issued...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between market sentiment and future stock rates of return. We used a methodology based on principal component analysis to create a sentiment index for the Brazilian market with data from 1999 to 2008. The sample consisted of companies listed on BM&FBOVESPA which were grouped into quintiles, each representing a portfolio, according to {{the magnitude of the}} following characteristics: market value, total annualized risk and <b>listing</b> <b>time</b> on BM&FBOVESPA. Next, we calculated the average return of each portfolio for every quarter. The data for the first and last quintiles were analyzed via two-factor ANOVA, using sentiment index of the previous period (positive or negative) as the main factor and each characteristic as controlling factors. Finally, the sentiment index was included in a panel data pricing model. The results indicate a significant and negative relationship between the market sentiment index and the future rates of return. These findings suggest the existence of a reversion pattern in stock returns, meaning that after a positive sentiment period, the impact on subsequent stock returns is negative and vice-versa...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Many {{non-native}} weed pests of food, fiber, and nursery crops pose {{threats to}} U. S. environment and agriculture. Noxious weed regulations {{play an important}} role in preventing the introduction and spread of non-native plants, thereby protecting the local biodiversity, environment and economic activities. However, these regulations could also hamper agricultural trade. The three essays of this dissertation address the causes and consequences of cross-state differences in noxious weed regulations. In the first essay, a political-economic model is developed to derive cross-state regulatory congruence as a function of ecological and agronomic characteristics, and interest-group lobbying through political contributions. Econometric estimation suggests ecological and agronomic dissimilarities are primary causes of cross-state differences in noxious weed regulation. However, evidence of lobbying effects is statistically and economically significant. In particular, agricultural seed producers favor more uniform weed regulations across states, while commodity producers and consumers prefer that their state maintain a distinct weed list to protect its ecosystem and agronomic conditions. The impact of noxious weed regulations on inter-state agricultural trade is measured in the second essay. In particular, the extent of trade distortions arising from interest-groups' lobbying is estimated. For this purpose, each state’s net trade in three industries - agricultural seeds, nursery products and commodities - is derived as a function of weed regulatory congruence. The resulting spatial-autoregressive tobit model of inter-state agricultural trade is estimated using a modified Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The empirical results show that the noxious weed regulatory congruence has a positive and significant effect on inter-state trade flows. Moreover, the inter-state trade distortion from consumer and commodity-producers lobbies is estimated to be as much as 1. 1 billion. In the third essay, a leader-follower framework is used to examine when a weed species on one state's (leader) regulation is added to that of another (follower) state. For this purpose, an ordered logit model of noxious weeds' <b>listing</b> <b>time</b> is specified as a function of invader characteristics and ecosystem invasibility. The empirical results suggest that the invader status and attributes are relatively more important than ecosystem characteristics in determining the weed <b>listing</b> <b>time.</b> Together, the three essays suggest greater emphasis on the use of science than interest-group lobbying for listing noxious weeds. Moreover, a better documentation of potential invaders, their characteristics and impacts on non-native environments, is important in controlling the introduction and spread of noxious weeds, and the consequent economic and ecological damages...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Primary graft {{dysfunction}} (PGD) is a {{major cause}} of mortality within the first year following lung transplantation. Pulmonary hypertension, elevated body mass index (BMI), prolonged ischaemic time of the graft, intraoperative blood transfusions > 1000 ml and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation increase the risk for PGD. We aimed to evaluate whether dyslipidaemia is an additional risk factor for the development of PGD. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed demographic and clinical data of 264 patients who received their first bilateral lung transplantation between March 2000 and October 2013 at our institution. The endpoint was PGD grade 3 at any time, defined according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) criteria. Fasting lipid profiles at <b>listing</b> <b>time</b> or just before transplantation (baseline) were documented and dyslipidaemia was defined as any of the parameters being out of range. Comparisons of continuous variables between patients with PGD grade 3 and patients without were performed with the Mann-Whitney U-test, whereas proportions were compared with the χ(2) test. Continuous variables were presented as arithmetic means with standard deviation for ease of comparison, but levels of statistical significance were computed using the appropriate non-parametric statistical test. To identify PGD risk factors, a forward stepwise logistic regression model was used. RESULTS: PGD occurred in 63 recipients (24...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveTimely {{access to}} {{necessary}} medicines that Australians need {{is one of}} the four pillars of the Australian Government's National Medicines Policy. We were interested to determine whether there was a change in the time taken for medicines to be listed once recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). MethodsDescriptive statistics were used to show the pattern of recommendations for PBAC meetings from 1999 to 2003. For successful recommendations, we developed a linear regression model to analyze the time to list from the PBAC meeting to date of <b>listing</b> (<b>time</b> to list). The model determined whether this time had changed over the 4 -year period, and the reasons for any changes. ResultsThe PBAC made 307 positive recommendations at its 17 meetings over the study period. Ninety percent resulted in a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) listing on or before April 1, 2005. Eighty-two percent of the recommendations made in 1999 and 2000 resulted in early or on-time listings. In 2001, 2002, and 2003, the comparable proportions were 67 %, 68 %, and 75 %. Mean times to list for the years from 1999 to 2003 were similar (approximately 23 weeks), except in 2001 where it was 30 weeks. ConclusionsOver the study period, 90 % of all PBAC recommendations resulted in a PBS listing. In 2001 there was a statistically significant increase in the mean time to list. In addition, it appears that recommendations for new listings and new indications (medicines that are likely to result in substantial Government expenditure) were associated with a longer time to list...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} {{the risk of death}} or urgent transplant for patients who survived an initial 6 months on the outpatient heart transplant waiting list when criteria emphasizing reduced peak oxygen consumption are used for transplant candidate selection. BACKGROUNDWaiting time is a key criterion for heart donor allocation. A recent single-center investigation described decreasing survival benefit from transplant for patients who survived an initial 6 months on the outpatient waiting list. METHODSKaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed for 80 patients from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) listed from July 1986 to January 1991, and 132 patients from Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) listed from September 1993 to September 1995. Survival from the time of outpatient listing for the entire group (ALL) was compared to subsequent survival from 6 months onward for those patients who survived the initial 6 months after placement on the outpatient list (6 M). Both urgent transplant and left ventricular assist device implantation were considered equivalent to death; elective transplant was censored. RESULTSSurvival for 6 M was not significantly better than ALL at HUP (subsequent 12 months: 60 ± 7 vs. 60 ± 6 % [mean ± SD]; p = 0. 89) nor at CPMC (subsequent 12 months: 60 ± 6 vs. 48 ± 5 %; p = 0. 35). Survival for 6 M at both centers was substantially lower than survival following transplant from the outpatient list in the United States in 1995. CONCLUSIONSWhen high-risk patients are selected for nonurgent transplant listing, mortality remains high, even among those who survive the initial six months after <b>listing.</b> <b>Time</b> accrued on the waiting list remains an appropriate criterion for donor allocation...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} how expected sale time of housing in Finland is formed and which factors {{have an effect on}} it. I use marketing time of dwellings as a proxy of expected sale time. This is a descriptive study in nature, because no earlier papers with Finnish data exist to compare the results with. The analysis covers housing features as well as its location. In addition, I study macro-economy and date of market entry related variables' effects on expected sale time. For most individuals, housing transactions are largest investment decisions of their lives and I aim to explain the high variation in the sale times within the Finnish housing market and in comparison with other asset classes. DATA I study my research questions mainly based on housing advertisements from January 2004 to July 2012. The advertisement data was collected from three sources: Etuovi, Oikotie and Kiinteistömaailma. In addition, I collected real transaction data from asuntojen. hintatiedot. fi and various background data from Statistics Finland. RESULTS The results show that nearly all available housing and listing date related features have a statistically significant relationship with expected sale time. I also find that submarkets within certain cities do not vary much from the city consensus and more variation is present at times with poor state of economy. Results suggest that a seller with no rush to sell should wait for the optimal <b>listing</b> <b>time</b> to ensure her dwelling to raise interest in the market. I find that buyers' search criteria selection has a clear link to expected sale time as well. With a careful selection of listing price the seller may lower her dwelling's expected sale time...|$|E
