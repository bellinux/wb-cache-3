5|$|O'Connell's strict classics-oriented {{education}} in Ireland stood him in good stead for his early career choices of teacher and journalist. In San Francisco, he formed friendships with artists and influential men who joined {{with him in}} presenting and promoting theatrical productions and in publishing books and newspapers. He wrote short stories for magazines and journals, and <b>lived</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> rich in food, drink, and the arts. A dedicated family man in America, O'Connell never lost his Irish poet's sense of overarching sadness joined with keen pleasure in the sensations of the physical world.|$|E

5|$|Ray's {{last three}} films, made after his {{recovery}} and with medical strictures in place, were shot mostly indoors, {{and have a}} distinctive style. They have more dialogue than his earlier films and are often regarded as inferior to his earlier body of work. The first, Ganashatru (An Enemy of the People) is an adaptation of the famous Ibsen play, and considered the weakest of the three. Ray recovered some of his form in his 1990 film Shakha Proshakha (Branches of the Tree). In it, an old man, who has <b>lived</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> of honesty, comes to learn of the corruption of three of his sons. The final scene shows the father finding solace only in the companionship of his fourth son, who is uncorrupted but mentally ill. Ray's last film, Agantuk (The Stranger), is lighter in mood but not in theme. When a long-lost uncle arrives to visit his niece in Calcutta, he arouses suspicion as to his motive. This provokes far-ranging questions in the film about civilisation.|$|E

25|$|His {{father was}} a lawyer with a {{struggling}} practice in a small city, and never enjoyed financial security. His parents <b>lived</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> of shabby gentility, employing servants and tutors they could scarcely afford, although their financial situation improved somewhat following a move to Toronto around 1890, where King lived with them for several years in a duplex located in a then-respectable neighborhood, Beverley Street, while studying at the University of Toronto.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} whether the late pontiff should or not be declared Venerable, theologians {{and the members of}} the Congregation for the Causes of Saints must determine if the late pope <b>lived</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> of heroic virtue. This meeting took place on 1 June 2017 in which theologians unanimously approved the fact that the late pope exercised virtues to a heroic degree. The cardinal and bishop members discussed the cause on 7 November 2017 and issued their unanimous approval.|$|E

25|$|Returning to the United States in triumph, Morphy {{toured the}} major cities playing chess {{on his way back}} to New Orleans. By 1859, on {{returning}} to New Orleans, Morphy declared he was retiring from chess to begin his law career. However, Morphy was never able to establish a successful law practice and ultimately <b>lived</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> of idleness, living off his family's fortune. Despite appeals from his chess admirers, Morphy never returned to the game, and died in 1884 from a stroke at the age of 47.|$|E
25|$|Paleo-Americans first {{inhabited}} what is {{now known}} as Nicaragua as far back as 12,000 BCE. In later pre-Columbian times, Nicaragua's indigenous people were part of the Intermediate Area, between the Mesoamerican and Andean cultural regions, and within the influence of the Isthmo-Colombian area. Nicaragua's central region and its Caribbean coast were inhabited by Macro-Chibchan language ethnic groups. They had coalesced in Central America and migrated also to present-day northern Colombia and nearby areas. They <b>lived</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> based primarily on hunting and gathering, as well as fishing, and performing slash-and-burn agriculture.|$|E

During their time in exile the family {{became more and more}} dispersed. Alice suffered a nervous breakdown and was institutionalized in Switzerland. Their daughters married and settled in Germany, separated from Andrew, and Philip was sent to school in England, where he was brought up by his mother's British relatives. Andrew went to live in the South of France.|$|E

25|$|Another {{major change}} made was that Lois {{did not fall}} in love with just Superman, {{although}} she was attracted to him. One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this newly revised concept, it was Clark Kent who <b>lived</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview. This sometimes ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until The Adventures of Superman #460–463 and Action Comics #650.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he managed}} huge sums in the {{development}} and construction of new neighborhoods, and his critics accused him of profiting from his activities, Rivlin <b>lived</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> of penury. Though he moved from house to house, he often had to sell the first house before the next one was built. He left nothing to his children, not even a house, and was unable to pay the doctors who treated him during his final illness. Rivlin died in his home in the Ezrat Yisrael neighborhood on Shabbat, 5 September 1897, at the age of 59. Payment for his medical care, as well as funds to provide for his widow and children after his death, were provided by Baron Shimon Wolf Rothschild of Frankfurt.|$|E
25|$|Various Puranas narrate {{the greatness}} of bathing in the Yamuna. The Padma Purana narrates {{the story of two}} brothers, who <b>lived</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> of indulgence and lust and gave up the virtuous ways. They finally plunged in poverty and resorted to robbery and were killed by beasts in the forest. Both of them reached Yama's court for judgement. While the elder brother was sentenced to Naraka (hell), the younger was granted Svarga (heaven). Astonished, the younger brother asked the reason for it, as both lived similar lives. Yama {{explained}} that the younger brother had lived in the ashram of a sage on Yamuna's banks and bathed in the sacred river for two months. The first month absolved him of sins and the second one granted him place in heaven.|$|E
