40|$|Abstract. Full-scale of U-type and grooved-type slotted {{end plate}} (SEP) {{connections}} are tested {{to determine their}} failure modes and damage mechanisms under ultimate loading. Simulate on mechanical behaviors of U-type and grooved-type SEP connections under compression using finite element software ANSYS based on the experimental research. Obtain load-vertical displacement curves of the SEP connections, and compare with the experimental results to determine {{the validity of the}} model. On this basis, this paper provide the improved SEP connections, and contrast with the U-type and grooved-type SEP connections. The results indicate that finite element results are in good agreement with experimental data. Difference of the ultimate load between the test specimen and finite element model is less than 10 %. The finite element can simulate mechanical behaviors of the SEP connections better. The ultimate bearing capacity of the UC-type SEP connected joints is significantly higher than the U-type and grooved-type, which shows the improved SEP Connections is reasonable and effective. SEP is the main factor of the U-type and grooved-type SEP Connections ’ ultimate <b>load,</b> <b>tube</b> is controlling factor of the UC-type SEP connected joints...|$|E

30|$|The {{choice of}} imaging {{parameters}} determines the image {{quality and the}} radiation dose. Generally, examinations with high kV and mAs settings, thin collimation and low pitch result in the best image quality. The downside is a relatively high radiation exposure of the patient and increased examination time and <b>tube</b> <b>loading.</b> <b>Tube</b> <b>loading</b> is no longer relevant for the newer multidetector-row CTs (MD-CT). For older generation scanners, the technical ability of the scanner will determine the practically achievable collimation, pitch and exposure factors.

In particular, movement artefact can render examinations non-diagnostic. In confused or otherwise uncooperative patients, exam speed rather than top resolution might be the main priority.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe current {{trend in}} car body {{construction}} concerning light weight design and car safety improvement increasingly requires an adaption {{of the local}} material properties on the component load. Martensitic hardenable steels, which are typically used in car body components, show a significant hardening effect, for instance in laser welded seams.

The strength in the treated zone was determined at crash relevant strain rates.

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} plastic (FRP) tanks and pipes exposed to corrosive environment in hydrometallurgical process plants {{are expected to}} degrade. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop a series of tests which are sensitive to the exposure and will be able to distinguish different materials used for this purpose. In this study both FRP material (pipes and plates) and resins were exposed to different acidic solutions at different temperatures, exposure durations. They were tested by the help of standard ASTM and developed test methods to study whether these tests are sensitive indicators of exposure and if these tests could be used for distinguishing between different materials in their susceptibility to exposure. Microstructure assessment included tests only on resins, a tensile test (ASTM D 638), a bending test (ASTM D 790), a microhardness test and a heat deflection temperature test (ASTM D 648). Among these tests the bending test and the microhardness test showed sensitivity to change of exposure conditions (solution, temperature, duration) and material (polyester and vinyl ester). Commercially available FRP tubes were used as samples for the tests on FRPs. Tests on FRP tube section included a tensile test on laterally <b>loaded</b> <b>tube</b> sections, a compression test and a bending test. [...] The bending test and the tensile test on laterally <b>loaded</b> <b>tube</b> sections were the more sensitive among the tests done on the FRP tubes. Microstructure analysis of resins and FRPs before and after exposure showed the effect of exposure on the surface of different resins and provided indication regarding the penetration of the acidic fluid into the material. The tests were carried out after four weeks of exposure which limits the tests results to predict failure due to hydrometallurgical applications of the FRP components. The tests which are more sensitive to the exposure should be carried out {{for a longer period of}} time to predict the lifetime of the fibre {{reinforced plastic}} pipes and tanks...|$|R

40|$|Saturn’s {{magnetic}} field is remarkably axisymmetric. Its dipole axis is inclined {{by less than}} 0. 2 ◦ with respect to its rotation axis. Early evidence for nonaxisymmetry came from the periodicity of Saturn’s kilometric radio bursts (SKR). Subsequently, percent variations of the SKR period were found to occur on timescales of years. A recent breakthrough has been the direct detection of a nonaxisymmetric component of the field that rotates with a period close {{to that of the}} SKR. Because this component’s magnitude varies only weakly with distance from Saturn, it must be supported by currents external to the planet. These currents flow along field lines that connect plasma in the equatorial region of the outer magnetosphere (the plasma disk) to the high latitude ionosphere.

The number of species and individuals increased with sample volume, but only the number of species number varied between morphotypes. Sample volume and the chaetopterid tubes influenced the polychaete assemblage structure, evidencing differences between morphotypes. We suggest that both sample volume and the habitat structuring capacity of the chaetopterid tubes change the habitat complexity of the ascidian aggregations and, hence, produce differences between morphotypes related to the polychaete assemblage structure.

Urine samples containing {{one of the}} five solvents (acetone, methanol, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and toluene) at the levels of biological exposure limits were aspirated into a vacuum tube via holder, a device commercially available for venous blood collection (the vacuum tube method). The urine sample, 5 ml, was quantitatively transferred to a 20 -ml head-space vial prior to HS-GC analysis. The <b>loaded</b> <b>tubes</b> were stored at + 4 °C in dark for up to 3 d. The vacuum tube method facilitated on-site procedures of urine sample preparation for HS-GC with no significant loss of solvents in the sample and no need of skilled hands, whereas on-site sample preparation time was significantly reduced. Furthermore, no loss of solvents was detected during the 3 -d storage, irrespective of hydrophilic (acetone) or lipophilic solvent (toluene). In a pilot application, high performance of the vacuum tube method in sealing a sample in an air-tight space succeeded to confirm that no solvent will be lost when sealing is completed within 5 min after urine voiding, and that the allowance time is as long as 30 min in case of toluene in urine.

40|$|Abstract: By {{changing}} the end constraints, the behaviour of mild steel and aluminium alloy tubes of relatively low D/t ratio, subjected to an axial crushing load, is studied. Many combinations of end constraints were produced by radially constraining {{one or both}} ends of the <b>loaded</b> <b>tube</b> outwards, inwards or in both directions. Partially constrained mild steel and aluminium tubes are found to collapse into either a pure concertina mode or a pure diamond mode, depending on the ratio D/t and the material characteristics. Mixed concertina ± diamond modes would generally result by radially constraining the tube at both ends. Constraining the tube radially outwards at one end does not signi ® cantly aVect the load ± displacement characteristics and the mode of collapse. However, con-straining the tube radially inwards produces a diVerent mode than that observed under outward, inward or combined outward/inward constraint. New modes of collapse have been observed under diVerent combinations of outward and inward constraints at both ends. Fully constraining the tubes in the radial direction results in the removal of the initial overshoot in the load ± displacement curve, which is responsible for the overestimation of the mean crushing load and the energy absorption capacity of tubular elements. The mode of collapse and the energy absorbed could be controlled with the proper choice of the end constraints...|$|R
