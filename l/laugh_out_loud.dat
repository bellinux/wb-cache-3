5|$|Simakis {{praised the}} book for having more depth of {{character}} than Grisham's novels customarily do. She compares the protagonist to Mitch McDeere from The Firm and Rudy Baylor from The Rainmaker. Memmott says {{that most of the}} claimants that they find are unsympathetic, but a few are from somewhat sympathetic immigrant families. Simakis notes that Wally trades sex for legal services with one claimant. Harshaw says that the book is a bit sentimental and comparatively lacking in terms of secondary character development for Grisham. Larry Orenstein of Canada's Globe and Mail notes that on the dramatic scale this book has instances of <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> humor that make it more like Boston Legal than The Practice, which Boston Legal was spun off from.|$|E

500|$|Even if {{the subject}} of the film is political, Weingartner said, [...] "the whole idea of 'Edukating' is playful. The movie is full of jokes. And happiness.

I want people to go see the film and have fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Response to MOBA's {{opening and}} {{continued}} success is, for some, evocative {{of the way}} art is treated in society. MOBA works {{have been described as}} [...] "unintentionally hilarious", similar to the atrocious films of Ed Wood. Visitors—and even MOBA staff—often <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> at displays. In Gullible's Travels, Cash Peters [...] contrasted this behavior with what is expected of patrons at galleries such as Southern California's Getty Museum; though viewers might find the art at the Getty equally hilarious, were they to show it they would almost certainly be thrown out.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Dan Iverson gave a mixed review, commenting that [...] "it is only passable" [...] {{and that}} [...] "it {{did not have}} that <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> funny" [...] concept. However, Iverson {{positively}} comments that the voice of Jillian by Drew Barrymore was perfect. Iverson added that it's [...] "pretty humorous in this episode was how they made fun of mediocre films." [...] In conclusion, Iverson gave the episode a final rating of 6.9/10. The press release for this episode commented that Jillian is a [...] "very attractive but intellectually challenged," [...] giving no negative comments. The entire scene of Buzz Killington discussing bridges to Peter and his friends in a flashback is Barrymore's favorite scene.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{comments from}} TV Squad, with Brett Love commenting that [...] "the suspended license plot {{was a little}} thin, but that's forgivable given {{that this was the}} b-story for the episode, and there are only 22 minutes to work with." [...] Love comments positively on the Stewie and Brian relationship in the episode, commenting that, [...] "the Stewie and Brian story is what made the episode for me. It was very well done, right down to the goofy little details." [...] IGN commented that, [...] "...for Family Guy to have a great episode, it takes a good story and humorous [...] "manatee" [...] gags. [...] "Road to Rupert" [...] was able to deliver on both these fronts, with the majority of the episode's attention focused on Stewie and Brian's road story, meshed with many <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> gags." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Richard Keller of TV Squad thought the finale's theme of Will and Grace's connection {{to each other}} was well-presented by director James Burrows. Keller added, [...] "While not as satisfying as, say, the Friends finale or as crushing as the Seinfeld finale, the series finale to Will & Grace did have its moments {{and came back to}} the original concept of friendship among a close group of people. There were some moments where I did <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> but they were few." [...] CHUD.com's David Oliver praised the finale for not having characters [...] "go on wild tangents that betray who they were during the entirety of the show's run." [...] He also commented that Messing and McCormack are [...] "affecting in their performances" [...] and the episode [...] "nicely summarizes [...] friendship {{over the course of the}} entire show." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Variety, Brian Lowry {{opined that}} with [...] "Mole Hunt," [...] Archer [...] "gives FX {{something}} that the drama-heavy channel hasn't enjoyed for awhile — namely, a sharp comedic arrow in its quiver."

[...] Moreover, though, Toomey praised the dialogue, saying [...] "The {{back and forth between}} Archer and Figgis and Archer and Lana were <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> funny," [...] and noted that he wished he could incorporate the phrase [...] "baby town frolics" [...] from the episode into a conversation. Toomey did, however, say that he felt that the plotting was [...] "a bit of a stretch," [...] and noted that the realization that Krenshaw was actually a Russian spy named Kremenski was [...] "out of nowhere" [...] and [...] "a bit confusing." ...|$|E

Viewers also get to see Mr. Krabs introduced to 'the love of his life' as he develops the secret formula to the Krabby Patty that Bikini Bottom's residents know and love today." [...] On the DVD, Patrick Cossel of Blogcritics said [...] "Children and adults will <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> at the crazy slapstick antics {{of the one who}} lives under the sea."

Sean Gandert, a contributor for Paste magazine, said that Tracy's plot was [...] "pretty awesome". Gandert, {{who has not been}} a fan of the [...] "Dealbreakers" [...] storyline, appreciated it in this episode, opining it had [...] "good writing even by the show's outsized standards."

[...] Dahl hoped Dwight would be reappearing soon, and concluded [...] "Overall, a crucial story episode with a nice cliffhanger. Even if wasn't as funny as last week or even most episodes this season, The Office still entertains." [...] AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea lauded the episode, writing [...] "I cannot remember ever guffawing over every single line in a single sitcom episode as I did watching this one. If the performances in this particular one don't garner the actors in this show a plethora of Emmys, {{there ought to be}} an investigation." [...] Sciannamea continued that he believed it was Steve Carell's best series performance thus far because he [...] "displayed the full range of his personality—jokester, arrogant jerk, charming salesman, sensitive soul, and added a new one—anger." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Chris and Ann {{was described by}} Sundermann as [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} parts of the show and the reason, specifically, is Chris". Likewise, Porter said Lowe and Rashida Jones had developed a [...] "fantastic dynamic". Joel Keller of TV Squad said he found Chris [...] "a little two-dimensional", and believed the relationship was poorly handled because it made Ann too passive. Lowe received particularly strong praise for his role in [...] "Flu Season", in which Chris became extremely ill and hallucinatory when infected with the flu. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said Lowe's character seemed well-integrated into the cast by the episode [...] "Flu Season", and added [...] "If you've never believed Lowe can make you <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> pay attention to that episode." [...] Steve Kandell said Lowe stole the show from the usual Parks powerhouses of Nick Offerman and Chris Pratt, and called one scene, when Lowe tries to will away his flu by yelling to himself in the mirror [...] "Stop...pooping!", the [...] "single greatest self-effacingly comic moment of his long, handsome career".|$|E

[...] Skerry concluded that [...] "there were some seriously funny, <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> moments tonight, but I don’t think this episode {{is going to make}} my favorites list. But even when The Office isn’t at its best, it’s still hands down the best comedy on TV." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A-. In the audio commentary, Wilson noted that [...] "The Coup" [...] is [...] "not a fan favorite," [...] though it was submitted for an Emmy Award. For his work on this episode, Paul Lieberstein was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Comedy.|$|E

To the irritation of the other group members, McCartney endlessly practised the lead guitar intro to [...] "Raunchy" [...] (by saxophonist Bill Justis) and a solo from [...] "Guitar Boogie Shuffle", for days before the engagement, but on the night (after being specially introduced by Lennon as a new member of the group) he missed his cue on [...] "Raunchy", played all the wrong notes, and stepped back in embarrassment between Hanton and Garry.

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Daniel Carlson of The Hollywood Reporter said Parks and Recreation {{appears to be}} a [...] "genuinely funny and engaging comedy" [...] and that inevitable comparisons to The Office are not fair; he also said Poehler [...] "proves instantly she's got the comic intelligence to carry a series like this one". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "Pilot" [...] lacked the [...] "snap and clear character delineation" [...] of The Office, but pointed out that show also appeared flat in early episodes; Tucker said he liked the performances, attitude and atmosphere of the show, although it had few <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> moments. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said the show has the potential to become a [...] "flip, witty political allegory" [...] and praised Poehler and the supporting cast. Los Angeles Times television critic Robert Lloyd praised the show for providing strong female leads, which he said was rare on television. He also said, [...] "It has a kind of sunny charm, a premise fit for a novel... Poehler and Jones have a nice, [...] rhythm. I stamp this show: approved." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1937 Howard Hawks {{signed a}} {{contract}} at RKO for an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's [...] "Gunga Din", which had been in pre-production since the previous fall. When RKO was unable to borrow Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the film and the adaptation of [...] "Gunga Din" [...] was delayed, Hawks began {{looking for a new}} project. In April 1937 he read a short story by Hagar Wilde in Collier's magazine called [...] "Bringing Up Baby" [...] and immediately wanted to make a film from it, remembering that it made him <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud.</b> RKO bought the screen rights in June for $1,004, and Hawks worked briefly with Wilde on the film's treatment. Wilde's short story differed significantly from the film: David and Susan are engaged, he is not a scientist and there is no dinosaur, intercostal clavicle or museum. However, Susan gets a pet panther from her brother Mark to give to their Aunt Elizabeth; David and Susan must capture the panther in the Connecticut wilderness with the help of Baby's favorite song, [...] "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby".|$|E
