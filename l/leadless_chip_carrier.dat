Three modeling approaches were presented in this study: 1) modeling the strain energy under the resultant complex temperature cycling and employing the energy based fatigue life models; 2) segmenting the resultant complex temperature cycle into multiple simple temperature cycles with a single temperature range for each first, then assessing the life expectancy of the solder interconnect under the segmented simple temperature cycles and at last applying Miner's rule to superpose the damage; 3) estimating solder damage under the resultant complex temperature cycling by a standard temperature cycling with a single temperature range.

The input transducer launches an acoustic wave that travels through the chemical film and is detected by the output transducer. The Sandia-made device runs {{at a very}} high frequency (approximately 525 MHz), and the velocity and attenuation of the signal are sensitive to the viscoelasticity and mass of the thin film [...] SAWS have been able to distinguish organophosphates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, saturated hydrocarbons, and water [...] The SAW used in these tests have four channels—each channel consists of a transmitter and a receiver, separated by a small distance. Three of the four channels have a polymer deposited on the substrate between the transmitter and receiver. The purpose of the polymers is to adsorb chemicals of interest, with different polymers having different affinities to various chemicals. When a chemical is adsorbed, the mass of the polymer increases, causing a slight change in phase of the acoustic signal relative to the reference (fourth) channel, which does not contain a polymer.

For components mounted directly on the PWB mounting pads, that is, surface mounted components, the tin-lead solder also constitutes the mechanical interconnection. Eutectic solder has a melting point of 183 °C (361 °F). It is {{important to realize that}} its homologous temperature, defined as the temperature in degrees Kelvin over its melting point temperature (T(m)), also in degrees Kelvin, is defined as T/T(m). At room temperature (25 °C = 298 K), eutectic solder's homologous temperature is 0. 65. It is widely acknowledged that materials having a homologous temperature ≥ 0. 5 are readily subject to creep, and the solder joints of printed wiring assemblies are routinely exposed to temperatures above room temperature. Hence, solder joints tend to be subject to both thermal fatigue and creep. This can lead to premature failures during service conditions. The geometry, that is, the lead configuration, of the joints can also affect failure. Various geometries are better suited to withstand failure than others.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{finite element}} modeling and experimental testing program {{has been carried out}} to determine the most optimum design parameters for solder joints in surface mount applications. Although the analysis and testing (power cycling and thermal cycling) has been carried out for a variety of package styles, particular at-tention will be paid to the result for <b>leadless</b> ceramic <b>chip</b> <b>carriers.</b> This package is particularly useful in certain high performance military and commercial applica-tions. Analysis and experimentation indicate that increased fatigue life under power cycling can be attained by fabricating solder joints with large fillets and low standoff heights. The large fillet geometry significantly reduces harmful stress concentrations while increasing the net cross-sectional area within the joint. Both factors tend to improve the fracture toughness of the joint. The temperature and frequency dependencies of solder joint fatigue life under power cycling testing is discussed. The observed frequency dependence can be minimized by eliminating harmful tensile strain components thus reducing harmful stress relaxation and tensile induced ox-ygen embrittlement of grain boundaries. Temperature cycling studies indicate joints with slightly higher standoffs and low fillet angles are more resistant to cyclic fatigue than pillar type joints which tend to focus shear strains at the interfaces. Solder joints can be tapered to improve overall reliability but, in most cases, tapering will provide only a small increase in fracture toughness of the joint through the elimina-tion of stress concentrations. Additional fatigue life increases can be obtained only through an enlargement of the joint cross-sectional area. Aspects of the above results will be presented in detail along with design guidelines for creating high reliability solder joints for various application scenarios...|$|R
