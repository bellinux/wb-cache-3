40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Anisogramma anomala {{causes a}} stem canker of filberts, Corylus avellana. This disease became {{a threat to}} the main U. <b>S.</b> <b>filbert</b> growing region when it was {{introduced}} into the Pacific Northwest around 1968. Various methods of artificially inoculating filbert trees and seeds were explored. Less than 1 % of potted filbert trees inoculated with ascospores produced symptoms after 4 years. The disease was not transmitted following graft inoculation of orchard trees with infected tissue. Ascospores had no effect on germination or growth of Corylus seedlings. Spread of existing cankers was compared on the susceptible cultivar 'Daviana' and the more resistant cultivar 'Barcelona'. There was no significant difference (t=. 05) in canker elongation between cultivars, or between spread up and down the stems. Vertical elongation of perennial cankers averaged 26. 2 cm/year. Methods for storing ascospores prior to germination, and conditions for germinating ascospores were explored. Spores exhibited no loss of viability after 2 months when cankered twigs were stored below 0 ° C. Ascospores remained viable for less than 14 days following discharge in water. Drying was lethal to hydrated spores. Ascospores commenced germination 24 hours after hydration when placed on a suitable medium in a proper atmosphere. Germination occurred between 5 ° and 25 ° C, with an optimum of 20 °. Optimum pH for germination was between 4. 2 and 5. 7. A direct relationship was detected between ascospore concentration and percent germination. Eight antibiotics were screened in an attempt to prevent bacterial contamination. 10 ppm Rifampicin or 100 ppm Kanamycin effectively inhibited bacterial contaminants without affecting ascospore germination. Germination was compared on many different complex and defined media, and with different amendments added to the media. Various Corylus extracts had no effect on spore germination. 1 % ethanol and 5 % sucrose increased germination. Casamino acids, cornmeal or peptone promoted growth beyond the initial germ tube. Several stages of ascospore germination and early hyphal growth are described...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} {{of real estate}} assets in organizations whose primary area of activity {{is not related to}} property has only recently become the focus of academic research. This thesis presents the results of a mail survey of 457 property owning organizations in New Zealand in which corporate real estate asset management (CREAM) issues were examined. The results were compared with the only previous study of CREAM in New Zealand, that of Teoh in 1992. In addition, a process was developed whereby multiple factors of CREAM performance identified in previous research by Veale and Pittman and Parker were combined using factor analysis into a single measure of CREAM performance. This performance measure was then used to test for associations between CREAM performance and corporate stage of development as identified by Joroff. M, Louargand, <b>Lambert.</b> <b>S,</b> and Becker. F. Finally, associations between a range of organizational factors and CREAM performance were examined. The findings include details {{on a wide range of}} current CREAM practices in a cross section of New Zealand organizations. These generally reflect prior research from the UK and USA. There has been progress since the research of Teoh, particularly in respect of property management information systems and management attitude towards corporate real estate. A relationship between CREAM performance and corporate real estate stage of development was found, as were associations between a number of organizational factors and high levels of CREAM performance. These included; organizational and portfolio size, qualifications of management, strategic planning, organizational structure, communication, advanced management information systems and decision-making techniques and having an outsourcing strategy...|$|R

40|$|Amber is a fossilized form of terpenoid resin {{found in}} many parts of the world that has {{undergone}} geological maturation over millions of years. It is translucent, of a color that can range from yellow, to red, to brown up to green. Even in its raw form this material has an attractive appearance and it was used by people of many different cultures for decorative objects over several millennia. The knowledge of the chemical structure of amber may allows one to associate a given object with its geographical origin and to draw maps of cultural and trade networks, besides, information on authenticity of artifacts may be obtained. Chemical characteristics of amber depend on both biological origin and geological environment. The non crystalline nature of amber and its poor solubility prevent the use of many analytical techniques. 13 C Solid state NMR spectroscopy has allowed us to obtain information on the chemical structure of amber in a non destructive way and without any manipulation of the sample [1 - 3]. Sicily is a source of highly valued amber whose mineralogical name (Simetite) derives from Simeto River. Sicilian amber is considered by gemological studies as the most valuable in the world for the physical-chemical properties and for its rarity. The limitation of the study of Simetite is due both to the lack of information in literature and the lack of authentic Simetite samples in mineralogical collections. In the study reported here, a collection of numerous Simetite samples was analyzed by NMR and Raman spectroscopy with the aim to trace Simetite with respect to ambers from other regions (Baltic and Dominican Republic) and to create a database of Simetite useful for future studies.

40|$|Two figures {{representing}} a linear and circular economy approach {{with a plastic}} bottle as an example but is applicable to any recycable waste product and especially single-use plastic packaging. In the linear economy model the product is manufactured using principally new resources, largely petroleum based. Most of the product’s value is lost during its life cycle because of leakage along the entire value chain (red arrows), including pellet loss, littering, combined sewage overflow, loss during transport and improper storage of waste, and poorly designed products that are easily lost {{to the environment and}} difficult to recover (microbeads, small wrappers, torn corners of packaging). This leads to a contamination of the environment, affecting wildlife and human well-being. A small proportion is recycled (green arrow) for remanufacture, with the remainder utilized for energy recovery. In the circular economy model a high percentage of recycled content is used as feedstock for new products, and the remainder from sustainable sources (potentially biopolymers). Poor practices (red arrows) throughout the life cycle are mitigated, for example, by proper legislative policy, public awareness that leads to proper consumer waste handling, and incentivized recovery systems (e. g., returnable bottles). Recovery is further improved by regulating end-of-life design in products and packaging. This leads to reduced leakage of plastic to the environment from all sectors of society, and significant improvements are social justice concerns for communities that manage waste. The small amount of residual plastic is then disposed of responsibly. Figure and figure captions originally published in: Eriksen M, Thiel M, Prindiville M, Kiessling T 2018.

40|$|Abstract. For an ElGamal-type {{signature}} scheme using {{a generator}} g of order q, {{it has been}} well-known that the message nonce should be chosen randomly in the interval [1, q − 1] for each message to be signed. Two different approaches to attack ElGamal-type signature scheme have been studied in this regard. One {{is to focus on}} reducing the number of known bits for the nonces [5], and the other is to focus on reducing the number of signatures [2]. In this paper, we follow the second approach. In [2], H. Kuwakado and H. Tanaka proposed a polynomial time algorithm that gives the private key of the signer if two signatures with message nonces 0 < k 1, k 2 ≤ O(√q) are available. We employ the integer decomposition method suggested by R. Gallant, R. <b>Lambert,</b> and <b>S.</b> Vanstone (See [3]) to improve Kuwakado-Tanaka Algorithm. We improve the efficiency and completeness of their algorithm and achieve a rigorous complexity analysis. 1...|$|R
