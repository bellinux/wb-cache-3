5|$|A BLT (Bacon, <b>Lettuce,</b> <b>and</b> Tomato) {{is a type}} {{of bacon}} sandwich. The {{standard}} BLT is made up of four ingredients: bacon, lettuce, tomato, and bread. The BLT evolved from the tea sandwiches served at a similar time to the club sandwich, although it is unclear when the name BLT became the norm.|$|E
5|$|A BLT {{cocktail}} is {{a cocktail}} {{made out of}} the contents of a BLT sandwich, (bacon, <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> tomato), blended together with vodka. Variants on the drink include utilizing bacon vodka instead of traditional vodka, substituting liquor for lettuce, incorporating bacon salt, or including cucumber flavored vodka.|$|E

50|$|While their dietary {{preferences}} {{have not}} been studied in detail, {{it is known that}} they do eat a wide variety of animals and plants including crickets, worms, snails, trout chow, aquatic plants, greens <b>and</b> <b>lettuces,</b> <b>and</b> certain fruits.|$|R
5|$|The tadpoles feed on detritus, algae, and bacteria. Tadpoles in more {{advanced}} phases of development may show {{a preference for}} vegetable matter, but also scavenge or become carnivorous on aquatic life. Captive tadpoles have eaten boiled <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> pet food in pellet form. If population density is high, tadpoles have cannibalised one another.|$|E

Sections are headed, Soups, Small dishes, Salads, Pasta, gnocchi & polenta, Rice, beans & lentils, Main dishes, Breads, and Desserts. Recipes {{range from}} aillade toulousaine (garlic and walnut sauce) and Angevin salad (<b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> endive with Gruyère or Emmenthal cheese) to {{watercress}} and potato soup and zuppa pavese (bread and egg soup). The book was illustrated with photographs by Kristin Perers, {{and published by}} Quadrille.|$|E
5|$|Captive crickets are omnivorous; when {{deprived}} of their natural diet, they accept {{a wide range of}} organic foodstuffs. Some species are completely herbivorous, feeding on flowers, fruit, and leaves, with ground-based species consuming seedlings, grasses, pieces of leaf, and the shoots of young plants. Others are more predatory and include in their diet invertebrate eggs, larvae, pupae, moulting insects, scale insects, and aphids. Many are scavengers and consume various organic remains, decaying plants, seedlings, and fungi. In captivity, many species have been successfully reared on a diet of ground, commercial dry dog food, supplemented with <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> aphids.|$|E

5|$|Due to its short {{lifespan}} after harvest, lettuce {{was originally}} sold relatively {{close to where}} it was grown. The early 20th century saw the development of new packing, storage and shipping technologies that improved the lifespan and transportability of <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> resulted in a significant increase in availability. During the 1950s, lettuce production was revolutionized with the development of vacuum cooling, which allowed field cooling and packing of lettuce, replacing the previously used method of ice-cooling in packing houses outside the fields.|$|E
5|$|In Los Angeles, {{two people}} died of {{injuries}} suffered from slippery roads. One man drowned in El Centro. and two people drowned when their cars tumbled {{into the water}} near the city. Record flood stage was attained at numerous streams near the Coachella Valley. Widespread property damage was recorded on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada {{as well as the}} nearby desert. Across the San Joaquin Valley, 2/3 of the $150 million raisin crop was threatened. Crops including cotton, <b>lettuce,</b> <b>and</b> hay were damaged. About half of the lettuce in the Palo Verde Valley were lost.|$|E
5|$|Other LTO {{products}} {{sought to}} expand existing product lines with new base ingredients. The company's 1992 offering, a Meatloaf Specialty Sandwich, was introduced {{as part of}} a push into limited table service. Other LTO variants in its Specialty Sandwich line included an Italian sausage sandwich served in one of three ways: with onions and peppers; parmigiana-style with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce; or with all four ingredients. Steak sandwiches were made from steak fillets or later, restructured beef. Other offerings were a ham and cheese sandwich with mayonnaise, <b>lettuce,</b> <b>and</b> tomato, and a veal parmigiana sandwich.|$|E

5|$|Some American {{settlers}} {{claimed that}} smallpox could be prevented through the ingestion of <b>lettuce,</b> <b>and</b> an Iranian belief suggested {{consumption of the}} seeds when afflicted with typhoid. Folk medicine has also claimed it {{as a treatment for}} pain, rheumatism, tension and nervousness, coughs and insanity; scientific evidence of these benefits in humans has not been found. The religious ties of lettuce continue into the present day among the Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who have a religious prohibition against eating the plant.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce {{appears in}} many medieval writings, {{especially}} as a medicinal herb. Hildegard of Bingen mentioned {{it in her}} writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses. In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces– head lettuce, loose-leaf <b>lettuce,</b> <b>and</b> romaine (or cos) lettuce. Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century. Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland. Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.|$|E
5|$|The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans {{recommends}} consuming five to nine {{servings of}} fruit and vegetables daily. The total amount consumed will vary according to age and gender, and is determined based upon the standard portion sizes typically consumed, as well as general nutritional content. Potatoes {{are not included in}} the count as they are mainly providers of starch. For most vegetables and vegetable juices, one serving is half of a cup and can be eaten raw or cooked. For leafy greens, such as <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> spinach, a single serving is typically a full cup. A variety of products should be chosen as no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients needed for health.|$|E
50|$|The {{business}} {{began by}} growing <b>lettuces</b> <b>and</b> tomatoes, but increased {{competition from the}} Common Market and rising heating costs saw them move into bedding plants and later pot plants such as poinsettias. They are {{one of only two}} businesses that grow poinsettias in the United Kingdom, growing around 18,000 of the plants in 2012.|$|R
50|$|The {{top side}} {{may also be}} used. On the top side of {{upside-down}} planters, <b>lettuce,</b> radishes <b>and</b> cress may be grown, and herbs or flowers such as marigolds can absorb sunlight to decrease desiccation of the planter; that is, preventing drying out. Unsuited are <b>lettuce,</b> peas <b>and</b> carrots as they do not generally do well, grown upside-down.|$|R
50|$|Florida {{box turtles}} {{can be kept}} as pets. They are omnivores and feed on a huge variety of food in the wild. In captivity, they are {{especially}} fond of live food such as earthworms, crickets, locusts, snails, wax worms (as a treat because of their high fat content), crickets, baby mice. In addition to this large variety of live foods, you can offer chopped fruits and vegetables. Finely grated dark green veggies such as <b>lettuces</b> <b>and</b> kale, and fruits such as melons, berries, cantaloupe, are also accepted (though not eagerly) {{once or twice a}} week.|$|R
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{cultivated}} emmer and barley, {{and several}} other cereal grains, {{all of which were}} used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer. Flax plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing {{on the banks of the}} Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, <b>lettuce,</b> <b>and</b> other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.|$|E
5|$|After Potter's {{death in}} December 1943, Frederick Warne & Co. granted {{licenses}} to various firms {{for the production}} of merchandise based on the Potter characters. Beswick Pottery of Longton, Staffordshire released six porcelain figurines beginning in 1965 depicting characters or scenes from the tale: Flopsy, Mrs. Tittlemouse, Benjamin Bunny, Peter Rabbit Digging, a Flopsy and Benjamin Bunny tableau, and a tableau depicting the sleeping bunnies under the <b>lettuce.</b> <b>and,</b> in 1984, Schmid & Co. of Toronto and Randolph, Massachusetts released a Flopsy Bunnies music box, a flat ceramic Flopsy Christmas ornament, and in 1985 a Flopsy music box. Stuffed toy manufacturers had sought licensing rights as early as 1906 for Potter's characters, {{but it was not until}} the 1970s that an English firm was granted worldwide rights. Their labour-intensive products were unprofitable however, and in 1972, The Eden Toy Company of New York became the exclusive manufacturer of Potter characters. Although Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor were released as plush toys, they were associated with the Peter Rabbit tale and not with that of The Flopsy Bunnies. None of The Flopsy Bunnies characters were released as Eden plush toys.|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, sailors on the USS America (CV-66) {{spent about}} 1,700hours to assist Guantánamo Bay in recovery. The sole {{survivor}} of the sinking boat carrying Cuban exiles was tried in a military tribunal. The man was {{held responsible for the}} 44boat deaths and was quickly executed. The United States Coast Guard deployed boats, helicopters, and airplanes to find victims of the boat capsized in the Straits of Florida. In the United States, the price for <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> tomatoes rose due to Inez's crop damage in Florida and reduced crop output in California. The country's military sent helicopters and planes to join the Mexican Air Force, as well as trucks by land, to deliver tons of supplies, including food, clothing, and medicine to flood-affected areas in Tamaulipas. In the weeks after the storm, many residents had minimal food access, and some areas remained flooded. Conditions in Tampico, located near where the storm moved ashore, gradually returned to normal. Heavy rainfall in Mexico restored reservoirs, which assisted future crop growing.|$|E
50|$|Greens — Most {{commonly}} collard or turnip {{greens in}} the cold-weather months, prepared by slow cooking the greens with smoked pork or bacon grease. In the spring-time, kilt greens {{are available for}} preparation and service. Kil't greens are made by boiling tender garden <b>lettuces</b> <b>and</b> the nascent leaves of wild local plants, dressed with a hot bacon and onion vinaigrette, and served hot.|$|R

5|$|In {{spring and}} early summer, migrant birds {{including}} the little gull, black tern, Temminck's stint and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north; some, such as whimbrels, curlew sandpipers and little stints, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds. Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, goldeneyes and northern pintails. Red-throated divers are usually on the sea, and brent geese feed on sea <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> other green algae. Barn owls and sometimes hen harriers quarter the marshes in winter, and snow bunting flocks {{can be found on the}} beaches. Thousands of geese, mainly pink-footed, roost at Holkham.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce also {{suffers from}} several viral diseases, {{including}} big vein, which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and mosaic virus, which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves. Aster yellows are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves. Fungal diseases include powdery mildew and downy mildew, which cause leaves to mold and die and bottom rot, lettuce drop and gray mold, which cause entire plants to rot and collapse. Crowding lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases. Weeds {{can also be}} an issue, as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground. Transplanted lettuce (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing misshapen <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> lower yields. Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult. Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production. However, {{this has led to}} the development of herbicide-resistant weeds and prompted environmental and health concerns.|$|E
