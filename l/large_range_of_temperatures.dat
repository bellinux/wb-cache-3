However, at low tide, temperatures may dip to below freezing or may become scaldingly hot, leading to a temperature range that may approach 30°C (86°F) during a period of a few hours. Many mobile organisms, such as snails and crabs, avoid temperature fluctuations by crawling around and searching for food at high tide and hiding in cool, moist refuges (crevices or burrows) at low tide.

The model was tested against experimental published data on <b>large</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> (723 - 1192 K) and conversion (up to more than 90 %), near atmospheric pressure.

In our conditions, the aromatic compounds are mainly formed by dehydrogenation and dealkylation reactions of cyclohexene and alkylcyclohexenes, whatever the temperature. So, the key-point is the formation of cyclohexene and alkylcyclohexenes. It was shown that, at high temperature, they are exclusively formed by free-radical reactions which decompositions by beta-scission of C-C and C-H bonds.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{mechanism}} for the stabilization of colloids in liquid mixtures without use of surfactants or polymers.
