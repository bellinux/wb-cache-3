500|$|Upon release, {{the game}} was lauded by the video game press. It was widely {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the best games released for the NES. Computer and Video Games editors Paul Rand, Tim Boone and Frank O'Connor awarded the game a 98/100, praising it for its gameplay, replayability, sound, and graphics. Boone commented that the game is nearly flawless in its utterly [...] "stupendous incredibility and absolutely impossible to put down for anything less than a fire alarm – and even then you find yourself weighting down the odds." [...] Rand called Super Mario Bros. 3 the best video game ever, labeling it [...] "the Mona Lisa of gaming" [...] and stating that it is [...] "astoundingly brilliant in every way, shape and form." [...] O'Connor stated that the game [...] "makes Sonic the Hedgehog look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wet</b> Sunday morning and even gives the [...] Famicom's [...] a run for its money." ...|$|E
500|$|Finding {{out that}} his old friend Ulysses Grant was {{in command of the}} Union Army, he told his fellow {{officers}} that [...] "he will fight us every day and every hour {{until the end of the}} war." [...] Longstreet helped save the Confederate Army from defeat in his first battle back with Lee's army, the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864, in which he launched a powerful flanking attack along the Orange Plank Road against the Union II Corps and nearly drove it from the field. Once again he developed innovative tactics to deal with difficult terrain, ordering the advance of six brigades by heavy skirmish lines, which allowed his men to deliver a continuous fire into the enemy, while proving to be elusive targets themselves. Wilderness historian Edward Steere attributed much of the success of the Army to [...] "the display of tactical genius by Longstreet which more than redressed his disparity in numerical strength." [...] After the war, the Union II Corps commander that day, Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, said to Longstreet of this flanking maneuver: [...] "You rolled me up <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wet</b> blanket." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon release, {{the video}} broke the Vevo record {{for having the}} most views in a 24-hour period with 8.24 million views, besting the {{previous}} record which had been set by Justin Bieber's [...] "Boyfriend" [...] (8.00 million). Bieber regained the record {{with the release of}} the music video for [...] "Beauty and a Beat" [...] (10.6 million) on 12 October 2012. It received positive reviews from music critics, who generally complimented its carefree, jubilant nature. Smith quipped that it has [...] "notable moments," [...] which he cited, [...] "glowstick campfire dances, inflatable pool splashing, four wheeler racing, and an unfortunate blonde streak in Zayn 's hair." [...] The Hollywood Reporter writer Sophie A. Schillaci called it [...] "fun-filled", and concluded that the video perfectly accompanies the track's lyricism. Lansky called the [...] "high quality" [...] clip [...] "fairly standard 1D fare", elaborating: [...] "the boys get up to some teenage shenanigans and, well, live while they’re young. When their festivities culminate in a pool party that reads more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wet</b> t-shirt contest than anything else, it's abundantly clear that 1D knows their audience." [...] The Huffington Post characterised it as an [...] "epic summer adventure", assessing: [...] "from a camping trip to the ultimate beach party, complete with a shirtless Niall [...] and inflatable banana." [...] Collins described it as featuring the group [...] "doing what they do best — scampering, singing, scampering some more." [...] ITN's Lindsay Brown viewed the video as [...] "wholesome", showing them [...] "having some good old fashioned fun." [...] Fuse editor Nicole James praised the apparent recurring trend of [...] "how the group isn't afraid to make fun of themselves." [...] James elaborated: [...] "If it were any other boy band acting out the Monkees-inspired hijinks in 1D's new video [...] "Live While We're Young," [...] it would likely come off as super cheesy. But for these five guys, their sense of comfortable self-awareness really comes through."

2500|$|Neoprene {{is a type}} of {{synthetic}} rubber which can be foamed during manufacture to a high proportion of tiny enclosed gas bubbles, forming a buoyant and thermally-insulating material, called [...] "foamed neoprene", [...] "foam-neoprene" [...] or [...] "expanded neoprene". Wetsuits are made from this material as it is a good insulator, waterproof, and is flexible enough for comfortable wear. The neoprene alone is very flexible, but not very resistant to tearing, so it is skinned with a layer of knit fabric bonded to each side for strength and abrasion resistance. Foamed neoprene may be used for the shell of a drysuit, providing some insulation due to the gas within the material, as in a standard wetsuit. If torn or punctured, leading to flooding, a foam-neoprene suit retains the insulation and buoyancy of the gas bubbles, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wet</b> suit, which is proportional to the thickness of the foam, Although foamed-neoprene dry suits provide some insulation, thermal under-suits are usually worn in cold water.|$|E

In order that I might hasten the tearing down and clearing away, I plunged into the hardest and dirtiest tasks, but at night, after the men were gone, dark moods of deep depression came over me, moments in which the essential futility of my powers overwhelmed me with something like despair.|$|R
