50|$|<b>Lepirudin</b> is {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in the USA, Canada, Europe and Australia. HIT is a very serious adverse event related to heparin and occurs with both unfractionated heparin and LMWH, although to a lesser extent with the latter. It is an immune-mediated, prothrombotic complication which results from a platelet-activating immune response triggered by the interaction of heparin with platelet factor 4 (PF4). The PF4-heparin complex can activate platelets and may cause venous and arterial thrombosis. When <b>lepirudin</b> binds to thrombin it hinders its prothrombic activity. Three prospective studies, called the Heparin-Associated-Thrombocytopenia (HAT) 1,2, and 3, were performed that compared <b>lepirudin</b> with historical controls in the treatment of HIT. All three studies showed that the risk of new thrombosis was decreased with the use of <b>lepirudin,</b> but the risk for major bleeding was increased. The higher incidence of major bleeding is thought {{to be the result of}} an approved dosing regimen that was too high, consequently the recommended dose was halved from the initial dose.As of May 2012 Bayer HealthCare, the only manufacturer of <b>lepirudin</b> injections, discontinued its production.

50|$|Hirudin {{derivatives}} are all bivalent DTIs, they block {{both the}} active site and exosite 1 in an irreversible 1:1 stoichiometric complex. The active site is the binding {{site for the}} globular amino-terminal domain and exosite 1 is the binding site for the acidic carboxy-terminal domain of hirudin. Native hirudin, a 65-amino-acid polypeptide, is produced in the parapharyngeal glands of medicinal leeches. Hirudins today are produced by recombinant biotechnology using yeast. These recombinant hirudins lack a sulfate group at Tyr-63 and are therefore called desulfatohirudins. They have a 10-fold lower binding affinity to thrombin compared to native hirudin, but remain a highly specific inhibitor of thrombin and have an inhibition constant for thrombin in the picomolar range. Renal clearance and degradation account {{for the most part}} for the systemic clearance of desulfatohirudins and there is accumulation of the drug in patients with renal insufficiency. These drugs should not be used in patients with impaired renal function, since there is no specific antidote available to reverse the effects. Hirudins are given parenteraly, usually by intravenous injection. 80% of hirudin is distributed in the extravascular compartment and only 20% is found in the plasma. The most common desulfatohirudins today are <b>lepirudin</b> and desirudin.|$|E
50|$|Anticoagulation {{therapy has}} a long history. In 1884 John Berry Haycraft {{described}} a substance found in the saliva of leeches, Hirudo medicinalis, that had anticoagulant effects. He named the substance ‘Hirudine’ from the Latin name. Interestingly the use of medicinal leeches can be dated back {{all the way to}} ancient Egypt. In the early 20th century Jay McLean, L. Emmet Holt Jr. and William Henry Howell discovered the anticoagulant heparin, which they isolated from the liver (hepar). Heparin {{remains one of the most}} effective anticoagulants and is still used today, although it has its disadvantages, such as requiring intravenous administration and having a variable dose-response curve due to substantial protein binding. In the 1980s low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) were developed. They are derived from heparin by enzymatic or chemical depolymerization and have better pharmacokinetic properties compared to heparin. In 1955 the first clinical use of warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was reported. Warfarin was originally used as a rat poison in 1948 and thought to be unsafe for humans, but an unsuccessful suicide attempt suggested that it was relatively safe for humans. Vitamin K antagonists are the most commonly used oral anticoagulants today and warfarin was the 11th most prescribed drug in the United States in 1999 and is actually the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant worldwide. Warfarin has its disadvantages though, just like heparin, such as a narrow therapeutic index and multiple food and drug interactions and it requires routine anticoagulation monitoring and dose adjustment. Since both heparin and warfarin have their downsides the search for alternative anticoagulants has been ongoing and DTIs are proving to be worthy competitors. The first DTI was actually hirudin, which became more easily available with genetic engineering. It is now available in a recombinant form as <b>lepirudin</b> (Refludan) and desirudin (Revasc, Iprivask). Development of other DTIs followed with the hirudin analog, bivalirudin, and then the small molecular DTIs. However, such DTIs were also having side effects such as bleeding complications and liver toxicity, and their long-term effects were in doubt.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether <b>lepirudin,</b> a direct thrombin inhibitor, is a safe and effective anticoagulant for patients with heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies (HAAbs). Methods: The charts of HAAb-positive patients who received <b>lepirudin</b> were reviewed. <b>Lepirudin</b> use was analyzed for indication, duration, and effectiveness of anticoagulation, and for adverse events. HAAb presence was determined by platelet aggregation. Results: Eighteen HAAb-positive patients received lepirudin: 9 had previous documentation of HAAb, 6 had thrombocytopenia while receiving heparin; and 3 had HAAb after a thrombotic event. The indications for <b>lepirudin</b> anticoagulation included thromboembolism prophylaxis (5), arterial thromboses (5), pulmonary embolus (3) or deep venous thrombosis (1), and one each for atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, artificial heart valves, and hemodialysis access. The average duration of therapy was 4. 04 days. Fifteen patients achieved adequate anticoagulation (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] ratio > 2. 0) with <b>lepirudin.</b> Seven patients had aPTTs that were sometimes supratherapeutic (aPTT > 100 seconds) but did not bleed. In all patients who had heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, platelet counts were normalized while they received <b>lepirudin.</b> There were two complications: one patient fell and had a calf hematoma (aPTT ratio 3. 24), and one patient who received <b>lepirudin</b> during nine separate hospitalizations had epistaxis (aPTT ratio 2. 86) during her ninth hospitalization.

40|$|Der limitierende Faktor für das Langzeitüberleben herztransplantierter Patienten ist die Transplantatvaskulopathie. Verschiedene Studien haben darauf hingewiesen, dass eine Aktivierung des Gerinnungssystems in der Pathogenese der Transplantatvaskulopathie neben immunologischen und inflammatorischen Faktoren eine Rolle spielt. Aktivierte Monozyten können im stimulierten Zustand durch die Expression von Tissue Factor eine hohe prokoagulatorische Aktivität aufweisen und dadurch direkt für die in den betroffenen Gefäßen beobachtete lokale Fibrinablagerung verantwortlich gemacht werden (50, 61, 68). In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde der Effekt von <b>Lepirudin</b> auf die Tissue Factor Expression humaner Monozyten untersucht. <b>Lepirudin</b> ist ein rekombinantes Hirudin und spezifischer Inhibitor der Proteinase Thrombin. Die Experimente wurden unter serumfreien Bedingungen mit Kulturen aufgereinigter humaner Monozyten durchgeführt. Untersucht wurde sowohl der Einfluss von <b>Lepirudin</b> auf die basale, unstimulierte als auch auf die durch LPS stimulierte Tissue Factor Expression der Monozyten. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass <b>Lepirudin</b> in humanen Monozyten sowohl die basale als auch LPS-stimulierte Tissue Factor Proteinexpression supprimieren kann. Die Inhibition der Tissue Factor Expression beruhte auf einer verminderten Transkription von TF-mRNA in den mit <b>Lepirudin</b> behandelten Zellen. Funktionell führte die verminderte Tissue Factor Expression der Monozyten nach Inkubation mit <b>Lepirudin</b> dosisabhängig zu einer reduzierten prokoagulatorischen Aktivität, die im Rahmen dieser Arbeit als Tissue Factor Aktivität charakterisiert werden konnte. Die basale Tissue Factor Aktivität konnte durch <b>Lepirudin</b> ab einer Konzentration von 0, 01 myg/ml statistisch signifikant reduziert werden. In den LPS-stimulierten Monozyten führte erst eine Konzentration von 0, 1 myg/ml zu einer statistisch signifikanten Reduktion. Die intrazellulären Signaltransduktionswege, die zu der Inhibition der Tissue Factor Gentranskription durch <b>Lepirudin</b> führten, sind noch ungeklärt. Der bekannte Wirkmechanismus von <b>Lepirudin,</b> die direkte Thrombin-Inhibition, konnte im Zellkulturmodell ausgeschlossen werden. The limited {{factor for}} {{long-term}} survival of heart-transplanted patients is transplant vasculopathy. Various {{studies have indicated}} that, apart from immunological and inflammatory factors, activating the coagulation system {{plays a role in}} the pathogenesis of transplant vasculopathy. Under stimulated condition induced by expressed tissue factor, activated monocytes are able to exhibit a higher pro-coagulated activity and can thus be made directly responsible for local fibrin accretion observed in affected vessels (50, 61, 68). This thesis investigated the effect of <b>lepirudin</b> on tissue factor expression of human monocytes. <b>Lepirudin</b> is a recombinant hirudin and specific inhibitor of thrombin protein. The experiments were performed under serum-free conditions with cultures of purified human monocytes. The influence of <b>lepirudin</b> was examined on basic, non-stimulated as well as LPS-stimulated tissue factor expression of the monocytes. It was demonstrated that <b>lepirudin</b> in human monocytes is able to suppress basic and also LPS-stimulated tissue factor protein expression. Inhibition of tissue factor expression is based on a decreased transcription of TF-mRNA in the lepirudin-treated cells. After incubation with <b>lepirudin,</b> the tissue factor expression of monocytes functionally leads to a dose-dependently reduced procoagulatory activity, this was able to be characterised as tissue factor activity in this work. The fundamental tissue factor activity was able to be statistically significantly reduced by a <b>lepirudin</b> concentration of 0, 01 myg/ml. In the LPS-stimulated monocytes, only a concentration of 0, 1 myg/ml was able to cause a statistically significant reduction.

BACKGROUNDExperimental studies and previous small clinical trials suggest that specific thrombin inhibition improves early patency rates and clinical outcome in patients treated with streptokinase. METHODSIn a randomized double-blind, multicenter trial, 1, 208 patients with AMI ≤ 6 h were treated with aspirin and streptokinase and randomized to receive recombinant hirudin (<b>lepirudin,</b> IV bolus of 0. 2 mg/kg, followed by subcutaneous (SC) injections of 0. 5 mg/kg b. i. d. for 5 to 7 days) or heparin (IV placebo bolus, followed by SC injections of 12, 500 IU b. i. d. for 5 to 7 days). A total of 447 patients were included in the angiographic substudy in which the primary end point, 90 -min Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3 of the infarct-related artery, was evaluated, while the other two-thirds served as “safety group” in which only clinical end points were evaluated. As an additional efficacy parameter the ST-segment resolution at 90 and 180 min was measured in all patients. RESULTSTIMI flow grade 3 was observed in 40. 7 % in the <b>lepirudin</b> and in 33. 5 % in the heparin group (p = 0. 16), respectively. In the entire study population the proportion of patients with complete ST resolution at 90 min (28 % vs. 22 %, p = 0. 05) and at 180 min (52 % vs. 48 %, p = 0. 18) after start of therapy tended to be higher in the <b>lepirudin</b> group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (0. 2 % vs. 0. 3 %) or total stroke (1. 2 % vs. 1. 5 %), reinfarction rate (4. 6 % vs. 5. 1 %) and total mortality rate (6. 8 % vs. 6. 4 %) at 30 days, as well as the combined end point of death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal reinfarction, rescue-percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and refractory angina (22. 7 vs. 24. 3 %) were not statistically different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONSLepirudin as adjunct to thrombolysis with streptokinase did not significantly improve restoration of blood flow in the infarct vessel as assessed by angiography, but was associated with an accelerated ST resolution. There was no increase in the risk of major bleedings with <b>lepirudin</b> compared to heparin...|$|E
40|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} is a {{rare and}} serious reaction to unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins in children. Quick recognition, discontinuation of heparin, and subsequent treatment with an alternative anticoagulant are essential steps to prevent serious complications such as thrombus and limb amputation. The purpose of this review is to describe the clinical features of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in children and to summarize the data available for its management. This paper summarizes data and relates the use of direct thrombin inhibitors with clinical outcomes. A literature search was conducted with Ovid, using the key terms argatroban, bivalirudin, hirulog, danaparoid, <b>lepirudin,</b> direct thrombin inhibitor, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, warfarin, and fondaparinux. Articles were excluded if they were classified as editorials, review articles, or conference abstracts or if they involved patients 18 {{years of age or}} older or described disease states not related to thrombosis. Nineteen articles containing 33 case reports were identified and evaluated for this review. Of the 33 cases, 14, 10, 4, and 2 cases described the use of <b>lepirudin,</b> danaparoid, argatroban, and bivalirudin, respectively. Two cases did not report the type of anticoagulant used, and 1 case used aspirin. The most commonly reported complication was bleeding...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the in vitro effects of unfractionated heparin, fractionated heparin and direct thrombin inhibition on platelet–monocyte aggregation, {{and to establish}} the in vivo effects of unfractionated heparin and direct thrombin inhibition on platelet–monocyte aggregates in patients scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Design: Platelet–monocyte aggregates were assessed in whole blood from 18 healthy volunteers after the addition of unfractionated heparin (1 U/ml), enoxaparin (0. 8 U/ml) or <b>lepirudin</b> (5. 6 g/ml), and in 28 patients scheduled for elective PCI before and after administration of 100 U/kg of unfractionated heparin or 0. 75 mg/kg bivalirudin. The influence of P-selectin-mediated platelet–monocyte aggregation was assessed with specific blocking antibodies. Results: Addition of unfractionated heparin in vitro {{was associated with a}} higher level of platelet–monocyte aggregates than in controls (20. 1 (1. 9) % v 16. 2 (1. 6) %, respectively, p, 0. 001). However, platelet– monocyte aggregation was not affected by enoxaparin or <b>lepirudin</b> (16. 9 (2. 0) % and 17. 0 (2. 2) %, respectively, NS). Intravenous unfractionated heparin in vivo also resulted in an increase in platelet– monocyte aggregates (absolute D 7. 1 (2. 7) %, p, 0. 01), whereas intravenous bivalirudin had no effect (absolute D 21. 5 (2. 4) %, NS). The addition of P-selectin blockade abolished any increase in platelet...|$|E
40|$|Argatroban {{has been}} {{introduced}} as an alternative parenteral anticoagulant for HIT-patients in several European countries in 2005. In 2009 {{a panel of experts}} discussed their clinical experience with argatroban balancing risks and benefits of argatroban treatment in managing the highly procoagulant status of HIT-patients. This article summarizes the main conclusions of this round table discussion. An ongoing issue is the appropriate dosing of argatroban in special patient groups. Therefore, dosing recommendations for different HIT-patient groups (ICU patients; non-ICU patients, paediatric patients, and for patients undergoing renal replacement therapies) are summarized in this consensus statement. Because of the strong correlation between argatroban dosing requirements and scores used to characterize the severity of illness (APACHE; SAPS, SOFA) suitable dosing nomograms are given. This consensus statement contributes to clinically relevant information on the appropriate use and monitoring of argatroban based on the current literature, and provides additional information from clinical experience. As the two other approved drugs for HIT, danaparoid and <b>lepirudin</b> are either currently not available due to manufacturing problems (danaparoid) or will be withdrawn from the market in 2012 (<b>lepirudin),</b> this report should guide physicians who have limited experience with argatroban how to use this drug safely in patients with HIT...|$|E
