Katsav resigned the presidency in 2007 {{as part of a}} plea bargain. Katsav later rejected the deal with prosecutors and vowed he would prove his innocence in court. In an unprecedented case, on 30 December 2010, Katsav was convicted of two counts of rape, obstruction of justice and other charges. On 22 March 2011, in a <b>landmark</b> <b>ruling,</b> Katsav was sentenced to seven years in prison. Katsav appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Israel.

In August 1870, Clara Clarita was towing a burning ferryboat out of harm's way when the tow rope burned through, allowing the ferry to collide with a schooner {{and set it on}} fire. In a later <b>landmark</b> <b>ruling,</b> the courts ruled that although the damage was caused by the ferry not the tug, and {{regardless of whether or not}} the schooner was anchored improperly, the tug was still at fault through negligently using a rope rather than a chain to tow the ferry.|$|E

The case in question involved four men accused of an armed robbery at Heathrow Airport in February 2004. It was the fourth time the case had been tried, but this time in front of only a single judge. The trial opened on 12 January 2010. The four accused were convicted, and on 31 March 2010 they received sentences ranging from 15 years to life.

25|$|Exception 2 {{of section}} 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), {{which deals with}} the {{punishment}} for rape, stated that “sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.” However, the same provision states that a man is said to commit rape if he has sexual relations with a woman with or without her consent, when she is under 18 years of age. Thus, there was a discrepancy between the two sub-clauses. Independent Thought, a non-governmental organisation, in a petition in 2013, had challenged Exception 2. In a <b>landmark</b> <b>ruling</b> on 11 October 2017, the supreme court upheld the age of consent as 18 years. The {{court held that the}} distinction made between a married girl child and an unmarried girl child was illogical and ran against the provisions of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Such a distinction also violated a child’s right to liberty and dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution. Irrespective of her marital status, sex with a minor girl will now attract a minimum rigorous imprisonment of ten years. Two other significant statues undermined by the IPC section were the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and the Juvenile Justice Act, both of which defines a child as someone below the age of 18.|$|E

500|$|Protection of {{life and}} {{personal}} liberty is also stated under right to life and personal liberty. Article 21 declares that no citizen can be denied his life and liberty except by law. This means that a person's life and personal liberty can be disputed only if that person has committed a crime. However, {{the right to life}} does not include the right to die and hence, suicide or an attempt thereof, is an offence. (Attempted suicide being interpreted as a crime has seen many debates. The Supreme Court of India gave a <b>landmark</b> <b>ruling</b> in 1994. The court repealed section 309 of the Indian penal code, under which people attempting suicide could face prosecution and prison terms of up to one year. In 1996 however another Supreme Court ruling nullified the earlier one.) [...] "Personal liberty" [...] includes all the freedoms which are not included in Article 19 (that is, the six freedoms).

500|$|The [...] "Terri Schiavo case" [...] {{actually}} {{refers to}} a series of cases. It differed from the Quinlan and Cruzan cases by involving settled law rather than breaking new legal ground on the right-to-die issue. In 2006, Shepherd said that it was [...] "unclear" [...] whether the Schiavo case represents a landmark decision. The Schiavo case instead involved a dispute between family members over what Schiavo's wishes would have been for such a situation. According to medical ethicist Matthew Stonecipher, [...] "The movement to challenge the decisions made for Terri Schiavo threatened to destabilize end-of-life law that had developed over {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century, principally through the cases of Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan." [...] The outcome of the Schiavo case was also in part determined by a 1990 Florida case, Guardianship of Estelle Browning. In that case, George Felos, the attorney for Michael Schiavo in the Schiavo case, represented a Browning relative. Felos successfully argued before the Florida Supreme Court that Browning's feeding tube should be removed. The elderly Browning had expressed in a living will her wish not to be kept alive by any artificial means, including receiving food and water [...] "by a gastric tube or intravenously." [...] At that time it was common to remove people from ventilators, but the law in Florida was not clear on removing them from feeding tubes. In a <b>landmark</b> <b>ruling,</b> the Florida Supreme Court decided that Browning had [...] "the constitutional right to choose or refuse medical treatment, and that right extends to all relevant decisions concerning one's health." ...|$|E
