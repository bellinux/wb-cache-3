500|$|The {{album was}} the Fall's first to include Karl Burns and Paul Hanley in the band's classic two-drummer lineup. Smith {{intended}} the album's lyrics [...] "to be <b>like</b> <b>reading</b> {{a really good}} book. You {{have a couple of}} beers, sit down and immerse yourself. None of those fuckers Elvis Costello or Spandau Ballet did that". Hex Enduction Hour was written during an unusually prolific period in his career. Many of the tracks had already been dropped from the band's live set by the time they visited Australia and New Zealand in the autumn of 1982. The earlier single [...] "Look, Know" [...] was recorded during the Icelandic sessions but not included on the album. This was characteristic of Smith's [...] "never look back" [...] approach.|$|E
500|$|... "Cocoon" [...] {{is a song}} based {{around a}} bassline and beats that [...] "sound like {{fingertips}} on skin". Discussing the glitch sound of the song, Björk said: [...] "when you take technology and use the areas where it breaks, where it's faulty, you're entering a mystery zone where you can't control it." [...] Björk's whispered vocals in [...] "Cocoon" [...] were described as [...] "near-cracking falsetto and a breathy ecstasy". Lyrically, for Michael Cragg from The Guardian newspaper, [...] "it feels almost intrusive, <b>like</b> <b>reading</b> someone's diary as they write about a new love", as Björk had just started the relationship with Barney. Its lyrics are set between metaphor, with her singing [...] "who {{would have known that}} a boy like him would have entered me lightly, restoring my blisses" [...] and over-sharing, whilst also stating [...] "He slides inside, half awake, half asleep... gorgeousness, he's still inside me".|$|E

500|$|Sesame Street {{reflected}} the prevailing view that preschoolers had short attention spans; it featured a magazine-like format consisting of varied segments. Based on research conducted over the 30 {{years since the}} launch of Sesame Street by theorists like Anderson, the producers of Blue's Clues wanted to develop a show that took advantage of children's intellectual and behavioral activity when watching television. Previous children's television programs presented their content with little input from their viewers, but Blue's Clues {{was one of the}} first children's shows to actively invite its viewers' involvement. Its creators believed that if children were more involved in what they were viewing, they would attend to its content longer than previously expected—for up to a half hour—and learn more. They also dropped the magazine format for a more traditional narrative format. As Variety magazine stated, [...] "...The choice for Blue's Clues became to tell one story, beginning to end, camera moving left-to-right <b>like</b> <b>reading</b> a storybook, transitions from scene to scene as obvious as the turning of a page." [...] Every episode of Blue's Clues was structured in this way.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{publication}} in 1999, Battle Royale became a bestseller in Japan. The novel was earlier {{entered into the}} 1997 Japan Horror Fiction Awards, but was eventually rejected {{in the final round}} with no winner that year. All three members of the final round's selection committee that year admitted Battle Royale was the best work, but declined to award it due to its controversial content. Hiroshi Aramata said that while it was the best nominee in terms of [...] "story, structure, and subject matter," [...] he felt it {{was too much of a}} Kinpachi-sensei parody and suspected its content would cause problems. Katsuhiko Takahashi felt that although it was the superior work as far as its construction as a novel, giving the award to a story about students killing each other at [...] "this time" [...] would hurt the reputation of the competition. Mariko Hayashi said that while she believed it was the best of the four novels, it was <b>like</b> <b>reading</b> an [...] "unpleasant near-future manga" [...] and [...] "No matter how squarely it might be horror or how interesting it might be, I'm not so sure we should be writing stories like this." [...] In 2001, Kōji Ōnuma wrote , a dissertation that explores the themes of the book.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} extant {{recording of}} [...] "Howl" [...] {{was thought to}} date from March 18, 1956. (The Blackburn Collection recordings show otherwise). Ginsberg and Snyder, after hitch-hiking from San Francisco, read from their poems in the Anna Mann dormitory at Reed College, Snyder's alma mater. This recording, discovered in mid-2007 on a reel-to-reel tape in the Reed College archives, contains only Part I of [...] "Howl". After beginning to read Part II, Ginsberg said to the audience, [...] "I don't really feel <b>like</b> <b>reading</b> anymore. I just sorta haven't got any kind of steam." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bradley saw {{the flag}} raising(s) as an {{insignificant}} event in a devastating battle. He rarely {{talked to people}} about it {{and spent most of}} his life trying to escape the attention he drew from allegedly raising it. He stated once that he [...] "just happened to be there". He spoke to his wife once about the flag raising during their 47-year marriage. That was on their first date, and he seemed very uninterested with it during the conversation. His daughter Barbara said that “Reading a book on Iwo Jima at home would have been <b>like</b> <b>reading</b> a playgirl magazine…it would have been something I had to hide.” He told his children more than once that the only real heroes on Iwo Jima were those that did not survive.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{criticism}} of the novel noted its length. Times Joel Stein noted [...] "The idea—models so solipsistic that they become terrorists—is a good-enough one for a short story of 15 pages, but it's unsustainable at 482." [...] He describes the book's first 185 pages as [...] "inanely repetitive". Entertainment Weekly opines [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>reading</b> Page Six of the New York Post, but for 482 pages." [...] One reviewer found the opening scenes [...] "funny enough" [...] although noted that it [...] "gets tired easily". Contrarily, the Star Tribune felt [...] "the satiric early half is Ellis in peak form, the thriller-style second half is less successful." [...] In fact, the humour in the novel was praised by multiple critics. The Star Tribune notes Victor's lack of depth, malapropisms, overuse of the word [...] "baby" [...] and the novel's [...] "enchantingly disaffected monotone" [...] of [...] "a been-there-done-that Valleyspeak". Hanson felt that the horror elements in the [...] "labyrinthian" [...] thriller section of the novel seemed [...] "recycled from American Psycho." [...] Entertainment Weekly also state their preference for the [...] "first 189 pages". Contrarily, the New York Times felt that the book was devoid of fun, where even the blackest satire (e.g. Evelyn Waugh's Loved One) are more humorous.|$|E
2500|$|Jay Michaelson {{proposes a}} reading of the story of Sodom that {{emphasizes}} the violation of hospitality as well as the violence of the Sodomites. [...] "Homosexual rape {{is the way in which}} they violate hospitality—not the essence of their transgression. Reading the story of Sodom as being about homosexuality is <b>like</b> <b>reading</b> the story of an ax murderer as being about an ax." [...] Michaelson places the story of Sodom in context with other Genesis stories regarding Abraham's hospitality to strangers, and argues that when other texts in the Hebrew Bible mention Sodom, they do so without commentary on homosexuality. The verses cited by Michaelson include Jeremiah 23:14, where the sins of Jerusalem are compared to Sodom and are listed as adultery, lying, and strengthening the hands of evildoers; Amos 4:1-11 (oppressing the poor and crushing the needy); and Ezekiel 16:49-50, which defines the sins of Sodom as [...] "pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and did toevah before me, and I took them away as I saw fit." [...] Michaelson uses toevah in place of abomination to emphasize the original Hebrew, which he explains as being more correctly translated as [...] "taboo".|$|E

40|$|Analysis of PIRLS data on <b>liking</b> <b>reading</b> and SES {{revealed}} five consistent patterns: (1) 'basline': locations {{with high}} PIRLS scores, high SES, {{and a high}} level of 'liking reading' among both children and their parents. (2) 'test-prep' locations, with high SES and PIRLS scores, but little interest in reading. Our conjecture is that these students achieved high scores through test-preparation (strategy instruction) and through diligently reading very hard texts. (3) 'late-bloomers' with high SES and high PIRLS scores, with parents but not children <b>liking</b> <b>reading,</b> In most of these locations, reading instruction starts late. (4) middle SES countries and locations; (5) Lower SES countries and locations, with children <b>liking</b> to <b>read</b> but adults much less. The problem in cases in category (5) is lack of access to reading material. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
