However, females can weigh more than 100 grams. Females are often ‘bulky;’ they have a large body size in comparison to their legs. Males tend to be slender in body size. This is sexual dimorphism. Mature males will also have tibial hooks on the front pair of legs; these hook back a female’s fangs during mating.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation is to study the strength of bolted ring-type connections used for solid-round leg members of all-welded steel towers subjected to tensile loads and {{to determine whether the}} current practice of ignoring the eccentricity of the connection can be justified or not. The load carrying capacity and maximum gap were determined experimentally and by finite element analysis. A total of eighteen specimens divided into three groups were tested. Group 1 consisted of six specimens of 25. 4 mm (1. 0 in.) <b>leg</b> <b>size</b> and 22. 2 mm (7 / 8 in.) bolt size with no girls, group 2 consisted of six specimens of 38. 1 mm (1. 5 in.) <b>leg</b> <b>size</b> and 22. 2 mm (7 / 8 in.) bolt size with girts, while group 3 consisted of six specimens of 50. 8 mm (2. 0 in.) <b>leg</b> <b>size</b> and 31. 8 mm (1 - 1 / 4 in.) bolt size with girts. All the specimens were subjected to tension loading. The investigation focused on: load-gap relationship under tension loading and the tensile capacity of the connections. In the finite element analysis, three-dimensional finite element models were developed with the ABAQUS package in order to simulate the strength and gap behavior of the bolted ring connections. It was found that the results from the finite element models agreed closely with the experimental values and that the strength of the connection increased with increase in <b>leg</b> <b>size</b> (for the same size bolt). The results from both the finite element analysis and the experiments show that the failure loads are less than the axial load capacities according to Canadian Standard for all groups. Comparing experimental failure loads to the axial load capacities according to AISC-LRFD, they are less for Groups 1 and 3 and are almost the same for Group 2.

Using data on seven morphological variables measured by Bumpus, we tested and confirmed a three-factor model that characterized physical attributes for general size, <b>leg</b> <b>size</b> and head size. Although males were physically larger than females, we found no difference {{between males and females}} in the physical attributes as measured by the three factors. Survival increased significantly with increasing general size and was unrelated to <b>leg</b> <b>size</b> and head size. Wing length, independent of its relationship to the general size factor, was also significantly related to survival. Higher survival was found among birds with short wings. Males had a higher survival compared to females. Their higher survival was mediated, to a lesser extent indirectly, through greater size and, to a greater extent directly, through effects of unknown origin. We favour the use of structural equation modelling methods in studies of selection because of their ability to test and confirm or disconfirm hypotheses related to selection events...|$|E

The relationship of all variables is explained. The neural model can be used to test initial welding conditions of voltage, amperage and travel speed.

40|$|Because {{the core}} body shapes of birds are {{relatively}} conservative (Hafner et al. 1984), differences in bill {{shape and size}} account {{for much of the}} variation among birds that we humans perceive. Although tail and <b>leg</b> <b>size</b> and shape may vary almost as much, the bill may exert more influence on our cognitive perception because of its proximity to the bird’s face. The close association of bill size and shape with food type and feeding behavior adds additional weight to the ornithologist’s perception of their ‘‘importance. ’ ’ For these reasons, it is perhaps no surprise that bird bills have played a prominent role in their classification. For the Passeriformes known as nine-primaried os-cines, bill characters historically have been used fre-quently in determining family boundaries. For example...|$|E

At last, the relationship between strength of transverse welded joints and weld <b>leg</b> <b>size</b> is investigated according to test results.

30|$|The bidimensional niche (under the {{assumption}} that it reflects differences in resource exploitation; sensu Holmes and Recher 1986) structured the waterbird community into four feeding guilds (Wiens 1989; Sarrías et al. 1996).

For instance, guild G 2 could be subdivided into subgroups according to morphological characteristics, such as bill or <b>leg</b> <b>size.</b> Morphological differences may explain why {{members of the same}} guild feed in different areas using the same techniques or in the same area (apparently exploiting the same resource) but catching different prey (Schoener 1974; Simberloff and Boecklen 1981; Gotelli and Ellison 2002; Zeffer et al. 2003). To provide an accurate description of feeding guilds, more dimensions should be added to the analysis.

40|$|Combat {{traits are}} thought to have arisen due to intense male-male {{competition}} for access to females. While large and elaborate weapons used in attacking other males have often been the focus of sexual selection studies, defensive traits (both morphological and performance) have received less attention. However, if defensive traits help males restrict access to females, their role in the process of sexual selection could also be important. Here we examine the morphological correlates of grip strength, a defensive combat trait involved in mate guarding, in the tenebrionid beetle Bolitotherus cornutus. We found that grip strength was repeatable and differed between the sexes. However, these differences in performance were largely explained by body size and a non-additive interaction between size and leg length that differed between males and females. Our results suggest that <b>leg</b> <b>size</b> and body size interact as part of an integrated suite of defensive combat traits...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} four {{populations of}} the grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus with respect to differences in morphological traits and characteristics of their communication signals. A special focus was laid on possible correlations between morphological and song traits of males {{that could be used}} by females to infer quality cues of potential mates. We also tested whether females exhibit preferences for males of their own population. Specific song features (onset accentuation, offset, syllable period) of males—but not of females—differed between populations. We observed size differences both in males and females from different populations, but the size ranks of the two sexes were not always correlated. Environmental factors appear to have a strong influence on different size traits, compared to genetic origin. In all populations a specific song feature, the accentuation of syllable onsets, showed a similar correlation with a morphological trait, hind <b>leg</b> <b>size,</b> but its correlation with other size indicators sometimes differed in sign. Females did not prefer songs of males from their own population. The best predictor for song attractiveness was—unexpectedly—not the onset accentuation but the offset depth. ...|$|E

To test diverse robot morphologies, robot legs of variable shapes were generated during the evolutionary process and autonomously built using additive fabrication. We present two cases with Evo-devo experiments and one with Evolution, and we hypothesize that the addition of a developmental stage can be used within robotics to improve performance. Moreover, our results show that a non-linear system-environment interaction exists, which explains the non-trivial locomotion patterns observed. In the future, robots will be present in our daily lives, and this work introduces for the first time physical robots that evolve and grow while interacting with the environment.

Analytical results had demonstrated that the socket weld <b>leg</b> <b>size</b> configuration can have an important effect on its high cycle fatigue resistance, with longer legs along the pipe side of the weld greatly increasing its predicted fatigue resistance. Other potentially important factors influencing fatigue life include residual stress, weld root and toe condition, pipe size, axial and radial gaps, and materials of construction. The second phase of the program tested 27 additional socket weld specimens of various designs by bolting them to a vibration shaker table and shaking them near their resonant frequencies to produce the desired stress amplitudes and cycles. Another objective of the second phase of testing was to evaluate various methods of in-situ modification or repair of socket welds, which could be used as alternatives to replacement with butt welds.

40|$|The {{difficulties}} in measuring total fitness of individuals necessitate {{the use of}} fitness surrogates in ecological and evolutionary studies. These surrogates can be different components of fitness (e. g. survival or fecundity), or proxies more uncertainly related to fitness (e. g. body size or growth rate). Ideally, fitness would be measured over the lifetime of individuals; however, more convenient short-time measures are often used. Adult lifetime reproductive success (adult LRS) {{is closely related to}} the total fitness of individuals, {{but it is difficult to}} measure and rarely included in fitness estimation in experimental studies. We explored phenotypic correlations between female adult LRS and various commonly used fitness components and proxies in a recently founded laboratory population of Drosophila littoralis. Noting that survival is usually higher in laboratory conditions than in nature, we also calculated adjusted adult LRS measures that give more weight to early reproduction. The lifetime measures of fecundity, longevity, and offspring viability were all relatively highly correlated with adult LRS. However, correlations with short-time measures of fecundity and offspring production varied greatly depending on the time of measurement, and the optimal time for measurement was different for unadjusted compared to adjusted adult LRS measures. Correlations between size measures and adult LRS varied from weak to modest, <b>leg</b> <b>size</b> and female weight having the highest correlations.

40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that low load exercise stimuli can lead to significant muscular adaptations when blood flow to a muscle is restricted or occluded. Electrical muscle stimulation {{has been used for}} years in the rehabilitative settings, but muscular hypertrophic or oxidative adaptation resulting from electrical stimulation is typically of limited magnitude, likely owing to the discomfort caused by the high intensity stimulus necessary to cause greater adaptation. Combining low intensity transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation (TEMS) with blood flow restriction (BFR) has yet to be examined, and offers the potential to stimulate substantial muscular adaptation without undue discomfort. We examined the effects of combining BFR with a low intensity TEMS on the upper and lower body musculature. Twenty recreationally active subjects (24 ± 6 yr, 174 ± 10 cm, 70 ± 17 kg) were recruited and had every limb randomly allocated to one of four possible training groups: 1) BFR - 4 mins inflated, 4 mins deflated at 220 mmHg alone, 2) TEMS alone- at a maximally tolerable intensity, 3) BFR+TEMS (COMB), or 4) control (CON). Each arm and leg was “trained” in its respective intervention group four times weekly for six weeks. To test muscular adaptation, muscle size and strength were measured at baseline and following 6 weeks of stimuli. Mean differences in size (g) and strength (kg), between week 0 and week 6, were calculated for each intervention group. ARM: After 6 weeks of training, the COMB group changed by 45 ± 201 g and 3. 2 ± 3. 6 kg, whereas the BFR group changed by 21 ± 103 g and 2. 6 ± 3. 9 kg.

There {{was no significant difference between}} groups for maximal strength (p= 0. 2) or size (p= 0. 4). LEG: Leg strength changed by 32 ± 19 kg in the COMB group and was significantly different than the 3 ± 11 kg change in the CON group (p= 0. 03). The TEMS and BFR group changed by 16 ± 28 kg and 18 ± 17 kg, respectively.
