40|$|Excerpt] Between March and September 2008, {{the federal}} {{government}} intervened financially with private corporations on three occasions, resulting in the government receiving significant debt and equity considerations. The firms affected were Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and AIG. Dissatisfaction with the case-by-case approach to addressing the ongoing financial turmoil led Treasury to propose a more comprehensive approach on September 19, 2008. On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA, P. L. 110 - 343) was signed into law, authorizing the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). TARP gave Treasury the option of purchasing or insuring up to $ 700 billion of assets from financial firms. On October 14, 2008, Treasury announced it was shifting its focus towards direct capital injections into banks through the purchase of preferred shares. Treasury’s announced “capital purchase plan” was for purchasing up to $ 250 billion in financial firms’ preferred stock under the TARP authority, with approximately $ 187. 5 billion actually purchased as of December 31, 2008. In addition to the general capital purchase plan, {{there have been several}} other case-by-case interventions since the passage of the EESA. The initial $ 85 billion AIG loan from mid-September was first augmented and then revamped into a combination package of a $ 60 billion line of credit, $ 40 billion in preferred share purchases, up to $ 20. 9 billion in commercial paper purchases, and up to $ 52. 5 billion in troubled asset purchases. Citigroup received an additional $ 20 billion in preferred share purchases after an initial $ 25 billion, along with federal guarantees to cover losses on a $ 306 billion pool of assets. The U. S. automakers also received financial assistance through TARP, with a $ 5 billion preferred share purchase from GMAC, up to $ 14. 4 billion in loans to GM and up to $ 4 billion in <b>loans</b> <b>promised</b> to Chrysler. These interventions have prompted questions regarding the taxpayer costs and the sources of funding. The sources of funding are relatively straightforward—primarily the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the U. S. Treasury. The costs, however, are difficult to quantify at this stage. In most of the interventions, many of the financial outflows that are possible have yet to occur, and the ultimate value of the debt and equity considerations received from the private firms is uncertain. At this point, {{the federal government}} has the option to own nearly 80 % of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG. Depending on the final proceeds from the various debt and equity considerations, the federal government may end up seeing a positive fiscal contribution from the recent interventions, {{as was the case in}} some of the past interventions summarized in the tables at the end of this report. The government may also suffer significant losses, as has also occurred in the past. This report will be updated as warranted by legislative and market events...|$|E

40|$|Government fiscal risk can {{be defined}} as a source of {{financial}} stress that could face a government in the future. The traditional cash-based accounting and reporting systems used by many governments provide inadequate information within the executive for the management of fiscal risks. They also do not produce enough information for the legislature and the public to hold governments accountable for the management of fiscal risks. The traditional focus on cash has been consistently associated with fiscal management practices that are short term and reactive. Poor information has interacted with poor incentives to discourage decision makers from taking a longer-term view of fiscal risks and their management In same time, conventional budgeting processes are deficient on two ways. First of all, they have a short time frame-one year in countries that have only annual budgets, three to five years in countries that budget within medium-term fiscal frameworks. These time horizons are too short to account for the downstream risks taken by governments when they establish pension systems and other entitlements, issue or guarantee <b>loans,</b> or <b>promise</b> to make good on shortfalls in financial performance. Second, conventional budgets record only cash flows; they do not account for the build up of liabilities, contingent obligations, or the future cost of past commitments. In this paper, we will analyze how can solve traditional accounting and budgeting systems shortages to cover all kind of fiscal liabilities either direct and indirect or implicit and explicit.

Stephen Joseph Fraenkel was born in Berlin in 1917 {{as the son of}} Max Fraenkel, a banker, and Martha (Plessner) Fraenkel, a musician and piano teacher. Martha Fraenkel died in 1932 of cancer. After graduating from the Kaiser-Friedrich-Schule in 1936 Fraenkel decided to pursue the study of engineering. After applying to all eleven of the engineering schools in Germany, he was admitted to and enrolled at the Technical University of Hannover despite being Jewish. In 1937 Stephen Fraenkel was contacted by a representative of the International Student Service, an organization that arranged scholarships in the United States offered by Jewish fraternities. He was granted such a scholarship by the Sigma Alpha Mu chapter at the University of Nebraska and immigrated to the United States in 1938. In 1941 he married Josephine Rubnitz; the couple had three children.

Unfortunately, however, the one thing which the British could not offer was the one thing which the Boers would insist upon having, and the leniency of the proposals in all other directions may have suggested weakness to their minds.

40|$|The postwar liberal trading {{framework}} {{has become}} hopelessly distorted {{during the past}} two decades by the hegemony of the U.

The economist John Maynard Keynes recognized this issue with characteristic clarity in the design of the Bretton Woods institutions [...] the World Bank and International Monetary Fund [...] in 1944. Keynes favored free markets and liberal trading arrangements insofar as they could be made to work, but he was also well aware that free markets are inherently unstable and prone to collapse. Keynes also understood that the characteristic structure of unregulated international finance placed bankers and creditors in the dominant position, and so would inevitably force adjustment by debtors. But what was locally rational in a financial transaction would prove disastrous for the system as a whole. As individual debtors contracted their economies in order to meet their interest payments, their demand for imports would diminish, and so would the exports of their suppliers. The entire economic system would contract, and in the end no one would be further forward in their ability to pay their debts. THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF) has offered Brazil a $ 30 billion loan, most of it reserved for next year, on condition that the country continue to run a large primary surplus in the government budget.
