5|$|NVC has {{reportedly}} been {{an element of}} a bundle of interventions that produced dramatic changes in forensic psychiatric nursing settings in which a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> is the norm. NVC was adopted, {{in combination with other}} interventions, in an effort to reduce violence. The interventions were said to reduce key violence indicators by 90 percent over a three-year period in a medium security unit, and by around 50 percent in a single year in a maximum security unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} of the NDH authorities to resistance had been to burn down the villages where this had occurred, and there were mass shootings of Serbs, which escalated the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> even further. In late May and June, 173 Serbs had been rounded up, tortured and killed in Nevesinje, and in early June, another 140 Serbs had been killed at Ljubinje. In response, Serbs attacked Ustaše officials and facilities, and conducted raids themselves, killing Muslim villagers.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in major US cities, the 1960s was a turbulent decade for the city. Numerous {{civil rights and}} anti-war protests took place, including large protests led by Marie Hicks to desegregate Girard College. Students took over the Community College of Philadelphia in a sit-in, race riots broke out in Holmesburg Prison, and a 1964 riot along West Columbia Avenue killed two people, injured over 300 and caused around US$3 million in damages. Crime was also a serious problem. Primarily drug-related gang warfare plagued the city, and in 1970 crime was rated the city's number one problem in a City Planning Commission survey. The court system was overtaxed and the tactics {{of the police department}} under Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo were controversial. Frank Rizzo was credited with preventing the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> seen in other cities at the time and was elected mayor in 1971.|$|E

25|$|School {{violence}} in Portugal {{is not unique}} to public schools or the major urban centers. Public and private Portuguese schools have all experienced an increase in school violence.

25|$|The IRA {{was capable}} of {{carrying}} on with a significant <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> for the foreseeable future.

40|$|After {{elections}} in 2007, Kenya experienced some <b>of</b> the worst <b>violence</b> {{in its history}} leaving over 1, 000 people dead and several hundred thousand displaced. Some towns experienced very high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> while others suffered only low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> or none at all. In order {{to account for the}} sub-national variation in the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> across Kenya, I introduce a framework that explains the mobilization <b>of</b> ethnic <b>violence.</b> ^ The strategic context within which violence takes place – defined as the goals of political actors along with the institutions and policies where they are active – determines who attacks whom. The challenge <b>of</b> mobilizing <b>violence</b> determines where and how violence is organized. This depends on two factors. First, violence is more likely to occur where attackers are strong and target populations are weak. Second, deadly violence requires violence specialists, people with the skills and opportunity to commit violence. ^ I present evidence from 8 case study locations in Kenya – four places with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and four places with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> In the locations with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> I carried out semi-structured interviews with youth who participated in or witnessed violence. In the towns with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> I interviewed similar youth who did not riot. I show that organized violence occurred in places where there were significant numbers of supporters of the opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and where violence specialists, either in the form of criminal gangs, or Kalenjin warriors, were present. I also show that in some cases elites, civil society associations and security forces could constrain violence. ^ I also study the March 2004 violence in Kosovo. I present evidence from 4 case studies of towns in Kosovo. In Kosovo too the strategic context determined who attacked whom. Attacks in Kosovo occurred in the attackers 2 ̆ 7 strongholds and deadly violence involved violence specialists. One main difference between the violence in Kenya and the violence in Kosovo is that in Kosovo violence specialists traveled greater distances. This means that their presence does not predict the location <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> {{in the same way as}} it does in Kenya. ...|$|R
25|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to the executions policy was the escalating <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> In {{the first two months}} of the Civil War (July–August 1922), Free State forces had successfully taken all the territory held by Republicans and the war seemed all but over. After the Anti-Treaty side resorted to guerrilla tactics in August–September, National Army casualties mounted and they even lost control over some of the territory taken in the Irish Free State offensive. The town of Kenmare, for example, was re-taken by Anti-Treaty fighters on 9 September and held by them until early December.|$|E
25|$|From the 1980s {{through to}} the early 2000s there was an {{increased}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> by animal rights extremist groups directed at individuals and institutions associated with animal research. Activist groups involved included the Justice Department, the Animal Rights Militia and SHAC. In the 1980s, animal rights became associated with punk subculture and ideologies, particularly straight edge hardcore punk in the United States and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom. This association continues on into the 21st century, {{as evidenced by the}} prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe.|$|E

The Pakistani military under his command has also supported the democratically elected government {{on the federal level}} and the Baloch provincial and local government in ending the Balochistan insurgency by pursuing reconciliation and integration of former militants back into mainstream Pakistani society. General Sharif also developed a new brigade-level military unit to help protect and secure the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor which runs through Balochistan province. General Sharif helped to develop Pakistan's indigenous defence industry which resulted in the savings of more than $1.14 billion of Pakistan's forex, over a year and half time period.|$|E

25|$|Many {{conflicts}} {{that result in}} harm and death involve status, reputation, and seemingly trivial insults. Steven Pinker in his book The Blank Slate argues that in non-state societies without a police {{it was very important}} to have a credible deterrence against aggression. Therefore, it was important to be perceived as having a credible reputation for retaliation, resulting in humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting reputation ("honor"). Pinker argues that the development {{of the state and the}} police have dramatically reduced the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.|$|E
25|$|Armed with pistols, grenades, {{dynamite}} and hand-held bombs, {{the seizure}} of the bank lasted for 14 hours, resulting {{in the deaths of}} ten of the Armenian men and Ottoman soldiers. The Ottoman reaction to the takeover saw further massacres and pogroms of 6,000 Armenians living in Constantinople and also Hamid threatening to level the entire building itself. However, intervention on part of the European diplomats in the city managed to persuade the men to give way, assigning safe passage to the survivors to France. Despite the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> the Turks had wrought, the takeover was reported positively in the European press, praising the men for their courage and the objectives they attempted to accomplish. Nevertheless, aside from issuing a note condemning the pogroms in the city, the European powers did not act on their promises to enforce reforms in the country as future massacres of Armenians continued to take place.|$|E
25|$|British rule marked, however, {{a period}} of growing unrest. Arab resentment at British rule and the influx of Jewish {{immigrants}} (by 1948 one in six Jews in Palestine lived in Jerusalem) boiled over in anti-Jewish riots in Jerusalem in 1920, 1929, and the 1930s that caused significant damage and several deaths. The Jewish community organized self-defense forces {{in response to the}} Jerusalem pogrom of April 1920 and later disturbances; while other Jewish groups carried out bombings and attacks against the British, especially in response to suspected complicity with the Arabs and restrictions on immigration during World WarII imposed by the White Paper of 1939. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> continued to escalate throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In July 1946 members of the underground Zionist group Irgun blew up a part of the King David Hotel, where the British forces were temporarily located, an act which led to the death of 91 civilians.|$|E

In the following weeks, protests spread to other sixty Romanian cities and dozens of cities in the Romanian diaspora. In Bucharest, the largest protest took place on 19 January, when up to 20,000 people expressed their disagreements with Băsescu regime. Several days, Bucharest faced widespread rioting and acts of vandalism. Thousands of policemen and gendarmes were deployed on the streets to confront angry demonstrators that stoned the vehicles of the law enforcers, vandalized shops and burned cars. Riot police used tear gas and flares to repel demonstrators who blocked traffic in the center of Bucharest. According to the Gendarmerie, destructions were caused by football ultras infiltrated among peaceful demonstrators. During these days of turmoil, several protesters entered the Romanian Television headquarters to blame the broadcaster for censorship. Official figures indicated over 60 injuries during clashes between police and protesters, while up to 283 arrests were made. Several journalists were injured while transmitting live the events.
