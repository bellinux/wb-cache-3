It was first developed within Toyota Motor Corporation in the Automotive Industry, but was then adopted by many organisations in all fields of human activities. A deeper observation of this success displays behaviours of complex systems: {{a high number}} of agents interact with each other, using basic routines for which they have been coached systematically, creating a much better result than each individual could have reached by themselves (emerging behaviour). We model two significant processes of Lean: Hoshin Kanri (for management of the organisation objectives) and Nemawashi (consensus building). The simulations performed based on these models show qualitative as well as quantitative evidence for emerging behaviours of the <b>Lean</b> <b>organisation.</b> They also allow to demonstrate the existence of several success factors for the Lean organisation: proficiency of the agents, readiness of the management to accept emergent proposals, and strong requirement for rigour in the execution of the decision process...|$|E

The manager's role changed radically with the implementation of Lean production. The focus in managerial tasks changed from managing processes to developing and coaching people. Supporting structures were developed to empower employees and give them more responsibility for daily management activities. These supporting structures included visual control, goal deployment, short daily meetings, two-way communication flow, and a system of continuous improvement. Many leadership behaviours exhibited by Lean managers can be classified as transformational leadership behaviours. However, the need for transformational leadership behaviours was smaller, if the supporting management structure was strong...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{documented}} in the literature that combining overlapping manufacturing practices lead to superior performance. The primary driver {{of this study is}} the conceptual overlap the researcher identified between the zero waste proposition in Lean and the zero defects (loss to society) proposition in Taguchi’s Quality Philosophy (TQP); TQP provides the backbone of Taguchi’s robust parameter design (RPD) approach, a statistically driven experimental method that enables engineers to identify optimum design parameter settings to make the product’s functionality robust against the background variables (noise). This study hypothesises that Taguchi’s RPD approach complements Lean. This overall hypothesis was examined in two phases. First, through the literature, the researcher hypothesised the theoretical relationships between TQP and Lean, through the mediating role being played by Continuous Improvement to explain Manufacturing Outcomes. This model was tested through Structural Equation Modelling using data collected from 318 respondents in 31 apparel manufacturing factories belonging to a mature <b>Lean</b> <b>organisation</b> in Sri Lanka. The researcher found that the model was a good fit to data (e. g. RMSEA = 0. 047), which suggested that her hypothesised theoretical model is tenable and that TQP is acceptable to Lean practitioners as an avenue to improve manufacturing performance. Next, the researcher examined the practical compatibility between Taguchi’s RPD approach and Lean through extensive fieldwork in one of the factories in the <b>Lean</b> <b>organisation.</b> The work involved conducting RPD experiments to solve a substantial quality problem, (which helped the researcher to identify the merits and demerits of Taguchi methods) and also permitted ethnographic engagement with the factory staff. This enabled the researcher to explore the drivers and restraints of integrating Taguchi’s RPD in the setting studied. The merits of Taguchi’s RPD were found to be the high degree of standardisation, ease of conducting the experiment and analysing the data, and compatibility with the Lean culture. The researcher identified 5 drivers (also 3 inhibitors) out of which, the most influential drivers were: (a) the experienced ineffectiveness of the existing tools and techniques being used, (b) non-value adding activities associated with machine setting up, and (c) conduciveness to conduct large Taguchi style experiments. Using Force Field Analysis as the theoretical framework, the researcher explained how <b>Lean</b> <b>organisation,</b> similar to the one being considered, can move towards using Taguchi’s RPD as a tool for process improvement. The study identified several future research directions for practitioners and academics...|$|E

The focus is on how WWW can improve project organisations to manage their knowledge, be it {{in the form of}} documents, formal communication or the tacit aspect of human interaction. In order to study the research hypotheses related to improved efficiency and <b>leaner</b> <b>organisations</b> resulting from networked operations, a layered framework is presented on organisational processes taking place in the distributed project business.

Basing on these cases the paper concludes that deploying advanced WWW-technologies to distributed engineering processes their punctuality, cost control and workflow can be improved. The cases indicate also, that the new tools enable the initiation of learning processes based on the quantitative information that accumulates in the network servers during the execution of the project. This information can be used to refine the organisation and focus the processes on the truly value-adding activities, which all support the research hypotheses set for the study...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Three methodologies are {{associated}} with production optimisation, namely, Theory of Constraints (TOC), Lean and Six Sigma – and each boasts {{with a number of}} success stories. This dissertation addresses the possibility of implementing all three these methodologies in a specific sequence at an organisation and also sets out to determine the impact of this implementation. A literature survey was conducted on all three stand-alone methodologies {{as well as on the}} combined methodology, which is called the Theory of Constrains Lean Six Sigma (TLS). TLS literature suggests that TOC should be implemented first with a view to identify the constraint in an organisation. Lean implementation should follow in order to eliminate any waste in the organisation. Lastly, Six Sigma should be implemented to optimise the process variability. TOC literature explains that The Goal of any organisation is to make money. All other objectives are only the means of achieving The Goal. The literature further indicates that the constraint in any organisation determines the drumbeat, and that this constraint should be managed by means of the Drum-Buffer-Rope methodology. Lean literature points towards 14 Management Principles by means of which an organisation should be managed in order to become a <b>Lean</b> <b>organisation,</b> while Six Sigma literature is concerned with the DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyse-Improve-Control) methodology used for improvement projects and the belt system that is used to manage these improvement projects. Jonker Sailplanes, a sailplanes manufacturer in Potchefstroom, South Africa, was used as a case study for the implementation of TLS. A description is given of the processes and procedures that were followed before and after the implementation of TLS. The TLS methodology had to be adapted in order to meet the specific needs of Jonker Sailplanes into an adapted 14 -step TLS implementation plan. After implementing TOC and Lean at Jonker Sailplanes, it was found that the organisation was not ready for the transition from Lean projects to Six Sigma projects. The implementation of Six Sigma was therefore referred for future research. One of the most significant findings of the current study was the very positive impact that the implementation of TLS had on the organisation: the production tempo (throughput) of the organisation has increased while the operating expenses per aircraft have decreased. This confirms that the profit per aircraft has increased. A critical evaluation of the implementation of the TLS methodology can therefore maintain that the implementation of TLS at Jonker Sailplanes was a success since the production tempo (throughput) and the organisational profit were increased and the implementation of the methodology was done with relative ease. In terms of interpreting results it was also necessary to set out how Jonker Sailplanes proceeded from a prototyping environment to a production setup, and how specifically identifying the constraint helped to achieve this transition. Furthermore, is it argued that when Lean is implemented before TOC, this could move the organisation away from The Goal, which is to make money. The interpretation of findings suggests that the procedure followed at Jonker Sailplanes was the most appropriate one. Finally, recommendations are made for future studies in terms of how to further improve the impact of the TLS implementation at Jonker Sailplanes. Master...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – During {{the last}} decades, {{different}} quality management concepts, including {{total quality management}} (TQM), six sigma and lean, have been applied by many different organisations. Although much important work has been documented regarding TQM, six sigma and lean, {{a number of questions}} remain concerning the applicability of these concepts in various organisations and contexts. Hence, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to describe the similarities and differences between the concepts, including an evaluation and criticism of each concept. Design/methodology/approach – Within a case study, a literature review and face-to-face interviews in typical TQM, six sigma and <b>lean</b> <b>organisations</b> have been carried out. Findings – While TQM, six sigma and lean have many similarities, especially concerning origin, methodologies, tools and effects, they differ in some areas, in particular concerning the main theory, approach and the main criticism. The lean concept is slightly different from TQM and six sigma. However, there is a lot to gain if organisations are able to combine these three concepts, as they are complementary. Six sigma and lean are excellent road-maps, which could be used one by one or combined, together with the values in TQM. Originality/value – The paper provides guidance to organisations regarding the applicability and properties of quality concepts. Organisations need to work continuously with customer-orientated activities in order to survive; irrespective of how these activities are labelled. The paper will also serve as a basis for further research in this area, focusing on practical experience of these concepts...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, we have {{witnessed}} {{a dramatic change in}} the field of product design. Fundamentally, product design is now commonly referred to as 'development'. This term conveys the extension of the designer's influence throughout the entire process, and not just in the middle, but in the front end marketing and the back end engineering stages. This change has broadened our scope, opened up our worlds and our minds, and has made product designers more important to the practice of developing products than ever before. Integrated in this change are other realities that must be confronted in order to succeed in the field of product design. New software and technologies have profoundly altered the value and core of the traditional set of skills of the designer. New methods of market research extract from consumers the unspoken needs and unrealised habits and behaviours. There is an almost universal desire for corporations to contract-out industrial design and full engineering development in order to maintain <b>lean</b> <b>organisations,</b> while leveraging world class design expertise. In order to prepare product design students for these new realities, we must continually evolve curriculums to teach and inform students of what is required of development. This expanded learning must be carefully incorporated into the formal education of product design so that students are prepared to confront today's new, altered face of design.

The opportunity to create more fulfilling and effective work in lean manufacturing is considerable, but so are the dangers of reducing its quality. <b>Lean</b> <b>organisations</b> are introducing new measures involving changes to people's jobs. However, the complex nature of work <b>organisation</b> in <b>lean</b> production enviromnents are contributing to work related injuries in particular Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI). Previous research has evaluated work organisation changes in the workplace by aligning work practices within business operations rather than considering the working situation from the workers perspective. The issues of work related injuries in lean production environments lack a coherent theoretical framework. This research work in lean production environments, has addressed certain issues however doubt and scepticism {{from the perspective of}} a range of disciplines, have emerged from the literature. In this research the possibility of identifying the levels of RSI risk has been through the development of the Lean Job Position Model. The proposal of this model has been to add and contribute to the aspects of work <b>organisation</b> in the <b>lean</b> production literature, not been previously considered. The model was applied in a lean manufacturing environment using direct observations semi-structured interviews, and a questionnaire in an action research content. The testing of the Lean Job Position Model showed that the use of Situational Strength as a strategic management method showed the key relationships that assisted the process of identifying the level of RSI risk in a lean manufacturing setting...|$|R

In 1990, they published a book called ‘The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production’. It was a concept that had slowly filtered from the east but had not made its mark on the manufacturing sector. The concept of lean, born out of the Japanese Toyota Manufacturing System, was first thought to be impossible to duplicate outside of Japan. Since Womack and company popularised this “new” way of producing goods and delivering services it spread across industries finding popularity in the medical, engineering, accounting and especially the manufacturing industries. Over {{the last few decades}} lean practices has been synonymous with efficiency, cost reduction, supply chain optimisation and innovative problem solving (Anvari Norzima, Rosnah, Hojjati and Ismail, 2010; Pieterse et al., 2010; Womack et al., 1990). Lean process implementation has been researched in abundance, as has failed attempts at lean implementation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify and assess enablers of <b>lean</b> sustainability in <b>organisations</b> where <b>lean</b> processes are already being implemented. The literature study found Organisational Culture, Leadership, Employee Engagement and Trade Unions participation as factors that contributed to successful lean implementations. The author developed a model to test Organisational Culture, Leadership, Employee Engagement and Trade Unions as enablers to sustain <b>lean</b> practices in <b>organisations</b> in South Africa’s manufacturing industries. The results proved that Organisational Culture, Leadership and Employee Engagement were considered enablers for lean sustainability. These three enablers have an interlinked relationship and together help sustainability. Lacking just one factor would surely result in unsustainable lean practices.

40|$|Abstract: For many years, <b>organisations</b> {{have studied}} <b>lean</b> production, and {{implemented}} {{certain aspects of}} <b>lean</b> in their <b>organisations</b> in efforts to continuously improve. However, lean implementation efforts have neither been successful nor sustainable. This has been primarily attributed to leadership. Furthermore, traditional organisations have not been pursuing {{the elimination of the}} eighth lean waste, which is the waste of unused employee creativity. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the impact of standard work for leaders in reducing the waste of unused employee creativity during lean implementation. Lean production is not only dependent on the lean tools and techniques, but also on the human elements of lean. These include both the leadership aspects and the employees. Therefore, successful lean implementation is partly dependent on the leadership of the organisations and human creativity embedded in the employees of the organisation. However, the leadership routines and practices that are required for lean are not always defined in various organisations. Furthermore, the extent to which these leadership routines and practices (referred to as standard work for leaders) affect the human creativity of the employees has not been sufficiently explored in literature. Based on the results of the data collected from the case study conducted in an auto manufacturing company, it was determined that whenever employees have been trained in lean, and standard work for leaders has been comprehensively implemented, then the ideas suggested by the workers increased, whereas whenever the employees were not trained in lean, and standard work for leaders has not been implemented comprehensively, the suggested ideas were less. Therefore, it was concluded that standard work for leaders when comprehensively implemented can reduce the waste of unused employee creativity. This research contributes to the current know how within the <b>lean</b> production framework. <b>Organisations</b> that are interested in implementing lean, as well as scholars who are studying lean can benefit from this study. Furthermore, a lean implementation model has been recommended, although it has not been validated. M. Phil. (Engineering Management...|$|R

50|$|The lean {{philosophy}} aims {{to reduce}} costs while optimizing and improving performance. Value stream mapping (VSM) and 5S {{are the most common}} approaches companies take on their first steps towards making their <b>organisation</b> <b>leaner.</b> Lean actions can be focused on the specific logistics processes, or cover the entire supply chain. For example, you might start from analysis of SKUs, using several days to identify and draw each SKUs path, evaluating all the participants from material suppliers to the consumer. Conducting a gap analysis determines the company's 'must take' steps to improve the value stream and achieve the objective. Based on that evaluation, the improvement group conducts the failure mode effects analysis (FMEA), in order to identify and prevent risk factors. It is crucial for front-line workers to be involved in VSM activities since they understood the process and can directly increase the efficiency. Although the impact may be small and limited for each lean activity, implementing a series small improvements incrementally along the supply chain can bring forth enhanced productivity.|$|R
30|$|Waste {{reduction}} {{is the main}} manufacturing paradigm in lean manufacturing. There {{is a difference between}} doing something lean and being lean. In 1990, James Womack and Daniel Roos coined the term “lean” in their book The Machine that Changed the World. Lean refers to a manufacturing paradigm based on the fundamental goal of the TPS: continuously minimising waste in order to maximise flow. To become lean requires changing the mind-set. Many manufacturing organisations have recognised the importance of lean management. However, many <b>organisations</b> are doing <b>lean</b> without necessarily becoming <b>lean.</b> Typically, such <b>organisations</b> sporadically implement improvements without linking their efforts to an overarching strategy. The TPS is more than applying individual methods and tools such as VSM. The purpose of lean is to use the appropriate tools {{in such a way that}} everyone connected within the value stream can work together to improve overall flow and eliminate overall waste. Not surprisingly, Fidsa found that a holistic problem solving design is usually less expensive and less wasteful in the long run because it avoids solving one problem within a complex system at the cost of creating other problems within that very system [26].|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade a number of {{principles}} of modern technology policy emerged from the intensive debate on efficient designs of technology policy to encourage and strengthen the competitiveness of economies. While at the beginning national innovation systems like national economies {{seemed to be a}} sufficient framework the ongoing process of globalization of knowledge production and its rapid diffusion changed the perspective. However, each country as a distinct location in a global economy and in an emerging global innovation system has to develop its particular competence to become or remain an attractive partner. A number of principles should be applied as guide lines to design and evaluate the respective technology policy. Nine principles are proposed in the paper. Starting with the destinction of mission versus diffusion oriented technology policies one objective of modern technology policy is to search for an adequate policy mix. Next the concept of network development in innovation systems looks for ways to increase the efficiency of the innovation system. Each institution of the innovation system should become part of a competence centre which link research institutions with innovative companies and government agencies involved in the funding and regulation process of innovation, forming something like a triple helix, a term proposed by Leydesdorff. Competence centres link {{to each other in the}} innovation system and compete with others to win market shares in the innovation system. Furthermore each organisation should apply internally and externally the principles of learning with those of <b>lean</b> research <b>organisations.</b> The basic framework, however, to ensure efficiency in the innovation system is that the government establishes a legal and regulatory framework to foster institutional competition in the innovation system so that inefficient institutions are replaced by efficient ones through a self-selection process. Selection might be accomplished by a market mechanism or a continuous evaluation of institutions. Without sufficient scientific reputation or market success no institution should be entitled to permanent funding from public or private sources. The theoretical perfect split of public and private financing would be given by the difference between the private and social rate of return of an innovation activity, so that only the amount of positive externalities which cannot be internalised by private sources should be financed by public ones.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the School of Technology University of Wolverhampton in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThe poor safety situation in the United Kingdom (UK) construction industry and its adverse socio-economic record are well documented in the existing literature. The application of Lean Construction techniques has been proposed as an effective strategy to address accidents on construction sites, a major safety concern in the construction industry. However, examination {{of the relationship between}} Lean Construction techniques and safety issues has been marginal. This study explores this relationship with the aim of developing a framework for using Lean Construction techniques to promote safety on UK construction sites. A framework was initially devised based on a synthesis of the literature and further refined based on findings from interviews held with 10 Lean Construction practitioners on antecedents of Lean Construction techniques and safety issues. In order to develop and confirm the framework, data was collected from practicing <b>Lean</b> Construction <b>organisations</b> using a questionnaire survey and analysed using descriptive statistics, inferential statistics and inter-rater agreement statistical test to examine the pattern and extent of the relationships. The study found a total of thirty-eight (38) relationships between Lean Construction techniques and safety issues. These relationships are mainly positive in nature in that they demonstrate path to improvement in safety on construction sites. They show which techniques could be used to address the relevant safety issue. Furthermore, it was established that the application of Lean Construction techniques on construction sites can be impeded by challenges such as: lack of Lean Construction knowledge, complexity, misconception about Lean and difficulties in changing employees’ working culture. The study identified strategies {{that could be used to}} address these challenges. These include enlightenment on benefits of Lean practice, publication of improvements realised from Lean practice, training, workers’ involvement and empowerment, persistence, robust planning and gradual step-by-step implementation. The study, therefore, concludes that Lean Construction techniques have positive relationships with safety issues on construction sites in the UK and on the basis of the relationships develops an integrated framework to guide application of the techniques by contracting organisations in promoting safety. The study makes a number of recommendations including the incorporation of Lean Construction practice into government health and safety initiatives, regulations and policies, and identifies areas for further research...|$|R
40|$|Lean {{manufacturing}} {{provides a}} fundamental basis for competitiveness {{in the auto}} component sector. The implementation and sustainability of the lean philosophy are important aspects when deciding on {{the adoption of the}} <b>lean</b> concept within <b>organisations.</b> Various barriers to implementation present themselves during and after lean implementation. These barriers are often related and in some instances they may be converted from an impediment into an enabler of lean within companies. The impact of unions as a negative or positive influence forms a central focus of this research. The influences on the perception of unions and their constituents are studied in relation to other barriers in order to determine their relevance in the Eastern Cape auto sector. A research questionnaire was constructed in line with the selected research design. The application of triangulation in the research design allows for greater depth in the responses from the participants in this research. The quantitative analysis combined with the qualitative thematic analysis provides an excellent means to explore and understand these selected barriers to lean in great detail. It can be concluded that automotive trade unions in the Eastern Cape are a barrier to implementation; however the factor that influences lean the most is the incorrect perception of lean due to ineffective leadership practices among organisational and union leaders, among other barriers. The impact of unions on the acceptance of a lean culture has far-reaching implications for the auto sector that requires a specific implementation approach in order to change perceptions and gain the requisite interest alignment among unions and their constituents...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the launch}} of the Government Construction Strategy in 2011, the UK {{construction}} sector has witnessed {{a significant increase in the}} awareness and adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM). As recognised by the strategy, there are synergies between Lean Construction and BIM. BIM implementation demands changes in existing process and procedures for design and construction, representing a technology change but also a people and process change. Therefore, the implementation of BIM is a business decision that should be aligned with a business strategy in making the <b>organisation</b> <b>leaner.</b> This paper presents a BIM implementation project through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) between the University of Salford and Links, a design, manufacture and fit-out SME based in the UK. KTP is a government-funded initiative to support businesses improvements by accessing universities expertise. The project aims is to implement BIM as a catalyst for a lean transformation, streamlining process and operations. The research adopts a case study methodology on a BIM implementation for Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) at Links through an approach of reviewing the organisational business process and workflows followed by exploring and implementing appropriate technologies that then enable the people and process transformation. The 30 months project is being delivered through 5 key stages. This paper presents the findings from the first two stages that have been completed to date of 1. Establishing and consolidating best practice knowledge in BIM; 2. Conducting a detailed review and analysis of the organisation’s current situation, and the third, which is currently progressing, of 3. Developing a BIM-based collaborative strategy. The remaining stages will implement a BIM-based collaborative strategy for DfMA through a pilot project before conducting a project review and evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates how the {{organisational}} culture and leadership influence {{the implementation of}} <b>lean</b> system in <b>organisations.</b> In doing so, {{organisational culture}}, leadership and internal issues concerning human resources are incorporated and discussed. The study further explains how an organisation can benefit from assessment of their culture by adopting Lean Culture Assessment Model (LCAM). The Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for lean system and internal as well as external organisational factors in Toyota’s working culture that brings about positive impacts on lean implementation is discussed. It is found from the literature review {{that a number of}} factors such as top management commitment and leadership, empowerment and training of human resources, building relationship with suppliers and customers, enhancing departmental relations and teamwork need {{to be taken into account}} in order to implement a successful lean system. The purpose of this study is to bring this system into organisations’ attention and give them insight of evaluating their weaknesses and strengths by implementing the proposed LCAM. The methodology for this study was based on secondary data that represents literatures referring to Toyota’s culture, lean’s CSFs and organisational culture. The literature review establishes the importance of organisational culture, its leadership and the human resources in any organisations’ success. Moreover, empirical evidence from the reviewed literature shows that an organisation cannot succeed in lean unless it has a healthy culture, skilled workers, the buy-in from the top management and a strong leadership. The key and essential part of an organisation was found to be the leaders who act as a cornerstone between top management and bottom line workers. The LCAM would enable the organisations to assess their internal culture before implementing lean management. The model has been designed by systematically incorporating the lean values, philosophy, principles and Toyota’s culture...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the quality {{practices}} of European pharmaceutical manufacturers to determine the level of readiness of this industrial sector to implement and/or sustain lean manufacturing (LM) Design/methodology/approach: An assessment framework developed by Al‐Najem et al. (2013) was adapted to evaluate how ready European pharmaceutical manufacturers are to implement and/or sustain lean manufacturing. Therefore, the lean readiness (LR) level of these organisations was assessed through six quality practices related to LM. These included: processes; planning and control; human resources; top management and leadership; customer relations; and supplier relations. One research question and three hypotheses were formulated and tested using a combination of descriptive statistics and non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Data was collected through a survey questionnaire distributed to 310 European pharmaceutical manufacturers and responded by 37 of these organisations. Findings: Overall, the results of this study indicate an inadequate level of LR for the participating firms. Simultaneously, it was concluded that factors such as company size, type of relationships with suppliers and ISO 9000 certification do not have an effect on the quality practices, and hence LR level, of European pharmaceutical manufacturing organisations Research limitations/implications: Practical implications: This study provides crucial information regarding the LR level of European pharmaceutical manufacturers, which can now be aware of the areas in their practices that require further improvement towards a successful <b>lean</b> journey. Simultaneously, <b>organisations</b> in the pharmaceutical sector that intend to implement LM can consider the results of this study and evaluate their readiness level. Managers can therefore refer to this research and use it as a platform to take better decisions regarding what quality aspects of their operations need to be enhanced to successfully deploy or sustain a lean strategy Originality/value: This research is one of the very few studies that have focused on evaluating whether the European pharmaceutical manufacturing industry is ready to successfully implement or sustain LM. Therefore, this research expands the limited existent body of knowledge of LM in this industr...|$|R
