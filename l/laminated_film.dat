Currently, the microchip employs a nonbiodegradable sealant layer, and the new design aims to fabricate it only of biodegradable parts. Experiments were conducted to evaluate two potential designs that are fabricated via lamination, and a final design was proposed based on the results. Design 1 sought to replace the sealant directly with a PLA backing layer, but the laminated backing layer was found to leak in 14 C-dextran release experiments.

The <b>laminated</b> <b>film</b> was optimized to a 200 - [mu]m thick poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) 2 A membrane, and the film-laminated microchip was shown to release 14 C-dextran within a 40 -day period.

A laboratory heat sealer was used to study the response of laminated films to temperature, time, and pressure. Platen temperature was confirmed as primary factor in controlling heat-seal strength. Dwell time must be sufficiently long to bring the interfacial temperature to a desired level. When the desired heat-seal strength has been achieved, further increase of dwell time did not improved heat-seal strength.

Then, we tried to study this problem by using an agar phantom with a blood vessel model (made by Polyester-Polypropylene <b>laminated</b> <b>film)</b> passing through it and a microwave heating equipment (TAGMED- 434 System). In our studies, the presence of a large vessel simulated blood stream (water flow in this study) tended to retard effective elevating temperature widely on sideway area of it on thermography. The negative influence of simulated blood flow on heating was extended about 30 mm or more than from a large blood vessel model wall. Upon this, the temperature of in-flow and out-flow of simulated blood stream of the heating area in phantom was measured, and the amount of the heat loss that was carried away by simulated blood stream was estimated. The amount of heat loss by the blood vessel model was more than ten times of the heat loss on diffusion by thermal conduction. To reduce the negative influence of simulated blood stream on heating, we studied to use the combination of the external heating applicator with the interstitial heating applicator inserted near a blood vessel model. The effectively heated area was retrieved to some degree. It seems usually difficult to heat the tumor near large blood vessels sufficiently by the external heating method. Therefore we have to grasp the tissue structure around the tumor in hyperthermia, requiring the use of every devices for efficacious hyperthermo-therapy in cancer treatment. 温熱療法において, 腫瘍組織血流量が加温に及ぼす影響はよく検討されてきた。しかるに食道癌, 膵臓癌等で多々認められるように腫瘍周囲近傍に大血管血流が存在する場合, これが温度上昇に与える影響も無視できないと考えられるが, 大血管血流の加温に対する影響についての報告は今までにない。そこで今回大血管血流の存在が温度上昇に対して与える影響を検討するためにNaCl加寒天ファントムに大血管血塊モデルを組み込んだ実験系を考案し, マイクロ波加温装置で加温実験を行った。大血管モデル血流の存在下に有効加温領域の大幅な横方向ヘの縮小がサーモグラフィーで認められ, 影響は血管モデル壁より 30 mm程度以上に及んだ。血管モデルから十分遠い地点と血管モデル近傍とでは温度上昇度に大きな差を認めた。温度下降曲線の傾きから求め評価した大血管モデル血流のもち去った熱量は, 熱伝導によって失われた熱量よりも 10 倍程大きかった。加温部への入口と出口においてモデル血塊の温度測定を行い, 実際にモデル血塊がもち去る熱量を算出した。血流速度が増すとモデル血流がもち去る熱量も増加し, それと同じ割合で大血管近傍領域の温度下降度も大きくなることが示された。大血管血流の加温に対する影響を減ずるため, モデル血管近傍に組織内加温用針状アプリケーターを刺入し体外加温との併用加温をすると, 有効加温領域はかなり回復した。しかし血管モデルの存する深さよりもさらに奥には有効加温領域は拡がらなかった。したがって腫瘍内および近傍に比較的大きな血管がある場合には, 期待通りに加温し得ない可能性が大きいので, 温熱治療計画時には腫瘍周辺構造をよく把握し, 適...|$|E
