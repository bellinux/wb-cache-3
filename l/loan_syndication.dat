25|$|China {{joined a}} number of {{international}} economic organizations, becoming {{a member of the}} World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the Multi-Fiber Agreement. China became an observer of GATT in 1982 and formally applied to participate as a full member in July 1986. China also reversed its aversion to foreign capital, borrowing money from international lending organizations, foreign governments, and foreign commercial banks and consortia and permitting foreign banks to open branches in China. The Chinese government maintained a good credit rating internationally and did not pile up huge foreign debts like many other communist and developing countries. Between 1979 and 1985, China signed loans totaling US$20.3 billion, US$15.6 billion of which it already had used. Most loans went into infrastructure projects, such as energy and transportation, and funded raw materials imports. The Bank of China, the principal foreign exchange bank, established branches overseas and participated in international financial markets in Eurobonds and <b>loan</b> <b>syndication.</b>|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} and reserves were controlled {{in the mid-1980s}} by the State Administration of Exchange Control under the People's Bank of China, the central bank. Foreign exchange allocations to banks, ministries, and enterprises were all approved by the State Administration of Exchange Control. The Bank of China, the foreign exchange arm of the People's Bank of China, lost its monopoly on all foreign exchange transactions in 1984 when the Agricultural Bank, People's Construction Bank, China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) were permitted to deal in foreign currency. The Bank of China remained China's principal foreign exchange bank and provided loans for production and commercial transactions related to exports, set up branches overseas, maintained correspondent relations with foreign banks, and did research on international monetary trends. The Bank of China also was active in international financial markets through such activities as <b>loan</b> <b>syndication</b> and issuing of foreign bonds. CITIC, formed in 1979 to facilitate foreign investment in China, also borrowed and lent internationally and issued foreign bonds in addition to encouraging and participating in joint ventures, importing foreign technology and equipment, and making overseas investments. In 1986 CITIC was renamed CITIC Group and shifted its emphasis to power, metallurgical, and raw materials industries, which had trouble attracting investments. In late 1986 the CITIC Group had set up 47 joint ventures, invested in 114 domestic companies, and issued US$550 million in foreign bonds. The China Investment Bank was established in 1981 as a channel for medium- and long-term loans from international financial {{institutions such as the}} World Bank.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{whether and how}} the earnings quality and state-ownership of Chinese corporate borrowers affect the features of syndicated loans, in terms of <b>loan</b> spread, maturity, <b>syndication</b> structure and the participation of foreign lenders. Using sample syndicated loan facilities issued to Chinese public firms over 1998 - 2016, we show novel and robust evidence that earnings quality is negatively associated with loan spread and state-ownership is positively associated with loan maturity, the concentration of syndication structure and the participation of foreign lenders as lead arrangers. In contrast to evidence on bilateral loans, we find state-ownership does not affect syndicated loan prices. We also show that compared with domestic lenders, foreign lenders rely more heavily on ‘hard’ information. They charge lower spread, than domestic lenders, from Chinese borrowers with higher earnings quality and they {{are more willing to}} lead <b>loan</b> <b>syndications</b> for state-owned borrowers. Overall, our findings are consistent with the conjecture that earnings quality {{plays an important role in}} alleviating the asymmetric information issue and state-ownership serves as a favorable signal for implicit guarantee for repayment in syndicated loan market in China...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} role of {{syndicated}} loan markets in financial market development in 24 European countries. We find credit spreads to be negatively related to market size in small markets and positively related in large financial markets. Syn-dicated loans play a different role in large versus small financial systems. In small markets, <b>loan</b> <b>syndications</b> are a substitute for missing public debt markets, while in large financial markets loan syndicates enable arrangers to spread risk more efficiently. Foreign banks tend to reinforce this effect. In small markets, they transfer external finance across borders and in large markets they tend to take on more risky projects. Consequently, we find that characteristics of loan contracts arranged by foreign banks in small versus large markets differ considerably...|$|R
