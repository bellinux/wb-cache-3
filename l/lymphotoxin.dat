25|$|The {{theory of}} an anti-tumoral {{response}} {{of the immune system}} in vivo was recognized by the physician William B. Coley. In 1968, Dr. Gale A Granger from the University of California, Irvine, reported a cytotoxic factor produced by lymphocytes and named it <b>lymphotoxin</b> (LT). Credit for this discovery is shared by Dr. Nancy H. Ruddle from Yale University, who reported the same activity in a series of back-to-back articles published in the same month. Subsequently, in 1975 Dr. Lloyd J. Old from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, reported another cytotoxic factor produced by macrophages and named it tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Both factors were described based on their ability to kill mouse fibrosarcoma L-929 cells. These concepts were extended to systemic disease in 1981, when Ian A. Clark, from the Australian National University, in collaboration with Elizabeth Carswell in Dr. Old's group, working with pre-sequencing era data, reasoned that excessive production of TNF causes malaria disease and endotoxin poisoning.|$|E

Two sugars, N-acetylglucosamine and α-methylmannoside, were able to inhibit direct cell lysis of both MOLT- 4 and K- 562 target cells. However, saccharide inhibition was distinct {{for each type of}} target even when effector cells were obtained from the same donor.

40|$|Interferons (IFN) ~ affect many cell {{functions}} {{in addition to}} their inhibitory action on virus replication. Among these effects on cell functions are the inhibition of cell growth in vitro, augmentation or inhibition of natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity, induction of major histocompatibility antigens, and the activation of macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity (reviewed in 1 - 3). Different types of IFN, however, may vary in their capacities to mediate these biological responses. For example, the mitogen-induced "immune " (gamma) IFN appears to show stronger immunoregulatory (4 - 8) and cell growth inhibitory (9 - 11) activities than alpha or beta IFN. While recent studies used recombinant IFN-gamma (12) to demonstrate immunoregulatory activities of this IFN, most studies of antiproliferative activity used either crude or only partially purified IFN-gamma preparations, thus leaving open the possibility that this biological activity may be at least partially due to the presence of other cytotoxic lymphokines in these preparations. <b>Lymphotoxins</b> (LT) are a group of lymphocyte-derived glycoproteins possessin...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prion {{diseases}} {{continue to}} present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to clinicians and researchers worldwide. Many important aspects of prion biology remain unclear, and {{we still do not}} understand the nature of the infectious agent, the mechanisms leading to central nervous system damage, and the physiological function of the cellular prion protein. The current diagnostic tools for prion infections are breathtakingly insensitive when compared with those of other infectious diseases. Finally, there are hardly any therapeutic strategies. However, not all is gloomy, and many recent developments have advanced our basic understanding of prion diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: In most prion infections, the portal of entry is extraneural. Although we still do not understand all details, several molecules and cell types have been identified as key players in prion neuroinvasion. These include <b>lymphotoxins</b> and their receptors, follicular dendritic cells, and the autonomic nervous system.

No Peyer's patches develop in RAG deficient mice. Formation of FAE with typical M cells has not been analyzed in these mice.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Cytokines and chemokines are {{essential}} {{players in the}} initiation and progression of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). This review focuses on the most recent data and the new insight they provide for the disease mechanisms of dermatomyositis, polymyositis and sporadic inclusion body myositis. Recent findings Interferon-alpha and beta are implicated in the innate immune responses underlying dermatomyositis, whereas interferon-gamma stands forward as a more general regulator of the IIMs, reflected by the induction of many interferon-gamma-inducible genes in patients. Interleukin- 1 beta and interleukin- 18 are localized to the inflammatory cells present in IIM muscle, where they may focally induce further recruitment of immune cells. <b>Lymphotoxins</b> are implicated in the cytotoxic activities toward polymyositis and inclusion body myositis muscle fibers, and in the organization and antibody production by B-cells in dermatomyositis. The a-chemokines CXCL 9, CXCL 10 and the beta-chemokines CCL 2, CCL 3, CCL 4, CCL 19 and CCL 21 are expressed in IIM muscle.

40|$|Activated {{lymphocytes}} and lymphoid-tissue inducer cells express <b>lymphotoxins</b> (LTs), {{which are}} essential for the organogenesis and maintenance of lymphoreticular microenvironments. Here we describe that T-cell-restricted overexpression of LT induces fulminant thymic involution. This phenotype was prevented by ablation of the LT receptors tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 1 or LT beta receptor (LTbetaR), representing two non-redundant pathways. Multiple lines of transgenic Ltalphabeta and Ltalpha mice show such a phenotype, which was not observed on overexpression of LTbeta alone. Reciprocal bone marrow transfers between LT-overexpressing and receptor-ablated mice show that involution was not due to a T cell-autonomous defect but was triggered by TNFR 1 and LTbetaR signaling to radioresistant stromal cells. Thymic involution was partially prevented by the removal of one allele of LTbetaR but not of TNFR 1, establishing a hierarchy in these signaling events. Infection with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus triggered a similar thymic pathology in wt, but not in Tnfr 1 (-/-) mice. These mice displayed elevated TNFalpha in both thymus and plasma, as well as increased LTs on both CD 8 (+) and CD 4 (-) CD 8 (-) thymocytes. These findings suggest that enhanced T cell-derived LT expression helps to control the physiological size of the thymic stroma and accelerates its involution via TNFR 1 /LTbetaR signaling in pathological conditions and possibly also in normal aging...|$|R

40|$|Four {{cardinal}} immune disorders {{interacting with}} each other may promote the progressive T cell depletion and immunosuppression characterizing AIDS. Immune activation of HIV- 1 infected T 4 cells leads to virus release and premature cell death. Both virus release with its resulting viral load and dead cells {{are the source of}} gp 120 stimulus. Anergy of non-infected CD 4 cells, resulting in cytokine dysregulation may be promoted by impairing the CD 4 -MHC interaction during CD 4 cell activation either directly through the SLWDQ pentapeptide identity with the CD 4 molecule and the CD 4 binding region or through a gp 120 -induced autoimmune reaction to CD 4. Overproduction of IFNα, the known antiproliferative and cytolytic cytokine may promote in a paracrine manner to neighbouring cells the immunosuppression generated by the lack of IL 2 secretion following CD 4 cell anergy. Apoptosis of activated non infected T cells could be induced by effector components of the sutoimmune reaction (CTL, <b>Lymphotoxins</b> or Abs?) directed towards the 2 consensus gp 120 sequence identity/similarity (INCTR and FYCNST) shared with the APO/Fas molecule.

Preincubation experiments suggested that there may be a population of pre-existing aggressor cells which only require linking to the targets by the mitogens for activation of their cytotoxic potential.
