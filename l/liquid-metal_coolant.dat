50|$|K-123, 1982: the Alfa-class {{submarine}} {{reactor core}} damaged by <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolant</b> leak; the sub {{was forced out}} of commission for eight years.|$|E
50|$|About {{one-fifth of}} the reactor core had {{experienced}} inadequate cooling caused by uneven coolant flows. Hot spots in the reactor had ruptured, releasing nuclear fuel and nuclear fission products into the <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolant,</b> which circulated them throughout its reactor compartment.|$|E
50|$|K-27 was {{the only}} {{submarine}} of Project 645 in the Soviet Navy. Project 645 was not assigned a NATO reporting name. That project produced one test model nuclear submarine, which incorporated a pair of experimental VT-1 nuclear reactors that used a <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolant</b> (Lead-bismuth eutectic), placed into the modified hull of a November class submarine (Project 627A).|$|E

40|$|Both liquid Hg and Pb-Bi {{eutectic}} {{have been}} proposed as possible target materials for spallation neutron sources. During the 1950 s and 1960 s, a substantial program existed at BNL {{as part of the}} Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor program on compatibility of Bi, Pb, and their alloys with structural materials. Subsequently, compatibility studies of Hg with structural materials were performed in support of development of Rankine-cycle Hg turbines for nuclear applications. This paper reviews our understanding of the corrosion/mass-transfer reactions of structural materials with these <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolants.</b> Topics discussed include the basic solubility relations of Fe, Cr, Ni, and refractory metals in these liquid metals, results of inhibition studies, role of oxygen on corrosion, and specialized topics such as cavitation corrosion and liquid-metal embrittlement. Emphasis is on utilizing the understanding gained in this earlier work on the development of heavy-liquid-metal targets in spallation neutron sources...|$|R
50|$|Liquid sodium {{presents}} {{safety problems}} because it ignites spontaneously on contact with air {{and can cause}} explosions on contact with water. This was the case at the Monju Nuclear Power Plant in a 1995 accident and fire. To {{reduce the risk of}} explosions following a leak of water from the steam turbines, the IFR design (as with other sodium-cooled fast reactors) includes an intermediate <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolant</b> loop between the reactor and the steam turbines. The purpose of this loop is to ensure that any explosion following accidental mixing of sodium and turbine water would be limited to the secondary heat exchanger and not pose a risk to the reactor itself. Alternative designs use lead instead of sodium as the primary coolant. The disadvantages of lead are its higher density and viscosity, which increases pumping costs, and radioactive activation products resulting from neutron absorption. A lead-bismuth eutectate, as used in some Russian submarine reactors, has lower viscosity and density, but the same activation product problems can occur.|$|E
40|$|An annular linear {{induction}} pump (ALIP) {{that could}} be used for circulating <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolant</b> in a fission surface power reactor system is modeled in the present work using the computational COMSOL Multiphysics package. The pump is modeled using a two-dimensional, axisymmetric geometry and solved under conditions similar to those used during experimental pump testing. Real, nonlinear, temperature-dependent material properties can be incorporated into the model for both the electrically-conducting working fluid in the pump (NaK- 78) and structural components of the pump. The intricate three-phase coil configuration of the pump is implemented in the model to produce an axially-traveling magnetic wave that is qualitatively similar to the measured magnetic wave. The model qualitatively captures the expected feature of a peak in efficiency as a function of flow rate...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHigh-temperature {{heat pipes}} are two-phase, {{capillary}} driven heat transfer devices capable of passively providing high thermal fluxes. Such a device using a <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolant</b> {{can be used}} as a solution for successful thermal management on hypersonic flight vehicles. Imaging of the <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolant</b> inside will provide valuable information in characterizing the detailed heat and mass transport. Neutron imaging possesses an inherent advantage from the fact that neutrons penetrate the heat pipe metal walls with very little attenuation, but are significantly attenuated by the liquid metal contained inside. Using the BT- 2 beam line at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, preliminary efforts have been conducted on a nickel-sodium heat pipe. The contrast between the attenuated beam and the background is calculated to be approximately 3 %. This low contrast requires sacrifice in spatial or temporal resolution so efforts have since been concentrated on lithium (Li) which has a substantially larger neutron attenuation cross section. Using the CG- 1 D beam line at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the first neutron images of high-temperature molybdenum (Mo) -Li heat pipes have been achieved. The relatively high neutron cross section of Li allows for the visualization of the Li working fluid inside the heat pipes. The evaporator region of a gravity assisted cylindrical heat pipe prototype 25 cm long was imaged from start-up to steady state operation up to approximately 900 °C. In each corner of the square bore inside, the capillary action raises the Li meniscus above the bulk Li pool in the evaporator region. As the operational temperature changes, the meniscus shapes and the bulk meniscus height also changes. Furthermore, a three-dimensional tomographic image is also reconstructed from the total of 128 projection images taken 1. 4 o apart in which the Li had already cooled and solidified...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} the {{scientific}} evidence {{for changes in the}} climate caused by greenhouse-gas emissions from human activities, the world is in ever more desperate need of new, inexhaustible, safe and clean primary energy sources. A viable solution to this problem is the widespread adoption of nuclear breeder reactor technology. Innovative breeder reactor concepts using <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolants</b> such as sodium or lead will be able to utilize the waste produced by the current light water reactor fuel cycle to power the entire world for several centuries to come. Breed & burn (B&B) type fast reactor cores can unlock the energy potential of readily available fertile material such as depleted uranium without the need for chemical reprocessing. Using B&B technology, nuclear waste generation, uranium mining needs and proliferation concerns can be greatly reduced, and after a transitional period, enrichment facilities may no longer be needed. In this dissertation, new passively operating safety systems for fast reactors cores are presented. New analysis and optimization methods for B&B core design have been developed, along with a comprehensive computer code that couples neutronics, thermal-hydraulics and structural mechanics and enables a completely automated and optimized fast reactor core design process. In addition, an experiment that expands the knowledge-base of corrosion issues of lead-based coolants in nuclear reactors was designed and built. The motivation behind the work presented in this thesis is to help facilitate the widespread adoption of safe and efficient fast reactor technology...|$|R
40|$|As a rule {{materials}} of small atomic weight (light and heavy water, graphite, and so on) {{are used as}} neutron moderators and reflectors. A new very heavy atomic weight moderator is proposed—radiogenic lead consisting mainly of isotope 208 Pb. It is characterized by extremely low neutron radiative capture cross-section (0. 23 [*]mbarn for thermal neutrons, i. e., less than that for graphite and deuterium) and highest albedo of thermal neutrons. It is evaluated {{that the use of}} radiogenic lead makes it possible to slow down the chain fission reaction on prompt neutrons in a fast reactor. This can increase safety of the fast reactors and reduce as well requirements pertaining to the fuel fabrication technology. Radiogenic lead with high 208 Pb content as a <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolant</b> of fast reactors helps to achieve a favorable (negative) reactivity coefficient on coolant temperature. It is noteworthy that radiogenic lead with high 208 Pb content may be extracted from thorium (as well as thorium-uranium) ores without isotope separation. This has been confirmed experimentally by the investigations performed at San Paulo University, Brazil...|$|E
40|$|The liquid-metal {{microstructure}} is {{a correct}} subdivision of Delaunay simplexes (triangular pyramids with atoms in their vertexes). Its dense part consists of almost regular tetrahedrons connected by faces in ramified clusters. Any metal additive (as a second component of alloy) can be outside of these tetrahedral clusters or into {{them as a}} constituent of dense liquid part. These structural states of liquid alloy convert to each other at its eutectic composition. Such the polymorphic conversion of the liquid-metal alloy is approved by molecular-dynamics simulating the Pb–K alloy and {{can be applied to}} any eutectic, for example, Na 0. 93 Tl 0. 07 with the melting point of 64 C. At the sodium side of this point, a homogeneous solution of thallium is formed in liquid sodium which becomes the colloidal one with clusters, (Na 6 Tl) n, when it is passing the eutectic point. Such the modified sodium coolant enriched by the isotope, 205 Tl, can appear attractive for inhibiting the chemical activity of this coolant maintained by oxygen-free technology. An alternative <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolant</b> for fast nuclear reactors is eutectic, Pb 0. 83 Mg 0. 17, with the melting point of 248 C. This liquid alloy as a modified lead coolant maintained by the same oxygen-free technology can appear attractive for inhibiting the high corrosion activity of molten lead...|$|E
40|$|OAK-B 135 The Encapsulated Nuclear Heat Source (ENHS) {{is a novel}} 125 MWth fast {{spectrum}} reactor {{concept that}} was selected by the 1999 DOE NERI program as a candidate ''Generation-IV'' reactor. It uses Pb-Bi or other <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolant</b> and {{is intended to be}} factory manufactured in large numbers to be economically competitive. It is anticipated to be most useful to developing countries. The US team studying the feasibility of the ENHS reactor concept consisted of the University of California, Berkeley, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Westinghouse. Collaborating with the US team were three Korean organizations: Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Korean Advanced Institute for Science and Technology (KAIST) and the University of Seoul, as well as the Central Research Institute of the Electrical Power Industry (CRIEPI) of Japan. Unique features of the ENHS include at least 20 years of operation without refueling; no fuel handling in the host country; no pumps and valves; excess reactivity does not exceed 1 $; fully passive removal of the decay heat; very small probability of core damaging accidents; autonomous operation and capability of load-following over a wide range; very long plant life. In addition it offers a close match between demand and supply, large tolerance to human errors, is likely to get public acceptance via demonstration of superb safety, lack of need for offsite response, and very good proliferation resistance. The ENHS reactor is designed to meet the requirements of Generation IV reactors including sustainable energy supply, low waste, high level of proliferation resistance, high level of safety and reliability, acceptable risk to capital and, hopefully, also competitive busbar cost of electricity...|$|E
40|$|Safety {{investigations}} {{were performed}} on 600 - and 1426 -MW(thermal) liquid-metal-cooled reactors with the heat exchangers (HXs) located in the risers of simple flow-path pool designs. This includes both critical reactors and accelerator-driven systems (ADSs) using liquid metal coolants. For the 600 -MW(thermal) ADS, the safety implications were examined for vessel sizes of two heights (11 and 15 m) and two diameters (6 and 10 m). Then, the reference design of 11 -m height and 6 -m diameter was compared with a similar design, but with the HXs located in the downcomers. The transients investigated were total-loss of-power (TLOP), unprotected-loss-of-flow (ULOF), protected-loss-of-flow, and unprotected loss-of-heat-sink accidents. The 600 -MW(thermal) ADS of 11 -m height and 6 -m diameter peaks at 1041 K after 29 h during a TLOP accident. If the diameter is increased to 10 m, it will peak after 55 h at a 178 K lower temperature thanks to its larger thermal inertia. The difference between locating the HXs in the risers and the downcomers is insignificant for this accident type. With the HXs in the risers, the temperature peaks at 1045 K after 28 h. During a ULOF accident in an ADS at full power, the core outlet temperature stabilizes at 1010 K, which is 337 K above the nominal outlet temperature. When the vessel height is increased to 15 m, the natural convection is improved, and the core outlet temperature stabilizes at 911 K. A Pb-cooled 1426 -MW(thermal) reactor of 11 -m height and 12 -m diameter is also shown to be sufficiently coolable during a TLOP accident; i. e., it peaks at 1093 K after 49 h. In a pool-type design with a simple flow path, the use of HXs in the risers and flaps at their inlets that prevent a flow reversal will have significant safety advantages in case of HX tube failures. Steam or gas bubbles exiting from the secondary circuit cannot be dragged into the core region by the <b>liquid-metal</b> <b>coolant.</b> Instead, they would rise with the coolant and exit through the free surface. Another important effect from placing the HXs in the risers {{is the fact that}} the reactor vessel wall will be cooler during normal operation and during all accidents in which the HXs still operate. This is because the coolant passes through the HXs before it reaches the vessel wall. The idea to place the HXs in the risers of a simple flow-path design is protected by European patent No. 04 103 634. 4. The computational fluid dynamics code STAR-CD was used in all calculations.
