40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{the speed}} at which a train can run on {{downward}} slopes through the effect of the force of gravity and the inertia of the train could involve: a reduction in travel time whilst also reducing energy consumed (due to reduced use of the brake). This increase in speed on downward slopes also offers the possibility of reducing the power of trains and/or reducing the maximum speed. Both alternatives can help to maintain the necessary travel time on the route, and the lost time on upward slopes and <b>level</b> <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> will be offset by the time gained on the downward slopes, which will in turn mean reduced train costs and a further reduction in energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|Predictions of {{railway traffic}} are needed by {{planners}} and dispatchers {{for the design}} of robust timetables and real-time traffic management of perturbed conditions. These tasks can be effectively performed only when using train running time models which reliably describe actual speed profiles. To this purpose calibration of model parameters against field data is a necessity. In this paper a simulation-based optimization approach is introduced to calibrate the parameters of the train dynamics equations against field data collected at the <b>level</b> of <b>track</b> <b>sections.</b> A genetic algorithm is used to minimize the error between simulated and observed speed profiles. Furthermore, a procedure for the estimation of train lengths has been developed. This method has been applied to trains with different rolling stock running on the Rotterdam-Delft corridor in the Netherlands. The model parameters were calibrated for a significant number of trains of different compositions. We also derived probability distributions for each parameter which can be usefully employed for simulations. The results show that the train length estimation model obtained good computation accuracy. The effectiveness of the calibration method in giving a reliable estimation of the real train path trajectories is shown. It has been observed that some of the parameters of tractive effort and resistance do not affect the train behaviour significantly. Also, the braking rate is significantly smoother than the default value used by the railway undertaking while calibrated resistance parameters tend to have lower mean than defaults. Finally, the computational efficiency of the approach is suitable for real-time applications. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|A {{measurement}} system {{for measuring the}} departures from a straight line of discrete <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> of a <b>track</b> along a coal face in a mine employing a vehicle having a pair of spaced wheel assemblies which align with the track is presented. A reference arm pivotally connects between the wheel assemblies, and there is indicating means for measuring the angle of pivot between the arm {{and each of the}} wheel assemblies. The length of the device is less than the length of a <b>track</b> <b>section,</b> and thus when one of the wheel assemblies is on one <b>track</b> <b>section</b> and one is on an adjoining <b>track</b> <b>section,</b> the sum of the indicated angles will be indicative of the angle between <b>track</b> <b>sections.</b> Thus, from the length of a <b>track</b> <b>section</b> and angle, the departure of each <b>track</b> <b>section</b> from the line may be calculated...|$|R
30|$|The data {{analysis}} was conducted using Excel based upon measured and filtered track quality values; longitudinal <b>level,</b> alignment, <b>track</b> gauge, cant, twist, STD for longitudinal level, {{and the relationship of}} track distance (km) or over time. This study analyses longitudinal <b>level,</b> alignment, <b>track</b> gauge, cant, and twist over the kilometre. The distance was analysed for 200  m of each <b>track</b> <b>section.</b> This was done to gain an understanding of the track behaviour and quality for facilitating maintenance decision making. In addition, STD for longitudinal level and cooperation analyses over time was used since it aims to understand the track deviation over the years and recognise the problems from measurement or the data quality.|$|R
