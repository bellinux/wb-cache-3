40|$|Abstract—In power systems, {{load curve}} data {{is one of}} the most {{important}} datasets that are collected and retained by utilities. The quality of load curve data, however, is hard to guarantee since the data is subject to communication <b>losses,</b> <b>meter</b> malfunctions, and many other impacts. In this paper, a new approach to analyzing load curve data is presented. The method adopts a new view, termed portrait, on the load curve data by analyzing the periodic patterns in the data and re-organizing the data for ease of analysis. Furthermore, we introduce algorithms to build the virtual portrait load curve data, and demonstrate its application on load curve data cleansing. Compared to existing regression-based methods, our method is much faster and more accurate for both small-scale and large-scale real-world datasets...|$|R

The V-Cone flowmeter is a differential pressure device produced by McCrometer, Hemet, California, USA. By design, the V-Cone measures differential pressure created by a cone positioned {{in the center of}} the pipe. The open area through which the fluid passes is stretched over the edge of the cone.

40|$|Although meter {{accuracy}} {{has been}} {{addressed in the}} past as a potential cause of apparent water loss, the lack of significant data on meter accuracy at low flows has caused losses at these flow rates to be largely ignored. This article provides average low-flow accuracies of different meter types and outlines two methods for estimating apparent <b>losses</b> caused by <b>meter</b> inaccuracy at low flows. By estimating apparent losses and resulting decreases in revenues, utilities can {{gain a better understanding of}} the real consequences of meter inaccuracy at low flow rates. Stopping nonrevenue water <b>loss</b> attributable to <b>meter</b> inaccuracy can result in substantial short-term increases in utility revenue. Furthermore, meters that accurately record water across the entire range of flow rates lead to more equitable customer billing. In light of these benefits as well as increased system efficiency, utilities may want to make low-flow accuracy a key consideration in selecting meters for initial installation or replacement...|$|R

We have investigated the effect of DDAVP administration in a double-blind, randomized, prospective trial including 100 patients placed on cardiopulmonary bypass during surgery. Fifty patients received 0. 3 micrograms/kg DDAVP and 50 patients received a placebo administered in a 50 ml saline solution over 15 min when cardiopulmonary bypass had been concluded. Results showed no significant differences either in total blood <b>loss</b> per square <b>meter</b> (458 +/- 206 ml in the DDAVP group vs 536 +/- 304 ml in the placebo group) or in necessity for red cell transfusions (1642 +/- 705 ml in the DDAVP group vs 1574 +/- 645 ml in the placebo group) in the first 72 hr after surgery. Only intraoperative blood <b>loss</b> per square <b>meter</b> was significantly lower (p less than. 02) in the DDAVP group (131 +/- 106 ml) as compared with the placebo group (193 +/- 137 ml). The prolongation of bleeding time and the decrease of factor VIII:C and factor VIII:von Willebrand factor 90 min after treatment were significantly lower (p less than. 001) in the DDAVP group as compared with the placebo group. We conclude that the administration of DDAVP in patients placed on cardiopulmonary bypass during surgery does not reduce total blood loss and is only effective in reducing intraoperative bleeding...|$|R

This is generally the case today, as household electric meters do not measure apparent power but only real power. Adding power factor correction merely affects the reactive power supplied or drawn and not real power, so utility costs are unaffected. However if there are high-resistance lines connecting between the utility meter and the load then power <b>loss</b> behind the <b>meter</b> can be reduced by a small amount with power factor correction.

40|$|Modern {{trends in}} fluid power {{technologies}} emphasize {{the design of}} efficient fluid power systems. Although improvements to individual hydraulic component efficiencies can increase total system efficiency, the demand for even higher system efficiencies has forced researchers {{to move away from}} traditional valve-controlled actuation. Displacement-controlled (DC) actuation is one such alternative under investigation by the Maha Fluid Power Research Center. Research has shown that this technology can achieve up to 50 % savings in energy consumption when compared with valve-controlled actuation. These savings are primarily due to the main advantage of DC actuation: the elimination of <b>metering</b> <b>losses.</b> The absence of <b>metering</b> <b>losses</b> is achieved by replacing proportional valves controlling individual actuators with variable-displacement pumps, thus actuator motion is controlled by pump displacement. Another advantage of highly-efficient DC actuation is lower working temperatures. This thesis focuses on this aspect of DC actuation. In order to study the temperature and cooling requirements in DC systems, a simulation model has been developed based on conservation of mass and energy for predicting the localized thermodynamic behavior of a multi-actuator DC machine as part of a project funded by the Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power (CCEFP). This model estimated a 50 % reduction in necessary cooling capacity. Despite the model was originally created for DC systems exclusively, the posed question was how can the model be used for mixed systems, i. e. systems comprised by both DC and valve controlled actuators. The general modelling approach and a second model validation through measurements taken on a valve-controlled wheel loader during field operation are also presented as part of the model validation study. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{implementation}} of power line network in the field of electricity billing. In the present scenario power line communication (PLC) is one of the economical ways of communication of data. Even though there are new methods of wireless communication methods, practically it is very much time consuming to install such a system, and also it is highly cost consuming method. But the power lines which already exist and connect every household in a particular area is more advantageous as it does not require any new installation or erection for establishment of communication channels, and thus is not a time consuming one. One biggest advantage of this system is that it can be readily implemented, unlike the other modern methods. The power line network can also be used for creating emergency response networks. This project eliminates the need for employing EB meter readers and this set of employees can be used elsewhere. The long queues in the billing counter can be avoided by implementing this model. Also the control of the system is fully automated by this technique. The most important feature in this system is the use of digital meters consisting of micro controllers and real time clock, thus eliminating the <b>loss</b> of <b>meter</b> data during power failure...|$|R
40|$|Current state-of-the art {{hydraulic}} systems suffer from poor efficiencies. A {{significant portion of}} these losses {{is due to the}} power <b>loss</b> across <b>metering</b> valves. Current research trends in hydraulics have been moving in two separate directions. The first movement is towards a displacement control system, while the second movement has been towards independent metering valve systems. The system, called a topography with integrated energy recovery (TIER), is a hybrid of these two types of systems. TIER offers to improve the advantages of these systems, {{while at the same time}} minimizing their weaknesses. This research expanded on the earlier TIER research and allows for energy recovery over a wider range of operating points. The enlargement of the operating space was accomplished with an additional variable displacement unit. This unit also expands the number of operating modes from four to 26. These modes were tested for validity via simulations with actual velocity and load data collected from a test fixture. Also, the foundation of a real time control system are explained, while some of the components of this system were tested. The results indicated that all of the 26 operating modes were valid and feasible, while some of the techniques of the control system need further refinement. The simulations suggest at power improvements with lower required pressures while doing the same amount of work. ...|$|R
