5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
5|$|Other bands {{during that}} part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, were really getting on the {{political}} bandwagon for one stupid reason or another. They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap going on at the time. We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> as a chance to catch up with our obscenity quota.|$|E
5|$|The boy's {{mother said}} that the video had helped him {{to deal with his}} depression. After {{watching}} Capaldi's message, Ross Goodall stated that his son's behaviour patterns changed markedly. This change included the ability to comfort his sister and step out of his day-to-day routine. Ross Goodall said that after watching the video, his son smiled {{for the first time since}} his grandmother's death. The family framed the letter from Capaldi that came before the video message, and Ross Goodall said that Thomas <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> when he felt distressed.|$|E

5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E
25|$|One {{police officer}} then {{drove down the}} road past Seascape and past the {{disabled}} car of Linda White. He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{for a moment and}} continued down to the Fox and Hound. After he informed his partner, they proceeded back to Seascape. At about 2:00p.m., they were back at Seascape and could see the BMW on fire. At some point, they were fired upon, and eventually had to hide in a ditch {{at the side of the}} road. Bryant fired at them whenever they tried to escape, and they were not able to move from that position for many hours.|$|E
25|$|A band of Pokanoket {{attacked}} several isolated homesteads in {{the small}} Plymouth colony settlement of Swansea on June 20, 1675 (O.S.). They laid siege to the town, then destroyed it five days later and killed several more people. On June 27, 1675 (O.S.) (July 7, 1675 N.S.; See Old Style and New Style dates), a full eclipse of the moon occurred in the New England area. Various tribes in New England <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> as a good omen for attacking the colonists. Officials from the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies responded quickly to the attacks on Swansea; on June 28, they sent a punitive military expedition that destroyed the Wampanoag town at Mount Hope (modern Bristol, Rhode Island).|$|E

25|$|According to Pelin, {{he walked}} to the upper sector console holding JP550's flight {{progress}} strip. He asked Tasić if the DC-9 could climb to FL350. Tasić took the strip from Pelin and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> then asked where the aircraft was at the moment. Pelin then pointed to a blip on the screen approaching Kostajnica. Tasić's response was 'yes, it could climb'. Pelin then noticed an aircraft on the screen coming from the direction of Metlika and asked Tasić about it, who said 'wait until they cross'. Pelin referred to the middle-sector screen {{to make sure that he}} had identified the DC-9 positively on the upper-sector screen. He then returned to Tasić and they both watched the targets pass each other, at which point Tasić authorised JP550 to climb. Pelin then called out to Erjavec and said 'yes, climb it'. Upon Erjavec receiving the OK from Pelin, he instructed the DC-9 to climb to FL350. That was at 10:07:40.|$|E
500|$|Billy Curtis, {{director}} of the Gender Equity Resource Center at UC Berkeley, was deeply moved by the preview; but he also <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from a practical perspective: [...] "I knew immediately I could {{use it as an}} educational tool for faculty, staff, administration and students.… It doesn't try to represent the entire trans experience, but it… answers some of the most basic questions {{about what it means to}} be trans while being this great conversation starter." ...|$|E

[...] "Lost Boys and Golden Girls" [...] is [...] "Steinman's {{interpretation}} {{of the story of}} Peter Pan." [...] The composer says that Peter Pan has [...] "always been about my favorite story and I've always <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from the perspective that it's a great rock and roll myth because it's about—when you get right down to it—it's about a gang of lost boys who never grow up, {{who are going to be}} young forever and that's about as perfect an image for rock'n'roll as I can think of." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{themes of}} God's {{presence}} {{and the final}} judgment of individuals are explored in multiple Insane Clown Posse songs. Throughout their career, the group has used parables set within the Dark Carnival mythology to warn of the ultimate consequences of immoral behavior. Their 2002 album [...] ended {{the first set of}} Joker Card albums and included the song The Unveiling, which explicitly revealed that the hidden message of ICP's music had always been to follow God. Joseph Bruce remarked that [...] "The ending of the Joker Cards, the way we <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> was death. Heaven and hell. That's up to each and every juggalo [...] ".|$|E

[...] She pointed out that the purpose of the film was neither to justify nor criticise Smitha's life but for the audience to live her life. Additionally, all actors, including Balan and Shah attended workshops for almost two months before filming began, to familiarise themselves with the body language of their characters.|$|E

500|$|In one scene, Orpheus's head is {{attached}} to a scarecrow body. [...] According to Matthew Chamberlain, the actor who portrayed Orpheus, he was told to jump on a horse while wearing the scarecrow costume. [...] Chamberlain said he [...] "just gave the horse a quick pat before hopping on" [...] but found himself [...] "getting tugged the other way as the horse was munching away on the straw poking out of the end of my sleeve!" [...] An animatronic version of Chamberlain's head which operated by remote control was used in some scenes. [...] Some of the actors had to only pretend to look at the animatronic head during their scenes, because if they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> while it responded, they would laugh and break character.|$|E
500|$|Jim Reid's piece {{appeared}} in The Observer on 25 September 1994. This is [...] "one {{of the most}} peculiar stories of the year", he cautioned readers. [...] "Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine {{is going to have}} trouble believing a word of it. Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth." [...] "It took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames", he added. [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I know they are capable of this." ...|$|E

Kerslake prepared five treatments during July and August 1993, but no shoot arrangements were made {{and by the end}} of the month, the group decided to work with Dutch photographer and video director Anton Corbijn. Corbijn, who typically created his own ideas for videos, was initially unsure of directing the video since Cobain's treatment was so detailed. Corbijn said, [...] "But then I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and I thought that actually it was pretty good.

500|$|As a consequence, Russell was {{extremely}} sensitive to all racial prejudice: according to Taylor, he often perceived insults even if others did not. He {{was active in}} the Black Power movement and supported Muhammad Ali's decision to refuse to be drafted. He was often called [...] "Felton X", presumably {{in the tradition of the}} Nation of Islam's practice of replacing a European slave name with an [...] "X", and even purchased land in Liberia. Russell's public statements became increasingly militant, so far that he was quoted in a 1963 Sports Illustrated interview with the words: [...] "I dislike most white people because they are people... I like most blacks because I am black"; however, Russell articulated these views with a measure of self-criticism: [...] "I consider this a deficiency in myself—maybe. If I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> objectively, detached myself, it would be a deficiency." [...] However, when his white Celtics teammate Frank Ramsey asked whether he hated him, Russell claimed to be misquoted, but few believed it.|$|E
500|$|The b-side of {{the single}} [...] "Zutto... Iyō yo" [...] was written by Matsu and {{produced}} by Hinata. Matsu decided {{to give it the}} theme of three girls going out for a drive. However, she commented that no matter how others <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> {{it seemed as if the}} song is about two girls. The song opens with an [...] "electro" [...] introduction and utilizes a warped guitar throughout. In addition to the two songs, the single also featured the original karaoke track to [...] "Ashita, Haru ga Kitara". An LP titled Remix Hyper Bug containing remixes of [...] "Ashita, Haru ga Kitara" [...] by DJ Craig William—"Ashita, Haru ga Kitara" [...] (Hyper Bug Mix) and [...] "Ashita, Haru ga Kitara" [...] (Techno Dub Mix) was released on August 21, 1997 through BMG Victor.

500|$|In 1962 Littleton’s first {{pieces in}} blown glass were, like his earlier works in pottery, {{functional}} forms: vases, bowls and paperweights. His breakthrough to non-functional form came in 1963 when, with no purpose in mind, he remelted and finished a glass piece {{that he had}} earlier smashed {{in a fit of}} pique. The object lay in his studio for several weeks before he decided to grind the bottom. As Littleton recounts in his book Glassblowing: A Search for Form, he brought the object into the house where [...] "it aroused such antipathy in my wife that I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> much more closely, finally deciding to send it to an exhibition. Its refusal there made me even more obstinate, and I took it to New York ... I later showed it to the curators of design at the Museum of Modern Art. They, perhaps relating it to some other neo-Dada work in the museum, purchased it for the Design Collection." [...] This led to Littleton’s mid-1960s series of broken-open forms, and [...] "Prunted," [...] "Imploded" [...] and [...] "Exploded" [...] forms.|$|E
