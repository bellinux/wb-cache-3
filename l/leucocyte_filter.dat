40|$|The {{development}} of antihuman leucocyte antigen antibodies (aHLAA) {{in response to}} multiple transfusions in preterm infants was studied prospectively. Fifty seven infants requiring {{a minimum of two}} blood transfusions were recruited after obtaining informed written parental consent. They were randomised to receive either whole blood or blood that had been passed through a <b>leucocyte</b> <b>filter.</b> Anti-HLAA were sought in maternal and cord blood so as to ensure that any aHLAA detected after transfusion had not been passively transferred antenatally, and in 1 ml samples drawn monthly from the baby, at least 10 days from a previous transfusion, until discharge from hospital. Anti-HLAA were detected by microlymphocytotoxicity assay. Results were obtained in 42 babies, 19 in the filter and 23 in the no filter group. Fifteen babies had to be excluded because of protocol violation or because they died. None of the babies receiving filtered blood developed aHLAA, but seven babies in the no filter group developed aHLAA. In conclusion, multiply transfused preterm infants have the ability to elaborate antibodies to HLA and leucocyte filters may prevent this...|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} method to centrifugation and automatic separation {{was developed to}} produce blood components. It was composed an equipment of parts from the closed plastic bag system and the hollow fiber filter, which is normally used for the haemodialysis. The  hollow fiber filter consists of a bundle of polypropylene hollow fibers (0, 2 - 0, 5 µm pore size), which separate the whole blood into plasma and a red cell concentrate by using gravity. For the leucoreduction it was integrate a <b>leucocyte</b> <b>filter</b> in the system. The red cell concentrates {{had to have a}} haematocrit of 50 - 70 %. By optimize the distances from the bags to the hollow fiber filter and a second filtration through the hollow fiber filter, it was possible to get an acceptable haematocrit. The mean volume of the red cell concentrate was 262 ml (without additive solution) and 322 ml (with additive solution). By optimising the attempts the mean haematocrit was 71, 84 % (without additive solution) and 54 ml (with additive solution). The mean volume of the plasma was 254 ml. This method used only materials, which occurs in the clinic, it is simple to practise, with a low personal expense and costs. It is independent from electrical devices and can be used principal all over the world...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) {{has been}} shown to induce a {{systemic}} inflammatory response similar to the local reaction seen after tissue damage [1]. This leads to the release of toxic substances, such as elastase, which cause endothelial damage and may adversely affect outcome [2]. Use of a leucocyte depleting arterial line filter is one of many anti-inflammatory strategies that are undergoing evaluation. Leucocyte depleting filters may be capable of selectively removing activated white cells [3], but this has not been proved in vivo. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare sequential total and activated white cells during CPB, using either a leucocyte depleting or standard arterial line filter. Materials and methods After local ethical committee approval, 20 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting using CPB were prospectively randomly allocated to have either a Leukogard LG– 6 (Pall Biomedical, Portsmouth, UK) or a nonleucocyte depleting filter inserted into the arterial line of the CPB circuit. Arterial limb blood samples were taken immediately after institution of CPB (0 min) and at 10 –min intervals throughout the bypass period. Activated white cells were identified using nitroblue tetrazolium, then both total and activated white cell numbers counted after staining with Leucoplate. Results Table 1 shows the number of white cells counted/ 1. 25 ? l (volume of a single channel of Nageotte counting chamber) using light microscopy (× 25). Conclusion The LG 6 <b>leucocyte</b> <b>filter</b> reduces the total white cell count and is capable of selectively removing activated white cells during CPB. The exact relationship between leucocyte depletion and improved patient outcome still remains unclear...|$|E

40|$|Cell salvage {{has been}} used as a method of blood {{conservation}} for more than three decades. Although the principles and development of the Latham bowl had occurred in the 1960 s, it was not until the early 1970 s that washing of the concentrated red cells was introduced and a product that was universally acceptable was obtained. The last 25 years have seen little in the way of development of cell salvage, although significant refinement has taken place. Although the simple picture of cell salvage involves removal of the buffy coat, including platelets and leucocytes, in practice there are reports of great variation in the removal of these cells. Most recent studies suggest that there is very little removal of leucocytes by cell salvage. The leucocytes that remain in the red cell suspension following cell salvage have undergone significant morphological changes and the surface expression of leucocyte adhesion receptors increases dramatically during the process. There is little evidence that removal of these activated leucocytes has any significant clinical benefit. Although leucofiltration of blood before storage has been shown to be an extremely safe process, ‘bedside leucofiltration’, including leucofiltration of cell salvage blood, may not be without problems. Reports of hypotensive events while receiving blood products through a bedside <b>leucocyte</b> reduction <b>filter</b> have emerged during the last few years. This may be due to bradykinin production following platelet exposure to negatively charged <b>leucocyte</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Neurological {{complications}} {{are common}} following cardiothoracic surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass; these {{can range from}} episodes of temporary delirium to severely debilitating strokes. Despite strong evidence showing the involvement of lipid microemboli, there is currently no established method for the effective removal of these particles. We conceived the study described here to evaluate the clinical use of a new integral lipid filter in reducing lipid microemboli and to determine the impact on markers of cerebral and renal injury and pulmonary dysfunction during the cardiopulmonary bypass period. Methods/Design: Fifty patients undergoing routine coronary artery bypass grafting using cardiopulmonary bypass will be randomised to either the intervention group, receiving the integral lipid filter during surgery, or a control group which does not. All clinicians and patients will be blinded as to their method of treatment. Measurements of lipid emboli will be taken throughout the surgical period with biochemical markers measured throughout the surgical and postoperative period. Discussion: Limited success {{has been found in}} removing lipid microemboli using currently available methods. An integral lipid filter may well fulfill this role and help reduce the associated morbidity. This paper reports the design and methods for a randomized controlled trial comparing the outcomes of the RemoweLL lipid and <b>leucocyte</b> removing <b>filter</b> with standard equipment for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting using cardiopulmonary bypass.

Es fand Anfang der siebziger Jahre in der Transfusionsmedizin seine erste routinierte Anwendung. { 31 } In der Herzchirurgie wurde der Leukozytenfilter Ende der achtziger Jahre eingeführt. Dort wurde er in der arteriellen und venösen Linie sowie für die Kardioplegie und zur Filtrierung des Restblutes aus dem Kardiotomiereservoir eingesetzt. { 62 }{ 92 }{ 93 }{ 95 }-{ 97 } In der vorliegenden Studie erfolgte die Leukozytendepletion in der arteriellen Linie der EKZ bei 80 Patienten mittels eines Leukozytenfilters (Leukoguard LG 6, Pall, Dreieich, Deutschland). Da die Filterkapazität und –effizienz zeitlich begrenzt sind, wurde der Einsatz des Filters in der kritischen Phase der Reperfusion evaluiert. Während dieser Phase erreicht die Leukozytenaktivierung den Höchstwert (Gruppe III: 10 Minuten vor Aortenklemmöffnung und für die ersten 20 Minuten der cardiopulmonalen Reperfusion, Gruppe IV: nach erfolgter 20 minütiger Reperfusionsphase bis Ende der EKZ). Zum Vergleich wurde der Leukozytenfilter auch während des Gesamtdauer der CCB angewendet (Gruppe II). Bei der Kontrollgruppe kam ein Standardfilter zum Einsatz. Die Patientengruppen wurden aus 20 radomisierten Patienten gebildet. Zu bestimmten peri-, intra- und postoperativen Zeitpunkten wurden folgende Parameter untersucht: PMN-Elastase, Procalcitonin, MDA (Malondialdehyd), MPO (Myeloperoxidase), NSE (Neuronenspezifische Enolase), S 100 -Protein, CK, CK-MB, Kreatinin und Harnstoff. Ebenso wurden die Leukozyten-, Erythrozyten- und Thrombozytenzahlen sowie der Hämatokrit- und Hämoglobinwert gemessen. Die Sauerstoffsättigung wurde mittels des Sauerstoffdruckes der Sauerstofffraktion und -indizes untersucht. Zusätzlich wurde die Dauer der Intubation, des Aufenthaltes auf der Intensivstation und des stationären Gesamtaufenthaltes ermittelt. Bei allen diesen Parametern konnten unter den Gruppen keine signifikanten Differenzen festgestellt werden. Die sensitiven Marker der Leukozytenaktivierung und der systemischen inflammatorischen Reaktion zeigten den in der Literatur beschriebenen typischen Kurvenverlauf. { 106 }{ 107 }{ 135 }{ 126 }-{ 128 }{ 148 } Jedoch blieb der {{positive}} Einfluss der Leukozytendepletion aus. Die im Blutkreislauf gemessenen Leukozytenzahlen ebenso wie die Erythrozyten- und Thrombozytenzahlen konnten durch den Filtrationsvorgang nicht statistisch absicherbar reduziert werden. Auch die intraoperative Leukozytose wurde nicht signifikant reduziert. Offenbar reicht die Filterleistung nicht aus, um entsprechende Mengen an Leukozyten zurückzuhalten. Würde es sich hierbei ausschließlich um eine rasche Kapazitätsausschöpfung des Filters handeln, müsste jedoch zumindest am Anfang des Filtrationsvorganges eine Verringerung der Leukozytenzahlen feststellbar sein. Vermutlich wird der lokale Filtrationseffekt des Leukozytenfilters durch die massive systemische Mobilisation der Leukozyten durch weitere Aktivierung aufgrund von Entzündungsmediatoren und Endothelschäden überdeckt. Die Ergebnisse deuten des Weiteren darauf hin, dass die Leukozyten durch den Filtrationsvorgang ihre Funktion nicht verlieren. Sie sind weiterhin in der Lage, Entzündungsmediatoren auszuschütten und systemische inflammatorische Reaktionen in Gang zu setzen. Eine neue Filtergeneration, die neben der Verbesserung der mechanischen Filtration eine pharmakologische Inaktivierung der Leukozyten bewirkt, bleibt Gegenstand weiterer Forschung. The {{extracorporeal circulation}} {{is associated with}} inflammatory reactions and secondary pathological changes of variant organ systems. { 2 }{ 17 }{ 40 }-{ 42 }{ 56 }{ 57 } To a great part this is caused by activation of leucocytes after contact with surface of the extracorporeal circulation and the following release of inflammatory mediators. { 36 }-{ 38 } Released enzymes from activated leucocytes cause a pathological hyperpermeability of the endothelial wall with migration of neutrophils in the tissue and secondary organ damage. { 2 }{ 17 }{ 56 }{ 57 } To reduce this inflammatory system reaction (SIRS), {{studies were carried out}} to renden the design and the surface of the heart lung machine more biocompatible. { 3 }-{ 9 }{ 18 }-{ 23 } Also pharmakological therapy approaches were evaluated by clinical studies { 10 }-{ 13 }{ 15 }-{ 17 } The concept of leucocytes filtration by an especially manufactured filter was developed during the thirties. At the beginning of the seventies the <b>leucocyte</b> <b>filter</b> found it’s first routine application in the transfusion medicine. { 31 } In heart surgery it was introduced {{at the end of the}} eighties. The filter was placed in the arterial or venous line as well as for the blood cardioplegia and for the filtration of the rest of the blood from the cardiotomy reservoir. { 62 }{ 92 }{ 93 }{ 95 }-{ 97 } In the present study, leucocyte filtration was applied to 80 patients in the arterial line of the extracorporeal circulation through a <b>leucocyte</b> <b>filter</b> (Leukoguard LG 6, Pall, Dreieich, Germany). Because the filter capacity and filter efficiency are limited in time, the insertion of the filter was evaluated in the different phase of reperfusion. During this phase the leucocyte activation reaches the highest level (group III: 10 minutes before aortic clamp opens and for the first 20 minutes of the cardiopulmonary reperfusion, group IV: after 20 minutes reperfusion untill the end of the extracorporeal circulation). For comparison the <b>leucocyte</b> <b>filter</b> was applied also during the whole duration of the cardiopulmonary bypass (group II). In the control group a standard filter was used. Four groups of 20 patients each were randomised. At different timepoints, the following parameters – during and/or after surgery - were determined: polymorphonuclear elastase PMNE, procalcitonin, malondialdehyd MDA, myeloperoxidase MPO, enolase specific for neurons NSE, S 100 protein, creatinkinase CK, CK-MB, creatinin and urea. Also we determined the levels of leucocytes, erythrocytes and platelets. The lung function was evaluated by the respiratory index. In addition, duration of the intubation, time on the intensive care unit and whole stationary time was determined. No significant differences could be determined between the groups. The sensitive indicators of the leucocyte activation and systemic inflammatory reaction showed clearly the typical time course described in the literature. { 106 }{ 107 }{ 135 }{ 126 }{ 128 }{ 148 } A positive influence of leucocyte filtration was missing. The determined leucocyte, erythrocyte and platelets counts could not be statistically significant reduced by the filtration process. Obviously, the filter capacity is not sufficient to prevent an increase of leucocyte counts. This is obviously not only caused by an exhaustion of the filter capacity. Than a reduction of leucocyte counts would have to be noticeable at least at the beginning of the filtration process. The filtration effect of the <b>leucocyte</b> <b>filter</b> is presumably compensated by extreme systemic mobilisation of leucocytes and further activation by inflammatory mediators and damage of the endothelium. Most probably the filter itself activates leucocytes and thay adhere to the filter mesh. Our results show that leucocytes do not lose their function by the filtration process. They still are able to release inflammatory mediators and to cause systemic inflammatory reactions. The developement of a new filter generation, which causes a pharmacological inactivation of leucocytes, remains an object of further research...|$|E
40|$|Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) {{leads to}} a {{generalized}} inflammatory reaction, resulting in increased postoperative leucocyte counts and decreased pulmonary function. In adults, removal of leucocytes from the residual heart - lung machine blood after CPB improved postoperative oxygenation. In children, however, the clinical effects of leucocyte filtration of the residual heart - lung machine blood are unknown. Therefore, we measured postoperative leucocyte counts and arterial blood oxygenation in children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery in a randomized prospective study. Anaesthesia and CPB were standardized. After CPB, the residual heart - lung machine blood was collected as usual. In a group of 25 children, this blood was <b>filtered</b> with a <b>leucocyte</b> depletion <b>filter</b> before transfusion. A control group of 25 children received this blood unfiltered. We found that the postoperative leucocyte counts were significantly lower in the filter group than {{in the control group}} (p = 0. 02, repeated measurements ANOVA). This difference reached a maximum on the second postoperative day (12. 9 x 10 (9) /L filter versus 15. 9 x 10 (9) /L control, p = 0. 02, Student's t-test). Values for the arterial blood oxygenation on the first postoperative day were not different between the two groups (15. 5 +/- 1 kPa filter versus 14. 6 +/- 1. 3 kPa control, p = 0. 57, Student's t-test). We conclude that leucocyte filtration of the residual heart - lung machine blood reduced systemic leucocyte counts, but did not improve arterial blood oxygenation in children after congenital heart surgery...|$|R
40|$|Background context Metastatic spine tumour surgery (MSTS) is {{associated}} with substantial blood loss therefore leading to high morbidity and mortality. While intraoperative cell salvage with <b>leucocyte</b> depletion <b>filter</b> (IOCS-LDF) has been studied as an effective mean of reducing blood loss in other surgical settings, including the spine, no study has yet analysed the efficacy of re-infusion of salvaged blood in reducing the need for allogenic blood transfusion in patients who have had surgery for MSTS. Purpose To analyse the efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness of using IOCS-LDF in MSTS. Study design/ Setting Retrospective controlled study Patient sample 176 patients undergoing MSTS Methods All patients undergoing MSTS at a single centre between February 2010 and December 2014 {{were included in the}} study. The primary outcome measure was the use of autologous blood transfusion. Secondary outcome measures included hospital stay, survival time, complications and procedural costs. The key predictor variable was whether or not IOCS-LDF was utilised during surgery. Logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted by controlling variables such as tumour type, number of diseased vertebrae, approach, number and site of stabilised segments, operation time, pre-operative anaemia, ASA grade, age, gender and BMI. No funding was obtained and there are no conflicts of interest to be declared. Results Data included 63 cases (IOCS-LDF) and 113 controls (non IOCS-LDF). IOCS-LDF utilisation was substantively and significantly associated with a lower likelihood of allogenic blood transfusion (OR= 0. 407, p= 0. 03). IOCS-LDF was cost neutral (p= 0. 88). Average hospital stay was 3. 76 days shorter amongst IOCS-LDF patients (p= 0. 03). Patient survival and complication rates were comparable in both groups. Conclusions We have demonstrated that the use of IOCS-LDF in MSTS reduces the need for post-operative allogenic blood transfusion whilst maintaining satisfactory post-operative haemoglobin. We recommend routine use of IOCS-LDF in MSTS for its safety, efficacy and potential cost benefit...|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} by which the susceptibility of chickens to Rous virus can be tested, and the virulence of eight or ten different fluids compared in a single animal. The results of five series of experiments made with this technique can be summarized as follows: When a medium composed chiefly of chicken serum and Tyrode solution and containing no fresh tissues is inoculated with filtered extract of Rous and other sarcomas and incubated for 48 hours, it never produces a tumor after being injected into chickens. The virus has apparently been destroyed or at least has lost activity. But, in a solid medium, composed chiefly of serum and Tyrode solution and containing fragments of fresh tissues, the virus is found to increase readily, {{as shown in the}} first series of experiments. In the course of 15 months, the experiments have been repeated many times, with identical results. Flasks containing embryo pulp or <b>leucocytes</b> inoculated with <b>filtered</b> extract of sarcoma are used to keep on hand a constant supply of the Rous virus. The cultures of monocytes inoculated with the filtered extract often assume the appearance of the cultures of Rous sarcoma. They may also remain normal to all appearance despite the circumstance that the virus is multiplying within the medium. It is not certain that the activity of Rous virus is always accompanied by cell lesions, but {{there is no doubt that}} its increase depends on the presence of fresh tissues within the medium. The disappearance of the Rous virus from a medium that does not contain any fresh tissue may be interpreted as follows: the agent has been destroyed; or it is still present in a concentration lower than 1 in 50, 000, which is the concentration required to produce a tumor even in the more susceptible chickens; or, according to the hypothesis of Gye, it is present in an inactive form. In the above experiments, the fresh tissues added to the medium might conceivably have enabled the virus to keep its full activity, through supplying the conditions requisite therefor, or they might merely have furnished an activating substance. The value of Gye's hypothesis was tested in a series of experiments. The results indicate that the tumor-producing virus present in the cultures was not composed of two parts, an inactive part multiplying in the medium, and an activating part supplied by the tissues. In another series of experiments, the relations between the reproduction of the virus and the quantity of the tissues contained in the medium were studied. The presence of a small fragment of leucocytic film or spleen tissue was sufficient to prevent the virus from disappearing. Approximately 1 c. mm. of spleen tissue in 3, 000 c. mm. of medium may on occasion maintain a concentration of Rous virus in this fluid sufficient to produce a tumor upon inoculation into chickens. But this rarely happens. Generally when the medium contained only one fragment of spleen or leucocytic film, or 1 drop of embryonic pulp, the virus disappeared rapidly. When the quantity of tissue was from five to nine times larger, an abundant production of virus was practically always found. It became obvious that the quantity of active virus present in a medium containing multiplying cells depends upon the amount of tissue in the medium. In the fourth series of experiments, the kind of cells needed for the multiplication of the virus was ascertained. Rous virus was found to disappear rapidly from the fluid of cultures of fibroblasts, while it multiplied readily in cultures of leucocytes, the total volume of both tissues being approximately the same. It should be remembered that strains of fibroblasts obtained from Rous and other sarcomas very rarely produce tumors upon inoculation into chickens, while the inoculation of cultures of macrophages from the same tumors practically always determines their appearance. The fifth series of experiments showed that the cell metabolism is an important factor in the reproduction of the virus. When the activity of tissues had been suppressed or very much decreased by freezing, no virus was produced, while it multiplied readily in the control. The lack of oxygen for a period of 24 or 48 hours stopped cell proliferation, and at the same time the production of Rous virus ceased. However, the fluid of some of these dead or inactive cultures, after 6 days incubation, was still able to give rise to a small tumor upon inoculation into a chicken. There is an evident relation between the proliferating activity of the tissues and the production of the virus. But the agent may persist for several days in association with dead tissues. It may be concluded that the reproduction in vitro of the active virus depends on the presence of fresh tissues in the culture and upon the quantity, the activity, and the nature of the cells contained in the medium...|$|R
