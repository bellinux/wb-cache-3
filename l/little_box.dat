25|$|Due to the {{collapse}} of her distribution deal with Paramount, Weber was forced to distribute The Blot through the F.B. Warren Corporation, a newly formed small independent company that would also distribute a film each by Canadian women producers Nell Shipman and May Tully, later in 1921. The Blot was released on September 4, 1921, but was not well-received critically and did <b>little</b> <b>box</b> office, and vanished after its run. After The Blot, Weber's films did not make money at the box office. For decades, The Blot was considered a lost film, until it was rediscovered by the American Film Institute in 1975, and was reconstituted and restored by Robert Gitt of the UCLA Film & Television Archive in 1986 from an incomplete negative and an incomplete print. The Blot was then produced for video by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill of Photoplay Productions, and released on home video and DVD.|$|E

Beds supported by lions paws XI. and XII. dynasties, from Gebelein, now in the Cairo Museum), headrests, 6 or 8 in. high, shaped like a crutch on a foot, very like those used by the native of New Guinea today, are carved with scenes, etc., in outline. In the British Museum may be seen a tiny little coffer, 4 in. by 21/2 in., with very delicate figures carved in low relief. This <b>little</b> <b>box</b> stands on cabriole legs 3/4 of an inch long with claw feet, quite Louis Quinze in character. There are incense ladles, the handle representing a bouquet of lotus flowers, the bowl formed like the leaf of an aquatic plant with serrated edges from Gurnah during the XVIII. dynasty; mirror handles, representing a little pillar, or a lotus stalk, sometimes surmounted by a head of Hathor, the Egyptian Venus or of Bes, god of the toilet; pin-cushions, {{in the shape of}} a small round tortoise with holes in the back for toilet pins, which were also of wood with dog-head ends (XI. dynasty, Cairo Museum); and perfume boxes such as a fish, the two halves forming the bottom and top of the perfume or pomatum was removed by little wooden spoons, one shaped in the form of a cartouche emerging from a full-blown lotus, another shaped like the neck of a goose, a third consisting of a dog running with a fish in its closed mouth, the fish forming the bowl. The list might be prolonged, but enough has been said to show to what a pitch of refinement the art of wood-carving had reached thousands of years before the birth of Christ.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{journalists and}} video game {{designers}} have questioned this cultural classification, {{arguing that the}} differences between Eastern and Western games have been exaggerated. In an interview held at the American Electronic Entertainment Expo, Japanese video game developer Tetsuya Nomura (who worked on Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts) emphasized that RPGs should not be classified by country-of-origin, but rather described simply for what they are: role-playing games. Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of Final Fantasy and The Last Story, noted that, while [...] "users like to categorise" [...] Japanese RPGs as [...] "turn-based, traditional styles" [...] and Western RPGs as [...] "born from first-person shooters," [...] there [...] "are titles that don't fit the category," [...] pointing to Chrono Trigger (which he also worked on) and the Mana games. He further noted {{that there have been}} [...] "other games similar to the style of Chrono Trigger," [...] but that [...] "it's probably because the games weren't localised and didn't reach the Western audience." [...] series director Tetsuya Takahashi, in reference to Xenoblade Chronicles, stated that [...] "I don’t know when exactly people started using the term 'JRPG,' but if this game makes people rethink the meaning of this term, I’ll be satisfied." [...] The writer Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com states that [...] "Xenoblade throws into high relief the sheer artificiality of the gaming community's obsession over the differences between" [...] Western and Japanese RPGs, pointing out that it [...] "does things that don't really fit into either genre. Gamers do love their boundaries and barriers and neat little rules, I know, but just because you cram something into a <b>little</b> <b>box</b> doesn't mean it belongs there." [...] Nick Doerr of Joystiq criticizes the claim that Japanese RPGs are [...] "too linear," [...] pointing out that non-linear Japanese RPGs are not uncommonfor instance, the Romancing SaGa series. Likewise, Rowan Kaiser of Joystiq points out that linear Western RPGs were common in the 1990s, and argues that many of the often mentioned differences between Eastern and Western games are stereotypes that are generally [...] "not true" [...] and [...] "never was", pointing to classic examples like Lands of Lore and Betrayal at Krondor that were more narrative-focused than the typical Western-style RPGs of the time. In 2015, IGN noted in an interview with Xenoblade Chronicles Xs development team that the label [...] "JRPG" [...] is most commonly used to refer to RPGs [...] "whose presentation mimics the design sensibilities" [...] of anime and manga, that it's [...] "typically the presentation and character archetypes" [...] that signal [...] "this is a JRPG." ...|$|E
