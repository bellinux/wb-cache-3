Each character is outfitted with an innate Element affinity and three unique special abilities that are <b>learned</b> <b>over</b> time. If {{taken to the}} world opposite their own, characters react to their counterparts (if available). Many characters tie in to crucial plot events. Since {{it is impossible to}} obtain all 45 characters in one playthrough, players must replay the game to witness everything. Through use of the New Game+ feature, players can ultimately obtain all characters on one save file.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{have long}} been fascinated with the studies of language, believing {{it to be a}} unique human {{cognitive}} ability. To test this hypothesis, scientists have attempted to teach human language to several species of great apes. One early attempt by Allen and Beatrix Gardner in the 1960s involved spending 51 months teaching American Sign Language (ASL) to a chimpanzee named Washoe. The Gardners reported Washoe learned 151 signs, and she had spontaneously taught them to other chimpanzees. Over a longer period of time, Washoe <b>learned</b> <b>over</b> 800 signs.|$|E

In his book, Eric Schmidt argues that successful companies in the technology-driven internet age, should attract smart and creative employees and then create an environment where they can thrive. He argues that the traditional business rules that make a company successful have changed. The book states that companies should maximize freedom and speed, and decision-making should not lie {{in the hands of the}} few. It also emphasizes that individuals and small teams can have a massive impact on innovation.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in August 1968, McCain was {{subjected}} to a program of severe torture. He was bound and beaten every two hours; this punishment occurred {{at the same time}} that he was suffering from dysentery. Further injuries led McCain to attempt suicide, which was stopped by guards. Eventually, McCain made an anti-U.S. propaganda [...] "confession". He has always felt that his statement was dishonorable, but as he later wrote, [...] "I had learned what we all <b>learned</b> <b>over</b> there: every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine." [...] Many U.S. POWs were tortured and maltreated in order to extract [...] "confessions" [...] and propaganda statements; virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors. McCain received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements.|$|E

The different approaches are tested on the inference of missing edges in two biological networks. 1...|$|R
40|$|Building {{cognitive}} abilities often requires sustained engagement with effortful tasks. We demonstrate that beliefs about willpower–whether willpower {{is viewed as}} a limited or non-limited resource–impact sustained learning on a strenuous mental task. As predicted, beliefs about willpower did not affect accuracy or improvement during the initial phases of learning; however, participants who were led to view willpower as non-limited showed greater sustained <b>learning</b> <b>over</b> the full duration of the task. These findings highlight the interactive nature of motivational and cognitive processes: motivational factors can substantially affect people’s ability to recruit their cognitive resources to sustain <b>learning</b> <b>over</b> time...|$|R

500|$|Rather Ripped is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} band's most accessible albums, featuring an abundance of concise and catchy melodies. Moore described it as [...] "a super song record" [...] that contains [...] "rockers and ballads". In addition, seven of the album's 12 tracks have a duration of less than four minutes, a feature that is uncommon in previous Sonic Youth releases. The album generally favors guitar textures over feedback or noise, which typically characterized the band's earlier works. Dave Heaton of PopMatters remarked that the guitars on Rather Ripped are joined together to form a vibrant and mysterious sound, stating that [...] "it often feels like Sonic Youth are taking all the instrumental tricks they've <b>learned</b> <b>over</b> the years and putting them in the service of building a lasting landscape of guitar sounds, one that reverberates with the sounds of the past but also feels eternally youthful".|$|E
500|$|Cagney's {{penultimate}} {{film was}} a comedy. He was hand-picked by Billy Wilder {{to play a}} hard-driving Coca-Cola executive in the film One, Two, Three. Cagney had concerns with the script, remembering back 23 years to Boy Meets Girl, in which scenes were reshot {{to try to make}} them funnier by speeding up the pacing, with the opposite effect. Cagney received assurances from Wilder that the script was balanced. Filming did not go well, though, with one scene requiring 50 takes, something to which Cagney was unaccustomed. In fact, {{it was one of the}} worst experiences of his long career. For the first time, Cagney considered walking out of a film. He felt he had worked too many years inside studios, and combined with a visit to Dachau concentration camp during filming, he decided that he had had enough, and retired afterward. One of the few positive aspects was his friendship with Pamela Tiffin, to whom he gave acting guidance, including the secret that he had <b>learned</b> <b>over</b> his career: [...] "You walk in, plant yourself squarely on both feet, look the other fella in the eye, and tell the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron <b>learned</b> <b>over</b> 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E

500|$|In late August 1968, {{a program}} of {{vigorous}} torture methods began on McCain. The North Vietnamese used rope bindings to put him into prolonged, painful positions and severely beat him every two hours, all while {{he was suffering from}} dysentery. His right leg was reinjured, his ribs were cracked, some teeth were broken at the gumline, and his left arm was re-fractured. Lying in his own waste, his spirit was broken; the beginnings of a suicide attempt were stopped by guards. After four days of this, McCain signed and taped an anti-American propaganda [...] "confession" [...] that said, in part, [...] "I am a black criminal and I have performed the deeds of an air pirate. I almost died, and the Vietnamese people saved my life, thanks to the doctors." [...] He used stilted Communist jargon and ungrammatical language to signal that the statement was forced. McCain was haunted then and since with the belief that he had dishonored his country, his family, his comrades and himself by his statement, but as he later wrote, [...] "I had learned what we all <b>learned</b> <b>over</b> there: Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine." [...] Two weeks later his captors tried to force him to sign a second statement; his will to resist restored, he refused. He sometimes received two to three beatings per week because of his continued resistance; the sustained mistreatment went on for over a year. His refusals to cooperate, laced with loud obscenities directed towards his guards, were often heard by other POWs. His boxing experience from his Naval Academy days helped him withstand the battering, and the North Vietnamese did not break him again.|$|E
