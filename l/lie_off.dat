500|$|The phrase [...] "Northern Isles" [...] {{generally}} {{refers to}} the main islands of the Orkney and Shetland archipelagos. Stroma, which lies between mainland Scotland and Orkney, is part of Caithness, and so falls under Highland council area for local government purposes, not Orkney. It is, however, clearly one of the [...] "northern isles" [...] of Scotland. Fair Isle and Foula are outliers of Shetland, but would normally be considered as part of Shetland and thus the Northern Isles. Similarly, Sule Skerry and Sule Stack, although distant from the main group, are part of Orkney and technically amongst the Northern Isles. However, the other small islands that <b>lie</b> <b>off</b> the north coast of Scotland are in Highland and thus not usually considered {{to be part of}} the Northern Isles.|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{was given}} [...] as his flagship, and on 27 May 1797 {{was ordered to}} <b>lie</b> <b>off</b> Cadiz, {{monitoring}} the Spanish fleet and awaiting the arrival of Spanish treasure ships from the American colonies. He carried out a bombardment and personally led an amphibious assault on 3 July. During the action Nelson's barge collided {{with that of the}} Spanish commander, and a hand-to-hand struggle ensued between the two crews. Twice Nelson was nearly cut down and both times his life was saved by a seaman named John Sykes who took the blows and was badly wounded. The British raiding force captured the Spanish boat and towed her back to Theseus. During this period Nelson developed a scheme to capture Santa Cruz de Tenerife, aiming to seize a large quantity of specie from the treasure ship Principe de Asturias, which was reported to have recently arrived.|$|E

The Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland describes the Inner Hebrides as lying [...] "east of The Minch", which would include any and all offshore islands. There are various islands that lie in the sea lochs such as Eilean Bàn and Eilean Donan that might not ordinarily be described as [...] "Hebridean" [...] but no formal definitions exist and for simplicity they are included in the List of Inner Hebrides rather than here.|$|E

It ended 2006 as UK's 11th best selling single of the year.

The song shared similar success in Ireland, where it debuted on the issue of 6 July 2006 and peaked inside the top ten at six, holding on the chart for nine weeks. In mainland Europe, it broke the top 40 of most countries, but wasn't as successful as in the singer's home country. Notable successes were ten on the Dutch Top 40, sixteen on the French Singles Chart and 21 on the Swiss Singles Chart. Across the ocean, [...] "Smile" [...] reached 14 on the ARIA Charts and in New Zealand peaked inside the top ten at six.|$|E
