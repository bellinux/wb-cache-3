5|$|The band {{formed at}} Manchester University, but settled in London where they signed with Charisma. They {{went through a}} number of incarnations in their early years, {{including}} a brief split in 1969. When they reformed, they found minor commercial success with The <b>Least</b> <b>We</b> Can Do Is Wave to Each Other (February 1970), and after the follow-up album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), stabilised around a line-up of Hammill, organist Hugh Banton, saxophonist David Jackson, and drummer Guy Evans. The quartet subsequently achieved significant success in Italy with the release of Pawn Hearts in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The group's {{previous}} album, The <b>Least</b> <b>We</b> Can Do Is Wave to Each Other (February 1970) {{had achieved}} {{a small amount}} of commercial success and critical acclaim in the UK and Europe. The next project the group attempted was recording the soundtrack to the 1970 film Eyewitness, but it was rejected, largely for being too sinister. They started to develop a live following during 1970, counting film director Anthony Minghella as one of their fans, but things backfired after a show at the Royal Festival Hall in June that drew negative reviews from Melody Makers Chris Welch. Around this time, the band decided to write some new material for a follow-up album.|$|E
5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at <b>least</b> <b>we</b> ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{business plan}} estimated {{a profit of}} €4.8bn based on a rise in assets value of 10%. Today's revised figures say that if they recover the full value of the loans plus 10% it {{will result in a}} profit of €3.9bn. NAMA chairman Frank Daly said the plan confirmed that the five institutions covered by NAMA had not disclosed or had been unaware of the extent of the financial crisis afflicting their borrowers. He said the banks had shown 'remarkable generosity' towards their borrowers, adding that NAMA had no intention of maintaining that approach. 'To say the <b>least</b> <b>we</b> are extremely disappointed and disturbed to find that, only months after being led to believe that 40% of loans were income producing, the real figure is actually 25%.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in December 1970, but did not sell as much as The <b>Least</b> <b>We</b> Can Do, and did not reach the album charts in the UK. Charisma hoped the group could produce another single like [...] "Refugees", released earlier in the year. There was some interest in releasing [...] "Killer" [...] as a single, but the band rejected this as {{they might have been}} pigeonholed as a hard rock band. The group felt there was some conflict of interest by having Tony Stratton-Smith both as manager and record company owner.|$|E

Throughout his writing, Druckmann approaches scenes with focus on every character, attempting {{to enter the}} mindset of each individual character. He tries to ignore character tropes {{in an attempt to}} write [...] "honestly". Druckmann also writes with a minimalist mindset, often asking himself [...] "What is this scene really about?

500|$|England had wins against Southern Hemisphere {{teams in}} the 1970s; with {{victories}} over South Africa in 1972, New Zealand in 1973 and Australia in 1973 and 1976. The 1972 Five Nations Championship was not completed due to the Troubles in Northern Ireland when Scotland and Wales refused to play their Five Nations away fixtures in Ireland. England played in Dublin in 1973 and were given a standing ovation lasting five minutes.

Rodman added, “That's the main reason why we're going. We're trying to bring everything together. If not, at <b>least</b> <b>we</b> tried."

500|$|Tony Stratton-Smith formed Charisma Records {{and signed}} the band {{as his first}} act, who {{recorded}} their second album, The <b>Least</b> <b>We</b> Can Do Is Wave to Each Other from 11–14 December 1969 with producer John Anthony in Trident Studios. Hammill's voice was electronically treated on [...] "After the Flood", while [...] "Refugees" [...] and [...] "White Hammer" [...] featured cello and cornet respectively. Because the band finished ahead of their rehearsal schedule, Potter decided to overdub some electric guitar – an instrument he had never played before. The album was released in February 1970 and made the top 50 in the U.K, Melody Maker said [...] "If all our groups were as together as this, the British music scene would improve ten-fold." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 12, 2015, Disney officially {{announced}} that a feature-length sequel to Frozen was in development with Buck and Lee returning as directors, and Del Vecho returning as producer. In a May 2015 interview, Buck said, [...] "We have lots of things to figure out but at <b>least</b> <b>we</b> {{know where we are}} going." [...] In March 2016, Bell stated that voice recording for the film was due to start later in the month, but in September of that same year, she retracted her earlier comments as mistaken and explained that she had been working instead on other Frozen projects such as the upcoming holiday special. In April 2017, Disney {{announced that}} the sequel would be released on November 27, 2019.|$|E
500|$|Hammill wanted King Crimson's guitarist and bandleader Robert Fripp {{to play on}} [...] "The Emperor In His War Room". Fripp {{had never}} played as a session {{musician}} at that point, but had enjoyed listening to The <b>Least</b> <b>We</b> Can Do... and was persuaded to take part by Anthony. Jackson recalled that Fripp [...] "set up all of his stuff, put his headphones on, and started searing away." [...] Fripp played the guitar part twice, having never heard the track before, and a composite of both takes appears on the final recording. Fripp has subsequently introduced Anthony as [...] "the guy who gave me my first session" [...] at events. Fripp would collaborate again with Van der Graaf Generator on their next album, Pawn Hearts, released the following year.|$|E

500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at <b>least</b> <b>we</b> gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{a number}} of franchisees bought the Collectramatic, which {{had the support of}} Colonel Sanders from 1970 onwards, John Y. Brown had given tacit {{approval}} to franchisees to exclusively use the older L S Hartzog fryer, saying [...] "Though those old pots were damn dangerous, at <b>least</b> <b>we</b> knew they worked! I was mostly afraid these new fryers would break {{down in the middle of}} business." [...] Brown warned franchisees that they were in violation of their contract if they used the Collectramatic. Brown held his ground on the issue until he learned that his father, John Y. Brown Sr., who owned multiple KFC franchises, was successfully using the Collectramatic in every franchise he owned. [...] The issue was eventually resolved after Heublein purchased KFC, acquired Hartzog and nullified the contract. The Collectramatic has been an approved pressure fryer for KFC from 1972 onwards.|$|E
500|$|The {{danger is}} perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At <b>least</b> <b>we</b> do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so {{seems to me to be}} intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.|$|E

We glanced at the orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past—we just recognised them, and that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> should not be disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre, and daubs of crimson and yellow all round, like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where night after night we had beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of Madame Somebody (we forget even her name now), who nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine her temple! ...|$|E
500|$|After the show, {{the band}} posted a public {{statement}} about the incident, thanking their fans for coming despite of the risks involved, and blessing the radicals: [...] "We are proud to call you {{our brothers and sisters}} in Christ.

Extra special hails to our fans who had the balls to come although they knew it could be dangerous. Antestor salutes you and be blessed." [...] In a newspaper interview with the Norwegian Christian newspaper Dagen two days following the band's safe return to Norway, bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen said that he had prepared himself for the worst-case scenario that the tour could end in death, and he reiterates the band's gratitude to the aggressive Brazilian Satanists stating: [...] "We're now twice as big in Brazil as we were before we went there." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} the video was [...] "a luxe-looking, moodily lit affair that finds the season 8 champ clad in a physique-appropriate black henley and {{stalking}} his way through an abandoned construction site featuring a giant countdown clock, a dramatic sunrise, and copious amounts of recycled plastic sheeting." [...] Slezak also said that, [...] "the folks at 19 gave Kris the proper budget to kick off his video career – at <b>least</b> <b>we</b> finally know what the company did with the savings gleaned from hiring student filmmakers to helm Blake Lewis and Diana DeGarmo’s tragic first clips". James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the video looked better and more expensive that past-first videos by American Idol alumni under 19. Montgomery also compared the video's [...] "artfully color-saturated frames and great expanses" [...] to Snow Patrol's [...] "Run" [...] clip and the Madonna, Justin Timberlake, and Timbaland's [...] "4 Minutes", doing away with the [...] "narrative crutch most Idol champs' debuts lean on (see, for example, David Cook's 'Light On'), putting the focus squarely on Allen himself." [...] He also said that, [...] "while Allen's debut video isn't as flashy-dashy as Idol compatriot Adam Lambert's 'Time for Miracles,' it's just as good – mostly because, rather than rely on fiery explosions, 'Dying' plays it straight, showcasing Allen and his talents", and called it [...] "bold" [...] as Allen was never shown as the [...] "flashy type".|$|E
