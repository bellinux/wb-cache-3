500|$|Frederick {{wrote to}} Elgin in January 1895 that Karim was deeply unpopular in the Household, {{and that he}} {{occupied}} [...] "very much {{the same position as}} John Brown used to". Princesses Louise and Beatrice, Prince Henry of Battenberg, Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Secretary of State for India Henry Fowler had all raised concerns about Karim with the Queen, who [...] "refused to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had to say but was very angry, so as you see the Munshi is a sort of pet, like a dog or cat which the Queen will not willingly give up". Elgin was warned by both Ponsonby and the India Office that the Queen gave his letters to the Munshi to read, and that consequently his correspondence to her should not be of a confidential nature. Victoria's advisors feared Karim's association with Rafiuddin Ahmed, an Indian political activist resident in London who was connected to the Muslim Patriotic League. They suspected that Ahmed extracted confidential information from Karim to pass onto the Amir of Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman Khan. There is no indication that these fears were well-founded, or that the Munshi was ever indiscreet.|$|E
500|$|... "I See You" [...] {{was written}} by James Horner and Kuk Harrell and {{produced}} by Simon Franglen as the official theme song to James Cameron's 2009 film, Avatar. It {{is the second time}} that Horner and Franglen have collaborated on a theme song for a film directed by Cameron, the first being [...] "My Heart Will Go On", performed by Celine Dion and used for his 1997 film Titanic. In an interview with Rick Edwards for 4Music called Under the Skin of Leona Lewis, Lewis explained how she became involved with Avatar and recording the theme tune. The singer said that she had known about the project for some period of time as she is very interested in film in general, and that she was approached by Cameron to record Avatars official theme song. She continued to say that she was very excited about seeing the film, even before her involvement with the film came to be. Cameron invited Lewis to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had in mind for the song, and upon hearing it, she [...] "immediately wanted to be on board." [...] One of the reasons Lewis gave as to why she accepted the proposal was that a lot of her second studio album, Echo (2009), was inspired by various films, and she {{thought it would be a}} great opportunity to appear on a soundtrack.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Manson {{appeared}} in Michael Moore's documentary, Bowling for Columbine; his appearance was filmed during the band's first show in Denver since the shooting. When Moore asked Manson {{what he would}} have said to the students at Columbine, he replied, [...] "I wouldn't say a single word to them. I would <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have to say and that's what no one did." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{he stayed}} in fear and {{trembling}} none the less for these words; and, shrouded in his black cloak with his face turned from them, stood away from the bedside, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> said, as if he felt himself a demon in the place.|$|R
60|$|Byron Lyall, a grizzled, elderly man, half farmer, half fisherman, and Maxwell Holmes, the Prospect schoolteacher, {{came up to}} {{the boat}} presently. Paul lay softly and <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were saying. He was not troubled by any sense of dishonour. Honour was {{something}} Paul King could not lose since it was something he had never possessed. They were talking of him and Joan.|$|R
2500|$|Marilyn Manson {{was blamed}} {{by the media}} {{in the wake of}} the Columbine shooting, and responded to {{criticism}} in an interview with Michael Moore, in which he was asked, [...] "If you were to talk directly to the kids at Columbine and the people in the community, what would you say to them if they were here right now?", to which he replied, [...] "I wouldn't say a single word to them—I would <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have to say, and that's what no one did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earlier in 2001, {{the band}} {{released}} {{a cover of}} Gloria Jones' [...] "Tainted Love" [...] on the soundtrack to Not Another Teen Movie. The song became the band's biggest international hit yet, peaking at number one in numerous European territories. In 2002, Jonathan Davis of Korn invited Marilyn Manson to record vocals on a track titled [...] "Redeemer", which was released on his [...] to Queen of the Damned. Manson also appeared in Michael Moore's 2002 documentary, Bowling for Columbine; his appearance was filmed {{on the same day}} as their Denver Ozzfest performance.

2500|$|During the episode, Ziva tells {{a witness}} {{that she and}} Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say, I think it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than she {{thought she was going to}} have, which maybe shocked her a little bit, because she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good." [...] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond [...] "unfulfilled sexual tension".|$|E
40|$|If a {{building}} could speak, {{what would it}} say? What would it sound like? Would it be worth <b>listening</b> <b>to?</b> This book treats buildings as deeply human creations - built by people for people; they come to embody the dreams, imaginings and stories that take place within them. David Littlefield and saskia Lewis argue that buildings have voices {{and that it is}} worth <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have <b>to</b> say...|$|R

The survey results reveal that secondary students want {{a more active role}} and a greater voice in their schooling.

5000|$|The {{mayor of}} Saint-Prix, Jean-Pierre Enjalbert, {{was at first}} against {{the idea of an}} Ahmadiyya mosque in his town, but later changed his mind and gave his approval. Said Enjalbert: [...] "What {{reassured}} us is the fact we’ve got to know them through all these years, had time to observe them, see how they act.

(In fact, we can only compare it to an electric light bulb with the power gone wrong.) Who is it? It is Jefferson C. Davis, President, as our readers will be gratified to learn, of the Confederate States.|$|R

[...] "But I can watch the doctor at any rate. We don't know what he may not do when he is left by himself, while my master is at the meeting. I want to try if I can follow that rogue through the streets, without his finding me out. Please to send me on an errand to Paris to-morrow." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 3 March 2015, Tusk or Tooth Records {{released}} a digital EP with six remixes of [...] "Head Up High" [...] produced by MS MR, Penguin Prison, CSS, Lauren Flax, and Mercury. Oh Land described CSS's remix as [...] "more club and minimal" [...] and compared its sound {{to the music}} of the 1980s. Reflecting on all six of the remixes, she claimed that she asked only musicians that she [...] "really admires" [...] then stated that she enjoyed <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could make of her music.|$|R

60|$|The station-master did {{not wait}} to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had to say, but at once began abusing them for being in the {{carriage}} at all.

60|$|Presently Billy Mink {{discovered}} that Grandfather Frog was asleep. Billy's little black eyes twinkled with mischief as he hurried {{over to the}} slippery slide in search of Little Joe Otter. Then the two scamps hunted up Jerry Muskrat. They found him very busy storing away a supply of food in his new house. At first Jerry refused to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had to say, but the more they talked the more Jerry became interested.|$|E
60|$|In {{the evening}} she {{gathered}} {{the truth from}} the nuns, {{who did not know}} that she was <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> said. It seemed that Thomas, whom they spoke of as a madman or as drunk, had tried to break into the Nunnery. When he was asked what he wanted, he answered that he did not know, but he must speak with Emlyn Stower. At this tidings she smiled to herself, for now she knew that he had heard her, and that in this way or in that he would obey her summons and come.|$|R
60|$|The {{snowstorm}} {{that started}} that evening proved a heavy one, {{and it was}} not until nearly a week later that the Morris party managed to get back to Fort Pitt. Here the commandant <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had <b>to</b> relate with close attention and said he would report to the proper authorities at the first opportunity. But means of communication were now almost entirely cut off; and in the end little or nothing was done to make Pontiac and his followers explain their actions, matters of greater importance coming up in the meantime.|$|R

She instantly {{opened the door of}} the back dining-room, and beckoned to me to follow. I naturally hesitated. [...] "I shall go mad," [...] she whispered, [...] "if you leave me by myself!" [...] What could I do? I degraded myself the second time. For my own child--in pity for my own child! ...|$|E
60|$|These ladies were deferentially {{received}} by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour {{at the top}} of the room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no time to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> said; other matters called off and enchanted my attention.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stick at it, Richard," [...] Hunterleys advised. [...] "Don't mind {{a little}} discouragement.

People speak of them tolerantly, <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say, doubt its reasonableness and put it {{at the back of}} their heads, but in the end it does good. Your people and mine are slow to believe and slow to understand, but the truth sinks in if one proclaims it often enough and loudly enough. We are going through it in our own country just now, with regard to National Service, for one thing. Here come your cars. You travel in state, Richard." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Best Of You" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{compositions}} for In Your Honor, written by Dave Grohl in his garage following his involvement on the campaign trail for John Kerry. Once the Foo Fighters recorded a demo, they shelved it feeling they could do better. It was only brought back for further production by manager John Silva, who felt [...] "Best of You"'s absence while <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had recorded that far. Taylor Hawkins declared that it was the only song from the rock disk of that album that remained from the original sessions along with [...] "No Way Back".|$|R
5000|$|... “The two {{students}} are {{holding each other}} up to express unity rather than the competition that exists in education. The equal sign signifies scientific {{as well as social}} equality---that everyone should be equal; men to women, students to faculty, blacks to everyone else. The students form the trunk of a tree. The medallions are arranged in a triangle like branches and the plaque represents the roots.” She went on to say: “I was happy to have the suggestions of the faculty and students.

60|$|They {{were shown}} {{into the inner}} office, where a gray-haired gentleman <b>listened</b> gravely <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had <b>to</b> say. Then he took the salvage claim from Jordan, and laid it beneath a pile of other papers.|$|R
60|$|Well, not settled exactly; Mr. Buzzacott wouldn't {{go so far}} as to say settled. A villine for {{the summer}} months. The winter in Rome. One was forced to live abroad. Taxation in England.... Soon they were all talking. Barbara looked at them. Beside the marquis they all seemed half dead. His face flashed as he talked; he seemed to be boiling with life. Her father was limp and pale, like {{something}} long buried from the light; and Mr. Topes was all dry and shrivelled; and Mrs. Topes looked more than ever like something worked by clockwork. They were talking about Socialism and Fascisti, and all that. Barbara did not <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were saying; but she looked at them, absorbed.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole of}} that night Esther {{remained}} shut up in her apartment in the Petite Rue Taranne. All night she heard the measured tramp, the movements, the laughter and loud talking of men outside her door. Once or twice she tried to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> said. But the doors and walls in these houses of old Paris were too stout to allow voices to filter through, save {{in the guise of}} a confused murmur. She would have felt horribly lonely and frightened but for the fact that in one window on the third floor in the house opposite the light of a lamp appeared like a glimmer of hope. Jack Kennard was there, on the watch. He had the window open and sat beside it until a very late hour; and after that he kept the light in, as a beacon, to bid her be of good cheer.|$|E

A shot rang out, and another and another, but I was getting now above the light of their torches. A hundred feet higher I came to a stand-still, for the rock rose right up in front of me, and the water had here come down from above in a fall. This made it a tight place, you bet. There war no ledge as I could see that I could get along, and I should have to go down a good bit afore I got to one.

I know I used to give up when people have weird accent, and believe they should change, but, now I think I should start to get acclimatised to different…diversity of English and it’s more like normally I used <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the sound, but I’m now <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want <b>to</b> tell me, so, communication (Phil).|$|R
