40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{empirical}} exploration of cracked trials at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court. Cracked trials are cases which are <b>listed</b> <b>for</b> <b>trial</b> {{but on the}} day they are due to be tried are disposed of in some other way. The thesis presents quantitative and qualitative data extracted from prosecution case files, as well as interviews with legal professionals, to examine the reasons <b>for</b> cracked <b>trials,</b> focusing on those trials which crack {{as a result of}} a late guilty plea. The data are analysed in order to explore the features of cracked trials, and the defence lawyer’s role in late guilty pleas (identified as significant by previous studies) is also examined. The existing literature has identified plea bargaining as a significant cause of late guilty pleas; the extent to which this was a feature within the sampled cases is assessed, and the nature of the plea bargains which were present in the data is explored. It is argued that the data demonstrate that plea bargaining played a key role in those cases which cracked {{as a result of a}} late guilty plea and that several types of plea bargain were prevalent within the sample. In light of these findings, the thesis analyses the reasons for the criminal justice system’s reluctance to acknowledge the role of plea bargaining in cracked trials (despite some recent formalisation of plea bargaining itself), and examines the extent to which grounds for policy and academic objections to plea bargaining and cracked trials were evidenced in the data collected. The thesis then considers whether either policy objections (that cracked trials represent defendants ‘playing the system’) or academic objections, (that plea bargains create pressure on defendants to plead guilty, and cracked trials are a manifestation of that pressure) are necessarily true, and whether plea bargaining could alternatively be viewed as a legitimate consensual or contractual exchange of concessions. The thesis concludes with the argument that a contradictory and hypocritical approach to plea bargaining has created a situation whereby the significance of plea bargaining is often ignored by a criminal justice system which has come to rely upon it. It is argued that the policies pursued in an attempt to reduce cracked trials are therefore flawed in their failure to acknowledge that cracked trials are inextricably bound together with plea bargaining...|$|R

RESULTS: We found sufficient evidence that interactive education, computerised reminder systems and audit and feedback delivered to clinicians may significantly increase several cancer detection measures in the short term and some evidence that they promote early diagnosis. Whilst educational outreach and local opinion leaders had some effect, formal education alone seemed ineffectual. CONCLUSION: Certain educational interventions delivered at a clinician as well as at a practice level may promote the early diagnosis of cancer in primary care.

40|$|Neutral-pH peritoneal dialysates, {{with reduced}} glucose {{degradation}} products (GDPs), {{have been developed}} to reduce peritoneal membrane damage. Here our review evaluated the impact of these solutions on clinical outcomes using data from The Cochrane CENTRAL Registry, MEDLINE, Embase, and reference <b>lists</b> <b>for</b> randomized <b>trials</b> of biocompatible solutions. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model of 20 eligible trials encompassing 1383 patients. The quality of studies was generally poor, such that 13 studies had greater than a 20 % loss to follow-up and only 3 trials reported adequate concealment of allocation. Use of neutral-pH dialysates with reduced GDPs resulted in larger urine volumes (7 trials; 520 patients; mean difference 126 ml/day, 95 % CI 27 - 226), improved residual renal function after 12 months (6 trials; 360 patients; standardized mean difference 0. 31, 95 % confidence interval 0. 10 - 0. 52), and a trend to reduced inflow pain (1 trial; 58 patients; relative risk 0. 51, 95 % CI 0. 24 - 1. 08). However, there was no significant effect on body weight, hospitalization, peritoneal solute transport rate, peritoneal small-solute clearance, peritonitis, technique failure, patient survival, or adverse events. No significant harms were identified. Thus, based on generally poor quality trials, the use of neutral-pH peritoneal dialysates with reduced GDPs resulted in greater urine volumes and residual renal function after 12 months, but without other clinical benefits. Larger, better-quality studies are needed for accurate evaluation of the impact of these newer dialysates on patient-level hard outcomes...|$|R

Results and discussion A review of several prospective trials demonstrates no treatment related grade 4 cardiovascular toxicities and only two grade 5 toxicities in 1424 (0. 1 %) collective patients. A recent publication and our own unpublished experience finds 6 of 128 (4. 7 %) patients developed grade 4 to 5 cardiovascular (thrombosis/embolism) toxicity. The differenc in incidence of severe or life threatening cardiovascular toxicity of 0. 1 versus 4. 7 % is highly statistically significant (p Conclusion This dramatic difference in incidence of cardiovascular toxicity raises the possibility that cardiovascular toxicities were inadequately reported on the <b>listed</b> prospective <b>trials.</b> <b>For</b> those patients enrolled in prospective trials, we suggest that thromboses should be diligently documented and reported.
