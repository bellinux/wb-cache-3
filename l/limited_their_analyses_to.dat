However, the details of the shape and topographic location of such growth remain largely unknown. One limiting methodological factor has been the relatively sparse sampling of sound intensities. Additionally, most studies have either analysed the entire auditory cortex without differentiating primary and non-primary regions or have <b>limited</b> <b>their</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>to</b> Heschl's gyrus (HG). Here, we characterise the pattern of responses to a 300 -Hz tone presented in 6 -dB steps from 42 to 96 dB sound pressure level as a function of its sound level, within three anatomically defined auditory areas; the primary area, on HG, and two non-primary areas, consisting of a small area lateral to the axis of HG (the anterior lateral area, ALA) and the posterior part of auditory cortex (the planum temporale, PT). Extent and magnitude of auditory activation increased non-linearly with sound level. In HG, the extent and magnitude were more sensitive to increasing level than in ALA and PT. Thus, HG appears to have a larger involvement in sound-level processing than does ALA or PT...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to bring together an existential analysis {{of the human condition}} and a theory of film. The existential theories are informed mainly by the work of Martin Heidegger, but also examine themes developed by Friedrich Nietzsche and Søren Kierkegaard. Many traditional film theories approach the medium with a critical distance that does not account for the everyday experience of popular movies. Many existential approaches to film are grounded on the human experience but <b>limit</b> <b>their</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>to</b> stories or characters.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a growing {{interest}} in new participatory forms of urban governance. This introduction provides readers with a basic review of current debates in the literature and a summary of the articles presented in the symposium. The introduction highlights two major tensions in the literature. First, many scholars operate under an assumption that plural actors can achieve a lasting and rational consensus on certain issues. Others believe that where there is consensus, there is also a silenced margin. For these critics, rather than focusing on building power-laden consensus, it is better to recognize and respect conflict and difference as normal parts of the governance process. Second, the introduction considers some of the possibilities for cross-national comparisons of participatory governance regimes. Scholars should not <b>limit</b> <b>their</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>to</b> institutional designs across countries but assess the importance of particular sociopolitical contexts in giving formal institutions their actual meanings and functions.

The analysis {{is based on the}} notions of 'theme' and 'rheme', and their semantic correlates 'old information' and 'new information'. The use of the notions 'theme' and 'rheme' for describing the functions of 'wa' and 'ga' is not new, but all the previous studies <b>limit</b> <b>their</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>to</b> simple sentences. Our analysis treats also complex sentences, mainly complex sentences with subordinate clauses, and shows that the notions 'theme' and 'rheme' can provide a rather unified description for the functions of 'wa' and 'ga' as subject markers both in simple sentences and in the subordinate clauses of complex sentences. The analysis also shows that the notions of 'theme', 'rheme', or their semantic correlates 'old information', 'new information', could be effective in Japanese language teaching. The final part of the paper {{deals with the}} problem of the usage of 'wa' and 'ga' in the opening sentence of text.

However, most studies have been focused on one health care service, mainly hospital care, or <b>limited</b> <b>their</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>to</b> one additional comorbid disease, or the data were based on self-reported questionnaires instead of health care registration data. The {{purpose of this study is}} to estimate the effects a broad spectrum of of comorbidities on the type and volume of medical health care utilization of patients with diabetes. Methods By linking general practice and hospital based registrations in the Netherlands, data on comorbidity and health care utilization of patients with diabetes (n = 7, 499) were obtained. Comorbidity was defined as diabetes-related comorbiiabetes-related comorbidity. Multilevel regression analyses were applied to estimate the effects of comorbidity on health care utilization. Results Our results show that both diabetes-related and non diabetes-related comorbidity increase the use of medical care substantially in patients with diabetes. Having both diabeterelated and non diabetes-related comorbidity incrases the demand for health care even more. Differences in health care utilization patterns were observed between the comorbidities. Conclusion Non diabetes-related comorbidity increases the health care demand as much as diabetes-related comorbidity. Current single-disease approach of integrated diabetes care should be extended with additional care modules, which must be generic and include multiple diseases in order to meet the complex health care demands of patients with diabetes in the future. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the youth’s {{decisions}} on household formation and human capital investment - in further education or work experience - and the factors influencing these choices. While previous studies <b>limited</b> <b>their</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>to</b> decisions concerning the living arrangements and the labour market, the choice set is extended here {{to take into account}} other alternatives. The decisions of either remaining in the parental household or going to live with a partner are modelled jointly with those of either entering the labour market (i. e. investing in work experience) or investing in higher (university) education. Using the Bank of Italy 1995 Sample Survey on Italian Households, a multinomial probit model estimates the probabilities of the different pairs of outcomes. The results highlight the crucial role of economic variables in shaping young adults’ decisions. Among these, expected lifetime earnings from attending university have the most important impact on the choice of studying and coresiding. Implications for policy stem from the estimated impact of housing and labour market performance variables on young adults’ decisions. In particular, a sizeable discouraged worker effect, inducing young people to study when the local unemployment rate is high, is detected. The effect of the cost of housing in delaying young workers’ decisions to leave the parental home and form a new household is also remarkable. Two policy experiments are presented. The former measures the impact of housing policies targeted at reducing housing cost on the probability of marriage. The latter measures the extent to which labour policies targeted at reducing youth unemployment would decrease the number of discouraged workers that choose to study...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effects of social identity in an economic context. The first chapter studies when a common group identity improves efficiency in coordination games. To address this, we propose a group-contingent social preference model and derive conditions under which social identity changes equilibrium selection. We test our predictions in the minimum-effort game in the laboratory under parameter configurations which lead to an inefficient low-effort equilibrium for subjects with no group identity. For those with a salient group identity, consistent with our theory, we find that learning leads to ingroup coordination to the efficient high-effort equilibrium. Additionally, our theoretical framework reconciles findings {{from a number of}} coordination game experiments. In the second chapter, we investigate {{the effects of}} lending team competition on pro-social lending on Kiva. org, the first peer-to-peer microlending site which matches citizen lenders with entrepreneurs in developing countries. We find that lenders are more similar to their team members than to those outside the team. When choosing a team, lenders pay more attention to team rank than to member characteristics. Furthermore, joining a lending team increases lending, but mostly for those who are not already engaged in the site. Lenders who join teams make 1. 8 more loans per month than those who do not, which translates to at least $ 45 per month. Using a random sample of team forum data, we find that teams who post many links to specific loans increase their lending. The third chapter studies the endogenous choice of groups, which is an important but underexplored aspect of social identity. While group membership is frequently voluntary in real-world situations, most studies of group effects <b>limit</b> <b>their</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>to</b> either pre-determined or induced groups. In this study, I separately examine how endogenous group choice and intergroup comparison affect pro-social behavior in a laboratory setting. Allowing subjects some choice over their group membership increases pro-social behavior, while intergroup comparison does so only when subjects care about their groups. Finally, I calibrate a learning model incorporating social preferences, yielding estimates of the subjects' group-contingent other-regarding preferences...|$|R

In {{the highly}} {{saturated}} global fashion industry, clothing brands {{attempt to create}} and sustain the illusion of uniqueness and exclusivity by deploying a multitude of artificial, both time- and volume-related product shortages, allegedly select shopping experiences and ever accelerating launch intervals of new collections. One of those ephemeral forms of customer inspiration represents the new phenomenon of temporary popup-stores.

This paper analyses both the existing pop-up-retail literature and empirical studies in related disciplines for critical success factors of pop-up-stores, identifies relevant dimensions of success and eventually proposes a success factors model, hierarchically structured into a macro and a micro level. The model's consistency is subsequently challenged using two explorative case studies from the international fashion industry. This approach demonstrates the model's suitability for practical application, the latter serving not only descriptive and explicative functions, but also managerial purposes by offering concrete guidelines to executives of pop-up-stores in terms of the strategic conception, operational execution and subsequent performance evaluation...|$|R

While most historical discussions of education in Japan have <b>limited</b> <b>their</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>to</b> the central education system and its expansion, I extend the field of educational inquiry to include sites and organizations that have been overlooked. In particular, I explore the explicit and implicit educational activities carried out {{by members of the}} Movement for Freedom and Popular Rights and by coal industrialists in the region. By comparing and contrasting these disparate areas of educational activity, I emphasize underlying themes that were implicated in both: region, identity, paternalism, and the possibility of liberation. Utilizing an analytic framework that emphasizes the intellectual and institutional aspects of pedagogy, my dissertation explores the educational ideas or theories of both sets of actors - who, what, and how they wanted to teach - as well as {{the ways in which they}} attempted to implement those ideas. Neither popular rights activists nor coal industrialists showed much concern for educational content, instead emphasizing its perceived moral and social effects. Therefore, they attributed educational value to a variety of sites and settings, from public gatherings and the popular press to mutual-aid associations and home life itself, all of which had perceived socializing properties. Finally, I explore the role that educational theory and practice plays in the constitution of identity itself by analyzing an overlooked consequence of both sets of activities: the creation of the "people" and "coal miners" as enduring concepts in Japanese social and political discourse, both referring to constituencies that require the educational intervention of enlightened superiors...|$|E
40|$|Epistasis {{could be}} an {{important}} source of risk for disease. How interacting loci might be discovered is an open question for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Most researchers <b>limit</b> <b>their</b> statistical <b>analyses</b> <b>to</b> testing individual pairwise interactions (i. e., marginal tests for association). A more effective means of identifying important predictors is to fit models that include many predictors simultaneously (i. e., higher-dimensional models). We explore a procedure called screen and clean (SC) for identifying liability loci, including interactions, by using the lasso procedure, which is a model selection tool for high-dimensional regression. We approach the problem by using a varying dictionary consisting of terms to include in the model. In the first step the lasso dictionary includes only main effects. The most promising single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are identified using a screening procedure. Next the lasso dictionary is adjusted to include these main effects and the corresponding interaction terms. Again, promising terms are identified using lasso screening. Then significant terms are identified through the cleaning process. Implementation of SC for GWAS requires algorithms to explore the complex model space induced by the many SNPs genotyped and their interactions. We propose and explore a set of algorithms and find that SC successfully controls Type I error while yielding good power to identify risk loci and their interactions. When the method is applied to data obtained from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium study of Type 1 Diabetes it uncovers evidence supporting interaction within the HLA class II region as well as within Chromosome 12 q 24...|$|R

Anthropogenic NOx (NO and NO 2) emissions have a range of health and environmental impacts. Reliable measurements of NOx are used to inform a range of science and policy goals. Satellite observations of tropospheric NO 2 give a synoptic view of global and regional air pollution and are essential to constraining NOx emission estimates. However, coarse spatio-temporal resolution <b>limits</b> <b>their</b> utility <b>to</b> <b>analyse</b> urban pollution.

A variant on the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique was developed using unpolluted Earthshine reference spectra, and was tested using modelled and operational satellite spectra. Tropospheric columns retrieved with this technique agreed well with operational products (r 2 = 0 : 85), particularly over heavily polluted regions (r 2 = 0 : 96).

40|$|Recently, {{the first}} {{rigorous}} runtime analyses of ACO algorithms appeared, covering variants of the MAX-MIN ant system and their runtime on pseudo-Boolean functions. Interestingly, a variant called 1 -ANT is {{very sensitive to}} the evaporation factor while Gutjahr and Sebastiani proved partly opposite results for their variant called MMASbs. These algorithms differ in their update mechanisms and, moreover, MMASbs only accepts strict improvements {{in contrast to the}} 1 -ANT. The motivation for this work is manifold. Firstly, we prove that the different behav-ior of the 1 -ANT and MMASbs results from the different update mechanisms. Secondly, we improve results by Gutjahr and Sebastiani and extend <b>their</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>to</b> the impor-tant class of unimodal functions. Thirdly, we compare MMASbs with a variant that also accepts equally fit solutions as this enables the exploration of plateaus. For well-known plateau functions we show theoretically and experimentally that accepting equally fit solutions drastically reduces the optimization time...|$|R
40|$|In appraising {{the power}} of antifeminist {{discourse}} in Brazil, I examine how this discourse appears {{in the realm of}} cultural journalism in order to make some connections to Brazilian social history, in the light of which {{it may be possible to}} understand why feminism as transforming praxis seems so alien to the habits of the country. To sustain my arguments I draw on the readings of Brazilian historical and cultural thinkers considered "leftists". At the same time, I point out the <b>limits</b> of <b>their</b> <b>analyses,</b> that is, <b>their</b> silence regarding women's oppression and gender issues. Finally, I examine the persistence of various forms of antifeminism in the lettered milieu so as to understand the statute of feminist critique in the field of literary studies and the reasons for its invisibility, including considerations on its achievements and the limitations of its practices...|$|R
