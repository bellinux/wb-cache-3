5|$|While {{attending}} {{her college}} reunion at Salve Regina University with Peter, Lois spots her old roommate, Naomi Robinson, {{with whom she}} had a brief lesbian relationship in college. Peter is shocked but excited to discover that Lois was bisexual in college. Naomi indicates that she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> an important matter with them at their home. Assuming that he will participate in a threesome with Lois and Naomi, Peter sends Chris, Meg, Stewie, and Brian out of the house. After Naomi arrives, she introduces her husband Dale. Peter expects that they will now be participating in an orgy, and tries to seduce the three of them while dressed in various costumes. When they clear the air to a dismayed Peter that they're not there for sex, Naomi and Dale tell Lois and Peter they've had trouble conceiving and ask Lois to be a surrogate mother for them, and Lois considers the matter.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Howe turned down several {{requests}} that he stand for alderman in Port Arthur. He did agree to seek {{election to the}} school board in 1921, and headed the polls at his first attempt. He served two 2-year terms on the board, spending the final year as its chairman. Early in their marriage, Clarence and Alice Howe had decided to separate their roles, with Alice Howe having full responsibility for their domestic lives. Howe took no interest in his home life; as an often-absent father he had only a small role in the upbringing of his five children. In the same manner he did not involve his wife in his business (or, later public) life. [...] During his ministerial career, he replied {{in response to an}} opposition question hinting at nepotism, [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> my family in public. Members may have noticed that my wife never appears on political platforms." ...|$|E

There's also rare footage of Bob's sister's wedding, {{including}} his mum's party piece and a small contretemps at the reception. The repossession of Rod Hull's house is recreated, with 'Emu' playing a starring role, and Ulrika Jonsson meets Bob for a high-powered TV dinner. The [...] "Casualty Location Man" [...] (Bob) is out and about again, stalking {{an old man who}} looks like he could easily topple over and be decapitated by a taxi, Lovely.|$|R
60|$|What had {{happened}} to them? What was the matter between himself and Marjorie that he couldn't even intimate his sense of their divergence? He would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the whole thing with his mother, but somehow that seemed disloyal to Marjorie....|$|R
2500|$|Cannon later recalled: [...] Many of the {{newcomers}} made a fetish of democracy. They were repelled {{so much by}} the bureaucratism of the Communist Party that they desired an organization without any authority or discipline or centralization whatever. [...] All {{the people of this}} type have one common characteristic: they <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> things without limit or end.... They [...] can all talk; and not only can, but will; and everlastingly, on every question. They were iconoclasts who would accept nothing as authoritative, nothing as decided {{in the history of the}} movement. Everything and everybody had to be proved over again from scratch." [...] As by-product of the group's small size, its quarrelsome and iconoclastic membership, and its isolation from the broader labor movement, a culture of fierce internal squabbling reigned supreme. Eyes were turned inward upon other members of the group itself rather than political activities matters of concern in the broader world, as party members frequently fought over trifles.|$|E
2500|$|Roast Beef had a desperately {{unhappy and}} impoverished childhood, ranging from simple {{lack of food}} due to poverty to an {{incident}} where he overheard his mother killing his father, apparently in self-defense. He does not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> his childhood, generally referring to it simply by saying he is [...] "from Circumstances". Beef has seemingly incurable depression, Seasonal Affective Disorder, and/or Avoidant personality disorder, and considers suicide often, though {{no one seems to}} care. Recently however, his depression seems to have improved, particularly since he met Molly. Molly has also gotten him a light therapy lamp, which helps when he remembers to use it. For a long time he lived in a trailer with his abusive grandmother, Gramma K., but has since moved out of the trailer and into Ray's pool shed. His speech balloons use a slightly smaller font than that of other characters and rarely include punctuation, to emphasize his timidity and unique manner of speech. Roast Beef possesses an impressive vocabulary and will, on occasion, sprinkle words such as [...] "insatiable", [...] "phenomena", or [...] "corpulent" [...] into his normally slang-filled dialogue.|$|E
2500|$|David Boreanaz as Seeley Booth: FBI Special Agent Booth {{seeks out}} Brennan's {{professional}} help in his investigations involving human remains that cannot be identified without Brennan's skills {{and those of}} her colleagues. The character is often used as an audience surrogate to provide a layman's translation of the scientific jargon-filled dialog, especially in the [...] "squints'" [...] conversations or lab scenes. He gives Brennan her nickname, [...] "Bones", which she starts out hating but comes to accept. He is a skilled investigator and interrogator who often relies on his [...] "gut" [...] and [...] "cop instincts" [...] (a quality unknown to Brennan). A decorated veteran of the United States Army Rangers, {{where he was a}} sniper, he has a son from a previous relationship, Parker, and a younger brother, Jared. He also has a daughter, Christine, with Brennan and a son Hank, named after his grandfather. Raised in the Roman Catholic church, Booth is a devout believer in God and heaven, and finds himself frequently debating spiritual issues with Brennan, who regards all religion as primitive superstition unsupported by empirical evidence. He is purportedly a member of the well-known Booth Family and, as such, is related to John Wilkes Booth, which he does not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gilman won the Scott McPherson Award and an Illinois Arts Council playwriting fellowship. She <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> {{issues in}} her plays. The Glory of Living {{is about a}} mother brutally killing runaways and hitchhikers {{in an attempt to}} please her husband. Boy Gets Girl (2000) looks at the power and {{violence}} in gender relations. Blue Surge (2001) looks at class, as Spinning into Butter looks at race.|$|R
2500|$|In 1936 Hawkins {{went to the}} University of California, Berkeley, {{to work on his}} doctorate. He {{became friends}} with Robert Oppenheimer, with whom he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> Hindu {{philosophy}}, and issues in the philosophy of science, such as the uncertainty principle, and Niels Bohr's complementarity. In 1938, Hawkins and his wife Frances joined the Berkeley campus branch of the Communist Party of America. He earned his Ph.D. in 1940, writing his thesis on [...] "A Causal Interpretation of Probability".|$|R
50|$|Don Saltero's was {{originally}} a barbers shop until Sir Hans Sloane began to donate unwanted objects {{from his own}} collections {{into the hands of}} James Salter, his former travelling servant. James Salter, or Don Saltero as he began to be known, displayed these objects in his place of business and the barbers shop evolved into Don Saltero's Coffee House and Curiosity Museum. Objects included taxidermy monsters (crocodiles, turtles, rattlesnakes), which local gentlemen including scientist Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Hans Sloane <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> over coffee.|$|R

60|$|After {{hearing this}} wondrous tale, Davidson went {{away from the}} hotel veranda, which was filling with Schomberg's regular customers. Heyst's escapade was the general topic of conversation. Never before had that unaccountable {{individual}} been the cause of so much gossip, he judged. No! Not even in {{the beginnings of the}} Tropical Belt Coal Company when becoming for a moment a public character was he the object of a silly criticism and unintelligent envy for every vagabond and adventurer in the islands. Davidson concluded that people <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> that sort of scandal better than any other.|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{in the day}} {{you heard}} several talks on the {{analytical}} techniques to treat defect scattering. I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> what amounts <b>to</b> two procedures which should hopefully help in not only testing some of these results but also to reduce these techniques to practice, that is to say, with a view toward obtaining defect signatures in the field. The thread that should hopefully be running through my talk is how to develop procedures for applying present scattering results to laboratory field practice...|$|R
2500|$|Ted Williams was on uncomfortable {{terms with}} the Boston {{newspapers}} for nearly twenty years, as he felt they <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> his personal life {{as much as his}} baseball performance. He maintained a career-long feud with SPORT magazine due to a 1948 feature article in which the SPORT reporter included a quote from Williams' mother. Insecure about his upbringing, and stubborn because of immense confidence in his own talent, Williams made up his mind that the [...] "knights of the Press Box" [...] were against him. After having hit for the league's Triple Crown in 1947, Williams narrowly lost the MVP award in a vote where one midwestern newspaper writer left Williams entirely off his ten-player ballot.|$|R

40|$|The problem {{regarding}} sensory-motor {{function in}} total development {{has come to}} occupy an important position in child development, especially in special education. In order to assess sensory-motor function and movement skills of elementary school or developmental retarded children, I and my fellow workers have been studying for five years.

The {{findings of this study}} were that Lauren uses the same literacy strategies when reading books in Greek and English (this finding is concurrent with other studies) Lauren’s reading skills in Greek are less advanced than her reading skills in English and that the student prefers reading in English, but <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> texts in Greek.
