40|$|During {{the last}} several decades, many kinds of {{population}} based Evolutionary Algorithms have been developed and considerable work {{has been devoted to}} computational methods which are inspired by biological evolution and natural selection, such as Evolutionary Programming and Clonal Selection Algorithm. The objective of these algorithms is not only to find suitable adjustments to the current population and hence the solution, but also to perform the process efficiently. However, a parameter setting that was optimal {{at the beginning of the}} algorithm may become unsuitable during the evolutionary process. Thus, it is preferable to automatically modify the control parameters during the runtime process. The approach required could have a bias on the distribution towards appropriate directions of the search space, thereby maintaining sufficient diversity among individuals in order to enable further ability of evolution. This thesis has offered an initial approach to developing this idea. The work starts from a clear understanding of the literature that is of direct relevance to the aforementioned motivations. The development of this approach has been built upon the basis of the fundamental and generic concepts of evolutionary algorithms. The work has exploited and benefited from a range of representative evolutionary computational mechanisms. In particular, essential issues in evolutionary algorithms such as parameter control, including the general aspects of parameter tuning and typical means for implementing parameter control have been investigated. Both the hyperheuristic algorithm and the memetic algorithm have set up a comparative work for the present development. This work has developed several novel techniques that contribute towards the advancement of evolutionary computation and optimization. One such novel approach is to construct a mixed strategy based on the concept of <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape.</b> It exploits the concepts of fitness landscape and <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape.</b> Both theoretical description and experimental investigation of this <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape</b> ??A ?Sbased mixed strategy have been provided, and systematic comparisons with alternative approaches carried out. Another contribution of this thesis is the innovative application of mixed strategy. This is facilitated by encompassing two mutation operators into the mixed strategy, which are borrowed from classical differential evolution techniques. Such an improved method has been shown to be simple and easy for implementation. The work has been utilised to deal with the problem of protein folding in bioinformatics. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm possesses an appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation. The use of this improved algorithm is less likely to fall into local optimal, entailing a faster and better convergence in resolving challenging realistic application problems...|$|E

We demonstrate the effectiveness of using regression on several static multimodal test functions as well as dynamic multimodal test scenarios (Moving Peaks). This chapter also extends the Moving Peaks test suite by enhancing the standard conic peak function to allow the creation of asymmetrical and additional multiple local peaks.

By studying the activity, stability and Zn(II) binding capabilities of all mutants in the preferred evolutionary pathways, we show that this <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape</b> is strongly conditioned by epistatic interactions arising from the pleiotropic effect of mutations in the different molecular features of the enzyme.

40|$|Background: Recent {{experimental}} and theoretical {{studies have shown}} that small asexual populations evolving on complex <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> may achieve a higher fitness than large ones due to the increased heterogeneity of adaptive trajectories. Here we introduce a class of haploid three-locus <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> that allows to investigate this scenario in a precise and quantitative way. Results: Our main result derived analytically shows how the probability of choosing the path of largest initial fitness increase grows with the population size. This makes large populations more likely to get trapped at <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> peaks and implies an advantage of small populations at intermediate time scales. The range of population sizes where this effect is operative coincides with the onset of clonal interference. Additional studies using ensembles of random <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> show that the results achieved for a particular choice of three-locus landscape parameters are robust and also persist as the number of loci increases. Conclusions: Our study indicates that an advantage for small populations is likely whenever the <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape</b> contains <b>local</b> maxima. The advantage appears at intermediate time scales, which are long enough for trapping at <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> maxima to have occurred but too short for peak escape by the creation of multiple mutants.

40|$|A <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape</b> is {{a genetic}} space – with two genotypes {{adjacent}} if they differ {{in a single}} locus – and a fitness function. Evolutionary dynamics produce a flow on this <b>landscape</b> from lower <b>fitness</b> to higher; reaching equilibrium only if a <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> peak is found. I use computational complexity to question the common assumption that evolution on static <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> can quickly reach a <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> peak. I do this by showing that the popular NK model of rugged <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> is PLS-complete for K ≥ 2; the reduction from Weighted 2 SAT is a bijection on adaptive walks, so there are NK <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> where every adaptive path from some vertices is of exponential length.

Applying results from the analysis of simplex algorithms, I show that there exist single-peaked landscapes with no reciprocal sign epistasis where the expected length of an adaptive path following strong selection weak mutation dynamics is eO(n 1 / 3) even though an adaptive path to the optimum of length less than n is available from every vertex.

40|$|The fitness {{landscape}} {{is a concept}} that is widely used for understanding and predicting evolutionary adaptation. The topography of the fitness landscape depends critically on the environment, with potentially far-reaching consequences for evolution under changing conditions. However, few studies have assessed directly how empirical fitness landscapes change across conditions, or validated the predicted consequences of such change. We previously evolved replicate yeast populations in the presence of either gradually increasing, or constant high, concentrations of the heavy metals cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn), and analyzed their phenotypic and genomic changes. Here, we reconstructed the local fitness landscapes underlying adaptation to each metal by deleting all repeatedly mutated genes both by themselves and in combination. Fitness assays revealed that the height, and/or shape, of each <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape</b> changed considerably across metal concentrations, with distinct qualitative differences between unconditionally (Cd) and conditionally toxic metals (Ni and Zn). This change in topography had particularly crucial consequences in the case of Ni, where a substantial part of the individual mutational fitness effects changed in sign across concentrations. Based on the Ni landscape analyses, we made several predictions about which mutations had been selected when during the evolution experiment. Deep sequencing of population samples from different time points generally confirmed these predictions, demonstrating the power of landscape reconstruction analyses for understanding and ultimately predicting evolutionary dynamics, even under complex scenarios of environmental change...|$|E

I map key features of the <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape</b> and characterise how they affect details of enzyme evolution. In order to investigate the evolution of core active site machinery, I mutated the nucleophile of TEV to serine. The differing chemical properties of oxygen and sulphur force the enzyme into a fitness valley with a > 104 -fold activity reduction. Nevertheless, directed evolution was able to recover function, resulting in an enzyme able to utilise either nucleophile. High-throughput screening and sequencing revealed how the array of possible beneficial mutations changes as the enzyme evolves. Potential adaptive mutations are abundant at each step along the evolutionary trajectory, enriched around the active site periphery. It is currently unclear how seemingly neutral mutations affect further adaptive evolution. I used high-throughput directed evolution to accumulate neutral variation in large, evolving enzyme populations and deep sequencing to reconstruct the complex evolutionary dynamics within the lineages. Specifically I was able to observe the emergence of robust enzymes with improved mutation tolerance whose descendants overtake later populations. Lastly, I investigate how evolvability towards new substrate specificities changed along these neutral lineages, dissecting the different determinants of immediate and long-term evolvability.

First, a two-level optimization model for RFID network planning based on distributed decision making (DDM) is presented in this paper. In this model, the mixed discrete and continuous planning variables, namely the number, location, and radiate power of RFID readers are optimized. In each level of the optimization model, the different objectives to determine optimal values for these planning variables are as follows: (i) minimization of total installation cost of RFID network in the top-level; (ii) maximization of tag coverage and network reliability, and minimization of reader interference in the lower-level. In order to solve the proposed model effectively, this work proposes an efficient approach for RNP problem, namely the hybrid artificial bee colony optimizer (HABC), which employs the natural life-cycle mechanism to cast the original ABC framework to a cooperative and population varying fashion.

An important class of these formalisms are biology-inspired process algebras, which offer-among other desirable properties - an almost complete separation of model specification (syntax) from model dynamics (semantics). In this thesis, the similarity between this separation and the genotype-phenotype duality in evolutionary biology is exploited to develop a process-algebraic approach to the study of evolution of biochemical systems. The main technical contribution of this thesis is the continuous π-calculus (cπ), a novel process algebra based on the classical π-calculus of Milner et. al. Its two defining characteristics are: continuous, compositional, computationally inexpensive semantics, and a exible interaction structure of processes (molecules). Both these features are conductive to evolutionary analysis of biochemical systems by, respectively, enabling many variants of a given model to be evaluated, and facilitating in silico evolution of new functional connections. A further major contribution is a collection of variation operators, syntactic model transformation schemes corresponding to common evolutionary events. When applied to a cπ model of a biochemical system, variation operators produce its evolutionary neighbours, yielding insights into the <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape</b> and neutral neighbourhood. Two well-known biochemical systems are modelled in this dissertation to validate the developed theory.

40|$|Evolutionary {{adaptation}} is {{the process}} that increases the fit of a population to the <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape</b> it inhabits. As a con-sequence, evolutionary dynamics is shaped, constrained, and channeled, by that <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape.</b> Much work has been ex-pended to understand the evolutionary dynamics of adapting populations, but much less {{is known about the}} structure of the landscapes. Here, we study the global and local structure of complex <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> of interacting loci that describe protein folds or sets of interacting genes forming pathways or modules. We find that in these landscapes, high peaks {{are more likely to be}} found near other high peaks, corroborat-ing Kauffman’s “Massif Central ” hypothesis. We study the clusters of peaks as a function of the ruggedness of the land-scape and find that this clustering allows peaks to form inter-connected networks. These networks undergo a percolation phase transition as a function of minimum peak height, which indicates that evolutionary trajectories that take no more than two mutations to shift from peak to peak can span the entire genetic space. These networks have implications for evolu-tion in rugged landscapes, allowing adaptation to proceed af-ter a <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> peak has been ascended...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} {{epistasis}} has important {{consequences for the}} evolutionary significance of sex and recombination. Recent efforts to find negative epistasis {{as a source of}} negative linkage disequilibrium and associated long-term advantage to sex have yielded little support. Sign epistasis, where the sign of the fitness effects of alleles varies across genetic backgrounds, is responsible for the ruggedness of the <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape,</b> with several unexplored implications for the evolution of sex. Here, we describe <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> for two sets of strains of the asexual fungus Aspergillus niger involving all combinations of five mutations. We find that 30 % of the single-mutation fitness effects are positive despite their negative effect in the wild-type strain and that several <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> maxima and minima are present. We then compare adaptation of sexual and asexual populations on these empirical <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> by using simulations. The results show a general disadvantage of sex on these rugged landscapes, caused by the breakdown by recombination of genotypes on fitness peaks. Sex facilitates movement to the global peak only for some parameter values on one landscape, indicating its dependence on the landscape’s topography. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between our results and the reports of faster adaptation of sexual population...|$|R
40|$|Inspired {{by social}} {{behavior}} of bird flocking or fish schooling, Eber-hart and Kennedy first developed the {{particle swarm optimization}} (PSO) algorithm in 1995. PSO, as a branch of evolutionary computa-tion, has been successfully applied in many research and application areas {{in the past several}} years, e. g., global optimization, artificial neu-ral network training, and fuzzy system control, etc [...] Especially, for global optimization, PSO has shown its superior advantages and ef-fectiveness. Although PSO is an effective tool for global optimization problems, it shows weakness while solving complex problems (e. g., shifted, ro-tated, and compositional problems) or dynamic problems (e. g., the moving peak problem and the DF 1 function). This is especially true for the original PSO algorithm. In order to improve the performance of PSO to solve complex prob-lems, we present a novel algorithm, called self-learning PSO (SLPSO). In SLPSO, each particle has four different learning strategies to deal with different situations in the search space. The cooperation of the four learning strategies is implemented by an adaptive framework at the individual level, which can enable each particle to choose the opti-mal learning strategy according to the properties of its own <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape.</b> This flexible learning mechanism is able to automatically balance the behavior of exploration and exploitation for each particle in the entire search space during the whole running process. Anothermajor contribution of thiswork is to adapt PSO todynamic environments, we propose an idea that applies hierarchical clustering techniques to generate multiple populations. This idea is the first attempt to solve some open issues when using multiple population methods in dynamic environments, such as, how to define the size of search region of a sub-population, how many individuals are needed in each sub-population, and how many sub-populations are needed, etc [...] Experimental study has shown that this idea is effective to locate and track multiple peaks in dynamic environments...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the adaptation dynamics of an asexual population that walks uphill on a rugged <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape</b> which is endowed with {{large number of}} <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> peaks. We work in a parameter regime where only those mutants that are single mutation away are accessible, {{as a result of}} which the population eventually gets trapped at a <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> maximum and the adaptive walk terminates. We study how the number of adaptive steps taken by the population before reaching a <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> peak depends on the initial fitness of the population, the extreme value distribution of the beneficial mutations and correlations amongst the fitnesses. Assuming that the relative fitness difference between successive steps is small, we analytically calculate the average walk length for both uncorrelated and correlated fitnesses in all extreme value domains for a given initial fitness. We present numerical results for the model where the fitness differences can be large, and find that the walk length behavior differs from that in the former model in the Fréchet domain of extreme value theory. We also discuss the relevance of our results to microbial experiments. Comment: To appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with two distinct fundamental research questions that are both investigated using the E. coli lac system. In the first chapters we investigate what the shape of biological <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> look like. Chapter 2 reviews recent progress in measurement of empirical <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes,</b> and introduces the open questions in evolution that they may answer, such as why particular evolutionary paths are taken. In this chapter, we also introduce the concept of epistasis as a useful description of the <b>local</b> shape of <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes.</b> In chapter 3 we describe existing in vivo measurements on lac repressor and operator mutants and show how these {{can be used to}} construct a <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape</b> of lac regulation. Using computer simulations we simulate mutational pathways and reveal that new regulatory interactions can easily evolve. Chapter 4 deals with the local structure of the lac landscape. We determine that the landscape is multi-peaked and, consistent with earlier predictions, show the presence of reciprocal sign epistasis. We conclude our analysis of the lac landscape in chapter 5 with a more global analysis of its structure, focusing on which landscape features are important for evolution. This study reveals that the essential features of the lac landscape can be sufficiently captured by modeling {{the presence or absence of}} additivity between functional residues. In chapter 6 we turn to another fundamental research question: how do random molecular fluctuations in the number proteins in a single cell propagate to its growth? Again, we use the E. coli lac system to investigate this question. But whereas the first part of this thesis consists of theoretical simulations of lac regulation, here we perform laboratory experiments on E. coli cells that require use of their lac enzymes for growth. By means of automated and highly sensitive fluorescence microscopy, we measure both fluctuations in lac level and in growth rate in individual growing cells. These experiments show that fluctuations in the growth rate of single cells can be linked to protein fluctuations, but also reveal a intricate dynamic interdependency between these two properties.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> {{are central}} in {{analyzing}} evolution, in particular for drug resistance mutations for bacteria and virus. We {{show that the}} <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> associ-ated with antibiotic resistance are not compatible {{with any of the}} classical models; addi-tive, uncorrelated and block <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes.</b> The NK model is also discussed. It is frequently stated that virtually nothing is known about <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> in na-ture. We demonstrate that available records of antimicrobial drug mutations can reveal interesting properties of <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> in general. We apply the methods to analyze the TEM family of β-lactamases associated with antibiotic resistance. Laboratory results agree with our observations. The qualitative tools we suggest are well suited for com-parisons of empirical <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes.</b> <b>Fitness</b> <b>landscapes</b> are central in the theory of recombination and there is a potential for finding relations between the tools and recom-bination strategies. 1.

40|$|The <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape</b> {{captures the}} {{relationship}} between genotype and evolutionary fitness and is a pervasive metaphor {{used to describe the}} possible evolutionary trajectories of adaptation. However, {{little is known about the}} actual shape of <b>fitness</b> <b>landscapes,</b> including whether valleys of low <b>fitness</b> create <b>local</b> <b>fitness</b> optima, acting as barriers to adaptive change. Here we provide evidence of a rugged molecular <b>fitness</b> <b>landscape</b> arising during an evolution experiment in an asexual population of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identify the mutations that arose during the evolution using whole-genome sequencing and use competitive fitness assays to describe the mutations individually responsible for adaptation. In addition, we find that a fitness valley between two adaptive mutations in the genes MTH 1 and HXT 6 /HXT 7 is caused by reciprocal sign epistasis, where the fitness cost of the double mutant prohibits the two mutations from being selected in the same genetic background. The constraint enforced by reciprocal sign epistasis causes the mutations to remain mutually exclusive during the experiment, even though adaptive mutations in these two genes occur several times in independent lineages during the experiment. Our results show that epistasis plays a key role during adaptation and that inter-genic interactions can act as barriers between adaptive solutions. These results also provide a new interpretation on the classic Dobzhansky-Muller model of reproductive isolation and display some surprising parallels with mutations in genes ofte...|$|R
