25|$|Leicestershire's first 70 {{years were}} largely spent in lower table mediocrity, with few notable exceptions. In 1953, the {{motivation}} of secretary-captain Charles <b>Palmer</b> <b>lifted</b> the side fleetingly to third place, {{but most of the}} rest of the 1950s was spent propping up the table, or thereabouts.|$|R
40|$|Contact: + 91 - 9968758413 / 9540067484 In {{last decade}} the rapid advancements in {{forensic}} science {{have changed the}} way of criminal investigation. We have witnessed so many rapid development and changes of new scientific methods and technology, which led’s to the unique features & applications of it and become the trend or part of popular culture. This study {{is based on the}} asserted ability to determine the percentage of documents in which <b>latent</b> <b>palm</b> prints or part is present. For this study, 160 samples were collected from Uttar Pradesh, North India in April 2013 and were distributed into four groups for intensification by different methods. It was noted from the intensification that the documents were having the <b>latent</b> <b>palm</b> prints, when treated with battery of powders. The obtained intensificated prints with black powder were 97. 5 %, Iodine Fuming 92. 5 %, Silver Nitrate 85 % and with Ninhydrin 95 %., which indicates the presence of latent prints along with writings on documents. All developed prints were clear and having identical information about an individual...|$|R

60|$|What {{there is}} of Mauritius is beautiful. You have undulating wide expanses of sugar-cane--a fine, fresh green and very {{pleasant}} to the eye; and everywhere else you have a ragged luxuriance of tropic vegetation of vivid greens of varying shades, a wild tangle of underbrush, with graceful tall <b>palms</b> <b>lifting</b> their crippled plumes high above it; and you have stretches of shady dense forest with limpid streams frolicking through them, continually glimpsed and lost and glimpsed again in the pleasantest hide-and-seek fashion; and you have some tiny mountains, some quaint and picturesque groups of toy peaks, and a dainty little vest-pocket Matterhorn; and {{here and there and}} now and then a strip of sea with a white ruffle of surf breaks into the view.|$|R

60|$|I {{sped away}} with the message. Presently I came back again, upon another message, and they were eating,--those reserves,--they were eating as I had never seen men eat but once, at Kaskaskia. The baker stood by with <b>lifted</b> <b>palms,</b> imploring the saints {{that he might have}} some compensation, until Clark sent him back to his shop to knead and bake again. The good Creoles {{approached}} the fires with the contents of their larders in their hands. Terence tossed me a loaf the size of a cannon ball, and another.|$|R
5000|$|The Bellamy salute {{was first}} {{demonstrated}} on October 12, 1892 according to Bellamy's published {{instructions for the}} [...] "National School Celebration of Columbus Day": At a signal from the Principal the pupils, in ordered ranks, hands to the side, face the Flag. Another signal is given; every pupil gives the flag the military salute -- right hand <b>lifted,</b> <b>palm</b> downward, to align with the forehead and close to it. Standing thus, all repeat together, slowly, “I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands; one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.” At the words, “to my Flag,” the right hand is extended gracefully, palm upward, toward the Flag, and remains in this gesture {{till the end of}} the affirmation; whereupon all hands immediately drop to the side. From The Youth’s Companion, 65 (1892): 446 - 447.|$|R
60|$|For {{some moments}} I stood {{still on the}} ridge, struck by the {{somewhat}} weird aspect of the shadowed scene before me--the long strip of dull uniform green, with {{here and there a}} slender <b>palm</b> <b>lifting</b> its feathery crown above the other trees, standing motionless, in strange relief against the advancing blackness. Then I set out once more at a run, taking advantage of the downward slope to get well on my way before the tempest should burst. As I approached the wood, there came a flash of lightning, pale, but covering the whole visible sky, followed after a long interval by a distant roll of thunder, which lasted several seconds and ended with a succession of deep throbs. It was as if Nature herself, in supreme anguish and abandonment, had cast herself prone on the earth, and her great heart had throbbed audibly, shaking the world with its beats. No more thunder followed, but the rain was coming down heavily now in huge drops that fell straight through the gloomy, windless air. In half a minute I was drenched to the skin; but for a short time the rain seemed an advantage, as the brightness of the falling water lessened the gloom, turning the air from dark to lighter grey. This subdued rain-light did not last long: I had not been twenty minutes in the wood before a second and greater darkness fell on the earth, accompanied by an even more copious downpour of water. The sun had evidently gone down, and the whole sky was now covered with one thick cloud. Becoming more nervous as the gloom increased, I bent my steps more to the south, so as to keep near the border and more open part of the wood. Probably I had already grown confused before deviating and turned the wrong way, for instead of finding the forest easier, it grew closer and more difficult as I advanced. Before many minutes the darkness so increased that I could no longer distinguish objects more than five feet from my eyes. Groping blindly along, I became entangled in a dense undergrowth, and after struggling and stumbling along for some distance in vain endeavours to get through it, I came to a stand at last in sheer despair. All sense of direction was now lost: I was entombed in thick blackness--blackness of night and cloud and rain and of dripping foliage and network of branches bound with bush ropes and creepers in a wild tangle. I had struggled into a hollow, or hole, as it were, in the midst of that mass of vegetation, where I could stand upright and turn round and round without touching anything; but when I put out my hands they came into contact with vines and bushes. To move from that spot seemed folly; yet how dreadful to remain there standing on the sodden earth, chilled with rain, in that awful blackness in which the only luminous thing one could look to see would be the eyes, shining with their own internal light, of some savage beast of prey! Yet the danger, the intense physical discomfort, and the anguish of looking forward to a whole night spent in that situation stung my heart less than the thought of Rima's anxiety and of the pain I had carelessly given by secretly leaving her.|$|R
5000|$|The {{new owners}} {{announced}} a [...] "Glypoteca, or Museum of Sculpture", displaying more than 180 works by leading sculptors. Instead of calico draperies [...] "which had {{the appearance of}} a tent hastily fitted up for some temporary purpose", the visitor was promised [...] " [...] a lofty dome, of several thousand feet of richly cut glass." [...] The frieze of the Glypoteca was decorated with a copy of the Panathenaic procession from the Parthenon, modelled by Mr Henning, Jr, above which were twenty allegorical fresco paintings by Mr. Absalom. The staircase leading up to the panorama was now disguised by a framework hung with [...] "handsome and classically disposed drapery". Around it were velvet-covered seats raised on a dais, separated by groups of Cupid and Psyche, bearing candelabra in the form of <b>palm</b> trees. The <b>lift,</b> described in the brochure as [...] "the Ascending Room capable of containing ten or twelve persons, which is raised by secret machinery" [...] was now was decorated in the Elizabethan style, and illuminated by stained glass windows.|$|R
