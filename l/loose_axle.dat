5000|$|Nantlle Tramway wagon, gauge 3 ft; steel: double-flanged wheels, <b>loose</b> on fixed <b>axles,</b> {{built by}} Glaslyn Foundry, Portmadoc. Line opened 1828 worked by horses {{until the final}} section was closed by British Railways in 1963, the last use of horses by BR. Given to Museum in 1958.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicles}} {{used were}} probably adapted road waggons and were about 13 ft long, with a wheelbase of 10 ft. The wheels were [...] in diameter with a 3 in tread, and were <b>loose</b> on the <b>axles.</b> The twelve-wheeled reference {{in the poem}} above means 'twelve waggons with wheels'.|$|R
50|$|Timber {{sleepers}} had {{an advantage}} over stone blocks in that they prevented the track from spreading, the gauges of some tramroads increased {{by a couple of}} inches after decades of horses passing up the middle, but being <b>loose</b> on the <b>axles</b> the wheels could usually be adjusted slightly with washers.|$|R
60|$|Half-way {{down the}} grade I felt, sir, a thrilling and creaking, Then a lurch to one side, as we {{hung on the}} bank of the cañon; Then, looking up the road, I saw, in the {{distance}} behind me, The off hind wheel of the coach just <b>loosed</b> from its <b>axle,</b> and following.|$|R

50|$|Several trams {{have been}} used over the years. That used in 1964 was built locally. It had a metal frame with a wooden floor lined with {{galvanised}} sheeting and wooden side planking, some {{of which could be}} lifted out by hand to make loading and unloading easier. The wheels were <b>loose</b> on their <b>axles,</b> which themselves were able to rotate. At that time four or five runs were made in a typical day, with considerable increases if building work was taking place when, for example, granite blocks and 20 ft scaffolding poles have been carried. The current tram has the general appearance of a trunk on wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{narrow gauge}} line {{was a form}} of wagonway {{constructed}} to a gauge of 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) and equipped with four wheeled wagons fitted with double-flanged wheels, which were <b>loose</b> on fixed <b>axles.</b> For many of their later years many wagons had extended axles which protruded beyond the wheels. Some wagons had eyes bolted to the tops of their sides to enable them to be lifted bodily by the Blondins used in some of the quarries. The wagons were owned by the tramway, rather than the quarries and the many that survived into BR ownership had narrow steel plate bodies, which were mounted between the wheels and bolted to the axles. Their shape and structure appears little changed from the railway's earliest years.|$|R
50|$|The tramway {{was built}} using old track {{materials}} from the Ffestiniog Railway. The track gauge was , as the wagons ran onto the Ffestiniog, although the track gauge above the mill was only nominally the same, as internal wagons had double flanged wheels which were <b>loose</b> on the <b>axles.</b> Operation of the Lake Incline was {{the responsibility of the}} Conglog Quarry, although after 21 years, ownership would transfer to the Cwmothin Quarry, who would make a payment for the drum and the rails. This appears to have happened, although it is not documented, as the three inclines on the Cwmorthin main line were all listed in a sale document from 1900. Cwmorthin Quarry was bought by Oakeley Quarry, after which they were connected underground, allowing it to be worked from the Oakeley side, and the absence of Oakeley men to operate the inclines was eventually resolved when Cadwaladr Roberts was given permission to operate them.|$|R
50|$|Construction began July 4, 1817, at Rome, New York. The first 15 mi, from Rome to Utica, {{opened in}} 1819. At that rate, the canal {{would not be}} {{finished}} for 30 years. The main delays were caused by felling trees to clear a path through virgin forest and moving excavated soil, which took longer than expected, but the builders devised ways to solve these problems. To fell a tree, they threw rope over the top branches and winched it down. They pulled out the stumps with an innovative stump puller. A pair of huge wheels were mounted <b>loose</b> on an <b>axle.</b> A large wheel, barely smaller than the others, was fixed {{to the center of}} the axle. A chain was wrapped around the axle and hooked to the stump. A rope was wrapped around the center wheel and hooked to a team of oxen. The mechanical advantage (torque) obtained ripped the stumps out of the soil. Soil to be moved was shoveled into large wheelbarrows that were dumped into mule-pulled carts. Using a scraper and a plow, a three-man team with oxen, horses, and mules could build a mile in a year.|$|R
5000|$|According to The Engineer of 1890:The Agenoria has upright {{cylinders}} working half-beams, {{thus reducing}} {{the stroke of}} the pistons to the cranks. The cylinders are 7 ½ in. diameter, with a stroke of 3 ft. There is a parallel motion to the piston-rod, and the feed pump is worked {{from one of the}} half-beams. The fire is within a large tubular boiler, branching into two tubes, with the chimney {{at the end of the}} boiler, the barrel of which is 10ft. long and 4ft. diameter. The excentrics for driving the slides are <b>loose</b> on the <b>axle,</b> with a clutch to drive either way, and there is hand gear to the valves to cause the axle to turn half round to bring the right clutch into action. The exhaust steam is discharged into the chimney, but it does not necessarily follow that it acted as a steam blast. Indeed, the great height given to the chimney can have no other object than to create the required draught. The driving wheels are 4 ft. diameter, and there are coupling rods to the front wheels, which are provided with springs.|$|R
