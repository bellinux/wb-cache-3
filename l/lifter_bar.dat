40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the path of a ball on the inside of a ball mill for lifter bars with rounded or worn profiles. The model predicts the response of a single ball with particular reference to the balls trajectory after departure from the <b>lifter</b> <b>bar</b> and incorporates the effect of friction, mill rotational speed, lifter height as well as different <b>lifter</b> <b>bar</b> profiles. The out of plane travel of the particles are ignored and hence the system is reduced to a two dimensional problem. A set of experiments were performed on a model perspex mill in order to obtain data by which the theory could be compared. The <b>lifter</b> <b>bar</b> is analysed using a parabolic expression which allows the shape to be changed to model various stages oflifter wear. Two possible formulations are investigated in determining the motion of the particle on the <b>lifter</b> <b>bar.</b> The first formulation assumes the ball to roll on the <b>lifter</b> <b>bar</b> until a limiting friction is reached after which the ball will slide along the lifter. The second formulation considers the ball to have a pure sliding motion on the lifter...|$|E
40|$|The {{grinding}} process in tumbling mills {{is complex and}} to include all phenomena that occur in a single numerical model is today not possi-ble. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study in which the deflection of a <b>lifter</b> <b>bar</b> in a pilot ball mill is measured by an embedded strain gauge sensor and compared to deflections predicted from finite ele-ment (FE) simulations. The flexible rubber lifter and the lining in a tumbling mill are modelled with the finite element method (FEM) and the grinding medium modelled with the distinct element method (DEM). The deflection profile obtained from DEM-FE simulation shows a reasonably good correspondence to pilot mill measurements. The approach presented here is a contribution to the validation of DEM-FE simulations and an introduction to the description of a bend-able rubber lifter implemented in a DEM-FEM mill model.

40|$|Increasing {{emphasis}} on productivity and quality control has provided an impetus to research on better methodologies for diagnosis, modelling, monitoring, control and optimisation of mineral process systems. One {{of the biggest}} challenges facing the research community is the processing of raw sensor data into meaningful information. Information that to some extent express quality parameters such as chemical assays, size distribution and other metallurgical variables in the different process streams. This thesis shows how multivariate statistical methods can be used with great advantage to model process data as well as robust sensor data. The modelling approach has been applied on a large process section, a cobbing plant, as well as a single unit operation, a tumbling mill. The knowledge of conditions inside a tumbling mill are of limited extent, due to a very harsh and wearing environment. A strain gauge sensor that measure the deflection of a <b>lifter</b> <b>bar</b> when it hits the charge inside a tumbling mill is studied for different operating conditions in a pilot scale ball mill. The deflection of the <b>lifter</b> <b>bar</b> during every mill revolution gives rise to a characteristic signal profile that is shown to contain information on both the charge position and grinding performance. The results presented for prediction of grinding performance suggest that the strain gauge signal in combination with wavelet transformation and multivariate data analysis provide promising means for monitoring and control of process fluctuations. The low prediction error achieved for grinding performance clearly highlights the importance of well-planned experimental strategy including experimental design, signal pre-processing, multivariate modelling and validation. Results also demonstrate that different operating conditions is well distinguishable from each other and by that the finding of proper operating regimes are highly feasible. Grinding parameters that are normally measured in the laboratory are now readily modelled from the on-line signal. As a consequence this opens new possibilities for real time monitoring and control of the grinding process. A further objective of this work is to link computational results to the experimental data obtained from the instrumented pilot ball mill. The approach taken is to simulate the behaviour of a rubber lifter when it is exposed to forces from the grinding load in a two-dimensional Distinct Element Method (DEM) mill model. Typically walls in a DEM model are made up of rigid bodies where the equations of motion are not satisfied for each individual wall - i. e., forces acting on a wall do not influence its motion. Here the instrumented rubber lifter is represented as an assembly of bonded particles rather than walls in order to simulate deflection. The deflection profile obtained from the DEM simulation shows a reasonably good correspondence to the pilot mill measurements. The difference is attributed to the fact that time-dependent behaviour of the rubber lifter is ignored, resulting in rapid relaxation of the lifter when the exerted force is released. Mill charge features such as toe and shoulder position of the charge are well marked. However, DEM prediction shows lower values compared to measurements which is most likely an effect of the two dimensional model used and the inability to model the effect of slurry present in the mill. The news value of the thesis work is in the method for analysing the signal profile as well as the experimental verification in both pilot and full scale operation. The result is a contribution to improved mill lifter design and continuous monitoring of the grinding process. Godkänd; 2005; 20061004 (ysko...|$|E
50|$|A trommel is {{composed}} of a slightly-inclined rotating metal tube (the 'scrubber section') with a screen at its discharge end. <b>Lifter</b> <b>bars,</b> sometimes {{in the form of}} bolted in angle iron, are attached to the interior of the scrubber section. The ore is fed into the elevated end of the trommel. Water, often under pressure, is provided to the scrubber and screen sections and the combination of water and mechanical action frees the valuable minerals from the ore. The mineral bearing ore that passes through the screen is then further concentrated in smaller devices such as sluices and jigs. The larger pieces of ore that do not pass through the screen can be carried to a waste stack by a conveyor.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mining {{and mineral}} {{processing}} demand wear-resistant machines and components, because the energies and masses of interacting bodies are significant. This paper {{is concerned with}} the wear mechanisms, which occur in grinding mills. Conditions of severe-impact wear and impact-abrasion, and wear behaviour of the <b>lifter</b> <b>bars</b> are studied. A hammer-mill type device, which can produce high-energy impacts, was used. The experiments were also carried out in conditions with abrasive particles present. The wear behaviour of several PM materials and a few reference materials were compared in certain wear conditions. Different material properties that influence the wear resistance were also studied. The microstructure and homogeneity of the materials were studied mainly with a scanning electron microscope. On the basis of the experimental results the studied materials were classified...|$|R
50|$|As {{the card}} was being read and {{positioned}} for printing, a ‘mechanical bail’ driven by large steel cams would raise 60 geared ‘lifter bars’ which engaged 60 ‘racks’ which engaged 60 ‘intermediate gears’, which drove 60 ‘print wheels’. (You {{can see the}} maintenance problem with 60 of just about everything). The <b>lifter</b> <b>bars</b> were then lowered under spring tension by the ‘mechanical bail’ {{in time with the}} reading of the punched card. Using the impulse from the ‘contact roll’ / ‘card brush’ / ‘wire contact relay’ circuitry, a ‘push rod’ would latch (stop) the individual ‘lifter bar’ on its downward motion with the character to be printed correctly positioned on the print wheel and facing 1 of 60 ‘print hammers’. An ‘alignment bail’ would then seat itself in between the teeth of the ‘print wheels’ to perform vertical alignment.|$|R

50|$|White {{cast iron}} {{displays}} white fractured surfaces {{due to the}} presence of an iron carbide precipitate called cementite. With a lower silicon content (graphitizing agent) and faster cooling rate, the carbon in white cast iron precipitates out of the melt as the metastable phase cementite, Fe3C, rather than graphite. The cementite which precipitates from the melt forms as relatively large particles. As the iron carbide precipitates out, it withdraws carbon from the original melt, moving the mixture toward one that is closer to eutectic, and the remaining phase is the lower iron-carbon austenite (which on cooling might transform to martensite). These eutectic carbides are much too large to provide the benefit of what is called precipitation hardening (as in some steels, where much smaller cementite precipitates might inhibit plastic deformation by impeding the movement of dislocations through the pure iron ferrite matrix). Rather, they increase the bulk hardness of the cast iron simply by virtue of their own very high hardness and their substantial volume fraction, such that the bulk hardness can be approximated by a rule of mixtures. In any case, they offer hardness at the expense of toughness. Since carbide makes up a large fraction of the material, white cast iron could reasonably be classified as a cermet. White iron is too brittle for use in many structural components, but with good hardness and abrasion resistance and relatively low cost, it finds use in such applications as the wear surfaces (impeller and volute) of slurry pumps, shell liners and <b>lifter</b> <b>bars</b> in ball mills and autogenous grinding mills, balls and rings in coal pulverisers, and the teeth of a backhoe's digging bucket (although cast medium-carbon martensitic steel is more common for this application).|$|R
5000|$|The snatch is {{the first}} of two lifts contested in the sport of weightlifting (also known as Olympic weightlifting) {{followed}} by the clean and jerk. The objective of the snatch is to lift the barbell from the ground to overhead in one continuous motion. There are four main styles of snatch used: squat snatch (or full snatch), split snatch, power snatch, and muscle snatch. The squat snatch and split snatch are the most common styles used in competition while power snatch and muscle snatch are mostly used for training purposes. In the squat snatch, the <b>lifter</b> lifts the <b>bar</b> as high as possible and pulls themselves under it in a squat position, receiving the bar overhead with the arms straight, decreasing the necessary height of the bar, therefore increasing the amount of weight that the lifter may successfully lift. In the split snatch, the <b>lifter</b> lifts the <b>bar</b> as high as possible and pulls themselves under the bar similar to the squat snatch but in the split snatch the lifter [...] "splits" [...] his legs, placing {{one foot in front of}} them and one behind, allowing themselves to receive the bar lower as in the squat snatch. The split snatch has become much less common with the increased popularity of the squat snatch but is occasionally performed by some lifters. In the power snatch, the lifter lifts the barbell as high as possible and receives the bar overhead with only a slight bend in the knee and hip, increasing the height that the bar must be lifted and decreasing the amount of weight that may be successfully lifted. In the muscle snatch, the <b>lifter</b> lifts the <b>bar</b> all the way overhead with arms locked out and the hip and knee fully extended.|$|R
50|$|In {{the clean}} movement, {{after taking a}} big breath and setting the back, the <b>lifter</b> jumps the <b>bar</b> up through triple {{extension}} (in very quick succession) of the hips, knees and then ankles. When the legs have driven the bar as high as possible, the lifter pulls under the bar by violently shrugging (contracting) the trapezius muscles of the upper back ("traps") dropping into a deep squat position and spinning the hands around the bar so the elbows are extended in front.|$|R
40|$|Tumbling mills are {{characterized}} by a flowing granular mixture comprising slurry, ore and grinding media. Akin to fluid flow, a rheological description underpinning granular flow has long been expected and pursued by many researchers. Unfortunately, no single theory has hitherto been able to successfully describe all the peculiar features and flow phases of granular systems. Tumbling mills exhibit a rich coexistence of all known flow phases and {{is arguably the most}} complicated of the granular flow geometries. Not surprisingly, current comminution models are almost entirely empirical with limited predictive capability beyond their window of design. Using Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) data we recover the key ingredients (velocity, shear rate, volume concentration, bed depth) for developing, testing and calibrating granular flow models. In this regard, 5 mm and 8 mm glass beads are rotated within a 476 mm diameter mill, fitted with angled <b>lifter</b> <b>bars</b> along the inner azimuthal walls and operated in batch mode across a range of drum rotation speeds that span cascading and cataracting Froude regimes. After averaging the PEPT outputs into representative volume elements, subsequent continuum analysis of the flowing layer revealed a rich coexistence of flow regimes - (i) quasi-static, (ii) dense (liquid-like), and (iii) inertial - that are consistent with the measured volume concentrations spanning these regimes in rotating drums. Appropriately matched constitutive choices for the shear stresses then facilitated the derivation of a new granular rheology that is able to (smoothly) capture all phases of the tumbling mill flow at transition points that match leading experimental findings reported in the literature. Limiting our models to athermal boundary conditions, we then derive the power density for better understanding of flow dissipation that ultimately drives the comminution purpose of tumbling mills. The rheology and power density models were then applied to the 5 mm and 8 mm glass bead data to reveal that shear power density is an order of magnitude larger than the normal component. Notwithstanding, the effective friction coefficient - which is akin to viscosity in typical fluids - remains relatively constant across most of the flowing layer with notable exponential growth across the interface from dense-to-inertial that continued into the inertial regime...|$|R
50|$|To {{execute the}} exercise, the lifter lies {{flat on the}} ground under a fixed bar (such as a Smith machine set at chest height). The <b>lifter</b> holds the <b>bar</b> with an {{overhand}} grip, straight arms, straight body, upper body hanging with heels on the ground close together. The lifter pulls the chest toward the bar until it touches, before returning to the starting position under control. Good form means that the body is kept straight throughout the movement.

5000|$|The {{second phase}} of the pull, or [...] "preliminary acceleration" [...] begins with the weight {{separated}} from the floor. In the second phase, the lifter begins by extending the knee and moving the hip upward while maintaining a constant back angle relative to the floor. [...] During this phase, the <b>lifter</b> pulls the <b>bar</b> closer to his body and the center of gravity of the lifter shifts toward the heel. During this phase, the lifter begins to accelerate the bar and {{towards the end of the}} phase, the torso begins to assume a more vertical position.|$|R
40|$|Mining mill linings are {{continuously}} {{exposed to}} wear {{induced by the}} charge, and thus, mill operation has to be interrupted {{on a regular basis}} for inspections. Stoppages due to inspections and replacement of linings lead to large production and monetary losses; especially in case of unplanned corrective maintenance. Condition monitoring during mill operation can assist in the maintenance planning and decision process to increase the availability and the overall performance of the material processing. In this pilot study, the feasibility of using waterflow ultrasonics for condition monitoring of the lining of mining mills during operation is to be investigated. The proposed waterflow ultrasonic technique uses a water beam to transmit the ultrasound to the mill shell and lining. By measuring the time of flight (TOF), it can be possible to monitor the thickness of mill linings, without the need of interrupting operation. The method can lead to significant energy and monetary savings by reducing inspections and corrective maintenance stoppages, and possibly increase product quality by optimised performance. Since steel has a very high acoustic impedance in comparison to rubber, TOF measurements on aluminium-rubber has been used as an intermediate step towards the goal of measuring steel-rubber combinations. TOF measurements of aluminium-rubber layers have been achieved, and advancement towards the understanding of TOF measurements in steel-rubber laysers have been achieved. The following conclusions have been reached:- Rubber thickness can be measured through aluminium. In practice, aluminium plugs/rivets can be mounted on the steel shell of a mill to measure TOF of rubber shell plates and <b>lifter</b> <b>bars.</b> - Ultrasound signals can be measured through steel-rubber layers in through-transmission and pitch-catch set-ups. - Ultrasound signals measured in pulse-echo or pitch-catch set-up on a solid steel plate connected to rubber, give rise to reverberations (ringing signal) that mask the rubber backwall echoes. For avoiding reverberations of steel plate sides, an experimental set-up requires the steel plate to be at least eight times wider and deeper (x- and y-axis) than the thickness (z-axis) of the rubber under inspection.
