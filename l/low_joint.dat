40|$|Analysis of a {{population}} of dilational faults within a densely welded ignimbrite layer reveals fault zone geometries that vary greatly within a single fault and between faults, but does not correlate with displacement. Within an individual fault {{the thickness of the}} fault core can differ by up to an order of magnitude along dip. Similarly, joint density adjacent to faults varies along fault dip but does not increase with displacement. A correlation does exist however, between joint density and the degree of ignimbrite welding, which can vary vertically within an ignimbrite layer. Previous work has shown that welding increases ignimbrite strength: non-welded ignimbrites form deformation bands and densely welded ignimbrites form discrete fractures. We observe zones of densely welded ignimbrite with high joint density, while less-welded zones have lower joint density. In turn, high joint densities correlate with narrow fault cores and <b>low</b> <b>joint</b> densities with wide fault cores. We propose a joint based model for dilational fault initiation and growth. Faults initiate on precursory joints and grow by entraining joint bound slabs, hence the correlation between high and <b>low</b> <b>joint</b> density (thin and thick slabs) and narrow and wide fault cores respectively. Ultimately joint density and consequently fault zone architecture are controlled by subtle variations in mechanical strength within the ignimbrite layer...|$|E

In order to process this information and to extract all possible knowledge, machine learning techniques become necessary. Here we present a new methodology to automatically discover unknown variable objects in large astronomical catalogs. With the aim of taking full advantage of all information we have about known objects, our method is based on a supervised algorithm. In particular, we train a random forest classifier using known variability classes of objects and obtain votes for each of the objects in the training set. We then model this voting distribution with a Bayesian network and obtain the joint voting distribution among the training objects. Consequently, an unknown object is considered as an outlier insofar it has a <b>low</b> <b>joint</b> probability. By leaving out one of the classes on the training set we perform a validity test and show that when the random forest classifier attempts to classify unknown light-curves (the class left out), it votes with an unusual distribution among the classes.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of general {{principles}} of person transfer techniques specifically on the <b>low</b> back <b>joint</b> extension moment. These effects were examined by the following measurable quantitative parameters: 1) trunk bending angle, 2) knee flexion angle, 3) distance between the centers of gravity (COGs) of the caregiver and patient, representing the distance between the caregiver and patient, and 4) the vertical component of the ground reaction force representing the amount of the weight-bearing load on the caregiver’ s low back during transfers with and without assistive devices. Twenty students each took the role of caregiver, and one healthy adult simulated a patient. The participants performed three different transfer tasks: without any assistive device, with the patient wearing a low back belt, and with the caregiver using a transfer board. We found that the distance between the COGs and the vertical component of the ground reaction force, but not the trunk bending and knee flexion angles, were the variables that affected the <b>low</b> back <b>joint</b> extension moment. Our results suggest that the general principle of decreasing the distance between COGs is most effective for decreasing the <b>low</b> back <b>joint</b> extension moment during transfers under all conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Continuum or hyper-redundant robots are robots which exhibit {{behavior}} {{similar to}} biological trunks, tentacles and snakes. Unlike traditional robots, continuum robot manipulators {{do not have}} rigid joints, hence the manipulators are compliant, extremely dexterous, and capable of dynamic, adaptive manipulation in unstructured environments; however, the development of high-performance control algorithms for these manipulators is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present an approach to whole arm grasping control for continuum robots. The grasping controller is developed in two stages; high level path planning for the grasping objective, and a <b>low</b> level <b>joint</b> controller using a neural network feedforward component to compensate for dynamic uncertainties. These techniques are used to enable whole arm grasping without using contact force measurements and without using a dynamic model of the continuum robot.

Two important properties that govern the shear behaviour and dilatancy behaviour of discontinuities have been analysed in this paper by the discrete element method (DEM). The ability of a frictional joint to suppress fracture growth decreases as the frictional resistance increases; however, the rate and extent of fracturing increases with joint dilatancy. The influence of joint frictional resistance is more dominant at high values and in this range effects of small magnitudes of dilatancy are correspondingly insignificant.
