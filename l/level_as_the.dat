5|$|Built in 2000, {{the main}} Trinity Road Stand {{is the most}} {{recently}} completed at Villa Park and houses the dressing rooms, club offices and director's boxes. The stand is composed of three tiers with a row of executive boxes between {{the second and third}} tiers. Although much larger than the other stands, the stand has roughly the same roof <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> other three sides. The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match {{are in the middle of}} the stand at pitch level. The press and the directors' VIP area are situated in the centre of the middle tier. The upper tiers of the stand extend over Trinity Road, the street that cuts behind the ground. Trinity Road passes through a tunnel formed by the Trinity Road Stand.|$|E

5|$|Despite Arsenal being {{reduced to}} 10 men, the scores {{remained}} <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> game went into its final minute, when Diego Forlán went to {{ground in the}} penalty area under a challenge from Arsenal defender Martin Keown while trying to reach a Gary Neville cross. The referee deemed this a foul and awarded a penalty. Van Nistelrooy stepped up to take the penalty, despite having missed his previous two penalties for Manchester United. Lehmann tried to put him off by moving {{from side to side}} along the goal line, and it appeared to work: the shot hit the bar and rebounded back into play, and the Dutchman was immediately confronted by Keown. Within a minute, the final whistle blew and the match finished as a goalless draw.|$|E
5|$|During the Red River Campaign Osage was {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Commander Thomas O. Selfridge, Jr. She {{participated in the}} capture of Fort DeRussy on 14 March 1864, shortly after {{the beginning of the}} campaign. She successfully defended the navy transports attacked during the Battle of Blair's Landing on 12 April, driving off the Confederate forces with heavy losses. After the end of the campaign in May she was assigned to patrol the Mississippi River. During that month she grounded on a sandbar near Helena, Arkansas and could not be refloated even when some of her armor was removed due to the rapidly falling water <b>level.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> water receded Osage began to hog at the ends because only her middle was supported by the sand. This caused her longitudinal bulkheads to split and broke many rivets in her hull and on her deck. She was repaired in place before being refloated at the end of November.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 {{the club}} {{moved to the}} Portway Stadium, {{situated}} in the Portway Industrial Estate on the western outskirts of the town. Built {{at a cost of}} £850,000, the ground has a main stand of brick and concrete construction with bench seating for around 250 people. This stand is set on a bank running along the entire south side of the ground, giving spectators on that side an elevated view of the pitch. The managers' benches are set into this banking in front of the stand at pitch level. The banking slopes down behind each goal until it reaches the same <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> pitch along the north side. There is hard standing around the entire perimeter of pitch, along with a turnstile block and a gate opening out onto the stadium car park for ambulance access.|$|E
5|$|Late glacial tool finds {{from the}} Upper Palaeolithic date to c.12,000BP: flint blades known as Cheddar points; smaller bladelets known as Cresswell points; scrapers; burins or lithic flakes; flint and bone awls; and a bone needle. Flint rarely occurs in Wales {{other than in}} drifts, or as small pebbles on beaches. Flint tools would {{therefore}} have to {{have been brought to}} Gower from other areas, such as those now known as southern or eastern England, or Antrim, either as finished tools or as incomplete, or unworked, nodules. Remains of red fox, Arctic fox, brown bear, tundra vole, and possibly reindeer, were found at the same <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Upper Palaeolithic tools, providing evidence of the climate c.12,000BP. Other animal remains excavated during the 19th century, which may predate the Late glacial finds, include mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, red deer and giant deer.|$|E

5|$|Male {{cocks-of-the-rock}} are polygamous, {{and have}} nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male’s energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where males gather to challenge rivals and beckon the females. The males are easily disturbed, so their behavior is not easy to see. One study reported that the display activity is dependent on light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during the same light intensity <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> afternoon period.|$|E
5|$|The British and Germans {{had been}} {{competing}} in radar technology {{for nearly a}} decade at this point, with the German technology often at the same <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> British or surpassing them due to heavy investment in the fledgling technology. By the beginning of World War II, Britain had devised effective radar systems, primarily through the work of Robert Watson-Watt, although much of the technology was still rudimentary in nature and Watson-Watt and other scientists had failed to devise an effective night-defence system in time for the German nighttime bombing of Britain during 1940.|$|E
5|$|The ba of a god {{was said}} to {{periodically}} leave the divine realm to dwell in the images of that god. By inhabiting these images, the gods left their concealed state and took on a physical form. To the Egyptians, a place or object that was ḏsr—"sacred"—was isolated and ritually pure, and thus fit for a god to inhabit. Temple statues and reliefs, as well as particular sacred animals, like the Apis bull, served as divine intermediaries in this way. Dreams and trances provided a very different venue for interaction. In these states, it was believed, people could {{come close to the}} gods and sometimes receive messages from them. Finally, according to Egyptian afterlife beliefs, human souls pass into the divine realm after death. The Egyptians therefore believed that in death they would exist on the same <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> gods and fully understand their mysterious nature.|$|E

5|$|The main {{judicial}} {{officers were}} the Barons of the Exchequer, or barones scaccari, who were originally the same judges {{as those of}} the Court of King's Bench, only becoming independent positions after the Exchequer's separation from the curia regis. In {{the early years of the}} Exchequer's existence, the Barons were the chief auditors of the accounts of England, a role passed to dedicated auditors during the reign of Edward II. With the Exchequer's expansion during the Tudor era, the Barons became more important; where previously only the Chief Baron had been appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, with the other Barons mere barristers, it became practice for all Barons of the Exchequer to be Serjeants. This further increased the Exchequer's standing, since for the first time it put the Exchequer at the same <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Court of Common Pleas and Court of King's Bench, where all judges were already required to be Serjeants.|$|E
5|$|The maxilla (upper jaw) {{is known}} only for A.donovani. In these fossils, the back {{margin of the}} incisive foramen (an opening in the palate) is about at the same <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> front of M1, and the back margin of the {{zygomatic}} plate (a bony plate {{at the side of}} the skull, connected to the zygomatic arch) is also close to the front of M1. Mandibles (lower jaws) of both species are known. The mental foramen (an opening in the front of the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side of the bone, except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular process—a raising in the bone that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side of the bone that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards the front and reach to a point below the front of m1.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} located in the {{residential}} area of Mortensrud, in Søndre Nordstrand. Mortensrud is an open station without any barriers and free access from the bus stops. The station area is one storey below from the surrounding area. It has step-free access, and at the same <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> buses. Only the western portion of the two side platforms is in use, where direct connection can be made with buses. The station is located adjacent to the shopping center at Mortensrud. The station is designed by Arkitektskap. It is built in concrete, covered in red brick, steel, natural rock and wood, that will allow lianas to grow on them. The roofover the western platform is curved, and made of wood and glass. There is an underground parking lot in two levels.|$|E

At its debut in the United Kingdom, it performed poorly, reaching only #38 in the charts. According to Xseed, the game's sales in North America were favorable, although they were not on the same <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>The</b> Last Story.

5|$|Velites did {{not form}} their own units; {{a number of them}} were {{attached}} to each maniple of hastati, principes and triarii. They were typically used as a screening force, driving off enemy skirmishers and disrupting enemy formations with javelin throws before retiring behind the lines to allow the heavier-armed hastati to attack. They were normally the ones who engaged war elephants and chariots if they were present on the field, such as in the Battle of Zama, in 202 BC. Their high mobility and ranged weaponry made them much more effective against these enemies than heavy infantry. An early Roman legion contained approximately 1,000 velites. Velites were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms. Lucilius suggests that rorarii and velites were interchangeable, with velites gradually superseding rorarii. Another theory is that the leves equipment was upgraded until they were at the same <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> rorarii, and they both collectively became known as the velites.|$|E
5|$|In the 1974 Daytona 200, after early leader Gary Nixon retired, Roberts battled for {{the lead}} with former 500cc world champion, Giacomo Agostini before an {{overheated}} engine forced him to settle for second place. In April 1974, Roberts ventured to Europe {{for the first time}} to compete in the prestigious mola 200 road race for 750cc motorcycles. He made a positive impression competing against the best road racers in the world, once again finishing second to Agostini. He then traveled to England with a team of American riders to compete against a British riding team in the 1974 Transatlantic Match races. The conventional wisdom at the time was that American riders, who competed mostly in dirt track races, could not race on asphalt at the same <b>level</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> British riders, who specialized in road racing events. Roberts dispelled any such notions by winning three of the six races and finishing second in the remaining three races. Roberts was the top individual points scorer in the event with 93 points, five more than Barry Sheene, the top British rider.|$|E
