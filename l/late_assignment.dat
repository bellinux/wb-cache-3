50|$|Attribution theory {{predicts that}} actors tend to {{attribute}} their actions to situational factors while observers tend to attribute the same actions to dispositional factors. For example, attribution theory predicts {{that a student}} who turns in a <b>late</b> <b>assignment</b> may explain to the professor that the tardiness is uncharacteristic and due to a situational factor like an unusual computer problem while the professor might believe the tardiness was due instead to a dispositional factor like the student’s laziness. In {{the context of the}} third-person effect hypothesis, then, attribution theory explains why a person may think that he or she understands the underlying persuasive aspects of the message while others’ dispositional flaws prevent them from perceiving those same aspects.|$|E
40|$|Assignments {{can play}} a pivotal role for {{students}} securing higher marks. Each assignment has its due date for submission and missing this date without permission would require a penalty. Significant amounts {{of time and money}} are spent during the process of getting and granting permission, and verifying the approval of <b>late</b> <b>assignment</b> submitter. This study analyses three research questions: (1) Are the students who are seeking permission for late submission really motivated by the objective of securing higher mark?; (2) Does gender type of students play any role for late submission and for securing higher mark?; and (3) Does age group of students play any role for late submission and for securing higher marks? On the basis of an in-depth analysis of assignments and final examination marks of on-campus students for one of the courses at one of the Australian Universities, we concluded the following. Firstly, <b>late</b> <b>assignment</b> submitters were indicator of poor students in terms of performance. Secondly, the gender type did not play any role for ‘on-time ’ and ‘late ’ assignment submissions and mark achievement. Thirdly, the highest percentage (66. 7 %) of <b>late</b> <b>assignment</b> submitters was from the age group 20 - 25. Surprisingly, 100 percent of the dropped-out students among the late-submitters were from this age group. This could be due to several reasons but without further investigation, we could not determine the exact reason. Finally, the age group 20 - 25 was marginally poor in assignment performance but in the final examination they became marginally better than other age groups as the poorest students of that age group had already been dropped-out...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown by Lacey et al. (1985) that, in general, the {{hydrophobicity}} ranking of an amino acid correlates with that of its anticodonic nucleotide, with tryptophan {{being one of the}} four amino acids for which this rule does not apply. It was proposed that this failure to correlate was {{due to the fact that}} the anticodon assignments for the four amino acids were made late, after the mutation of existing tRNAs. In this paper, the evolution of E. coli tRNA(Trp) is examined by comparing its homology with other E. coli tRNAs. The results demonstrate the presence of an evolutionary relationship between E. coli tRNA(Trp) and tRNA(Gly) or tRNA(Arg) molecules, and support the idea of the <b>late</b> <b>assignment</b> of anticodon to Trp...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} optimal points {{of time for}} task assignment in dynamic load balancing schemes. Normally final assignment of tasks to server queues is made at the latest possible time. The main reason for a <b>late</b> <b>assignment</b> is, that a dynamic load balancer can use most recent information about system and application state for the decision. In general however, assignment can be done at task arrival time, {{at the moment when}} a processor or server becomes idle, or when significant load changes in the system occur. We will elaborate preconditions and circumstances for situations, where it is advantageous to assign tasks earlier than necessary, i. e. to queue them at the servers. We verify the results in an experimental load balancing environment.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an account of}} how Minimalist derivation (Chomsky 1995) can be embedded in a comprehension model, the <b>Late</b> <b>Assignment</b> of Syntax Theory (LAST) (Townsend & Bever, 2001). The issues addressed concern the interface between {{the first step of}} the model, in which heuristic strategies apply to the utterance, and the second step, Minimalist derivation. Two questions about the interface are addressed: 1) How are features in the numeration needed to begin a Minimalist derivation chosen? 2) What dictates which units Merge in the derivation? Chomsky (1995 : 226 - 227) claims that we do not need to ask either question. I review his reasons and argue that we can and should answer these questions in a workable comprehension model. In response to the first question, I demonstrate that heuristic strategies applied to the utterance determine which features enter the numeration. In response to the second question, I discuss how heuristic strategies combined with lexical information determine which items Merge...|$|E
40|$|The {{attraction}} of the well-structured arguments of the mental syntactic processing device (parser) in Chomsky’s theory {{has led to an}} overemphasis on syntactic processing to the exclusion of semantic and other processing in the initial sentence processing stage (Frazier & Clifton, 1996; Gibson & Hickok, 1993; Pickering & van Gompel, 2006). The current thesis joins some others (Green & Mitchell, 2006; MacDonald et al., 1994; Townsend & Bever, 2001, etc.), investigating the timecourse of the information processing of sentences. The first interest centres on ambiguous sentence resolution. Crosslinguistic studies have shown different resolutions in processing the relative clause (RC) attachment as in “the servant of the actress who was on the balcony” (Cuetos & Mitchell, 1988). Three studies confirmed that there is an NP-low preference in Chinese; however, this effect was delayed in comparison to its English counterparts. The NP-low preference can be explained by syntax-first, syntax parallel, and syntax later theories. However, the delay effect questions the traditional syntax-first theories. This leads to the second investigation of direct comparison of the timecourse of syntactic and semantic processing using anomalous materials in English and Chinese. Two experiments have confirmed that the syntactic anomaly is recognised later than semantic anomaly in both languages. The empirical investigation in the current thesis used various methodologies, including self-paced reading, a questionnaire, and eye-tracking studies, where the design of materials strictly followed linguistic principles. All the results support the <b>late</b> <b>assignment</b> of syntax theory (LAST) (Townsend & Bever, 2001). In fact, LAST can explain most of the evidence for syntax-first and syntax-parallel theories, and it is in line with the latest development of the linguistic UG theories (the Minimalist Programme) ...|$|E
