In 1966 (without energy-absorption), the average passenger car <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> assembly weighed 9. 94 lbs.

40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in partial ful lment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Engineering. Johannesburg, May 2014 Race vehicles depend mainly on passive safety systems, such as the steel collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> investigated in this report. There is no existing literature that investigates alternate impact testing methods that meet the F ed eration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) requirements. In this study, the <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> were statically crushed to determine the e ect of residual stresses. The <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> were observed to collapse on themselves, as the top surface deformed, the 90 bends unfolded, and the 50 bends folded further on the side supports. The reduced residual stresses in the 90 bends after stress relief annealing, resulted in a strengthening e ect and therefore a larger bending moment was required to unfold the bend. The residual stresses did not greatly a ect the overall strength and energy absorption characteristics of the <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> because the deformation of the 90 bends only contributed a small percentage towards the energy absorption ability of the <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> In conclusion, zero residual stresses in cold bent steel plates are desired if the plate is being unfolded as the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> collapses, however residual stresses can be useful if the plate is being bent further. The quasi-static approximation {{has been reported to}} be suitable if the impact mass is much larger than the impact structure. The quasi-static approximation was used to calculate the acceleration-time history of each tested specimen from the static compression tests. Numerical simulation of the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> impact test illustrated that the impact mass and <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> experienced a series of high frequency collisions. This phenomenon was due to the momentum transfer between the impact mass and <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> i. e. the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> locally accelerated away from the impact mass, it then slowed down as the energy was absorbed which allowed the impact mass to again collide with the <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> The numerical simulation and experimental results showed good correlation after having been digitally ltered using a low pass digital lter with a cuto frequency of 1000 Hz as per Le Mans regulations. The quasi-static approximation was found to give excellent agreement with the digitally ltered results, however due to its nature it could not replicate the high speed oscillatory behaviour. In conclusion, the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> under investigation was found to be inertia sensitive, and the quasi-static approximation may only be used to evaluate the energy absorption characteristics of the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> on its own according to the FIA requirements...|$|R

40|$|Several {{parts of}} {{automotive}} <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> are fixed by both dimensional interference and mechanical-plastic sticking of one part to another. To determine {{the effect of}} these fixing procedures on the joints of <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> pull-out tests were performed. Samples with and without sticking were tested. The influence of the sticking and interference procedures on the integrity of the <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> was experimentally determined by force-distance curves. The results suggested that the sticking increases more than twice the pull-out force and augments about 24 % the absorbed energy in the whole pull-out process. Statistical fitting tests show that pull-out forces obey a log-normal distribution. From these data were possible to estimate the structural reliability of joints of <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> which results indicate that the fail probability is close to zero for a minimum pull-out force of 2000 N. This work allows for knowing the importance of the sticking procedure in the fixation of automotive pieces, and establishing new standards for the assembly of <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> in mechanical and statistical basis...|$|R

50|$|The {{steering}} wheels were rigid and mounted on non-collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>columns.</b> This arrangement increased {{the risk of}} impaling the driver {{in case of a}} severe crash. The first collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> was invented in 1934 but was never successfully marketed. By 1956, Ford came out with a safety steering wheel that was set high above the post with spokes that would flex, but the column was still rigid. In 1968, United States regulations (FMVSS Standard No. 204) were implemented concerning the acceptable rearward movement of the steering wheel in case of crash. Collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> were required to meet that standard.|$|R

Most modern vehicle steering boxes/racks are mounted behind the front axle on the front bulkhead, at the rear of the front crumple zone.|$|R
