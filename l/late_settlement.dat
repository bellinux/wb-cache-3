The rest of the island consists of rivers, canals, and railroads. Popanilla was surprised when he was informed that Hubbabub did not contain more than five millions of inhabitants; but his surprise was decreased when their journey occasionally lay through tracts of streets, consisting often of capacious mansions entirely tenantless. On seeking an explanation of this seeming desolation, he was told that the Hubbabubians were possessed by a frenzy of always moving on, westward; and that consequently great quarters of the city are perpetually deserted. Even as Skindeep was speaking their passage was stopped by a large caravan of carriages and wagons heavily laden with human creatures and their children and chattels. On Skindeep inquiring the cause of this great movement, he was informed by one on horseback, who seemed to be the leader of the horde, that they were the late dwellers in sundry squares and streets situated far to the east; that their houses having been ridiculed by an itinerant balladeer, the female part of the tribe had insisted upon immediately quitting their unfashionable fatherland; and that now, after three days' journey, they had succeeded in reaching the <b>late</b> <b>settlement</b> of a horde who had migrated to the extreme west.|$|E

5000|$|These dialect regions differ {{mostly in}} their sound systems (see below), {{but also in}} {{vocabulary}} (including basic vocabulary, non-basic vocabulary, and grammatical words) and grammar. The North-central and Central regional varieties, which have {{a significant amount of}} vocabulary differences, are generally less mutually intelligible to Northern and Southern speakers. There is less internal variation within the Southern region than the other regions due to its relatively <b>late</b> <b>settlement</b> by Vietnamese speakers (in around the end of the 15th century). The North-central region is particularly conservative; its pronunciation has diverged less from Vietnamese orthography than the other varieties, which tend to merge certain sounds. Along the coastal areas, regional variation has been neutralized to a certain extent, while more mountainous regions preserve more variation. As for sociolinguistic attitudes, the North-central varieties are often felt to be [...] "peculiar" [...] or [...] "difficult to understand" [...] by speakers of other dialects, ironically despite the fact that their pronunciation fits the written language the most closely; this is typically because of various words in their vocabulary which are unfamiliar to other speakers (see the example vocabulary table below).|$|E

40|$|A {{retrospective}} analysis of insurance data {{was made of}} 600 individuals claiming compensation for whiplash following motor vehicle accidents. Three hundred randomly selected claimants who had settled their injury claims within 9 months of the accident were compared with 300 who had settled more than 24 months after the accident. We compared the two groups to identify possible risk factors for prolonged recovery, for which settlement time greater than 24 months was a marker. Variables considered included demographic factors, type of collision, degree of vehicle damage, workers compensation, prior claim or neck disability, treatment and time to settlement. Consulting a solicitor {{was associated with a}} highly significant, four-fold increase of <b>late</b> <b>settlement</b> of the claim. A concurrent workers' compensation claim, prior neck disability and undergoing physiotherapy or chiropractic treatment were weakly associated with <b>late</b> <b>settlement.</b> The degree of damage to the vehicle (as indicated by cost of repairs) was not a significant predictor of <b>late</b> <b>settlement.</b> <b>Late</b> <b>settlement</b> may be the direct effect of legal intervention, independent of the severity of the injury. Whilst the financial benefit to the claimant of consulting a solicitor is apparent, the benefit of prolonged disability is not.

40|$|Este trabalho propõe-se analisar a evolução demográfica da ilha de São Vicente, desde o seu descobrimento até 1950. A análise é complementada pelo estudo da natalidade e mortalidade desta ilha que, à semelhança do resto do arquipélago, foi marcada histórica e demograficamente por cíclicas crises de mortalidade e uma elevada natalidade. As particularidades da ilha prendem-se com o seu povoamento tardio e com a sua ligação ao Porto Grande que lhe deu uma dinâmica diferente do resto do país. A pesquisa foi desenvolvida nos arquivos da Conservatória do Registo Civil de São Vicente e da Câmara Municipal de São Vicente.

40|$|The article {{raises the}} problem of {{identifying}} regional and dialect words in the Russian language of the XVIII century. In this regard, the principles and methods for establishing geographically limited lexical means of the historical period are studied. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the method of reconstruction of the original state of the secondary dialect, which was deeply developed by V. V. Palagina. Considering the provisions of theTomskscientist {{and a number of other}} researchers the author offers his own interpretation of some methods in identifying regional words in colloquial idioms, functioning in the territory of a <b>late</b> <b>settlement.</b> The article emphasizes the importance of respecting the research principle of historicism, i. e. regularly taking into account vocabulary’s historical dynamics, which determines the change of status of the all-Russian as well as regional words. The nature of the secondary dialectisms in the dialects ofEastern Siberiais described more in detail. The colloquial vocabulary, which is presented in the Transbaikalian’s written business language of the XVIII-th c., is regarded due to application of principles of the complex identification of regional and dialect words. It was revealed that it contains genetically heterogeneous groups of regionalisms. In this connection, the lexical-semantic groups of words are determined, among which two types of regionalisms exist: a) regionalisms of northern Russian origin and b) regionalisms - local (autochthonous) loan words. </p...|$|E
40|$|Europe {{is a small}} continent, {{which extends}} at middle to high latitudes, well outside the tropics where primates, {{including}} most past hominins, evolved and currently live. Furthermore, it {{is located at the}} westernmost end of Asia, rather resembling a peninsular area of this huge continent. Notwithstanding the geographic handicaps and apparent marginality, Europe has a rich and complex Palaeolithic record, extending over one million years. It has also been investigated ever since the XIXth century, when was first started the scientific study of humankind’s remote past. We discuss below how it is that Europe has, again all odds, much to add to the understanding of human evolution, adaptations, dispersals and social developments. Three case studies are discussed: the earliest peopling of Europe and adaptation to extra-tropical environments; the <b>late</b> <b>settlement</b> of Anatomically Modern Humans; and the recolonisation of abandoned areas after the Late Glacial Maximum. The overall conclusions are that the rather extreme environmental and geographical characteristics of Europe fostered the development of technological and cognitive capabilities, also promoting changes in social organization within Pleistocene human groups, who had to adapt to an environment which was indeed rich in resources, but also quite demanding. The Palaeolithic record of Europe is as a yardstick allowing to gauge such developments. Accordingly, in this marginal part of the globe there is exceptional testimony of cultural traditions which have disappeared, illustration of significant stages in human history; outstanding examples of traditional human settlement. Those are all aspects of the human record that are fully highlighted by the criteria established in the World Heritage Convention...|$|E

40|$|Taken from PrefaceIt is the {{intention}} of this thesis to examine <b>late</b> <b>settlement</b> on the wastes of former royal hunting forests in Yorkshire. Three forests only were selected for study in detail; those of Bowland, Knaresborough, and Pickering, but they were well spaced across the former county of Yorkshire with their extremities extending virtually from coast to coast. Although their origins were diverse, and they show considerable differences, they were chosen largely on account of their unifying characteristic - {{the fact that all}} became part eventually of the Duchy of Lancaster. This is of some importance since it conveys uniformity to a principal source of information - the lists of those fined at the forest courts for illegal encroachment on the forest wastes. It was, in fact, the principal means of colonisation ' in the 16 th and 17 th centuries, and the existence of many such lists at the Public Record Office - most particularly for the Forest of Knaresborough - constitutes a hitherto untapped source, for this Forest at least. It is clear that lists of names are of little use unless they can be related to particular places, and this information is never given explicitly. A large part of the research was therefore concerned with correlation of different sources with this end in view. In the process, it was discovered that other civil sources, too, were capable of revealing more about the geographical location of individuals than they are normally given credit for, particularly when used in conjunction with parish registers by utilising the technique of family reconstitution...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of sediment cores from Lake Temae utilizing pollen, accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and charcoal particle counts was undertaken to assess landscape transformation following Polynesian colonization of Mo’orea in the Society Islands. A significant influx of terrigenous sediment accompanied by increases in charcoal {{and the presence}} of the Polynesian cultigen Colocasia (taro) are indicative of human presence on the island by at least 1060 – 980 cal. yr BP. Polynesian arrival resulted in the rapid alteration of lowland vegetation illustrated in the pollen record by the removal of the coastal tree Pandanus and the promotion of more economically important trees such as Cocos. The most significant period of burning in the charcoal data overlaps with archaeological evidence for expansion into the island interior and the establishment and growth of more intense agricultural practices from 700 to 500 cal. yr BP. The pollen record also documents the apparent abandonment of the coastal plain near Lake Temae during this phase of inland expansion with the terrestrial landscape returning to an environment similar to that found before colonization. A final phase of environmental transformation commenced with European contact {{at the end of the}} 18 th century and is marked most clearly in the Lake Temae sequence with the conversion of the system to a freshwater body accompanied by the expansion of the freshwater reed Typha and a level of burning not seen at any time over the previous 1000 years. Importantly, the new data from Lake Temae support the colonization model for central Eastern Polynesia of ca. 1000 cal. yr BP and refute the <b>late</b> <b>settlement</b> scenario for the Society Islands...|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} the functional and semantic {{features of the}} verbs of emotional state and emotional evaluative attitude recorded in the lexicon of the dialect speakers – the native Cossacks and Ukrainian immigrants, who live together on the territories of the <b>late</b> <b>settlement</b> of southern Russia. The research material is collected {{as a result of}} direct interviewing during the field dialectological expeditions in 2008 - 2014 in Kikvidzensky, Uryupinsky and Ilovlinsky districts of Volgograd region, and represents spontaneous oral speech of informants. On the basis of the componential analysis of verbal lexemes the authors reveal the peculiarities of their use in the oral speech of dialect speakers. Besides, the role of these linguistic units as facilities that represent the human inward life was justified. These units explicate the different interrelations of the person with the reality. The verbs of emotional state and emotional evaluative attitude can show the life priorities and value systems of the researched ethnic groups in the context of oral speech. The authors distinct nuclear and peripheral means of expressing the given field unity {{on the basis of the}} following features – specialization, regularity and frequency of use. The verb of emotional state muchitsya and the verbs of emotional evaluative attitude nravitsya and druzhit are assigned to the nuclear means as they are specialized, regular and frequent in the speech of dialect speakers. These verbs are also the specialized elements in the literary language. The periphery is formed primarily by many lexical units of the literary language, as well as Ukrainianisms, conversational and vulgar verbs. Being specialized, these lexemes do not fulfil the features of regularity and frequency...|$|E
