6000|$|... "Well, I’m {{reckoning}} on that," [...] {{said the}} mate, deliberately. [...] "I’m going for’ard; don’t <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you</b> two. So long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gentlemen,' {{returned}} Dick, 'I thank you. Anybody in {{the helpless}} state {{that you see}} me in, is naturally anxious. Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellent--excellent. I {{only wish}} there were more of it," [...] he chirruped. [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt.</b> <b>You</b> {{were just going to}} hand over to someone, weren't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Instead of {{instantly}} leaping {{into his}} chair and cheering himself hoarse, as the Brotherhood in public meeting assembled would infallibly have done on this cue, Mr. Crisparkle merely reversed the quiet crossing of his legs, and said mildly: ‘Don’t <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> your explanation—when <b>you</b> begin it.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very {{superior}} dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me." ...|$|R
60|$|SIR OLIVER. O pray don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> Mr. Trip's Negotiation.|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure. And I know that's what you're {{here for}} now. Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you.</b> It's a mighty hard job, finding that letter, and the folks'll be back by and by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, there are," [...] Ezra Girdlestone remarked, {{coming into}} the room. He had been {{standing}} between the two doors {{which led to the}} counting-house, and had overheard the latter portion of the conversation. [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you.</b> You were saying that you would blacken my father's character unless he increased your salary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> Mr.--" [...] {{she was at}} a loss, as usual, for the name, and Katharine {{thought that}} she did not {{recognize}} him. [...] "I hope you've found something nice to read," [...] she added, pointing to the book upon the table. [...] "Byron--ah, Byron. I've known people who knew Lord Byron," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|Turning {{round to}} take a chair, Captain Donnithorne said, [...] "But don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> Joshua's business--he has {{something}} to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don’t <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you," [...] said Mr. Vyner, politely, as {{the other}} rose and {{straightened}} himself. [...] "What are you doing—besides decapitating worms?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] he said, {{or rather}} hesitated, [...] "but don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> your plans. I thought I heard {{something}} about--about. Salisbury. I {{have something to}} do there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! our worthy Moody. How well he wears! Not a {{gray hair}} on his head--and look at mine! What dye do you use, Moody? If he had my open {{disposition}} he would tell. As it is, he looks unutterable things, and holds his tongue. Ah! if I could only have held my tongue--when I was in the diplomatic service, you know--what a position I might have occupied by this time! Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> Moody, if {{you have anything to}} say to Lady Lydiard." ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{entering}} his own door after watching his wife out of sight, the Mayor walked {{on through the}} tunnel-shaped passage into the garden, and thence {{by the back door}} towards the stores and granaries. A light shone from the office-window, and there being no blind to screen the interior Henchard could see Donald Farfrae still seated where he had left him, initiating himself into the managerial work of the house by overhauling the books. Henchard entered, merely observing, [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> if ye will stay so late." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> fellows," [...] he said, flinging a log {{upon his}} horse, and dashing his saw gaily into it. [...] "Don't mind me! I know {{you hate to}} lose a minute of this fun; I {{understand}} just {{how you feel about}} it, and I don't want you to stand upon ceremony with me. Treat me just like one of yourselves, gents. This beech- wood is the regular Nova Scotia thing, ain't it? Tough and knotty! I can't bear any of your cheap wood-lot stuff from around here. What I want is Nova Scotia wood, every time. Then I feel that I'm gettin' the worth of my money." [...] His log dropped apart on each side of his horse, and he put on another. [...] "Well, mates," [...] he rattled on, [...] "this is lovely, ain't it? I wouldn't give up my little quarter of a cord of green Nova Scotia before breakfast for anything; I've got into the way of it, and I can't live without it." ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "Nothing, nothing; I--I--thought it {{was getting}} too warm. Go on, dear; don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you." [...] After a moment of heroic self-denial she softly presses the {{register}} open with her foot.|$|R
6000|$|They strolled {{towards the}} swimming-baths, and {{presently}} overtook King. [...] "Oh, don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you," [...] he said. [...] "Engaged in scientific pursuits, of course? I trust you will enjoy yourselves, my young friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He regrets {{to say he}} is {{otherwise}} engaged for the present," [...] Francine replied with spiteful politeness. [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> the conversation. Who is this Miss Jethro, whose name is on everybody's lips?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I sha'n't {{want you}} again till ten to-morrow morning. Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> you," [...] he added patronizingly to Mrs. March. He {{put his hand}} up toward his hat, and sauntered away out of the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay! I beg of you, Mesdames and Messieurs," [...] she {{now said}} quite cheerfully, [...] "do not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> your conversation. Alas! do I not know its subject? [...] . . . My poor son cannot be to blame in the unfortunate affair. Lydie, though {{she may be}} wholly {{innocent}} in the matter, is singularly obstinate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "New at the game," [...] replied Sarah Judd, with a shrug. [...] "You don't know me, Nan, but I know you; and I {{know your}} record, too. You're as slick {{as they make}} 'em, {{and the one who}} calls herself Agatha Lord is just an {{infantile}} amateur beside you. But go ahead, Nan; don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> your work." ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{shaking hands}} all about, Bradley hastened to say, [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>interrupt.</b> Go on, senator. I want to listen." [...] This made a fine {{impression}} on the senator, who loved dearly to {{hear the sound of}} his own voice. He proceeded to enlarge upon his plan for gerrymandering the state--to the advantage of the Democratic party, of course.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Rigby,' {{said the}} Duke, 'pardon <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you.</b> Unhappily, {{there is no}} doubt Lord Spencer is dead, for I am one of his executors.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must excuse <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> Mrs. Tulliver; I have {{business}} {{that must be}} attended to; and I think {{there is nothing more}} necessary to be said." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allow <b>me</b> to <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> Mr. Mason. I {{think it}} will be better that you should hear me before you commit {{yourself}} to any expression as to your relative." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> but allow <b>me</b> {{to suggest}} that any further remarks {{you may have to}} make on the subject had better be made to my friend, Major Macdonnel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At least, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>interrupt</b> your harmony, Annot," [...] said Lord Menteith, [...] "though {{my arrival}} may breed discord elsewhere. My cousin Allan needs the {{assistance}} of your voice and music." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> my dear fellow," [...] he said. [...] "We {{are having}} our coffee outside, {{just on the}} left there. Miss Thorpe-Hatton wants you to stop {{for a moment on}} your way out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] I <b>interrupted,</b> [...] "excuse <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> but how {{has this}} been brought about? The {{obstacles}} you told me of on Saturday appeared even {{to me to be}} quite insurmountable; how has it been contrived?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I most cheerfully promise, worthy master," [...] said Luis, laughing, {{and taking}} a seat, [...] "even though it lead me to the ship-yard-gate. And now, Señor Pedro, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>interrupt</b> the discourse, which I {{discovered}} was most interesting as I entered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pardon <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> {{but it is}} very {{important}} that I should understand the position exactly before you go farther. Whatever this matter may be of which you are about to tell me, do I understand that it was one entirely between Miss Hawtrey and yourself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive <b>me</b> that I <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> my liege," [...] said Nigel, placing himself {{between the}} king and his steed; [...] "hear me but a moment!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Edie," [...] I said, laying {{powerful}} restraint on myself, {{and looking}} her calmly in the face, [...] "you must {{bear with me}} to-night. You know that weakness sometimes causes men to act unaccountably. Forgive <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you.</b> I won't do it again, as the naughty boys say.--Go on, dear, with your story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allow <b>me</b> to <b>interrupt</b> <b>you</b> for one moment, Smith," [...] {{said the}} old gentleman, who had been {{listening}} attentively to my words. [...] "We understood what you said so well on this occasion that it seems a pity you should suddenly again render yourself unintelligible. Can you explain to us {{what you mean by}} dressing in accordance with the fashion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Permit <b>me</b> here to <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> mother. Whatever you {{may have}} seen in me; she,--I mean Lucy,--has never been in the {{slightest}} hurry to be married;--that's all. But I shall regard it as a lapsus-lingua in you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>interrupt</b> <b>me,</b> <b>you</b> black villain! Can't you {{see that}} if Hester's father is a Bagnio slave {{there is no chance}} of her having found refuge with him?" ...|$|R
