Noel Dowling, a professor to whom Berg explained his situation, told Berg to take extra classes in the fall, and said that he would arrange with the dean a leave of absence from law school the following year, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Carl Jaenisch {{had arrived}} too <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tournament; Staunton convincingly won a match with him soon after (seven wins, one draw, and two losses). Later in 1851 Staunton played a match against Elijah Williams, {{who had won}} their {{play-off}} for third place in the London International tournament. Staunton won more games (six wins, three draws, and four losses) but lost the match because he had given Williams a three-game start.|$|E
5|$|Forfeit: A {{player who}} cheats, or violates {{the rules of}} the game, or violates the rules {{specified}} for the particular tournament can be forfeited.

5|$|The Union's V Corps, {{commanded}} by Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter, took up {{positions on the}} hill on June30. McClellan was not present for the initial exchanges of the battle, having boarded the ironclad USS Galena and sailed down the James River to inspect Harrison's Landing, where he intended to locate the base for his army. Confederate preparations were hindered by several mishaps. Bad maps and faulty guides caused Confederate Maj. Gen. John Magruder to be <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> battle, an excess of caution delayed Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger, and Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson had problems collecting the Confederate artillery.|$|E

5|$|A Company—now under Lieutenant Lawrence Clark {{following}} Chitts' wounding that afternoon—had {{only just}} succeeded in breaking contact from the Chinese, suffering a number killed and wounded during a confused withdrawal. Meanwhile, B Company {{had also been}} forced to fight its way down the hill. Both companies were now well clear of their former positions and {{would have had a}} hard time fighting their way back. Ultimately it was too <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Australians to regain the feature in darkness, and the weight of the Chinese attack continued to mount. Only D Company on the southern right flank—which had been left unmolested—was able to regain its previous position on Hill 63. Meanwhile, the positions previously occupied by A and B Companies were occupied by the Chinese in superior numbers, and the remainder of 3 RAR concentrated at the railway crossing instead. At 22:00 Coad arranged to shell and mortar the relinquished ridge, while a standing patrol from the Middlesex was posted on the south-western side of the Maenjung-dong pass in anticipation of a renewed Chinese attack. However, following heavy fighting the pressure on the Australians unexpectedly ceased after midnight, and parties of Chinese were observed beginning to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Another command change {{occurred}} on June 22. In addition to Pemberton at his front, Grant {{had to be}} concerned with Confederate forces in his rear under the command of Joseph E. Johnston. He stationed one division {{in the vicinity of the}} Big Black River Bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as Mechanicsburg, both to act as a covering force. By June 10, the IX Corps, under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, was transferred to Grant's command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, gathering his forces at Canton, from interfering with the siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele replaced him at the XV Corps. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it was too <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Vicksburg garrison, and then fell back to Jackson. Sherman would eventually pursue Johnston and (re)capture Jackson on July 17.|$|E

5|$|As Zwingli {{was working}} on {{establishing}} these political alliances, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the Augsburg Diet to present their views {{so that he could}} make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, Memmingen, and Lindau produced the Tetrapolitan Confession. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Burgrecht cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, Fidei ratio (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the Apostles' Creed. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, Johann Eck, counter-attacked with a publication, Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor.|$|E

The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> train he was to drive on his final working day.

5|$|In 1944, Johns became commandant of the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir. The wartime Engineer School was {{responsible}} for the training of officers. Some were engineers in civilian life who were trained as officers; other were officers transferred from other arms who were given training in engineering subjects. The Officer Candidate School (OCS) prepared enlisted men for commissioning as officers. There had been strong criticism of the content of training courses from SWPA, where it was the norm for machinery to be operated around the clock and for engineer officers to supervise all manner of construction tasks. The commanders there felt that the training courses taught by the Engineer School were concentrating too much on leadership in combat, and not enough on technical matters, such the operation and maintenance of construction equipment. Johns reformed the curriculum, but by this time it was too <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> changes to have much effect in the overseas theaters of operations. For his work at Fort Belvoir, Johns was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E

From Moscow she went on to tour Germany, France, England, Switzerland and Italy, receiving significant public attention and VIP treatment from the Europeans, to whom Chinese film stars were novelties. She took many notes and photographs, and published a travelogue after returning to China.|$|E
5|$|Menominees from Green Bay, who had mobilized a {{battalion}} of nearly 300 men, arrived too <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> battle. They were upset at having missed the chance to fight their old enemies, and so on August 10, General Scott sent 100 of them after {{a part of the}} British Band that had escaped. Indian agent Samuel C. Stambaugh, who accompanied them, urged the Menominees not to take any scalps, but Chief Grizzly Bear insisted that such a prohibition could not be enforced. The group tracked down about ten Sauks, only two of whom were warriors. The Menominees killed and scalped the warriors, but spared the women and children.|$|E

5|$|Miller, the vice-captain of the team, almost {{missed the}} trip to India after turning up <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> voyage. The {{servicemen}} arrived in Bombay and took a two-day train journey to Lahore to play North Zone. Miller scored 46 in a drawn match. The Australians headed to Delhi, but Miller missed the tour match due to food poisoning. He then led the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay with Hassett being rested. Miller top-scored with 106 in a high-scoring draw. In the first match against India at Bombay's Brabourne Stadium, regarded as unofficial Tests, Miller took two wickets: Rusi Modi in the first innings and Abdul Hafeez Kardar in the second. The match ended in a high-scoring draw with Miller unbeaten on 15 as Australia were 1/31 in pursuit of 112 for victory. At this point, {{with most of the}} team suffering from dysentery, some of the Australians became disenchanted with the long train journeys across the subcontinent, and tried to ask Hassett and manager Keith Johnson for air travel. When this was rejected, some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett should be removed, with Miller as one of the candidates to replace him. With Bradman likely to miss the upcoming tour of New Zealand, the Services captain {{would be one of the}} leading candidates to lead Australia. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when Squadron Leader Stan Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane already in India to transport the team. On the first flight to Calcutta, the squad survived an electrical storm that caused the plane to drop altitude.|$|E
5|$|On 3 July 1992, Croatia was re-admitted to FIFA, playing {{its first}} {{official}} matches {{in the modern}} era against Australia in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney. This team was led by Stanko Poklepović as part of an international exhibition tour; in April 1993, Vlatko Marković was appointed as manager. Croatia finally gained admission into UEFA in June 1993, which was too <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> national team to enter the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, as these already commenced the year before. Marković only led the team in one match, a home win against Ukraine in June 1993, before being dismissed in February 1994 and replaced by Miroslav Blažević the following month. The team's performances before Croatia's official independence were not recorded by FIFA, so they entered the World Rankings in 125th place. Blažević led Croatia's qualifying campaign for Euro 1996, beginning with the nation's first post-independence competitive victory, a 2–0 win over Estonia on 4 September 1994. Their first competitive defeat came on 11 June 1995 in a 1–0 away loss to Ukraine during the same qualifying campaign. They eventually finished first in their qualifying group and won FIFA's 1994 Best Mover of the Year award as they moved up to 62nd in the rankings {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
