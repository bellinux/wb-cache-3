5|$|Before {{the release}} of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in 2005, Msgr. Fleetwood, then serving with the Council of European Episcopal Conferences, gave an {{interview}} with Vatican Radio. In the interview, Fleetwood reaffirmed his positive opinion of the books, and remarked that then-Cardinal Ratzinger's <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> {{have been written by}} a member of the congregation's staff and simply signed by the prefect. He also stated that his and Amorth's opinions are just that, conflicting personal opinions of priests.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{calligraphy}} {{ranges from}} functional inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> {{or may not}} be readable. Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may practice both.|$|E

25|$|In 1880, Rosecrans {{was elected}} U.S. Representative as a Democrat from California's 1st congressional district. That same year, James Garfield was elected President as a Republican. Rosecrans was distressed {{to see that}} Garfield's {{campaign}} literature played up {{his role in the}} war at Rosecrans's expense. Their former friendship was irretrievably broken. After Garfield's assassination, Charles A. Dana capitalized on the tragedy by publishing the letters written by Garfield after Chickamauga to then-Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase; the <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> have been the major reason for Rosecrans's loss of political support at the time.|$|E

Some of the <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> have been forgeries or literary exercises assembled in collections which were already circulated in the 2nd century AD.

These <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> have been engraved when Pierre de Lannion re-chiseled the statue {{and may have}} originally read [...] "ILITHYIA", the Greek goddess of childbirth. It is also speculated that these letters were carved later {{by one of the}} young Roman officers to amuse himself by carving his initials on the forehead. The fingers and toes of [...] "Venus" [...] are represented by lines and the facial expression has distinct similarities to those of Egyptian idols.|$|E
500|$|It is {{customary}} to use simpler letters, without many diacritics, in phonemic transcriptions. The {{choice of}} IPA <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> reflect the theoretical {{claims of the}} author, or merely be a convenience for typesetting. For instance, in English, either the vowel of pick or the vowel of peak may be transcribed as [...] (for the pairs [...] or [...] ), and neither {{is identical to the}} vowel of the French word [...] which is also generally transcribed [...] That is, letters between slashes do not have absolute values, something true of broader phonetic approximations as well. A narrow transcription may, however, be used to distinguish them: , , [...]|$|E
500|$|The International Phonetic Alphabet {{is based}} on the Latin alphabet, using as few non-Latin forms as possible. The Association created the IPA so that the sound values of most {{consonant}} letters taken from the Latin alphabet would correspond to [...] "international usage". Hence, the letters , , , (hard) , (non-silent) , (unaspirated) , , , , (unaspirated) , (voiceless) , (unaspirated) , , , and [...] have the values used in English; and the vowel letters from the Latin alphabet ( [...] , , , , [...] ) correspond to the (long) sound values of Latin: [...] is like the vowel in machne, [...] is as in rle, etc. Other <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> differ from English, but are used with these values in other European languages, such as , , and [...]|$|E

500|$|Subjective {{frequency}} is {{how frequently}} subjects [...] a stimulus appears. Name <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> be noticed more and, consequently, assumed to occur {{more frequently than}} other letters. Early research into the impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when the [...] frequency was identical. Hoorens and Nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be {{an explanation for the}} name-letter effect by asking subjects to rank-order the entire alphabet twice, once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency. Subjects indeed significantly overestimated the frequency of letters in their names, although there was no significant positive correlation between the overestimation of frequency and the name-letter effect. The researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name. Subjects who liked their name had a stronger name-letter effect {{than those who did not}} like their name, but they did not overestimate the frequency of own-name letters more than subjects who did not like their names. Hoorens and Nuttin concluded that there is no support for the subjective frequency hypothesis.|$|E
