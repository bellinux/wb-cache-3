40|$|Cladribrine (2 -CdA), a purine {{analogue}} {{active on}} both dividing and resting lymphocytes, {{plays an important}} role in the treatment of indolent lymphoproliferative malignancies such as Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), <b>Lymphoplasmocytic</b> <b>Lymphoma</b> (LPL), Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM). With the aim of evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of low dose 2 -CdA, 15 <b>lymphoplasmocytic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> patients, not eligible for more aggressive or standard therapies, because of age or poor performance status, were treated with the drug at a dose of 5 mg/m 2, once a week for six total courses. All patients showed disease progression. Fourteen patients were valuable for response. In eleven out of these 14 (85. 7 %) disease progression stopped, with 21 % having good hematological responses (one CR and two PR). The treatment was generally well tolerated, without serious infectious events. This schedule may be appropriate for the management of patients where the aim of the treatment is control of disease progression...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{bilateral}} lacrimal gland involvement as {{the first sign of}} Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia in a patient with sarcoidosis. Histological analysis of an incisional biopsy revealed a <b>lymphoplasmocytic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> consistent with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia. No noncaseating granulomas were encountered. Systemic treatment was initiated and resulted in complete resolution of the lesions. In a patient with a systemic disease, such as sarcoidosis, and lacrimal gland involvement, a biopsy of the lacrimal gland mass should be taken to make a correct diagnosis and start appropriate treatment...|$|E
40|$|Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a {{lymphoproliferative}} disease of B lymphocytes, {{characterized by a}} <b>lymphoplasmocytic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in the bone marrow and by IgM monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. It was first described in 1944 by Jan Gösta Waldenström, reporting two patients with oronasal bleeding, lymphadenopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum viscosity, normal radiography and bone marrow infiltrated by lymphoid cells. The WM is a rare disease with a typically indolent clinical course, affecting mainly individuals aged between 63 and 68 years. Most patients have clinical signs and symptoms related to hyperviscosity resulting from IgM monoclonal gammopathy, and/or cytopenias resulting from bone marrow infiltration by lymphoma. The differential diagnosis with other lymphomas {{is essential for the}} assessment of prognosis and therapeutic approach. Treatment of patients with asymptomatic WM does not {{improve the quality of life}} of patients, or increase their survival, being recommended, therefore, their follow-up. For the treatment of symptomatic patients, alkylating agents, purine analogs and anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibodies are used. However, the disease is incurable and the response to therapy is not always favorable. Recent studies have shown promising results with bortezomib, an inhibitor of proteasomes, and some patients respond to thalidomide. In patients with relapse or refractory to therapy, autologous transplantation may be indicated. The aim of this paper is to describe in detail the current knowledge on the pathophysiology of WM, main clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment...|$|E
