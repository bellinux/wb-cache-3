5|$|Solar deities play a {{major role}} in many world {{religions}} and mythologies. The ancient Sumerians believed that the sun was Utu, the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, who was identified as the planet Venus. Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash. Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress, and, in iconography, he is usually portrayed with a <b>long</b> <b>beard</b> and clutching a saw, which represented his role as the dispenser of justice.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{story about}} an aloviti man, who is {{described}} as unusually tall, thin, bony-faced, and with a <b>long</b> <b>beard</b> and moustache. When the weather was nice, he worked and behaved like the other people in his village, {{but as soon as the}} dark clouds covered the sky, he used to close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone and in a trance as long as the bad weather and thunder lasted. Historical persons believed to be aloviti men are Stefan Nemanja, and Stefan Dečanski.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor {{probably}} {{hoped that}} Henry would be recognised as a saint, as his contemporary Louis IX of France had been; indeed, Henry's final tomb resembled {{the shrine of}} a saint, complete with niches possibly intended to hold relics. When the King's body was exhumed in 1290, contemporaries noted that the body was in perfect condition and that Henry's <b>long</b> <b>beard</b> remained well preserved, {{which at the time}} was considered to be an indication of saintly purity. Miracles began to be reported at the tomb, but Edward was sceptical about these stories. The reports ceased, and Henry was never canonised. In 1292 Henry's heart was removed from his tomb and reburied at Fontevraud Abbey with the bodies of his Angevin family.|$|E

50|$|Beards are {{sometimes}} {{the subject of}} art and competition. The World Beard and Moustache Championships take place every other year; contestants are evaluated by creativeness and uniqueness among other criteria.

5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a <b>long</b> <b>beard</b> and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E
5|$|The way Caracalla {{wanted to}} be portrayed to his people can be seen through the many {{surviving}} busts and coins. Images of the young Caracalla cannot be clearly distinguished from his younger brother Geta. On the coins, Caracalla was shown with laureate after becoming Augustus in 197 while Geta is bareheaded until he himself became Augustus in 209. Between 209 and their father's death in February211, both brothers are shown as mature young men who were ready {{to take over the}} empire. Between the death of the father and the assassination of Geta towards the end of 211, Caracalla's portrait remains static with a short full beard while Geta develops a <b>long</b> <b>beard</b> with hair strains like his father. The latter was a strong indicator of Geta's effort to be seen as the true successor to their father, an effort that came to naught when he was murdered. Caracalla's presentation on coins during the period of his co-reign with his father, from 198 to 210, are in broad terms in line with the third-century imperial representation; most coin types communicate military and religious messages, with other coins giving messages of saeculum aureum and virtues. During Caracalla's sole reign, from 212 to 217, a significant shift in representation took place. The majority of coins produced during this period made associations with divinity or had religious messages; others had non-specific and unique messages that were only circulated during Caracalla's sole rule.|$|E

25|$|Both Fude Zhengshen and Tudigong are {{described}} as sitting white haired old men with white <b>long</b> <b>beard.</b> The main {{differences between the two}} deities are that Fude Zhengshen is a wealth deity with no connection to the earth while Tudigong are a group of low-ranking earth gods with limited length of service. While Fude Zhengshen's altar is placed high above the floor; Tudigong's altar are built just on the ground and usually accompanied by Tudipo his wife and Hushen or tiger god whose help him to ward of evil.|$|E
25|$|On May 1 of 561 king Ariamir, {{who was in}} {{the third}} year of his reign, called the First Council of Braga, being styled The most glorious king Ariamir in the acts. The first Catholic Council held in the Kingdom, it was almost entirely devoted to the {{condemnation}} of Priscillianism, making no mention at all of Arianism, and only once reproving clerics for adorning his clothes and for wearing granos, a Germanic word implying either pigtails, <b>long</b> <b>beard,</b> moustache, or a Suebian knot, a custom declared pagan. Of the eight assistant bishops only one bore a Germanic name, bishop Ilderic.|$|E
5000|$|The Iranians were fond of <b>long</b> <b>beards,</b> {{and almost}} all the Iranian kings had a beard. In Travels by Adam Olearius, a king {{commands}} his steward's head to be cut off and then remarks, [...] "What a pity it was, that a man possessing such fine mustachios, should have been executed." [...] Men in the Achaemenid era wore <b>long</b> <b>beards,</b> with warriors adorning theirs with jewelry. Men also commonly wore beards during the Safavid and Qajar eras.|$|R

25|$|Number One (real name unknown) is {{the leader}} of the TNT. He is wheelchair-bound, has a <b>long</b> <b>beard</b> and a bald scalp. Running gag in the series is his age: he claims to be alive well even from the Neanderthal era and to meet various {{characters}} from history, such as Nero, Homer and Maximilien Robespierre. He has a habit of telling stories of his past to his agents, who all fall asleep in the end, causing him to angrily wake them up by brandishing his stick. Another running gag is his time spent in his wheelchair: in all of the stories, he is still paraplegic, never shown to be able to walk.|$|E
25|$|He is {{described}} as having a dark complexion, large eyes and a <b>long</b> <b>beard.</b> He was tall and slender and his hair and beard remained black until he was very old. He was attentive to his health, avoiding red meat, fats and other foods he deemed unhealthy. He was seldom sick before his last decade when he suffered from bouts of pleurisy. When he was ill, he treated himself (to the approval of physicians). He {{had a sense of}} humour, though serious subjects he treated seriously. He had studied poetry when young and enjoyed writing, reciting and participating in poetic exchanges. It is said that he was asked in Egypt about al-Tirimmah and was able to recite this 7th century poet's work for Egyptians who had merely heard al-Tirimmah's name.|$|E
25|$|The Prose Merlin {{contains}} many instances of Merlin's shapeshifting. He {{appears as a}} woodcutter with an axe about his neck, big shoes, a torn coat, bristly hair, and a large beard. He is later found in the forest of Northumberland by a follower of Uther's disguised as an ugly man and tending a great herd of beasts. He then appears first as a handsome man {{and then as a}} beautiful boy. Years later, he approaches Arthur disguised as a peasant wearing leather boots, a wool coat, a hood, and a belt of knotted sheepskin. He is described as tall, black and bristly, and as seeming cruel and fierce. Finally, he appears as an old man with a <b>long</b> <b>beard,</b> short and hunchbacked, in an old torn woolen coat, who carries a club and drives a multitude of beasts before him.|$|E

25|$|In Renaissance {{paintings}} of the adoration of the Trinity, God may be depicted in two ways, either with emphasis on The Father, or the three elements of the Trinity. The most usual depiction of the Trinity in Renaissance art depicts God the Father using an old man, usually with a <b>long</b> <b>beard</b> and patriarchal in appearance, sometimes with a triangular halo (as {{a reference to the}} Trinity), or with a papal crown, specially in Northern Renaissance painting. In these depictions The Father may hold a globe or book (to symbolize God's knowledge and as a reference to how knowledge is deemed divine). He is behind and above Christ on the Cross in the Throne of Mercy iconography. A dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit may hover above. Various people from different classes of society, e.g. kings, popes or martyrs may be present in the picture. In a Trinitarian Pietà, God the Father is often symbolized using a man wearing a papal dress and a papal crown, supporting the dead Christ in his arms. They are depicted as floating in heaven with angels who carry the instruments of the Passion.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of his father in 1399, Oswald {{returned}} to the County of Tyrol and began a drawn out quarrel with his older brother Michael about their inheritance. In 1401–02 Oswald participated in the failed Italian expedition of King Rupert of Germany. In 1407 he and his brother finally agreed on how to split the inheritance: Oswald received a third of Castle Hauenstein and the accompanying estates in Seis am Schlern. The other two thirds of the castle belong to a knight named Martin Jäger, but Oswald did not respect the property situation, occupying the entire castle and appropriating Jäger's share of the tithe. In 1408, in preparation for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Oswald paid for a memorial stone to be installed on the wall of the cathedral in Brixen. The stone has survived, and shows him in the garb of a Crusader, with the <b>long</b> <b>beard</b> associated with pilgrims. Before he left, he wrote several songs for his beloved, Anna Hausmann, the wife of the Brixner burgher Hans Hausmann. After his return in 1410 he acquired the right to take up residence in the Augustiner-Chorherren cloister Neustift near Brixen.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, the {{popularity}} of Jamaica's reggae music and musician Bob Marley prompted interest in dreadlocks internationally. The anti-establishment philosophy of Rastafari, echoed {{in much of the}} reggae of the time, resonated with leaning youth of all ethnicities – especially and primarily among African Americans and other Blacks, but among counterculture whites as well. Eastern Christians are encouraged [...] to wear long hair with <b>long</b> <b>beard.</b> In the 1980s the view of long hair as a solitary signifier of political or counter-cultural identity was countered and parodied in films such as Rambo and many other militaristic heroes of media which challenged then-contemporary views of tradition. In the 2000s longer hairstyles among men became popular among neopagans and rock enthusiasts; for example, musicians in Metal bands and their fans often wear long hair. Long hair may be grown for the purpose of being donated to an organization, such as Locks of Love, for hairpieces to help those who could not have hair otherwise, such as those who are diagnosed with alopecia aerate. Today long hair has gained even more popularity. Even among mainstream men it is socially acceptable to have hair reaching around the upper back. This could in part be due to the [...] "man bun" [...] trend where men pull their shoulder length or longer hair back into a topknot Bun (hairstyle).|$|E
