In locations where there is no natural harbour or where there is a large tidal range it is necessary to use an inclined slipway to launch a large lifeboat. Lifeboat slipway stations consist of an initial section where the boat is held on rollers followed by an inclined keelway of nickel/chromium coated steel, the lifeboat is released {{from the top of the}} slipway and proceeds under its own weight into the water. The lifeboat is subsequently recovered to the top of the slipway using a winch line. With the introduction of the new, larger Tamar class lifeboat existing boathouses are being upgraded and existing <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> <b>coated</b> steel slipway lining materials replaced with a low-friction jute fibre/phenolic resin composite. The composite slipway lining material was selected in part because it was able to run unlubricated or water lubricated. However the friction problems have been such that it is usual to line the slipway with grease before every launch and recovery. This adds to the number of operations involved in a launch and has safety implications. The use of grease to line the slipway results in the grease being washed out to sea with effects on the surrounding area, it is likely that there is some environmental impact due to this as the grease is non-biodegradeable and not recommended for open water use according to the material data sheet. Because of these issues it is desirable to develop a set of working guidelines for crews to reduce both these risks by setting appropriate conditions for the manual application of grease along the slipway. These guidelines will also feature a method of assessing the wear of slipway panels so that panels can be replaced before they present a hazard to lifeboat operation. This thesis describes a method for assessing slipway lining materials and lubricants. Appropriate tribometer test machines are selected to assess slipway lining materials performance, the TE 57 reciprocating tribometer and the TE 92 rotary tribometer are used in conjunction to ascertain friction and wear performance respectively. These results are combined with detailed slipway panel surveys and case studies, and with Finite Element models to develop a method for assessing and predicting the friction and wear along a panel lined slipway. These results are used to develop slipway performance monitoring techniques for lifeboat crews and to develop design modification to combat high friction and wear on slipway panels. The adoption of a modified slipway panel and water lubrication system is proposed, this arrangement reduces panel misalignment contributions to slipway friction and wear resulting in more reliable slipway performance and is also projected to save the RNLI up to £ 195 k annually compared with current practice.

40|$|Abstract Today {{sheet metal}} forming is {{used to make a}} variety of mass {{production}} because it has a high production rate. One of the biggest concerns in {{sheet metal forming}} is wear of the tool in form of galling. Galling in sheet metal forming is characterised by an increased tool surface roughness, unstable friction in the forming process and undesirable scratches on the final products. Several ways of ranking materials resistance to galling exist today but only ASM G 98 is standardised. Nevertheless, some different methods developed for ranking tool materials’ tendency to galling have also been developed. The aim of this thesis is to develop and improve the Uddeholm Tooling Tribo Test rig located at Uddeholm Tooling AB. The rig, which is a variation of cylinder-on-cylinder test equipment, was improved with a new tool holder, a utilization of the real sheet material counter face and a new data acquisition system and software. The galling was detected using scratches on the sheet, metallographic analysis of the material adhered on the tool specimen, monitoring of coefficient of friction and the standard deviation of the coefficient of friction. The obtained results show difficulties with ranking of tool materials in terms of galling resistance under non-lubricated conditions. The tool steels tested were SVERKER 21 and UNIMAX. AISI 304 - 10, DC 04 and DOCOL 1000 DP sheets were used. Additionally a <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> <b>coating</b> of BalinitC on SVERKER 21 was also included. All specimens of the tool steels showed signs of galling on every run, only the <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> <b>coating</b> showed a transition in behaviour of friction coefficient corresponding to galling initiation. The standard deviation of the coefficient of friction increased at low loads. A decrease of the test loads led to stability loss of the system detected by an increase in the standard deviation of the coefficient of friction. This might happen because the Kistler platform is originally designed for larger loads. Although, the test rig does not work properly in its present state, the concept looks promising...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of low friction PVD coatings on machine elements {{is limited by the}} high costs associated with fulfilling the demands on the surface quality of both the supporting substrate and the counter surface.

Reciprocating ball on disc tests was performed, using balls with two different surface roughnesses. The worn surfaces were investigated using 3 -D profilometry and SEM.

40|$|Over {{one million}} hip {{prostheses}} are implanted in patients worldwide {{each year and}} the need is increasing as the patient group of younger and more active patients is increasing.

To be able to monitor wear in vivo and also to predict the longevity of new materials for hip prostheses are therefore important issues in this interdisciplinary research area. This thesis comprise a true non-invasive 3 D method for determination of acetabular cup wear using Computed Tomography (CT) intended for clinical routine use in order to plan for a revision. It also comprises investigations of the influence of surface roughness and sterilization method in wear testing of materials for hip prostheses. Mainly wear of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) was investigated since it is the most common soft bearing in hip prostheses. The 3 D-CT method was found to be easy to use and showed an accuracy and repeatability at a clinical relevant level for acetabular cup wear. It should lend itself well to semi-automation. The influence of surface roughness was investigated with both a multidirectional pin-on-disk machine and with a hip simulator.

40|$|Total hip {{prostheses}} {{have succeeded}} in significantly {{improving the quality of}} life of millions of patients worldwide. Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) has been widely and successfully used as a bearing material in orthopaedic prostheses since the 1960 s. Despite the recognized success and worldwide acceptance of total hip replacement, the numbers of failures increase after about 15 - 20 years of use. The negative biological effects of wear particles are considered to be the most important limiting factors for a long implant life. The liberation of sub micron size wear debris into human tissue leads to chronic inflammation. Continuous inflammation caused by UHMWPE particles activates inflammatory cells (macrophages) that stimulate bone resorptive cells (osteoclasts) and eventually a loosening of the implant. In-vitro experimental wear simulations are helpful in evaluating the importance of the many variables which can influence the generation of the wear debris. However, the difficulties involved in accurately duplicating in-vivo wear conditions, the long time that it takes to carry out the wear experiments and difficulties in accurately measuring the low degrees of wear, have limited the applicability of in-vitro wear testing. Screening methods using simplified experimental conditions, mainly unidirectional sliding (pin-on-disc devices), have shown to yield wear rates markedly different from those obtained in advanced wear simulator tests and from that observed in vivo. There is thus a need for simplified screening methods which mimic the wear process in a more realistic way, still do not require long testing times. A new test method has been developed based on a modification of an existing pin-on-disc machine. The strain-hardening effect of the polymer pin was avoided by a bi-directional motion. The results indicate that significant wear occurs due to the bi-axial motion and the testing time is drastically reduced compared to that required in a joint wear simulator. The modified pin-on-disc machine was used for tribological investigation of UHMWPE sliding on stainless steel, and on stainless steel coated with diamond-like carbon, titanium nitride or Micronite. Micronite is a new type of coating combined with a very <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> <b>coating</b> material giving enhanced tribological properties. It was also shown that the wear properties of UHMWPE can be affected by a treatment of the polymer (addition of vitamin E (VE) as antioxidant, &# 61543;-irradiation and annealing). The possibility of controlling the wear properties of high-density polyethylene at an early processing stage by using a cold roll-drawing technique was also investigated. The results indicate that molecular orientation induced by the polymer processing is a promising route to improve the wear properties of polyethylene...|$|E

The measured leakage rate of a single brush was 2 - 3 times less than that measured for a 12 -tooth, 0. 127 -mm (0. 005 inch) radial clearance labyrinth seal used as a baseline. Stage effects were studied and {{it was found that}} two brush seals with a large separation distance leaked less than two brushes tightly packed together. The maximum measured groove depth on the Inconel 718 rotor was 25. 4 (mu) m (0. 001 inch) after 4. 31 hours of shaft rotation. The Haynes- 25 bristles wore approximately 25. 4 - 76. 2 (mu) m (0. 001 - 0. 003 inch) under the same conditions. Three seal runner coatings, chromium carbide, Teflon impregnated chromium, and zirconium oxide, were tested in liquid hydrogen at 35, 000 and 65, 000 rpm with separate 50. 8 mm diameter brush seals made of Haynes- 25 bristles and having a nominal initial radial interference of 129 rpm. Two bare Inconel- 718 rotors were also tested as a baseline. The test results revealed significant differences between the wear characteristics of the uncoated and coated seal runners. At both speeds the brush seal with the bare Inconel- 718 seal runner exhibited significant bristle wear with excessive material transferring to the runner surface. In contrast, the coated seal runners inhibited the transfer and deposit of bristle material. The chromium carbide coating showed only small quantities of bristle material transferring to its surface. The Teflon impregnated chromium coating also inhibited material transfer and provided some lubrication. This coating, however, is self-sacrificing. The Teflon remained present on the low speed runner, but it was completely removed from the high speed brush seal, which was tested considerably longer. The tests of the Teflon coating revealed the importance of using a lubricating and <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> <b>coating</b> for brush seals to reduce bristle and seal runner wear. The zirconium oxide coating exhibited the greatest amount of coating wear, while the brushes incurred only slight wear. Further testing of ceramics is recommended before making a final judgement on the viability of ceramic coatings for brush seals because of the contrast between the results reported by Carlile and the results presented herein. Strictly based on the results presented hereinabove, the chromium carbide and Teflon impregnated chromium coatings were considered preferable to the uncoated Inconel- 718 and zirconium oxide coatings because of their good wear resistance and characteristics to inhibit bristle material wear and transfer to the seal runner...|$|E
