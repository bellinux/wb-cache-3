Conventional wisdom attributes <b>labor</b> <b>hoarding</b> to labor adjustment costs. This paper argues that {{the conventional wisdom is}} inadequate for understanding <b>labor</b> <b>hoarding</b> because it ignores the role of inventories. Since idle labor can be used to produce inventories, why do firms hoard labor when inventory is an option? Using a dynamic rational expectations model of profit-maximizing firms facing demand uncertainty, this paper studies the dynamic interactions between <b>labor</b> <b>hoarding</b> and inventory accumulation. Closed-form decision rules for labor and inventory decisions are derived. The analysis shows that labor adjustment costs alone are far from sufficient for explaining labor hoarding.; Earlier title: On the optimal volume of labor hoardingProductivity; Labor supply...|$|E

RBC analysts typically measure these technology shocks by the Solow residual. This paper assesses the sensitivity of inference based on Solow residual accounting to <b>labor</b> <b>hoarding</b> behavior. Our main results can be summarized as follows. First, the quantitative implications of RBC models {{are very sensitive to}} the possibility of <b>labor</b> <b>hoarding.</b> Allowing for such behavior reduces our estimate of the variance of technology shocks by 50 %. Depending on the sample period investigated, this reduces the ability of technology shocks to account for aggregate output fluctuations by 30 % to 60 %. Second, our <b>labor</b> <b>hoarding</b> model is capable of quantitatively accounting for the observed correlation between government consumption and the Solow residual. Third, unlike standard RBC models, our <b>labor</b> <b>hoarding</b> model is consistent with three important qualitative features of the joint behavior of average productivity and hours worked: (i) average productivity and hours worked do not display any marked contemporaneous correlation, (ii) average productivity is positively correlated with future hours worked, and (iii) average productivity is negatively correlated with lagged hours worked. ...|$|E

In this paper, we analyze the determinants of German firms' labor demand during the crisis using a firm-level panel dataset. Our analysis proceeds in two steps.

40|$|<b>Labor</b> <b>hoarding</b> is a {{phenomenon}} when companies do not discharge their employees but try to “retain ” them instead. Labor economics suggests that such employers ’ behavior is due to fixed labor costs. These can incur every time taking on a new employee (e. g. on-the-job training), but can also result when discharging a worker (e. g. redundancy compensations). If the former type of fixed labor costs were more important for companies, we would expect the phenomenon to be more spread between specialists and earners of higher wages. On the contrary, the latter type is seen as evasion of labor law and sometimes is treated as hidden unemployment; thus, it should be more spread between workers of lower qualification and earners of lower wages. The main question of the paper is: “Do Lithuanian companies use <b>labor</b> <b>hoarding</b> as a competitive strategy to adjust the demand of their products to temporary fluctuations or is it primarily a way to evade the labor law? ” The second question is a supplement to the first: “Does labor retaining end up with unemployment in Lithuania? ” To answer these, two main types of <b>labor</b> <b>hoarding</b> – part time work and unpaid (partly paid) leaves – are examined in this paper jointly.

By using firm-level panel data drawn from two high-quality sources, we obtain a microeconomic estimate of variable labor effort from a dynamic cost minimization set-up. We argue that, contrary to common assumptions, the relationship between effort and hours is not monotonic. During a recovery, if a critical level of hours per capita is reached (say, because of labor market rigidities), every additional hour is worked with decreasing effort, due to physical fatigue. We provide supporting evidence by estimating the structural parameters of a Taylor approximation of the effort function. Corroborating evidence has been obtained by estimating the elasticity of effort with respect to hours at different business cycle conditions. <b>labor</b> effort, factor <b>hoarding,</b> business cycles...|$|R

However, we do not find that high school graduates have a comparative advantage on production jobs requiring more training, nor, in the PSID sample, are high school graduates assigned to jobs requiring more training. Finally, we find that the wage premium associated with graduation from high school vanishes during severe slumps, periods in which employers are likely to be <b>hoarding</b> <b>labor</b> and in which quits and absences are least important to firms. We conclude from this evidence that the sorting model of education provides a better explanation for the higher wages of high school graduates than does the human capital model. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{relatively}} mild {{reaction of}} the German labor market to the Great Recession 2008 / 09 was often called the “German Miracle”. However, various reasons are able to explain this unusual response. First, the economic crisis mostly hit financially strong firms coming from a long upswing leading towards to the crisis. These firms were able to <b>hoard</b> <b>labor</b> deliberately due {{to a number of}} working-time flexibility instruments at the firm as well as the state level. Second, in the years prior to the Great Recession, Germany had introduced profound reforms of the labor market, which fundamentally changed its institutional settings as well as income support systems and overall led to higher working incentives and better matching between labor demand and supply. There was also a considerable reframing of ALMPs {{in the course of the}} labor market reforms, which led to a broad collection on evaluation results providing sound guidance for policy makers in further developing the institutional framework to adjust to structural changes on the labor market. Overall, it is fair to say that Germany has been on the right track with the main reforms of the labor market for the last 10 years.|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Bemanke and Parkinson (1991) studied interwar U. S. {{manufacturing}} data {{with the objective}} of assessing competing theories of the business cycle. An important finding was that short-run increasing returns to Labor (SRIRL), or procyclical labor productivity, was at least as strong during the Great Depression as in the postwar period. The authors conclude that this information casts further doubt on the real business cycle explanation of economic fluctuations. The purpose of this note is to point out that, within the data set analyzed by Bemanke and Parkinson (20 % of the manufacturing sector), labor productivity during the Great Depression (1928 :III to 1933 : 1) was procyclical in some industries and countercyclical in others. Furthermore, our measure of labor productivity for the entire manufacturing sector during this period was countercyclical.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines English and American {{authors of}} the fin de siècle whose depiction of failed artists functions as {{a critique of the}} predominant modes of identity formation under capitalism. Scholars have tied the transatlantic aesthetic project of literary realism with the social project of the reform era, a political practice of small gains that served to reinforce the identities produced by the division of <b>labor</b> and the <b>hoarding</b> of capital. The late-century fictions presented here protested the conventions of reform fiction and the sociopolitical consequences of the movement, advocating the depoliticized practice of art as an alternative means of identification and a form of political engagement in its own right. Chapter One shows how Rebecca Harding Davis and Oscar Wilde envisioned the work of art [...] divorced from the identity of its producer [...] as the ideal body. Through the depiction of collective works of art that outlive their producers, Davis and Wilde assert the primacy of the work itself over authorial identity. The contemporary artist Banksy, an anonymous street writer whose works gesture towards a future society fueled by aesthetic participation, later employs the same aesthetic strategy in his critique of late capitalism. Chapter Two examines Kate Chopin and Thomas Hardy's response to the fragmentation of the fiction market in the eighteen-nineties. Their feeling that mass-produced art like photographs, popular sheet music, and especially reform fiction had hijacked the creative freedoms of the artistic sphere and its potential to offer an alternative mode of identity formation is present in their depictions of mimetic artist characters whose work reinscribes them into an increasingly professionalized and consumerist society. Chapter Three identifies a compromise formation in the fictions of George Gissing and Edith Wharton, who wrote explicitly about the artist's engagement in social and financial markets. Their novels envision the replacement of identities and communities formed through the production and reception of art by the rise of brand culture, wherein consumers identify with the imagined identities of corporations.

40|$|The authors analyze {{changes in}} the Russian labor market in 1992. They focus {{on the path of}} wages and {{employment}} in a context of partial price liberalization and considerable ambiguity about government and central bank policy. Under the former Soviet economy, the firm was the bedrock of the centrally planned system. The relaxation of centralized controls did not result in substantial employment losses partly because of the implicit moral economy of the system and partly because of continuing constraints on wages. In 1992, the wage structure and employment levels in the economy's state sector exhibited surprising stability, reflecting the system's immense inertia. Despite announced regime changes, at the end of 1992 the number of jobseekers was no more than 1. 5 percent of the labor force. But significant changes have been made: wage and employment decisions have been widely liberalized; some restraints on labor mobility have been removed; changes have also been made in ownership title; and there has been some expansion in the private sector, as yet largely concentrated in services. These substantive changes are important for future expectations about entitlements to jobs and incomes, but the changes remain restricted and the sources of these restrictions imply significant economic costs. The underpinning of the current stagflation is the inability to break the soft budget constraint on state firms and to impose realistically a systematic, transparent set of constraints on the firms'financing demands. This has combined with the firms'continuing ability to exercise market power alongside weak controls on wage claims. Employment transitions have been dominated by high levels of quits {{at the base of the}} skill structure. Involuntary separations have been limited, involving mostly women and white collar workers. Firms commonly provide de facto unemployment compensation to workers in the form of minimum wage payments with little or no work requirement. There is evidence of some increase in the proportion of laid-off workers among the unemployed, but firms seem to prefer <b>hoarding</b> <b>labor</b> in light of uncertainty about policy, firm, or product-specific market prospects. Wages have been more volatile. Wages initially bore almost all of the adjustment costs, but have shown mild recovery thereafter. Lax monetary policy and decentralized insider power, giving rise to relative employment stability and real wage rigidity, are powerful ingredients for hyperinflation.
