Chess grandmaster, Nigel Short grew up in Atherton and attended St Philip's School. Architect Arthur John Hope (1875–1960), a partner in Bradshaw Gass & Hope was born and lived in Atherton. Edward Ormerod, mining engineer at Gib Field Colliery, invented the Ormerod detaching hook, an important mining safety device.|$|E

25|$|Aérotrain S44 was a {{full-size}} passenger-carrying car intended for suburban commuter service at speeds of 200km/h (in particular links between city centres and airports).

50|$|Despite their name, not all <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> produce <b>linear</b> motion; some <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> are {{employed}} for generating rotations of large diameters where {{the use of}} a continuous primary would be very expensive.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the coaster {{was about}} to be {{manufactured}} by BHS/Zierer, with <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> as transport elements. After the track layout was already developed and models were created, the park finally decided to work with Vekoma and scrap the idea of <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors,</b> because of financial reasons.|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} {{versions of}} Innovia Metro {{were based on}} a <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> (LIM) using vehicle-mounted windings and a track-mounted stator consisting of a thin aluminum plate mounted flat between the tracks. The small size and flat shape of the motor, and its lack of a transmission connected to the bogies, allows the ART to be much closer to the ground than a traditional subway car. The motor is used for all control with the exception of emergency braking using conventional shoes in the bogies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the British {{electrical}} engineer Eric Laithwaite, {{a professor at}} Imperial College London, developed the first full-size working model of the <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motor.</b> He became professor of heavy electrical engineering at Imperial College in 1964, where he continued his successful development of the linear motor. Since linear motors do not require physical contact between the vehicle and guideway, they became a common fixture on advanced transportation systems in the 1960s and 70s. Laithwaite joined one such project, the Tracked Hovercraft, although the project was cancelled in 1973.|$|E
25|$|All current designs (except for the human-powered Shweeb) are {{powered by}} electricity. In {{order to reduce}} vehicle weight, power is {{generally}} transmitted via lineside conductors rather than using on-board batteries. According to the designer of Skyweb/Taxi2000, J. Edward Anderson, the lightest system is a <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> (LIM) on the car, with a stationary conductive rail for both propulsion and braking. LIMs are used in {{a small number of}} rapid transit applications, but most designs use rotary motors. Most such systems retain a small on-board battery to reach the next stop after a power failure.|$|E

50|$|However conversely, <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> {{can avoid}} the need for {{gearboxes}} and similar drivetrains, and these have their own losses; and working knowledge {{of the importance of}} the goodness factor can minimise the effects of the larger air gap. In any case power use is not always the most important consideration. For example, in many cases <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> have far fewer moving parts, and have very low maintenance. Also, using <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> instead of rotating motors with rotary-to-linear transmissions in motion control systems, enables higher bandwidth and accuracy of the control system, because rotary-to-linear transmissions introduce backlash, static friction and/or mechanical compliance in the control system.|$|R

However, the current rolling stock are not qualified to use either LIRR or subway tracks due to the AirTrain rolling stock's inadequate structural strength and differing method of propulsion. In particular, the <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> system that propels the AirTrain vehicles cannot be used on LIRR and subway tracks because these are manually propelled by electric motors. If a one-seat ride is ever implemented, a hybrid-use vehicle would be needed to operate on both subway/LIRR and AirTrain tracks.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Six Flags Great Adventure {{announced}} that it would be adding a new roller coaster in 1997, bringing their coaster count back up to seven. It was then {{announced that}} the coaster would be a prototype <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> (LIM) launched dual tracked shuttle coaster dubbed [...] "Batman & Robin: The Chiller". The theme was chosen with the intent of promoting the Batman & Robin film, which was set to open in summer that year. The Observatory scenery piece, that eventually loomed over the launch tracks and exit ramp, was taken directly from the film source material. A track was devoted to both title characters, with the icy blue track being christened Batman and its fiery red companion being labeled Robin.
