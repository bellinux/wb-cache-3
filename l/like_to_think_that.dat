25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time}} ago as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E

She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else is not my job.|$|E

However, in September 2010, she ruled out a return, saying, [...] "It was a bit selfish of me but I didn't want to be killed off. I am never going to go back but I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> 's still out there somewhere." [...] At the recording of the new series of The Rob Brydon Show for BBC Two, Brydon asked if she would consider returning, to which Windsor replied, [...] "Never say never".|$|E
500|$|Due to {{his support}} for the LGBT community, and his {{portrayal}} of gay characters in his projects, Franco's sexuality has been a subject of discussion in [...] media sources, relentlessly questioning if he himself is gay. In response to questions regarding his sexuality, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. [...] "Or, you know what," [...] he quipped, [...] "maybe I’m just gay". In a March 2015 interview with Four Two Nine magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, commenting that it is not who you have sex with that defines your sexuality, but instead how you act. [...] "In the twenties and thirties, they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, but as long as they behaved in masculine ways, they weren’t considered gay". Franco added, [...] "Well, I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I’m gay in my art and straight in my life".|$|E
500|$|The Pounds {{settled in}} Paris in January 1921, and {{several months later}} moved into an {{inexpensive}} apartment at 70 bis [...] Pound became friendly with Marcel Duchamp, Tristan Tzara, Fernand Léger and others of the Dada and Surrealist movements, as well as Basil Bunting, Ernest Hemingway and his wife, Hadley Richardson. He {{spent most of his}} time building furniture for his apartment and bookshelves for the bookstore Shakespeare and Company, and in 1921 the volume Poems 1918–1921 was published. In 1922 Eliot sent him the manuscript of The Waste Land, then arrived in Paris to edit it with Pound, who blue-inked the manuscript with comments like [...] "make up yr. mind..." [...] and [...] "georgian". Eliot wrote: [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue pencilling on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound's critical genius." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we can use this story to really educate people and get the word out there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E
500|$|A {{focus of}} Tang's {{art is the}} theme of {{national}} and cultural identities, I Was Born Japanese (1995) being an example. Tang notes that he has had four nationalities. He was issued with a Japanese birth certificate as he was born during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He became a British national after World War II, a Malaysian citizen when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, and a Singaporean citizen when Singapore gained full independence in 1965. While living in the UK he was conscious of his Chinese identity, but later on he took the view that he might not be fully Chinese since China had been occupied by the Mongols and Manchurians: [...] "I'm not sure if I'm 100% Chinese blood. I'm sure my ancestor has got mixture of Mongolian and even Thai and Miao people [...] We are all mixed, and this is true. But I always <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there is only one race in the world. We are all one human race." [...] Another of Tang's performances, Jantung Pisang – Heart of a Tree, Heart of a People, centres around the banana tree. He was inspired {{by the fact that the}} banana is used widely in Southeast Asia as an offering to bring blessings, but is also feared as it is associated with ghosts and spirits. He also sees banana trees as a reminder of the lack of democracy in certain parts of the world: [...] "Democracy in many Asian countries and Third World countries is as shallow as the roots of a banana tree. We need to deepen [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report 2005 defines {{ecosystem}} services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet {{is that a}} few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, ants, mosquitoes, and spiders). [...] However, insects offer ecological goods and services. The Xerces Society calculates {{the economic impact of}} four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. [...] "the importance of bugs to hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, including bird-watching"), dung burial, and pest control. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide. As the ant expert E. O. Wilson observed: [...] "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos." [...] A Nova (TV Series) segment on the American Public Broadcasting Service framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: [...] "We humans <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we run the world. But even in the heart of our great cities, a rival superpower thrives... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we hardly even notice them. But in many ways, it is they who really run the show. The Washington Post stated: [...] "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the Asian tiger mosquito or the fire ant, appears in our midst. In other words: Start thinking about the bugs." ...|$|E

500|$|Meyer {{moved to}} Boulder, Colorado because he [...] "just {{wanted to get}} {{as far from the}} New York {{environment}} as [...] could." [...] There, he wrote a film script for Letterman; the project was dropped due to the success of Letterman's show, although several of its jokes were later used in The Simpsons when no other ideas could be found. He spent time [...] "skiing, going to poetry readings, and trying to meet girls from the University of Colorado." [...] He founded the humor zine Army Man; he wrote the eight-page first issue almost wholly by himself, publishing just 200 copies which he gave to his friends. Meyer had been disappointed by the decline of the National Lampoon and felt that there was no longer a magazine which has the sole purpose of being funny. By starting Army Man he [...] "tried to make something that had no agenda other than to make you laugh." [...] He claimed that [...] " [...] didn't know what [...] was doing," [...] and reprinted material without obtaining permission, including a review of Cannonball Run II. He added: [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Army Man was somewhere between a real publication and a very irresponsible, lawbreaking zine." [...] Army Man gained a strong following and was listed on Rolling Stones [...] "Hot List" [...] in 1989. Meyer noted: [...] "The only rule was that the stuff had to be funny and pretty short. To me, the quintessential Army Man joke was one of John Swartzwelder's: 'They can kill the Kennedys. Why can't they make a cup of coffee that tastes good?' It's a horrifying idea juxtaposed with something really banal-and yet there's a kind of logic to it. It's illuminating because it's kind of how Americans see things: Life's a big jumble, but somehow it leads to something I can consume. I love that." [...] Meyer suspended publication with the third issue, after offers to take the magazine national made him fear that it would lose its best qualities. According to The Believer: [...] "In comedy circles, [...] taken on almost mythological proportions." [...] This was met with varying reactions from Meyer, who felt [...] "embarrassed when people build it up as this monumental work of comedy. It was just a silly little escapade, never meant to be enshrined." ...|$|E

In November 2009, McVie went to see Fleetwood Mac's last UK performance on their Unleashed tour in London, but did not join her former bandmates on stage. During the announcement of Fleetwood Mac's 2012 world tour, Stevie Nicks downplayed the likelihood of McVie ever rejoining the group: [...] "She went to England and {{she has never been}} back since 1998 [...] as much as we would all <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she'll just change her mind one day, I don't think it'll happen [...] We love her, so we had to let her go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ryan's {{poems are}} often quite short. In {{one of the}} first essays on Ryan, Dana Gioia wrote about this aspect of her poetry. [...] "Ryan reminds us of the suggestive power of poetry–how it elicits and rewards the reader’s intellect, imagination, and emotions.

[...] Ryan tends to avoid using the personal [...] "I" [...] in her poetry, claiming that she [...] "didn’t want confession. [...] didn’t want to be Anne Sexton."

In the interview, Greig was forced to respond to questions concerning England’s chances of winning the series against the young West Indies' side. Greig described being unimpressed by the West Indian squad. He described the West Indies recent humiliating defeat in Australia and their tumultuous home series against India. Greig explained, [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> people are building these West Indians up, because I am not really sure they’re as good as everyone thinks they are.” He then notoriously claimed, “Sure, they’ve got a couple of fast bowlers, but… you must remember that (if) the West Indian get on top they are magnificent cricketers, but if they’re down, they grovel.
