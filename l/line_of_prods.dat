40|$|A {{moderately}} thermostable pyranose oxidase (PROD) was purified to apparent homogeneity with a {{yield of}} 71 % from mycelium extracts {{of the white}} rot fungus Phlebiopsis gigantea by an efficient three-step procedure that included heat treatment, immunoaffinity chromatography, and gel filtration on Superdex 200. <b>PROD</b> <b>of</b> P. gigantea is a glycoprotein with a pI between pH 5. 3 and 5. 7. The relative molecular weight (M(infr)) <b>of</b> native <b>PROD</b> is 295, 600 (plusmn) 5 % as determined by four independent methods. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis <b>of</b> <b>PROD</b> revealed two distinct but similar stained bands corresponding to polypeptides with M(infr) s of 77, 000 and 70, 000, suggesting a heterotetrameric enzyme structure. The tetrameric structure <b>of</b> <b>PROD</b> was confirmed by electron microscopic examinations, which additionally showed the ellipsoidal shape (4. 6 by 10 nm) of each subunit. Spectral analyses and direct determinations showed the presence of covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide with a stoichiometry of 3. 12 mol/mol of enzyme. A broad pH optimum was determined in the range pH 5. 0 to 8. 0 in 100 mM sodium phosphate, and the activation energy for d-glucose oxidation was 24. 7 kJ/mol. The main substrates <b>of</b> <b>PROD</b> are d-glucose, l-sorbose, and d-xylose, for which K(infm) values 1. 2, 16. 5, and 22. 2 mM were determined, respectively. PROD showed high stability during storage. In 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6. 0 to 8. 0), the half-life <b>of</b> <b>PROD</b> activity was > 300 days at 40 (deg) C, > 110 days at 50 (deg) C (pH 7. 0), and 1 h at 65 (deg) C...|$|R

40|$|Michael A Smith, Alice LimDepartment of Pharmacy Practice and Pharmacy Administration, Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, University of the Sciences, Philadelphia, PA, USAAbstract: Over {{the last}} several years, many {{advances}} {{have been made in}} the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with the development of direct-acting antivirals. Paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir with dasabuvir (PrOD) is a novel combination of a nonstructural (NS) 3 / 4 A protein inhibitor boosted by ritonavir, an NS 5 A protein inhibitor, and an NS 5 B nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitor. This review aims to discuss the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, drug interactions, and viral drug resistance <b>of</b> <b>PrOD</b> in the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infections. Phase I, II, and III human and animal studies that describe the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety <b>of</b> <b>PrOD</b> for HCV were identified and included. Studies that evaluated patients without cirrhosis (n= 2, 249) and with cirrhosis (n= 422) demonstrated that PrOD for 12 or 24 weeks was effective at achieving sustained virologic response rates (> 90 %) in patients with genotype 1 a or 1 b HCV infection. Although indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection, PrOD is also recommended for the treatment of HCV in patients coinfected with HIV. Additionally, promising data exist for the use <b>of</b> <b>PrOD</b> in liver-transplant recipients. The most common adverse drug events associated with PrOD included nausea, pruritus, insomnia, diarrhea, asthenia, dry skin, vomiting, and anemia. The high efficacy rates seen coupled with a favorable side effect profile seen with PrOD with or without ribavirin have led to its addition as a recommended treatment regimen for HCV genotype 1 infection.

40|$|Not just {{a system}} of checks and {{balances}} ideally tuned to constrain collective political action, the constitutional division of authority also may be seen as {{a system of}} “prods and pleas” in which distinct governmental branches and actors can push each other to entertain collective political action when necessary. Though prods and pleas are an inversion of the assumed direction of checks and balances, they are not a radical reconfiguration of the basic structure and principles of American government. Rather, they are limited government’s fail-safe: a latent capacity inherent to a system of divided authority that does and should activate when the external pressures of a changing world threaten the sustainability of disaggregated governance. By understanding and embracing their role in the shadow logic <b>of</b> <b>prods</b> and pleas, judges and other public officials can protect limited government by, when necessary, counteracting its potential to overprefer passivity. Through the case study of climate change nuisance litigation, we examine how three potential obstacles to merits adjudication—the political question doctrine, standing, and implied preemption—should be evaluated in recognition of the significance <b>of</b> <b>prods</b> and pleas. We conclude that federal and state tort law provide an important defense mechanism that can help limited government sustain itself in the face of climate change and other dramatic twenty-first century threats, where the nature of the threat is, in large part, a function of limited government itself. As a residual locus for the airing of grievances when no other government actor is responsive to societal need, the common law of tort is a—and perhaps the—paradigmatic vehicle for the expression <b>of</b> <b>prods</b> and pleas. Although climate change plaintiffs still face long odds on the actual merits of their claims, judges would sell short their institutional role if they dismissed such claims as categorically beyond the proper domain of the courts and the common law. They would duck and weave when they should prod and plead...|$|R
