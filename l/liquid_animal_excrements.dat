50|$|The {{landfill}} was poorly engineered.

40|$|WO 200116055 A UPAB: 20010724 NOVELTY - A {{method for}} {{controlled}} fertilization using natural fertilizers involves mixing <b>animal</b> <b>excrement</b> (which is <b>liquid</b> {{or has a}} high liquid content), directly before or during application, {{with at least one}} swellable hydrophilic material (I), followed by applying the obtained gel to the area to be fertilized. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the use of (I) as binder for <b>animal</b> <b>excrement</b> which is <b>liquid</b> or has a high liquid content, where (I) is added to the excrement at 4 wt. % or more. ACTIVITY - Fertilizer. MECHANISM OF ACTION - Plant nutrient source. USE - The gelled manure product is slow-release fertilizer having a depot effect. ADVANTAGE - The gelled excrement remains on the soil surface and releases plant nutrients in a slow and controlled manner, so that ground water does not become contaminated by leaching of non-utilized nitrates, phosphates etc. by rainwater into the ground water-supplying layer. Emission of ammonia (which causes malodor, damage to forests and loss of available nitrogen) is also prevented. The gels are coherent, elastic and mechanically stable...|$|R

Research conducted in 2001 – 2011 in six farms located {{in the area of}} a few villages in the basin of Miedwie lake. Researches points were placed (piezometer and wells) in the area of these farms. High concentration of NH 4 +, NO 3 - and PO 4 3 - were found in a ground water which are exposed to contact inflow of pollutant from farms areas, and sources which are occurred in outlying from the source of pollutants. Also water from a farm wells, which are periodically used, manifested the presence of large chemical elements concentration, especially NO 3 - and PO 4 3 -, what proves a constant inflow of pollutants.

5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} <b>animal</b> <b>excrement,</b> which they roll with their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards and pushing {{the ball with}} their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|R
5000|$|The {{compost is}} {{naturally}} obtained by decomposing aerobic (with oxygen) of organic waste and plant debris, <b>animal</b> <b>excrement</b> and slurry, through the mass reproduction of thermophilic aerobic bacteria that are present naturally {{in any place}} (later the continue fermentation the other species of bacteria, fungus and Actinobacteria). Typically, this is to avoid (if possible) the putrefaction of organic waste (excess water, preventing aeration-oxygenation and creates smelly anaerobic biological conditions), although some industrial composting processes used by anaerobic bacteria of putrefaction.|$|R

2500|$|N2O {{emissions}} {{originate from}} <b>animal</b> <b>excrement</b> {{and from the}} use of nitrogenous fertiliser. Livestock produce methane from rumination. Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide as it can trap twenty times the heat of an equivalent volume of carbon dioxide. Since New Zealand has large stock numbers these emissions are significant. A dairy cow produces between 84 and 123kg of methane per year from rumen fermentation.

Biocides, which are used for the disinfection of stables, end up in the stored <b>animal</b> <b>excrements.</b> Via manure application in agriculture, veterinary medicines and biocides are released into the environment and consequently affect soil and water quality.|$|R

40|$|Agriculture is {{a source}} of {{emissions}} of the greenhouse gas methane into the environment. These emissions can be reduced by appropriate storage of animal slurry and manure, with proper fertilization and processing of organic agricultural waste into biogas, where methane is captured and used as an energy source. Biogas is a renewable source of energy that is produced by microbial anaerobic digestion in biogas plants. As a substrate in biogas plants using different types of organic biomass such as animal manure and slurry, crop residues, spoilt silage, waste from food processing industry and biodegradable industrial and municipal waste. Biogas can be used to produce heat and electricity or purified to biomethane as a fuel for vehicles. Digestate {{can be used as a}} high-quality fertilizer. Biogas as a renewable energy source represents a replacement for fossil fuels, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil sources. The system of financial supports for electricity produced from biogas is applied in Slovenia. There were 24 operating biogas plants in Slovenia in year 2014. Slovenian biogas plants currently produce the majority of biogas from energy crops. As only the minority of biogas is produced from <b>animal</b> <b>excrements</b> we will primarily support the development of agricultural microbiogas plants that will use <b>animal</b> <b>excrements</b> and organic waste biomass from agri-food sector as substrates...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{discharge}} and the concentration of faecal bacteria in the water from a subsurface field drain were monitored, initially for one winter without application of <b>animal</b> <b>excrement</b> to the pasture, and, subsequently, for two winters when pig excrement was sprayed over the pasture. The concentrations of Escherichia coli and enterococci in the water {{were found to be}} affected by three main factors: the flow rate of the drain discharge; the number of bacteria in or on the soil and vegetation; and the application to the land of large volumes of semiliquid <b>animal</b> <b>excrement</b> over short periods of time. In the absence of excrement application, the concentration of faecal bacteria in the water was related to the flow rate and to time by an equation of the form: log bacterial concentration = a+ b log flow rate- c days, where a, b and c are constants. The concentrations of bacteria in the water declined with time, the 90 % reduction times being 57 days for E. coZi and 96 days for enterococci. The spraying of pig excrement over the pasture resulted in a 30 - to 900 -fold increase in the concentrations of faecal bacteria in the drain discharge within 2 h of the start of the spraying. The concentrations of faecal bacteria returned to their normal levels over a period of 2 to 3 days...|$|R

Pasture soils and especially overwintering areas receive large amounts of nutrients as <b>animal</b> <b>excrements.</b> Together with other effects, this creates good conditions for high rates of nitrogen and carbon transformations, and also for substantial losses in the form of gaseous metabolites. This paper informs on research of a specific model ecosystem – the cattle overwintering area.

50|$|Infection {{in humans}} {{typically}} occurs {{by exposure to}} <b>animal</b> <b>excrement</b> through the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts.

It is possible to acquire the infection through broken skin or mucous membranes that are directly exposed to infectious material. Transmission from person to person has also been established, presenting a disease risk for healthcare workers. The virus is still present in the urine for between three and nine weeks after infection, and it can be transmitted in semen for up to three months after becoming infected.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cellular}} metabolism of all life requires phosphorus; humans need between 700 and 1250 milligrams (mg) a day. Traditional farming practices used human and <b>animal</b> <b>excrement</b> as fertiliser for plants, but today {{most of this}} excrement is not collected and ends up in watercourses and in the sea. This forces the use of phosphorus from fossil excrements (old guano) or from minerals. It seems that 6 056 kg of phosphorus are introduced every second (191 millions of tons every year); this {{could lead to a}} peak production by 2030, and then to a phosphate shortage, or worse, a large-scale famine.|$|R
