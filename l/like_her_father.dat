5|$|Elizabeth Rona {{was born}} on 20 March 1890 in Budapest, Hungary, to Ida, (née Mahler) and Samuel Róna. Her father was a prosperous Jewish {{physician}} who worked with Louis Wickham and Henri-August Dominici, founders of radium therapy, to introduce the techniques to Budapest, and installed {{one of the first}} x-ray machines there. Elizabeth wanted to become a physician <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>father,</b> but Samuel believed that it would be too difficult for a woman to attain. Though he died when she was in her second year of university, Rona's father had encouraged her and spurred her interest in science from a young age. She enrolled in the Philosophy Faculty at the University of Budapest, studying chemistry, geochemistry, and physics, receiving her PhD in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Gary and Veronica Cooper's daughter, Maria Veronica Cooper, {{was born}} on September 15, 1937. By all accounts, he was a patient and affectionate father, {{teaching}} Maria to ride a bicycle, play tennis, ski, and ride horses. Sharing many of her parents' interests, she accompanied them on their travels and was often photographed with them. <b>Like</b> <b>her</b> <b>father,</b> she developed a love for art and drawing. As a family they vacationed together in Sun Valley, Idaho, spent time at Rocky's parents' country house in Southampton, New York, and took frequent trips to Europe. Cooper and Rocky were legally separated on May 16, 1951, when Cooper moved out of their home. For over two years, they maintained a fragile and uneasy family life with their daughter. Cooper moved back into their home in November 1953, and their formal reconciliation occurred in February 1954.|$|E

She has wings like her mother, horns <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>father,</b> and green-brown eyes unlike those of either of her parents.

She is seen taking her first steps {{at the end of the}} third story arc, and is speaking in simple phrases by the beginning of the fourth.

2500|$|Charke's tone is, <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>father's,</b> chatty, witty, relaxed, and intimate. [...] It is {{a mixture}} of honesty and self-flattery, but with nothing <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>father's</b> self-aggrandizement. She wrote the autobiography, she said, to {{reconcile}} herself to <b>her</b> <b>father.</b> It did not work. He would not communicate with her, returning a letter unopened, and when he died on 12 December 1757, a very wealthy man, he left Charlotte a token £5. In response, Charke wrote The Lover's Treat, or, Unnatural Hatred, a novel about families at war with themselves.|$|R

5|$|In {{this era}} Scotland {{followed}} {{the trend of}} Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing. James V, {{as well as being}} a major patron of sacred music, was a talented lute player and introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court, although almost nothing of this secular chamber music survives. The return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her position as a Catholic, gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. <b>Like</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> she played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household.|$|E
5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to have an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (<b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>father,</b> a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Rosie and Aldermach {{announce}} {{that they have}} given birth to Callie's sister, Lilith. Thanks to the hormone injections Rosie has had, it only took a day for Lilith to be born and she will age one year, every day, and take Callie's place as Twayne's bride. After an accident caused by Lilith, Rosie is hospitalized and Mark and Callie {{take on the task}} to raise Lilith. In just a few weeks, she is eighteen years old and has started dating Randall. Mark takes in Twayne for a session and finds out about his arranged marriage to Lilith, and that the marriage will be a televised sex ritual. Callie realizes that she is forcing Lilith to marry Twayne, just <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> forced her, and tells Lilith that she does not want her to marry him. Lilith, however, wants to the opposite of what Callie wants and tells her that she will marry him. Just before the ritual is about to commence, Lilith reveals to Mark that she plots to kill Callie and Twayne and instead join Mark at the sex altar. Mark informs Callie, who takes out her soul to transform into a more demonic figure. Following a battle between the two, Lilith falls down to a lower level of Hell. Later, Callie kicks Mark out of her apartment as she does not have to marry Twayne anymore.|$|E

5|$|The {{return of}} James V's {{daughter}} Mary from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her {{position as a}} Catholic, gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Scottish Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. <b>Like</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> she played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household. James VI was a major patron {{of the arts in}} general. He made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music, attempting to revive burgh song schools from 1579. He rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1594 and the choir was used for state occasions like the baptism of his son Henry. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family. When he went south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I, he removed one of the major sources of patronage in Scotland. Beginning to fall into disrepair, the Scottish Chapel Royal was now used only for occasional state visits, leaving the court in Westminster as the only major source of royal musical patronage.|$|E
