25|$|I do {{not know}} how many men I saw, but {{certainly}} during this one march not less than 5,000. Of this great number two only offered insults to the gang of prisoners....But little and petty as it was it galled horribly. The soldiers felt the sting and scowled back; the officers <b>looked</b> <b>straight</b> before them. Yet it was a valuable lesson. Only a few days before I had read in the newspapers of how the Kaffirs had jeered at the Boer prisoners when they were marched into Pietermaritzburg, saying, 'Where are your passes?' It had seemed a very harmless joke then, but now I understood how a prisoner feels these things.|$|E
500|$|He lived a frugal existence, {{his only}} source of income being a £20-a-week {{retainer}} he received from Island Records (...) [...] At one point he could not afford {{a new pair of}} shoes. He would often disappear for days, sometimes turning up unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: [...] "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back." [...] Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, once saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously clinically depressed. [...] "There was something about him which suggested that he would have <b>looked</b> <b>straight</b> through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around." ...|$|E
500|$|Stratton tried {{variations}} of the experiment {{over the next few}} years. First he wore the glasses for eight days, back at Berkeley. The first day he was nauseated and the inverted landscape felt unreal, but by the second day just his own body position seemed strange, and by day seven, things felt normal. A sense of strangeness returned when the glasses were taken out, though the world <b>looked</b> <b>straight</b> side up; he found himself reaching out with the right hand when he should have used the left, and the other way around. Then he tried the experiment outdoors. [...] He also tried another experiment disrupting the mental link between touch and sight. There he wore a set of mirrors attached to a harness as shown in the figure allowing, and forcing, him to see his body from above. He found the senses adapted in a similar way over three days. His interpretation was that we build up an association between sight and touch by associational learning over a period of time. During certain periods, the disconnect between vision and touch made him feel as if his body was not where his touch and proprioceptive feeling told him it was. This out-of-body experience, caused by an altered but normal sensory perception, vanished when he attended to the issue critically, focusing on the disconnect.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the Saturday Night Live appearance, she was set to perform [...] "I Believe in You" [...] at the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary tribute concert in Madison Square Garden. She was greeted by a thundering mixture of cheers and jeers. During the booing, Kris Kristofferson {{told her not to}} [...] "let the bastards get you down", to which she replied, [...] "I'm not down." [...] The noise {{eventually}} became so loud that O'Connor saw no point in starting the scheduled song. She called for the keyboard player to stop and the microphone to be turned up, and then screamed over the audience with an improvised, shouted rendition of [...] "War". This time, she sang the song, stopping just after the part in which the lyrics talk about child abuse, emphasising the point of her previous action. She then <b>looked</b> <b>straight</b> to the audience for a second and left the stage. Kristofferson then comforted her, as she cried.|$|E
2500|$|This hostility {{was also}} felt {{by those who}} {{attended}} the movie's première in Mexico City on 9 November 1950, when Los olvidados was taken by many as an insult to Mexican sensibilities and to the Mexican nation. [...] At one point, the audience shrieked in shock {{as one of the}} characters <b>looked</b> <b>straight</b> into the camera and hurled a rotten egg at it, leaving a gelatinous, opaque ooze on the lens for a few moments. [...] In his memoir, Buñuel recalled that after the initial screening, painter Diego Rivera's wife refused to speak to him, while poet León Felipe's wife had to be restrained physically from attacking him. [...] There were even calls to have Buñuel's Mexican citizenship revoked. [...] Dancigers, panicked by what he feared would be a complete debacle, quickly commissioned an alternate [...] "happy" [...] ending to the film, and also tacked on a preface showing stock footage of the skylines of New York, London and Paris with voice-over commentary to the effect that behind the wealth of all the great cities of the world can be found poverty and malnourished children, and that Mexico City [...] "that large modern city, is no exception". [...] Regardless, attendance was so poor that Dancigers withdrew the film after only three days in theaters.|$|E
