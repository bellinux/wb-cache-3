See List of <b>logic</b> <b>symbols.</b> In other cases, the turnstile symbol may mean implies; permits the derivation of. See: List of mathematical symbols.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} symbols for NAND gates: the MIL/ANSI symbol, the IEC symbol and the {{deprecated}} DIN symbol sometimes found on old schematics.

50|$|The {{example in}} the {{previous}} section used unformalized, natural-language reasoning. Curry's paradox also occurs in some varieties of formal logic. In this context, it shows that if we assume there is a formal sentence (X → Y), where X itself is equivalent to (X → Y), then we can prove Y with a formal proof. One example of such a formal proof is as follows. For an explanation of the logic notation used in this section, refer to the list of <b>logic</b> <b>symbols.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{classical}} logics, {{taking a}} contradiction [...] (see List of <b>logic</b> <b>symbols)</b> as a premise (that is, taking as a premise {{the truth of}} both [...] and [...] ), allows us to prove any statement [...] Indeed, since [...] is true, the statement [...] is true (by generalization). Taking [...] together with [...] is a disjunctive syllogism from which we can conclude [...] (This is often called the principle of explosion, since the truth of a contradiction is imagined to make the number of theorems in a system [...] "explode".) ...|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of first-order <b>logic,</b> the <b>symbols</b> in a {{signature}} are {{also known as the}} non-logical symbols, because together with the logical symbols they form the underlying alphabet over which two formal languages are inductively defined: The set of terms over the signature and the set of (well-formed) formulas over the signature.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>logic,</b> the <b>symbol</b> ⊨, [...] or [...] {{is called}} the double turnstile. It is often read as [...] "entails", [...] "models", [...] "is a {{semantic}} consequence of" [...] or [...] "is stronger than". It {{is closely related to}} the turnstile symbol , which has a single bar across the middle, and which denotes syntactic consequence (in contrast to semantic).|$|R
50|$|Zellweger's logic {{alphabet}} {{offers a}} visually systematic way of representing {{each of the}} sixteen binary truth functions. The idea behind the logic alphabet is to first represent the sixteen binary truth functions {{in the form of}} a square matrix rather than the more familiar tabular format seen in the table above, and then to assign a letter shape to each of these matrices. Letter shapes are derived from the distribution of Ts in the matrix. When drawing a <b>logic</b> <b>symbol,</b> one passes through each square with assigned F values while stopping in a square with assigned T values. In the extreme examples, the symbol for tautology is a X (stops in all four squares), while the symbol for contradiction is an O (passing through all squares without stopping). The square matrix corresponding to each binary truth function, as well as its corresponding letter shape, are displayed in the table below.|$|R
5000|$|A logical symbol is a {{fundamental}} concept in logic, tokens {{of which may be}} marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Although the term [...] "symbol" [...] in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized, and at other times to the marks {{on a piece of paper}} or chalkboard which are being used to express that idea; in the formal languages studied in mathematics and logic, the term [...] "symbol" [...] refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to be a token instance of the symbol. In <b>logic,</b> <b>symbols</b> build literal utility to illustrate ideas.|$|E
50|$|Algorithmic {{communication}} systems are {{a relatively new}} field within CETI. In these systems, which build upon early work on mathematical languages, the sender describes a small set of mathematic and <b>logic</b> <b>symbols</b> that {{form the basis for}} a rudimentary programming language that the recipient can run on a virtual machine. Algorithmic communication has a number of advantages over static pictorial and mathematical messages, including: localized communication (the recipient can probe and interact with the programs within a message, without transmitting a reply to the sender and then waiting years for a response), forward error correction (the message might contain algorithms that process data elsewhere in the message), and the ability to embed proxy agents within the message. In principle, a sophisticated program when run on a fast enough computing substrate, may exhibit complex behavior and perhaps, intelligence.|$|E
5000|$|Belief <b>logic</b> <b>symbols,</b> when {{combined}} with imperative logic, allow beliefs and desires to be expressed. The notation [...] is used for beliefs ("You believe A") and [...] for desires ("You desire A"). In formal ethics, desire is taken in a strong sense when the agent of the belief {{is the same as}} the agent of the imperative. The following table shows the different interpretations for [...] depending on the agent and the tense of the imperative:This strong interpretation of desires precludes statements such as [...] "I want to get out of bed (right now), but I don't act to get out of bed". It does not, however, preclude [...] "I want to get out of bed (right now), but I don't get out of bed". Perhaps I act to get out of bed (make my best effort), but can't for some reason (e.g. I am tied down, my legs are broken, etc.).|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of first-order logic. Some {{of these are}} inessential {{in the sense that}} they merely change notation without affecting the semantics. Others change the expressive power more significantly, by extending the semantics through additional quantifiers or other new logical symbols. For example, infinitary logics permit formulas of infinite size, and modal <b>logics</b> add <b>symbols</b> for possibility and necessity.|$|R
50|$|The {{last two}} lines {{are the only}} {{essentially}} new component to the syntax for plural <b>logic.</b> Other logical <b>symbols</b> definable in terms of these can be used freely as notational shorthands.|$|R
40|$|A {{concept of}} "guessability" is defined for sets of {{sequences}} of naturals. Eventually, these sets are thoroughly characterized. To do this, a nonstandard logic is developed, a <b>logic</b> containing <b>symbols</b> for the ellipsis {{as well as}} for functions without fixed arity. New proofs are given for some seemingly-unrelated known results. Comment: 15 pages (revised to add addendum to give due credit to William Wadge for defining guessability long before me...|$|R
