Settings: Family Practice Center, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, in June 2004. Main outcome measures: <b>Low</b> blood <b>pressure</b> is a disease, causes and treatment of <b>low</b> blood <b>pressure,</b> patient ever suffered from <b>low</b> blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>low</b> blood <b>pressure</b> can be diagnosed with BP apparatus, without apparatus and stress can cause <b>low</b> blood <b>pressure.</b> Results: A 110 patients were interviewed. Majority of the subjects were educated young married men, well placed socio-economically. A majority (73 %) of the respondents consider <b>low</b> blood <b>pressure</b> as a disease entity. Weakness, dizziness, low mood and headaches are reported as symptoms and use of salt (41 %) and medications (20 %) are considered treatments for <b>low</b> blood <b>pressure.</b> Conclusion: Further studies are recommended to ascertain the existence of <b>low</b> blood <b>pressure</b> syndrome in our population as a myth or a disease entity.

The cyclone's motion shifted to the northwest and it made a second landfall near Balasore in northern Orissa that night. The cyclone quickly weakened to a deep depression overland and tracked to the west over central India, where it degenerated into a broad area of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> on June 11.|$|E

5|$|A non-tropical trough at {{the surface}} {{extended}} from the northern Gulf of Mexico across Florida into the western Atlantic Ocean. On August 3, the western portion developed into a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> area. The eastern portion slowly organized and ultimately developed into Tropical Storm Cristobal. The <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> area in the Gulf of Mexico steadily organized, and late on August 4 the circulation was organized enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Two while located 40miles (65km) east of Port Eads, Louisiana. Northeasterly wind shear initially prevented organization of the cloud pattern, though the depression was able to strengthen to become Tropical Storm Bertha about five hours after it formed.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} strong <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> systems formed across the {{southern}} Great Plains on February 4, contributing to record warmth on February 4 and 5 {{in the southern}} Plains and lower Mississippi River Valley. High temperatures across many areas reached the 70s°F (21–26°C), and in Alabama temperatures reached the low 80s°F (27°C) with dew points in the middle 60s° (17–20°C). Dewpoints in the mid 60s°F were recorded {{as far north as}} Memphis. A strong cold front trailing the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> area approached the region from the west.|$|E
30|$|Second, {{the radius}} of the damping hole affects the {{pressure}} undershoot, as shown in Figure  11 (b). The <b>lowest</b> <b>pressure</b> increases when the radius increases. The <b>lowest</b> <b>pressure</b> is 0.017  MPa when the damping hole is not used, and it increases to a value higher than 0.05  MPa (high saturated vapor pressure) when the radius is 0.3  mm. As the high saturated vapor pressure is 0.05  MPa, the cavitation occurs when the radius is too small. This implies that the damping hole is capable of maintaining a relatively higher <b>lowest</b> <b>pressure</b> {{at the start of}} the compression process, which is the main reason for employing the damping hole.|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} western coast of Africa on September26, quickly spawning {{an area of}} <b>low</b> <b>pressure.</b> Upon {{the formation of the}} low, the wave split into two pieces and a second area of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> developed along the southern portion of the wave as it traveled west. The northern low quickly developed, spawning Tropical Depression Fourteen on September28. The southern low attached to the wave failed to develop and moved away from the intensifying tropical depression. It continued through the Atlantic, entering the Pacific Ocean, after crossing Central America, on October8. A broad area of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along the wave around 275miles (440kilometres) south of Acapulco, Mexico. However, the low remained disorganized because of strong upper-level winds. On October13, the low became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear. The low developed enough convection late on October14 to be declared Tropical Depression Fifteen-E while located about 435mi (705km) southwest of Colima, Mexico.|$|E

A new, secondary <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> system formed over Georgia along the warm front {{associated with the}} primary low. As the secondary low matured along the U.S. East Coast, the initial center weakened rapidly, and heavy rainfall developed over the Carolinas {{in association with the}} new low. Mixed precipitation soon spread across the Mid-Atlantic States, and heavy snow began to fall from New Jersey northward by 1200 UTC on February 9.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work non-idealities of flat burner-stabilized flames at {{atmospheric}} and <b>low</b> <b>pressures</b> are examined using PIV measurements, which {{are supported by}} and analyzed {{with the help of}} CFD modeling. Radial and axial velocity profiles measured in the cold flow and in the flames at atmospheric and at lower pressures are presented. Two possible reasons for the drop in the apparent laminar burning velocity at <b>low</b> <b>pressures</b> (below 20 kPa) were considered: the non-uniformity of the velocity profile issuing from the burner mouth and diffusion of the gas mixture from the original gas flow. At very <b>low</b> <b>pressures</b> an outward velocity {{at the edge of the}} burner plate is detected. A part of the fuel-air mixture therefore seems to escape the flow at the edge of the burner. Further experiments, however, revealed that diffusion of the fuel from the fresh mixture and of the ambient atmosphere into the flame is less important as compared to the diffusive loss of H atoms from the flame at <b>low</b> <b>pressures.</b> This was substantiated by the numerical analysis and assessment of the earlier observations from the literature. A critical relation between the size of the burner and the <b>lowest</b> <b>pressure</b> for ensuring the stabilization of a flat flame is demonstrated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

5|$|An area of <b>low</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> tracked across southeastern Canada {{during the}} 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to {{what is known as}} cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new area of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E
5|$|Early on July8, another brief {{burst in}} {{convection}} {{near the center}} of Blanca occurred. In this area, satellites found sustained winds around 40mph (65km/h). However, the convection quickly dissipated and the winds were not considered to be representative of the storm's true intensity. By later that day, convection had not reformed around the center of circulation and Blanca degenerated into a non-convective remnant <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> system, corresponding with the final public advisory from the NHC. Although no longer a tropical cyclone, the remnants of Blanca maintained a well-defined <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> center as it continued its northwesterly movement. Early on July11, the system turned northward and gradually weakened. The following day, the remnants of Blanca dissipated over open waters.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few days of September 2002, an upper-level trough emerged in the Gulf of Mexico and stalled. Thunderstorms {{developed}} along the trough and concentrated around a weak <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> system. Gradually, the trough and associated <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> drifted south into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> area in the northwest Gulf of Mexico became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and some deep convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression. Wind shear within the Gulf of Mexico was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation. A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill-defined circulation which led to low confidence of the location of the center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening.|$|E
