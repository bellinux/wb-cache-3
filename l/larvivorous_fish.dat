5000|$|Based on diet, {{mosquitofish}} {{are classified}} as <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish.</b> Their diet consists of zooplankton, small insects and insect larvae, and detritus material. Mosquitofish feed on mosquito larvae at all stages of life. Many mosquitos do not hatch due to improper fertility. Adult females can consume hundreds of mosquito larvae in one day. Maximum consumption rate in a day by one mosquitofish has been observed to be from 42%-167% of its own body weight. [...] They can suffer mortalities if fed only on mosquito larvae, and survivors show poor growth and maturation. Mosquitofish have also shown cannibalistic behavior in laboratory experiments; however, whether these traits are hereditary is unknown.|$|E

40|$|Background & objectives: Indigenous <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fishes</b> bear {{potential}} for regulating vector mosquitoes throughtrophic interactions. The mosquito prey preference of five indigenous <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fishes</b> {{in the presence}} of alternativefood items was assessed to highlight their use in mosquito vector management. Methods: Laboratory experiments were carried out using the <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fishes</b> Ambassis (=Chanda) nama,Parambassis (=Chanda) ranga, Colisa fasciatus, Esomus danricus and Aplocheilus panchax, as predators and IVinstar Culex quinquefasciatus larvae as target prey. Mosquito prey preference of these fishes {{in the presence of}}chironomid larvae, tubificid worms and artificial fish foods, in varied proportions, were assessed using preferenceindex. Results: The fishes consumed considerable amount of mosquito larvae both in absence and presence of alternativefood items. However, the positive selectivity for mosquito larvae at all densities were significantly (p < 0. 05) affected by the alternative foods. The chironomid larvae and tubificid worms were consumed proportionatelyhigher than expected (p < 0. 05), while the artificial fish food was consumed at lower than expected proportions(p < 0. 05). The niche overlap was significantly similar among the fish species suggesting likeliness in predationpattern and prey preference. Interpretation & conclusion: The results reflect that the alternative food items influence the mosquito prey selectivityand thus the efficacy of indigenous <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fishes.</b> While use of these fishes in the wetlands and allied mosquitolarval habitats {{in different parts of the}} country is suggested, impact of the alternative prey may affect the successfulregulation of mosquitoes.

We therefore assessed the evidence base for <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> programmes in malaria control. Objectives: Our main objective was to evaluate whether introducing <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> to anopheline breeding sites impacts Plasmodium parasite transmission. Our secondary objective was to summarize studies evaluating whether introducing <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> influences the density and presence of Anopheles larvae and pupae in water sources, to understand whether fish can possibly have an effect. Search methods: We attempted to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, or ongoing). We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CABS Abstracts; LILACS; and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) until 18 June 2013. We checked the reference lists of all studies identified by the above methods. We also examined references listed in review articles and previously compiled bibliographies to look for eligible studies. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials and non-randomized controlled trials, including controlled before-and-after studies, controlled time series and controlled interrupted time series studies from malaria-endemic regions that introduced fish as a larvicide and reported on malaria in the community or {{the density of the}} adult anopheline population. In the absence of direct evidence of an effect on transmission, we carried out a secondary analysis on studies that evaluated the effect of introducing <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> on the density or presence of immature anopheline mosquitoes (larvae and pupae forms) in community water sources to determine whether this intervention has any potential in further research on control of malaria vectors. Data collection and analysis: Three review authors screened abstracts and examined potentially relevant studies by using an eligibility form. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. If relevant data were unclear or were not reported, we wrote to the trial authors for clarification. We presented data in tables, and we summarized studies that evaluated the effects of fish introduction on anopheline immature density or presence, or both. We used GRADE to summarize evidence quality. We also examined whether the authors of included studies reported on any possible adverse impact of <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> introduction on non-target native species. Main results: We found no reliable studies that reported the effects of introducing <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> on malaria infection in nearby communities, on entomological inoculation rate, or on adult Anopheles density. For the secondary analysis, we examined the effects of introducing <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> on the density and presence of anopheline larvae and pupae in community water sources. We included 12 small studies, with follow-up from 22 days to five years. Studies were conducted in a variety of settings, including localized water bodies (such as wells, domestic water containers, fishponds, and pools; six studies), riverbed pools below dams (two studies), rice field plots (three studies), and water canals (two studies). All studies were at high risk of bias. The research was insufficient to determine whether <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> reduce the density of Anopheles larvae and pupae (nine studies, unpooled data, very low quality evidence). Some studies with high stocking levels of fish seemed to arrest the increase in immature anopheline populations, or {{to reduce the number of}} immature anopheline mosquitoes, compared with controls. However, this finding was not consistent, and in studies that showed a decrease in immature anopheline populations, the effect was not consistently sustained. <b>Larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> may reduce the number of water sources with Anopheles larvae and pupae (five studies, unpooled data, low quality evidence). None of the included studies reported effects of <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> on local native fish populations or other species. Authors' conclusions: Reliable research is insufficient to show whether introducing <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> reduces malaria transmission or the density of adult anopheline mosquito populations. In research examining the effects on immature anopheline stages of introducing fish to potential malaria vector breeding sites (localized water bodies such as wells and domestic water sources, rice field plots, and water canals) weak evidence suggests an effect on the density or presence of immature anopheline mosquitoes with high stocking levels of fish, but this finding is by no means consistent. We do not know whether this translates into health benefits, either with fish alone or with fish combined with other vector control measures. Our interpretation of the current evidence is that countries should not invest in fish stocking as a larval control measure in any malaria transmission areas outside the context of carefully controlled field studies or quasi-experimental designs. Research could also usefully examine the effects on native fish and other non-target species. 65 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The {{saltwater}} mosquito, Aedes vigilax, is prolific {{in coastal}} wetlands including mangroves and saltmarshes. Ae. vigilax is a vector for arboviruses such as Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses, with significant consequences {{for human health}} and economic productivity. In Australia the dominant form of mosquito control is chemicals. For mangroves, this is because there is a critical lack of knowledge supporting alternative approaches, such as environmental modification or biological control using <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish.</b> This review examines the potential of fish as biological agents for the control of mosquito larvae in mangroves. We consider two key aspects: how <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> use mangroves; and can <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> reduce larval mosquito populations sufficiently to provide effective mosquito control? The link between fish and mangroves is reasonably well established, where mangroves act as refuge habitat for small and juvenile fish. Also, research has established that fish can be significant predators of mosquitoes, and therefore may be effective control agents. However, studies of fish activity within mangroves are limited to study of the fringe of the mangroves and not the internal structure of mangrove basins and as a result, fish populations within these areas remain unstudied. Also, until recently there was little appreciation of the mangrove-mosquito habitat relationship and, as a consequence, the importance of the mangrove basin as the key mosquito habitat has also been overlooked in the literature. Similarly, the predator/prey relationships between fish and mosquitoes within mangrove basin environments also remain unstudied, and therefore the importance of fish for mosquito management in mangrove basins is not known. There are substantial knowledge gaps regarding the potential of fish in controlling larval mosquitoes in mangroves. The gaps include: understanding of how <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> use mangrove basins; the nature of the fish-mosquito predator/prey relationship in mangrove basins; and whether <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> are effective as a mosquito control option in mangroves.

However, the use of synthetic insecticides to control Culicidae may lead to high operational costs and adverse non-target effects. Plant-borne compounds have been proposed for rapid extracellular synthesis of mosquitocidal nanoparticles. Their impact against biological control agents of mosquito larval populations has been poorly studied. We synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using the aqueous leaf extract of Mimusops elengi as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The formation of AgNP was studied using different biophysical methods, including UVâvis spectrophotometry, TEM, XRD, EDX and FTIR. Low doses of AgNP showed larvicidal and pupicidal toxicity against the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi and the arbovirus vector Aedes albopictus. AgNP LC 50 against A. stephensi ranged from 12. 53 (I instar larvae) to 23. 55 Â ppm (pupae); LC 50 against A. albopictus ranged from 11. 72 Â ppm (I) to 21. 46 Â ppm (pupae). In the field, the application of M. elengi extract and AgNP (10 Ã LC 50) led to 100 Â % larval reduction after 72 Â h. In adulticidal experiments, AgNP showed LC 50 of 13. 7 Â ppm for A. stephensi and 14. 7 Â ppm for A. albopictus. The predation efficiency of Gambusia affinis against A. stephensi and A. albopictus III instar larvae was 86. 2 and 81. 7 Â %, respectively. In AgNP-contaminated environments, predation was 93. 7 and 88. 6 Â %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Malaria {{control in}} Madhya Pradesh is complex because of vast tracts of forest with tribal settlement. Fifty four million {{individuals}} of various ethnic origins, accounting for 8 % {{of the total}} population of India, contributed 30 % of total malaria cases, 60 % of total falciparum cases and 50 % of malaria deaths in the country. Ambitious goals to control tribal malaria by launching "Enhanced Malaria Control Project" (EMCP) by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), with the World Bank assistance, became effective in September 1997 in eight north Indian states. Under EMCP, the programme used a broader mix of new interventions, i. e. insecticide-treated bed nets, spraying houses with effective residual insecticides, use of <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fishes,</b> rapid diagnostic tests for prompt diagnosis, treatment of the sick with effective radical treatment and increased public awareness and IEC. However, the challenge is to scale up these services. A retrospective analysis of data on malaria morbidity and associated mortality reported under the existing surveillance system of the Madhya Pradesh (Central India) for the years 1996 â 2007 was carried out to determine the impact of EMCP on malaria morbidity and associated mortality. Analysis revealed that despite the availability of effective intervention tools for the prevention and control of malaria, falciparum malaria remains uncontrolled and deaths due to malaria have increased. Precisely, the aim of this epidemiological analysis is to draw lessons applicable to all international aid efforts, bureaucracy, policy makers and programme managers in assessing its project performance as a new Global Malaria Action Plan is launched with ambitious goal of reducing malaria and its elimination by scaling up the use of existing tools. </p...|$|R

Method Comprehensive literature search of published and grey literature using PubMed, EMBASE (DMDI), Web of Science, WHOLIS, WILEY, LILACS, GIFT, Cochrane Library, ELDIS, New York Academy of Medicine Grey Literature Report and Google. All results were checked for duplicates and examined for eligibility. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed using RoBANS. Results Thirteen articles were considered eligible for inclusion. Incorporating a wide range of interventions and outcome measures, three were efficacy studies and 10 assessed community effectiveness. None of the studies were randomised or cluster-randomised controlled trials. All three efficacy studies and seven community effectiveness studies investigated fish as a single agent. All efficacy studies reported elimination of Aedes larvae from treated containers, while community effectiveness studies reported reductions in immature vector stages, two of which also detected a continuous decline over 2 years. An impact on adult mosquitoes was shown in only two community effectiveness studies. Reductions in dengue cases following intervention were reported in two studies, but {{it was not possible to}} attribute this to the intervention. Conclusion While the use of <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> as a single agent or in combination with other control measures could lead to reductions in immature vector stages, considerable limitations in all the studies restricted any conclusions with respect to the evaluation of community effectiveness.

40|$|Abstract: Ornamental fishes are {{the most}} popular pets in present day world. Among these orna-mental fishes, gold fish (Carrasius auratus (Linnaeus, 1758)) is the most admired {{ornamental}} fish through out the world and also in India. Most of the fish farmers associated with ornamental fish trade in India are engaged in captive cul-ture of gold fishes. Supply of suitable food during culture period is the most vital factor to achieve good growth and survival of gold fish, but proper knowledge regarding the most prefer-able food of gold fish is lacking. On the other hand, age-specific food preference in some fishes has been reported earlier. So, in the present study gold fish was selected to determine its food preference and experiment was also conducted to discern any age-specific food preference of gold fish. Previous works have considered gold fish as consumer of mosquito larvae but its po-tential as mosquito biocontrol agent has not been studied so far. So, the potential of gold fish as mosquito biocontrol agent was also studied. From the experiment, it has been observed that gold fish has significantly higher preference for live food than artificial food, more preferably for chironomid larvae. Gold fish has significantly higher mosquito larvae consumption rate than same aged guppy and Aplocheilus sp. under same hydrological parameter was also observed. So, from this study it can be concluded that supply of live food more preferably the chironomid larvae could be beneficial to get good growth and survival of gold fish in captive culture. As from this study it has also been observed that gold fish has significantly higher mosquito larvae con-sumption rate than popular <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fishes,</b> so in near future gold fish can not only be used as ornamental fish but also as an efficient mosquito biocontrol agent.

40|$|Background & objectives: The predatory {{potential}} of the <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fishes</b> can {{be affected by the}} presence of alternative preys. In the present study the predation pattern of the sewage dwelling Poecilia reticulata (Peters 1872) on the larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus Say 1823 (Diptera: Culicidae) was evaluated in the presence of alternative preys. Methods: The predation of Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae by different size groups of P. reticulata fishes was evaluated. In addition to this, the niche breadth (N) and diet breadth (B) were measured following Manlyâs selectivity index (Si) as an indicator of variation of such predation pattern in the presence of alternative prey types, like chironomid larvae and tubificid worms. Results: The consumption of IV instar Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae by individual P. reticulata ranged between 65 and 84 in a 3 h feeding period and varied with the size of fish (F 2, 33 = 34. 91; p< 0. 001). The selectivity coefficient revealed a significantly low preference for the Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae (0. 16, CL: 0. 05 â 0. 27; p< 0. 05) compared to the chironomid larvae and tubificid worms, when all the three prey types were present. The niche breadth (N) and diet breadth (B) ranged from 0. 77 to 0. 92 and 0. 69 to 0. 93, respectively. The total consumption of all the prey types varied with the predator density, but the selectivity index for the mosquito larvae was significantly low in all the instances. Interpretation & conclusion: P. reticulata can consume a good number of mosquito larvae, with the consumption rate varying with the body size. P. reticulata fishes exhibit low preference for mosquito larvae as prey in the presence of alternative controphic preys like chironomid larvae and tubificid worms. Though establishment and sustenance of P. reticulata in new habitats will be favoured by the presence of alternative preys, but vulnerability of mosquito larvae may be reduced with availability of multiple preys in natural conditions...|$|R

In order to improve {{the knowledge of the}} determinants of malaria transmission in this city, the present study reports the results of an extensive entomological survey that was conducted in 45 areas in Dakar from 2007 to 2010. Methods Water collections were monitored for the presence of anopheline larvae. Adult mosquitoes were sampled by human landing collection. Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoÃ¯te (CSP) protein indexes were measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the entomological inoculation rates were calculated. Results The presence of anopheline larvae were recorded in 1, 015 out of 2, 683 observations made from 325 water collections. A water pH of equal to or above 8. 0, a water temperature that was equal to or above 30 Â°C, the absence of <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fishes,</b> the wet season, the presence of surface vegetation, the persistence of water and location in a slightly urbanised area were significantly associated with the presence of anopheline larvae and/or with a higher density of anopheline larvae. Most of the larval habitats were observed in public areas, i. e., freely accessible. A total of 496, 310 adult mosquitoes were caught during 3096 person-nights, and 44967 of these specimens were identified as An. gambiae s. l. The mean An. gambiae s. l. human-biting rate ranged from 0. 1 to 248. 9 bites per person per night during the rainy season. Anopheles arabiensis (93. 14 %), Anopheles melas (6. 83 %) and An. gambiae s. s. M form (0. 03 %) were the three members of the An. gambiae complex. Fifty-two An. arabiensis and two An. melas specimens were CSP-positive, and the annual CSP index was 0. 64 % in 2007, 0. 09 % in 2008 - 2009 and 0. 12 % in 2009 - 2010. In the studied areas, the average EIR ranged from 0 to 17. 6 infected bites per person during the entire transmission season. Conclusion The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of An. gambiae s. l. larval density, adult human-biting rate (HBR) and malaria transmission in Dakar has been confirmed, and the environmental factors associated with this heterogeneity have been identified. These results pave the way for the creation of malaria risk maps and for a focused anti-vectorial control strategy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{ability of}} the native <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> Aplocheilus panchax (Hamilton, 1822) (Cyprinodontiformes:Aplocheilidae) as {{predator}} of mosquito larvae was assessed under laboratory conditions using multiple prey andhabitat conditions. Methods: The consumption of larvae of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus Say 1823 (Diptera: Culicidae) byA. panchax was evaluated {{in the presence of}} tubificid worms and chironomid larvae under complex and simplehabitat conditions. The number of mosquito larvae consumed in comparison to other prey types was noted andan index of prey selectivity was used to evaluate the preference for mosquito larvae. Results: Aphlocheilus panchax consumed 53 to 65 mosquito larvae in a three hour feeding bout contrast to 29 â 38 tubificid worms and 43 â 62 chironomid larvae depending on the habitat conditions. The prey consumptiondiffered significantly between the habitats and the prey type. The index of prey selectivity was positive for Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae over other alternative prey in all the habitat conditions. Conclusion: It is apparent from the study that the <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> A. panchax can be employed for biologicalregulation of mosquitoes in rice-fields and similar wetlands where the multiple prey choices are available undercomplex habitat conditions.

40|$|Background & objectives: To {{ensure that}} the {{activities}} of Malaria Control Programme were takingplace in effective and judicious manner, an intensive monitoring and supervision of various activitiesof the programme were carried out in Karbi-Anglong, Cachar and Nagaon districts of Assam,India during JulyâOctober 2007. Methods: Questionnaire-based protocol prepared by the National Vector Borne Disease ControlProgramme {{was used to evaluate}} the activities. Sixteen villages belonging to five different PrimaryHealth Centres (PHCs) of three districts were selected for investigations. Results: Results of monitoring of indoor residual spraying (IRS) revealed inadequate sprayingcoverage. Although recorded to be about 69 â 99 %, but apparently it was 17 â 43 % in the districtsinvestigated. Cross-examination of 180 blood smears (90 positive and negative each) in thelaboratories of the study PHCs, revealed discrepancy in the results of 67 blood smears. Maximum(44 %) discrepancy was observed in positive blood smears and 30 % in negative blood smears. Outof 22 Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) interrogated, none was found involved inantimalaria activities. However, out of 13 fever treatment depots monitored, one was found partiallyfunctional. Criteria laid down for preparation of micro action plan were not followed properly inany of the districts sruveyed. Various important components of the programme like constitution ofVillage Health Sanitation Committee, information education communication (IEC) activities,capacity building, use of <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fishes,</b> supervision, etc. were not exercised properly. However, 100 % community acceptance was recorded for insecticide-treated bed nets in the villages surveyed. Indiscriminate use of rapid diagnostic test kits yielded poor and unsatisfactory response. Decliningtrend of malaria was observed during 2002 â 06 in Districts Nagaon and Karbi-Anglong (up to 2005). In District Cachar, however, a little increasing trend was observed during 2002 â 04. Conclusion: The results of this investigation revealed that the malaria control programme hadbeen jeopardized seriously due to improper implementation of vector control measures, lack ofadequate professional support and varied commitment {{on the part of the}} State Government. It canbe concluded that long-term malaria control strategy should be based on generation of increasedawareness on the disease and various methods of its control, health care access and administrativecommitment for increased prosperity in resource-poor settings.

40|$|The {{call for}} malaria control, {{over the last}} century, marked a new epoch {{in the history of}} this disease.

40|$|Tidal marsh {{wetlands}} {{provide important}} foraging habitat {{for a variety}} of estuarine fishes. Prey organisms include benthicâepibenthic macroinvertebrates, neustonic arthropods, and zooplankton. Little is known about the abundance and distribution of interior marsh macroinvertebrate communities in the San Francisco Estuary (estuary). We describe seasonal, regional, and site variation in the composition and abundance of neuston and benthicâepibenthic macroinvertebrates that inhabit tidal marsh channels, and relate these patterns to environmental conditions. We also describe spatial and temporal variation in diets of marsh-associated inland silverside, yellowfin goby, and western mosquitofish. Fish and invertebrates were sampled quarterly from October 2003 to June 2005 at six marsh sites located in three river systems of the northern estuary: Petaluma River, Napa River, andÂ  the west Delta. Benthic/epibenthic macroinvertebrates and neuston responded to environmental variables related to seasonal changes (i. e., temperature, salinity), as well as those related to marsh structure (i. e., vegetation, channel edge). The greatest variation in abundance occurred seasonally for neuston and spatially for benthicâepibenthic organisms, suggesting that each community responds to different environmental drivers. Benthic/epibenthic invertebrate abundance and diversity was lowest in the west Delta, and increased with increasing salinity. Insect abundance increased during the spring and summer, while Collembolan (springtail) abundance increased during the winter. Benthic/epibenthic macroinvertebrates dominated fish diets, supplemented by insects, with zooplankton playing a minor role. Diet compositions of the three fish species overlapped considerably, with strong selection indicated for epibenthic crustaceansâa surprising result given the typical classification of Menidia beryllina as a planktivore, Acanthogobius flavimanus as a benthic predator, and Gambusia affinis as a <b>larvivorous</b> surface-feeder. <b>Fish</b> diets were influenced by position along the estuarine gradient and season. Overall, our data show that local-scale site effects and marsh position within the estuary influence invertebrate community composition and abundance. Additionally, we show that restoring marsh ecosystems can subsidize fishes similarly to reference marshes. We, thus, recommend that managers focus on the ability of restoring marshes to produce food subsidies for target species when planning and designing tidal marsh restoration projects, especially those targeted for food web support. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Biological control {{methods are}} once again being given much {{research}} focus for malaria vector control. This {{is largely due to}} the emerging threat of strong resistance to pesticides. <b>Larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> have been used for over 100 years in mosquito control and many species have proved effective. In the western Kenyan highlands the <b>larvivorous</b> <b>fish</b> Oreochromis niloticus L. (Perciformes: Cichlidae) (formerly Tilapia nilotica) is commonly farmed and eaten but has not been previously tested in the field for malaria mosquito control. Methods This fish was introduced into abandoned fishponds at an altitude of 1, 880 m and the effect measured over six months on the numbers of mosquito immatures. For comparison an untreated control pond was used. During this time, all ponds were regularly cleared of emergent vegetation and fish re-stocking was not needed. Significant autocorrelation was removed from the time series data, and t-tests were used to investigate within a pond and within a mosquito type any differences before and after the introduction of O. niloticus. Mulla's formula was also used on the raw data to calculate the percentage reduction of the mosquito larvae. Results After O. niloticus introduction, mosquito densities immediately dropped in the treated ponds but increased in the control pond. This increase was apparently due to climatic factors. Mulla's formula was applied which corrects for that natural tendency to increase. The results showed that after 15 weeks the fish caused a more than 94 % reduction in both Anopheles gambiae s. l. and Anopheles funestus (Diptera: Culicidae) in the treated ponds, and more than 75 % reduction in culicine mosquitoes. There was a highly significantly reduction in A. gambiae s. l. numbers when compared to pre-treatment levels. Conclusion This study reports the first field trial data on O. niloticus for malaria mosquito control and shows that this species, already a popular food fish in western Kenya, is an apparently sustainable mosquito control tool which also offers a source of protein and income to people in rural areas. There should be no problem with acceptance of this malaria control method since the local communities already farm this fish species. </p...|$|E
