40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a dynamic hierarchical database architecture for location management in personal communications service (PCS) networks. The proposed scheme allows the dynamic adjustments of user location information distribution {{based on the}} mobility and calling patterns of the mobile terminals (MT’s). A unique distribution strategy is determined for each MT, and location pointers are set up at selected remote locations which indicate the current location of the MT’s. This method effectively reduces the signaling and database access overhead for location registration and call delivery. Besides, the required processing is handled by a distributed network of directory registers and centralized coordination is not necessary. The functions of the other network elements, such as the home <b>location</b> <b>register</b> (HLR) and the visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (VLR’s), remain primarily unchanged. This greatly facilitates the deployment of this scheme in current PCS networks.

40|$|Abstract — In a 3 G {{cellular}} network, {{the visitor}} <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (VLRs), the gateway <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (GLRs), {{and the home}} <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (HLRs) form a three-level mobility database structure. When users leave a GLR/VLR service area, deregistration with a GLR/VLR is required. Deregistration may create significant traffic in the network, especially the traffic between a GLR and a HLR, which is the remote/international traffic. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical implicit deregistration scheme with a first/subsequent registration in 3 G cellular networks to effectively eliminate deregistration traffic. An analytic model is proposed {{to carry out the}} performance of the proposed scheme. Our study shows that the proposed scheme not only reduces the local deregistration traffic between the GLR and the VLR, but also reduces the remote/international deregistration traffic between the HLR and the GLR. This is especially true when the ratio {{of the cost of the}} remote/international traffic between the GLR and the HLR to the cost of local traffic between the VLR and the GLR is high.

40|$|Replication {{strategy}} is mostly useful for replicating the called mobile user’s profile at selected locations where some caller mobile users have higher calling rate. It plays {{important role in}} personal communication services (PCS) {{in order to reduce}} call setup cost and call setup time. In prior replication schemes, replicated sites (visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers)</b> have no inter relationship. We have proposed a novel and innovative replication tree which is buildup from replicated VLRs (visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers).</b> VLRs are replicated based on effective replication probability of caller mobile user. Home <b>location</b> <b>register</b> (HLR) keeps update replica at root VLR in the replication tree and root VLR forwards update replica to a VLR in the replication tree on demand. The main objective of the proposed scheme is to reduce call setup time and call setup cost by enabling replication of called mobile user’s location profile at certain visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (VLRs) where caller mobile user roams.

50|$|The {{key feature}} of a mobile phone {{is the ability}} to receive and make calls in any area where {{coverage}} is available. This is generally called roaming from a customer perspective, but also called visiting when describing the underlying technical process. Each geographic area has a database called the Visitor <b>Location</b> <b>Register</b> (VLR), which contains details of all the mobiles currently in that area. Whenever a phone attaches, or visits, a new area, the Visitor <b>Location</b> <b>Register</b> must contact the Home <b>Location</b> <b>Register</b> to obtain the details for that phone. The current cellular location of the phone (i.e., which BTS it is at) is entered into the VLR record and will be used during a process called paging when the GSM network wishes to locate the mobile phone.|$|R

40|$|AbstractÐIn a {{cellular}} phone system, mobility databases called visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (VLRs) are used to temporarily hold the subscription information of the roaming users who visit the service area of the VLR. When the users leave the VLR area, the corresponding records in the VLR are deleted. Due to user mobility, {{the capacity of the}} VLR may not be large enough to hold information for all visitors in the VLR area at some time periods. This issue is called VLR overflow. This paper describes a record replacement policy to allow mobile users to receive services in the VLR overflow situation. We utilize analytic modeling to investigate the performance of the replacement policy. The study indicates that our approach effectively eliminates the VLR overflow problem with insignificant extra overhead.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two mobile {{location management}} algorithms for ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks {{based on the}} PNNI (private network-to-network interface) standard. The first solution is called the mobile PNNI scheme because it builds on the PNNI routing protocol. It uses limitedscope (characterized by a parameter S) reachability updates, forwarding pointers, and a route optimization procedure. The second solution is called the LR (<b>location</b> <b>registers)</b> scheme because it introduces <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (such as the cellular home and visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers)</b> into the PNNI standards-based hierarchical networks. This scheme uses a hierarchical arrangement of <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> with the hierarchy limited to a certain level S. Analytical models are set up to compare the average move, search, and total costs per move of these two schemes for different values of the CMR (call-to-mobility ratio), and to provide guidelines for selecting parameters of the algorithms. Results show that at low CMR's (CMR ! 0. 025), the LR scheme performs better than the mobile PNNI scheme. We also observe that the two schemes show a contrasting behavior {{in terms of the}} value to be used for the parameter S to achieve the least average total cost. At low CMR's, the parameter S should be high for the mobile PNNI scheme, but low for the LR scheme, and vice versa for high CMR's. Index Terms [...] -Mobility management, PNNI, wireless ATM. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Location {{management}} {{is a key}} issue in personal communication service networks to guarantee the mobile terminals to continuously receive services when moving {{from one place to}} another. In this paper, we study two location management schemes, a dynamic movement-based scheme (DYNAMIC- 3 G) and a static scheme (STATIC- 3 G), for 3 G cellular networks where home <b>location</b> <b>registers,</b> gateway <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (GLRs), and visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> form a three-level hierarchical mobility database structure. For both schemes, the cost functions are formulated analytically. We prove that there is an optimal movement threshold that minimizes the total cost function of DYNAMIC- 3 G and propose a binary search algorithm to find the optimal threshold. Furthermore, we present performance evaluation and comparison of the proposed schemes with the previous schemes in 2 G cellular networks where the GLR is not present. Our studies validate the optimality of the DYNAMIC- 3 G scheme and show that the proposed schemes outperform the previous schemes, especially when the remote-local-cost ratio is high. The comparison results between DYNAMIC- 3 G and STATIC- 3 G indicate that DYNAMIC- 3 G should be adopted when the mobility rate is low, and STATIC- 3 G should be adopted otherwise. Furthermore, DYNAMIC- 3 G tends to perform better than STATIC- 3 G when the paging cost is high or the number of cells in a location area is large.
