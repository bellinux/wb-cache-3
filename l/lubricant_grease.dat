50|$|Grease is a semisolid <b>lubricant.</b> <b>Grease</b> {{generally}} {{consists of}} a soap emulsified with mineral or vegetable oil. The characteristic feature of greases is that they possess a high initial viscosity, which upon the application of shear, drops to give the effect of an oil-lubricated bearing of approximately the same viscosity as the base oil used in the grease. This change in viscosity is called shear thinning. Grease is sometimes used to describe lubricating materials that are simply soft solids or high viscosity liquids, but these materials do not exhibit the shear-thinning properties characteristic of the classical grease. For example, petroleum jellies such as Vaseline are not generally classified as greases.|$|E

40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} {{is one of}} {{the effective}} techniques used for the condition monitoring of rolling element bearings. Contamination {{is one of the}} major reasons for bearing early failure due to presence of solid particle in <b>lubricant</b> <b>grease.</b> In most cases, outer race is stationary and the inner race is attached to the rotating assembly. The lubrication is very essential for the bearing to perform under various demanding conditions. The main aim of this project is to analyze the effect of contamination of lubricant by solid particles on the dynamic behavior of rolling bearing. Green sand at three concentration levels 5 %, 15 %, 25 % and different particle sizes 75 μm, 106 μm and 150 μm is used to contaminate the lubricant. Experimental tests have been performed for different load and speed condition in good and contaminated ball bearings lubricated with grease. The trends in the amount of AE waves affected by the contamination of the grease were determined. Acoustic emission signals were analyzed in terms of RMS, kurtosis, and peak-peak...|$|E

40|$|Management {{of rolling}} contact fatigue (RCF) risk is a {{critical}} maintenance activity in railway operations. Practical means of RCF mitigation involve: 1) preventative and corrective grinding to remove RCF cracks; 2) management of wheel and rail profiles to minimize peak contact pressures; and 3) selection of appropriate rail metallurgy. In addition, reduction of traction forces by application of dry film Top of Rail friction modifiers (FM) has recently been shown to reduce crack growth and extend grinding intervals. Hydro-pressurisation and crack face lubrication are processes by which liquid materials (e. g., water), enter pre-existing RCF cracks and under wheel/rail contact pressure and cause accelerated crack growth, leading to spalling and shelling on rail and wheels. Thus, any liquid material added deliberately to the wheel/rail interface should be considered carefully {{in terms of the}} potential for aggravating RCF damage. This study compares the impact on hydro-pressurization and crack face lubrication of different types of materials designed for application to the top of rail using twin disc testing. One type of FM material is water-based, drying providing solid particles to the rail-wheel contact. Two other types are oil or oil-plus-water-based (hybrid material) that do not naturally dry and have been introduced more recently to the market. In addition, a commonly used gauge face <b>lubricant</b> (<b>grease)</b> was evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Grease is {{a mixture}} of a fluid {{lubricant}} usually petroleum oil and a thickener (soap) dispersed in the oil. The base oil (petroleum) can be changed by using the castor waste. Other than base oil, thickener may {{play an important role in}} the mixture. Soap thickeners are formed by reacting metallic hydroxide, or alkali, with a fat, fatty acid, or ester. Since the petroleum prices were increase each year, using castor waste as base oil is the best solution to produce grease in the low cost at the same time it will decrease the water pollution. The objective of this research is to produce special <b>lubricant</b> <b>grease</b> from castor waste with bentonite. In this research, preparation and formulation of bio-based grease and quality and performances of grease were studied. The characteristics of produced grease were analyzed in order to evaluate the performance of the grease. The testing (type of thickener, dropping point test, viscosity test and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, FTIR analysis) have been done on the formulated greases to determine the properties. It was discovered that formulated grease has no dropping point which proves that the greases has stable structure at higher temperature. Therefore, the formulated greases has high potential to be used in wide range of industries such as the cars, ships, aircrafts and most of the industries that deals with heavy duty equipment...|$|E
40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} {{are common}} in any rotating machinery. The rolling element bearings subjected to failure under continuous running. Therefore they have received great attention {{in the field of}} condition monitoring. Different methods are detection and diagnosis of the bearing defects. Among them the commonly used technique is vibration signature analysis. The information obtained from the system vibration can be used for identifying its response subjected to various conditions. In rolling element bearing, contamination of <b>lubricant</b> <b>grease</b> by solid particles is one among the several reasons for early bearing failure. The main objective of this project is to investigate the effect of lubricant contamination by solid particles on rolling element bearing. This work is carried out to determine the vibrations on good and defective bearing in healthy grease and contaminant grease conditions. Obtained the vibration characteristics of healthy grease tested ball bearings are compared with those of contaminant grease tested ball bearings. Vibration signals are acquired from the ball bearings assembled in an experimental rig. The radial load was applied to the outer ring of the test bearing. An accelerometer placed on bearing housing measures radial vibration both in vertical and horizontal. The SKF-LGWA type of lubricants is used in this test, and also different types of solid particles are used as contaminants. The effect of contaminant concentration and particle size on vibration is to be studied. A way of monitorin...|$|E
