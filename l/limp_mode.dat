5000|$|Remove {{fallback}} code (<b>limp</b> <b>mode)</b> and fallback data (default values): These {{can hide}} defects {{in the main}} implementation, or, from the user point of view, {{hide the fact that}} the software is working suboptimally. Special attention to unimplemented parts may be needed as part of factory acceptance testing, as yet unimplemented code is at no stage of test driven development discoverable by failing unit tests.|$|E
5000|$|Automotive tests {{itself to}} enhance safety and reliability. For example, most {{vehicles}} with antilock brakes test them once per safety interval. If the antilock brake system has a broken wire or other fault, the brake system reverts to operating {{as a normal}} brake system. Most automotive engine controllers incorporate a [...] "limp mode" [...] for each sensor, so that the engine will continue to operate if the sensor or its wiring fails. Another, more trivial example of a <b>limp</b> <b>mode</b> is that some cars test door switches, and automatically turn lights on using seat-belt occupancy sensors if the door switches fail.|$|E
50|$|Cataclean DPF is {{designed}} to prevent Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) breaking down. Under EU law DPFs are now fitted to all new vehicles which run on diesel. DPFs sometimes experience problems when used on short, stop-start journeys in urban areas causing vehicles to enter <b>limp</b> <b>mode.</b> DPFs are meant to clean themselves on a long journey or motorway drive, but if they {{spend too much time}} in a congested area they become clogged and can break down. From February 2014 the UK Government announced cars which have had their DPF removed will fail their MOT, or annual test for heavy vehicles. Cleaning products such as Cataclean DPF protect DPFs by reducing soot emissions, assisting the DPF to regenerate and reducing risk of it becoming clogged.|$|E
50|$|Some of the 2005 {{and later}} Subaru vehicle Engines (especially the turbo charged engines) are using CAN bus as their sole Vehicle/Vessel speed input channel. When those ABS Speed signal are removed, the ECU will force the Engine {{to run in}} <b>limp</b> home <b>mode.</b> This has posed some {{challenge}} for {{people who try to}} use the same automotive boxer 2.5L and 3.3L engines on Aerospace application, engine replacement for aged Subaru vehicles, and VW Vanagon modifications, etc.|$|R
25|$|On February 14, 2014, Toyota {{announced}} a global recall of third generation Prius. The recall {{is related to}} a software fault having been identified in the hybrid-control system which might cause the hybrid drive inverter transistors to overheat. This will cause the car {{to go into a}} limited performance <b>mode</b> (i.e. <b>limp</b> home <b>mode)</b> or may even stall the car entirely. Owners will be notified with a letter to rectify the problem for free of charge or reimbursement for anyone who was charged to rectify the problem prior to recall.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the oil cooler seals; this engine can also have an issue with {{the design of the}} positive crankcase ventilation system. The crankcase ventilation system vents to the inlet of the turbo. The issue is that the air vented from the crankcase contains too much oil to easily pass through the swirl motor valves downstream of the turbo. Once this oil and sludge begin to accumulate, the valve becomes inoperative and blows a fuse that controls many other sensors required to properly operate the engine and emission system. This will immediately place the vehicle into <b>limp</b> home <b>mode</b> and limit the rpm to 3000. It also causes a check engine light and numerous OBDII Codes. Mercedes Benz has previously recognized this feature of the vehicle and has stated that this engine feature, the accumulation of oil at the turbo inlet, is [...] "normal". In a Technical Service Bulletin they issued in 2008 they state:"Engine oil venting occurs on the right hand side of the engine air intake duct. For this reason there is always some oil in the engine air intake duct, see (Figure 3). This is no justification for replacing the turbocharger. Turbochargers replaced for this reason will not be covered by warranty." [...] While a slight amount of oil may be normal and acceptable, sufficient quantities and accumulation will indeed lead to other failures as identified above.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this {{electronic}} era, modern automobiles {{are designed}} with electronically controlled throttles with CAN (Controller Area Network) [1] Bus which limits the vehicle's speed and protects the vehicle engine in a single cost-effective system. Generally, CAN Bus link is used to monitor the engine diagnostic faults and alerts the driver for one or more failure modes via an audible alarm or an LED. Our idea is to include the driver's emotional state as an additional feature for the control of speed. Firstly, the driver's emotional state such as sadness, anger, fear, disgust is analyzed by using the speech processing technique. When any one of this state is predicted, then the system incrementally limits the vehicle speed and ultimately <b>limps</b> to home <b>mode</b> until the driver comes to normal state or the engine fault is rectified. This system is mainly intended for avoiding accidents and road safety...|$|R
40|$|The 17 XS 6500 is {{the latest}} {{achievement}} in automotive lighting drivers. It belongs to an expanding family to control and diagnose incandescent lamps and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with enhanced precision. It combines flexibility through daisy-chainable SPI 5. 0 MHz, extended digital and analog feedbacks, safety and robustness. Output edge shaping helps to improve electromagnetic performance. To avoid shutting off the device upon inrush current, while still being able to closely track the load current, a dynamic overcurrent threshold profile is featured. Current of each channel can be sensed with a programmable sensing ratio. Whenever communication with the external microcontroller is lost, the device enters a Fail operation mode, but remains operational, controllable, and protected. This new generation of high side switch products family facilitates ECU design thanks to compatible MCU software and PCB foot print for each device variant. This family is packaged in a Pb-free power-enhanced SOIC package with exposed pad which is End of Life Vehicles directive compliant. Features • Penta 17 m � high side switches with high transient current capability • 16 -bit 5. 0 MHz SPI control of overcurrent profiles, channel control including PWM duty cycles, output-ON and-OFF OpenLoad detections, thermal shutdown and prewarning, and fault reporting • Output current monitoring with programmable synchronization signal and battery voltage feedback • <b>Limp</b> Home <b>mode</b> • External smart power switch control • 6. 0 to 28 V operating voltage •- 16 V reverse polarity and ground disconnect protections • Compatible PCB foot print and SPI software driver among the famil...|$|R
50|$|The {{injection}} of fuel or the quantity of injected fuel has a decisive influence on engine starting, idling, power and emissions. The engine ECU is programmed ("mapped") with relevant data to where the fuel rack position has an equivalent signal {{for the amount of}} fuel being injected. The driver requests the torque or engine speed requirements via accelerator pedal potentiometer thereby sending a signal to the engine ECU which then, depending on its mapping and data collected from various sensors, calculates in real time the quantity of injected fuel required, thus altering the fuel rack to the required position.The driver can also input additional commands such as idle speed increase to compensate e.g. for PTO operation which can be either variably set or has a preset speed which can be recalled. The road speed function can be used to evaluate vehicle speed and possibly activate a speed limiter (Heavy Vehicles), or maintain or restore a set speed (cruise control). Further functions can include exhaust brake operation which, when activated, will result in the fuel pump rack position being set to zero delivery or idle. The engine ECU can also interface with various other vehicle systems e.g. traction control and carry out self monitoring duties and self diagnostic functions to keep the system working at an optimal level. To ensure the safe operation in case of failure, the <b>limp</b> home <b>mode</b> functions are also integrated into the system, e.g. should the pump speed sensor fail the ECU can use an alternator speed signal function for engine RPMs counter as a backup signal.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{ever more}} {{stringent}} requirements {{in terms of}} emissions control, driveability, and safety of automobiles {{have led to the}} development of the drive by wire (DBW) concept, a new architecture for engine control systems, with the purpose of managing air, fuel and ignition in an integrated way. The throttle control plays an important role in the development of DBW sys-tems. Despite its apparent simplicity, the position control of the throttle valve is quite a complex problem, due to application con-straints and system characteristics. Very high robustness must be linked with limited cost, as required by a mass production device. A cascaded control structure including a nonlinear trajectory gener-ator filter is adopted, allowing each different control problem to be solved with the most suitable control algorithm and implementa-tion technology. In this regard, the use of variable structure control techniques is the key element to reaching the solution. Extensive simulation tests are reported to show the performance of the pro-posed control algorithm. A throttle step from 0. 5 to 89. 5 indicates good position tracking under realistic operating conditions, with a position error smaller than 1. The same simulation is performed at a battery voltage of 9 V to check the controller robustness. A pro-totype controller is presented. The experimental implementation of the controller for a step from 2. 5 to 85. 5 indicates a very smooth position trajectory with a maximum dynamic position error of 7. A small throttle step from 1 to 7 (which contains the nonlinearity of the <b>limp</b> home <b>mode</b> spring) was also tested and resulted in very good position response with the maximum position error of 2. Ap-plication specifications are fully satisfied both in terms of control performance and controller cost. Index Terms—Automotive, drive by wire, sliding mode, variable structure. I...|$|R
