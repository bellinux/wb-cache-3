5|$|Sections 21–23 {{cover the}} review of agents and the {{liability}} of trustees for agents actions. Section 21 identifies that review and liability occurs when the trustees appoints agents, nominees and custodians under the Act or under similar provisions in the trust instrument. Section 22 provides a duty on trustees who delegate their powers, with the duty consisting of three elements. Firstly, trustees are required {{to make sure that}} agent is suitable for the job he is employed to do. Secondly, they are required to consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it. Thirdly, trustees are required to intervene after appointment if the circumstances demand it. Section 23 establishes trustees' liability for the actions of agents; a trustee is <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>negligence</b> if he violates the general duty of care set out in Section 1, but not otherwise.|$|E

In 2015, Sanders defended his vote, saying: [...] "If somebody has a gun and it falls {{into the hands of}} a murderer and the murderer kills somebody with a gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible?

2500|$|The tort of {{trespass}} was inapplicable, as {{the flooding}} was deemed {{not to be}} [...] "direct and immediate"; the tort of nuisance was rejected as this was a one-off event. The case was first heard by Mellor J and a special jury in September 1862 at the Liverpool Assizes; a court order led to an arbitrator from the Exchequer of Pleas being appointed in December 1864. The arbitrator decided that the contractors were <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>negligence,</b> since they had known about the old mine shafts. Fletcher, however, {{had no way of}} knowing about the mine shafts and so was not.|$|E

In addition, the jury held the defendants, excluding CAN, liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding they [...] "intentionally or recklessly acted in a way so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and {{to be regarded as}} atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second primary {{area where}} courts {{have sought to}} {{constrain}} trustee discretion, but recently have retreated, is in the rule that trustees' decisions may be interfered with if irrelevant issues are taken into account, or relevant issues are ignored. There had been suggestions that a decision could be wholly void, {{which led to a}} flood of claims where trustees had failed to get advice on taxation of trust transactions and were sometimes successful in having the transaction annulled and escaping payments to the Revenue. However, in the leading case, Pitt v Holt the Supreme Court reaffirmed that poorly considered decisions may only become voidable (and so cannot be cancelled if a third party, like the Revenue, is affected) and only if mistakes are [...] "fundamental" [...] can a transaction be wholly void. In one appeal, a trustee for her husband's worker compensation got poor advice and was liable for more inheritance tax, and in the second, a trustee for his children got poor advice and was liable for more capital gains tax. The UK Supreme Court found that both transactions were valid. If a trustee had acted in breach of duty, but within its powers, then a transaction was voidable. However, on the facts, the trustees seeking advice had fulfilled their duty (and so the advisers could be <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>negligence</b> instead).|$|E

40|$|In June 1992, {{the issue}} of whether a surgeon could be held <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the <b>negligence</b> of an {{anesthesiologist}} was examined by the tribunal of Leuven (1). Liability was asserted not only against the negligent anesthesiologist, but also against the surgeon. The judgement is most interesting and raises many controversial points of law. Although, in most jurisdictions today, it is recognized that the surgeon is no longer the captain of the ship, but shares the responsibility with other colleagues such as the anesthesiologist, the Belgian judge, free as the trier of fact, can exceptionally hold a member of a surgical team <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the <b>negligence</b> of his colleague. A critical analysis of this and two other recent cases in Belgium forms the basis of this paper, which deals with the liability of the surgeon <b>for</b> the anesthesiologist's <b>negligence.</b> This article will centre around four issues: First, the nature of the contractual relationship between anesthesiologist and patient. Second, the liability (criminal and civil) of a team member for his own fault if he observes a negligent colleague and does not take the appropriate measures. Third, the liability in Belgian tort law of the surgeon for the negligent anesthesiologist. Fourth, the liability in Belgian contract law of the surgeon for the anesthesiologist...|$|R

40|$|The Liability of Charitable Corporations for the Torts {{of their}} Servants. [...] This {{question}} was discussed quite {{fully in the}} last number of the REVIEW, pp. 552 - 559, under the title Liability of Hospitals <b>for</b> the <b>Negligence</b> of their Physicians and Nurses, particular attention being given to the reasons underlying the doctrine that charitable corporations are not <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the <b>negligence</b> of their servants, provided proper care has been exercised in their selection, and to the limitations within which that doctrine should be confined. It was concluded that the true reason for the doctrine {{is not to be}} found, as many cases apparently hold, in the inviolability of trust funds, or, as some hold, in the exercise of a sound public policy, but rather in the contract relation which those who receive the benefits of the charity occupy toward such funds, and that the doctrine should be limited in its application to those who have expressly contracted that they will not hold the corporation <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the <b>negligence</b> of its servants and those who, by accepting the benefits of the charity, impliedly contract that they will not, provided proper care has been exercised in the selection of such servants. Among the cases cited in support of the proposition that public charities are not <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the <b>negligence</b> of servants on account of the inviolability of trust funds was that of Downes v. Harper Hospital, 101 Mich. 555, 6 o N. W. Rep. 42, 25 L. R. A. 6 o 2, 45 Am. St. Rep. 427. Apparently this case stood for that doctrine. At all events, it had been frequently cited as authority for the doctrine. But in the recent case of Bruce v. Central Methodist Episcopal Church, decided by the Michigan Supreme Court, March 5, 1907, and reported in 110 N. W. Rep., 951, the Downes Case is distinguished and its apparent doctrine materially limited. The writer of the note in the last number of the REVIEW had not, {{at the time of its}} preparation, seen the case of Bruce v. Central Methodist Episcopal Church, and did not have the advantage of the excellent opinions filed therein, but it is quite apparent that they were inspired by the exhaustive opinion that inspired the note, namely, that of JUDGE LOWELL in Powers v.
