In a famous 1929 study, An Institutional Approach to the Law of Commercial Banking, Moore and co-author Theodore S. Hope, Jr. attempted to explain banking law judicial decisions that did not appear to derive from existing legal rules (<b>lex</b> <b>lata).</b> The authors examined banks’ then common use of what were considered to be questionable practices and found that courts upheld a bank’s practice when it was in conformance with the practice of other banks in the area, even though it deviated from hypothetical “normal banking practice.” In later articles with Gilbert Sussman, Moore undertook an empirical survey of actual banking practices in discounting notes. Moore’s empirical emphasis in legal research characterized the body of his work.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent decades}} we can watch heated debates {{on the legal}} and moral {{permissibility}} of State-sponsored targeted killings involving representatives from Governments, academic circles, military and police forces, intelligence services, human rights groups, humanitarian institutions, intergovernmental organizations a and the mass media. These debates are even more intense after the killing of Osama bin Laden, leader of the terrorist group Al Qaeda, in May 2011. The aim of the thesis is to answer to the question: Are targeted killings a permissible method of fight against terrorism? The legality of targeted killings is analyzed in term of <b>lex</b> <b>lata</b> international law, namely under human rights law, international humanitarian law and law of international security. The thesis is composed of six chapters. Chapter One defines basic terminology used in the thesis. The Chapter is subdivided into two parts. Part One defines the concept of targeted killings.

40|$|Natural and human-made {{disasters}} cause {{on average}} 120, 000 deaths and over US$ 140 billion in {{damage to property}} and infrastructure every year, with national, regional and international actors consistently responding to the humanitarian imperative to alleviate suffering wherever it may be found. Despite various attempts to codify international disaster laws since the 1920 s, a right to humanitarian assistance remains contested, reflecting concerns regarding {{the relative importance of}} state sovereignty vis-à-vis individual rights under international law. However, the evolving acquis humanitaire of binding and non-binding normative standards for responses to humanitarian crises highlights the increasing focus on rights and responsibilities applicable in disasters; although the International Law Commission has also noted the difficulty of identifying <b>lex</b> <b>lata</b> and lex ferenda regarding the protection of persons in the event of disasters due to the “amorphous state of the law relating to international disaster response. ” Therefore, using the conceptual framework of transnational legal process, this thesis analyses the evolving normative frameworks and standards for rights-holders and duty-bearers in disasters. Determining the process whereby rights are created and evolve, and their potential internalisation into domestic law and policy, provides a powerful analytical framework for examining the progress and challenges of developing accountable responses to major disasters...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, the {{punishment}} of violations {{of the laws of}} war became of greater importance and the subject of heated debate than had hitherto been the case, not only for the British Government and its Allies, but also for members of the newly founded Grotius Society who had already worked on the topic during the war. The British Government proposed a number of innovative ideas that were a radical departure from the existing <b>lex</b> <b>lata</b> governing the laws of war. The most notable among them were that violations of the laws of war give rise to individual criminal responsibility for the actual perpetrators and high ranking officials, and even Heads of State, who order or fail to prevent them, and that injured belligerents have the right to try persons belonging to the enemy for such violations, including after hostilities have ceased. These ideas were far from uncontroversial. Yet they ultimately brought about a landmark change in the customary laws of war and were relied upon by Britain and its Allies during World War II. To date, the influence that Britain had in bringing about this change has been given little consideration in existing scholarship. This chapter uses a range of primary and secondary sources, including archival materials, in order to examine the pivotal role that Britain played. It also examines the work of members of the Grotius Society, on whose innovative ideas the British Government had relied...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that jus cogens norms are recognised to be non-derogable, and to bind all States because they protect {{the interests of}} the wider international community. If this is correct, it is incongruous that States could breach jus cogens norms with impunity. This thesis approaches this statement from two angles. Firstly, it questions whether States do in fact enjoy impunity; or whether there is a formal, or even ad hoc, practice of holding States accountable. Secondly, this thesis asks what it means to hold States accountable - whether the changing conception of international law, that accommodates jus cogens norms, is also developing to recognise a changing conception of State accountability. In order to answer these questions this thesis conceptualises State accountability as an interpretive framework, with which to analyse relevant State practice and identify juridical support for State accountability. In addition, consideration is given to how a theoretical concept of State accountability relates to existing doctrines of public international law and illustrates why it is that State and juridical support for a conceptual principle of accountability exists when there is already an established principle of State responsibility. It is submitted that rather than being an established legal principle, State accountability has legal, political and even moral characteristics and although the concept is currently lex feranda there is evidence of an evolution to <b>lex</b> <b>lata.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Since 1945 {{the focus}} of the {{principle}} of self-determination has been on decolonization. The remarkable success of the application of the principle in the decolonization process has established it as a hximan right, a norm of modern international law and (arguably) part of jus cogens. With decolonization virtually completed, the question is whether self-determination as a right of all peoples should still be legally valid in the post-colonial era. In this research the conclusion is reached that international law neither recognizes nor prohibits selfdetermination as a right in the post-colonial context, and that the law is in this sense "neutral". The neutrality of international law on the subject does not prejudge the issue as to the desirability of a recognition of the right in the post-colonial context. A fortiori it necessitates a rational analysis of the role of self-determination in the context of decolonization and the potential of the principle in the pos. t-colonial setting with the view to regulating competing claims. To this end, the research analyses the function of self-determination in decolonization and arrives at the conclusions that, within that context, self-determination is a putative remedial right aimed at remedying a specific form of human relations manifested by domination, exploitation and (or) a general denial of human rights. In the light of this, the research advances the thesis that in the post-colonial context, where inter-communal relationships in a sovereign state are characterized by similar trends of domination and denials of human rights, the application of self-determination could be a useful remedy. It also indicates that, as an inherently democratic principle, self-determination could be used to settle certain types of territorial disputes. Using the relationship between human rights and self-determination as the normative basis for a community policy on post-colonial self determination, the research recommends a set of substantive and procedural prescriptions on the support for or rejection of specific claims. The first two chapters of the research deal with the emergence of self-determination as a right in international law and its application in the colonial context. Chapter Three discusses the relationship between self-determination and other norms of international law, namely territorial integrity, domestic jurisdiction and the use of force (within the context of decolonization). In all, the first three chapters define the confines of self-determination as <b>lex</b> <b>lata.</b> Chapter Four addresses the issue as to whether self-determination exists as <b>lex</b> <b>lata</b> beyond the context of decolonization and concludes that it does not exist. Chapter Five is devoted to a normative inquiry into the desirability of recognizing a right of self-determination in the post-colonial context. The chapter draws the conclusion that in view of the persistence of competing claims usually accompanied by conflicts of international dimensions, and in view of the relationship between human rights and self-determination, it is desirable to recognize the right, at least in cases that involve gross deprivation of human rights (e. g. genocide). Chapter Six is devoted to a discussion of separatist movements that seek a right of self-determination in the post-colonial context. In Chapter Seven, human rights as the normative basis for a community policy on post-colonial self-determination is discussed. On the strength of the discussion, recommendations are made as to which claims should be supported and which claims should be rejected. It is also recommended that as a means of expressing popular will, the principle of self determination could be useful in the settlement of territorial disputes that involve transfer of populations. Chapters Eight and Nine deal with the substantive and procedural conditions that must precede the support of a claim for self-determination in the post-colonial context. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{almost a}} decade, the un General Assembly (unga) has adopted annual resolutions on ‘the {{rule of law}} at the {{national}} and international levels. ’ Moreover, the unga has held a High-level Meeting in September 2012 where Heads of State and Government discussed the topic {{for the first time ever}} and issued a declaration. This paper assesses the results. Its core question is whether unga commitment to rule {{of law at the}} national level is merely a vague aspiration or whether it has concrete normative content. The main conclusions are that: (a) the 9 annual resolutions have so far articulated neither a clear concept of rule of law nor a set of requirements or a minimum standard which States should respect in their legal systems; (b) the 2012 High-level Declaration articulates a thin conception of rule of law, i. e., stresses formal legality; (c) that the Declaration largely confirms Aust and Nolte’s analysis of <b>lex</b> <b>lata</b> with respect to the rule of law at the national level, but that it also departs from it somewhat; (d) that the unga’s commitment to rule of law is compatible with different political systems and normative outlooks. In 2015, the unga will again discuss rule of law in the context of renewal of the Millennium Development Goals (mdgs), and it seems likely after the Secretary General’s Road to Dignity by 2030 that rule of law is an important aspect of the new Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an interdisciplinary}} {{study on the}} external ‘Responsibility to Protect’ (R 2 P) and international law. It focuses on the legal customary process on jus ad bellum by which states try to address {{the gap between the}} legitimacy and legality of humanitarian intervention to protect human security within a state against genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The development of specific legal rights for the Security Council, regional organisations and ‘coalitions of the willing’ to protect by military means is examined through case studies of humanitarian interventions after the Cold War. Constructivist perspectives on security and norms are contrasted with legal positivist analyses of customary law, the applicable law on the use of force, and evolutionary interpretation and informal modification of treaties. Feminist theories and gender perspectives on human security, the R 2 P and humanitarian intervention are also integrated into the thesis. The decisions to authorise humanitarian interventions in Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, East Timor and Darfur confirm an external R 2 P for the Security Council {{in the form of a}} <b>lex</b> <b>lata</b> right to protect by military means where states have manifestly failed to do so and where peaceful means are considered inadequate. Furthermore, a similar customary right for regional organisations may also be emerging, when the state concerned manifestly fails to protect, the Security Council is unable or unwilling to act and peaceful means found inadequate. Finally, support is found for a lex ferenda right of regional organisations, coalitions of the willing and individual states to intervene by military means in ‘exceptional circumstances’ in accordance with the theories on ex post facto or implied authority, or the principle of necessity, to protect people in humanitarian crises where the criteria of the R 2 P doctrine are met...|$|E
40|$|When {{transactions}} are complicated or {{are carried out}} {{for the purposes of}} tax planning, the need to determine whether they have been correctly characterised may arise in some situations. The general position is that however transactions have been classified, taxation should be based on their “true import”. One overall conclusion is that in addition to classification in accordance with the norms of private law, the true import of transactions may also be determined in accordance with specific tax law provisions or normative tax law principles. The support for a tax charge varies depending on the norm type, as do the methods of     interpretation. The thesis presents the methodological principles on which determination of true import should be based. It has proved essential to examine possible <b>lex</b> <b>lata</b> conclusions regarding the scope of the different norm types, particularly bearing in mind rule of law considerations. The material examined largely comprises income tax case law on taxation based on the true import of transactions. Much of the work has consisted of systemising this case law. Analyses are made and conclusions drawn as to how the Supreme Administrative Court determines the true import of transactions in general, and in particular as regards “composite” chains of transactions. The methodological principles on which determination of true import should be based and the conclusions as to how the Supreme Administrative Court determines the true import of {{transactions are}} applied to a specifically selected chain of events. In addition, an examination is made and conclusions drawn as to whether there is support for a substance-over-form approach in Swedish tax law, or whether private law sets the precedent for tax law, whether the taxpayer’s desire to achieve tax advantages should be taken into account, the importance of the economic effect when determining the true import of transactions, and whether assessments can be made both to the advantage of taxpayers and to their detriment...|$|E
40|$|International law {{has long}} {{recognized}} the general principle that an illegal act cannot produce legal rights. Yet, this principle of ex injuria jus non oritur is seemingly {{ignored in the}} uneasy {{relationship between the two}} international legal regimes most associated with war. A head of State can, for example, violate international law regulating the resort to armed force by ordering his military forces to illegally invade another country, yet he, through his military forces, simultaneously and subsequently benefits on the battlefield from the application of the separate body of international law regulating the actual conduct of war. The paradoxical benefit flows from the latter regime 2 ̆ 7 s salutary rules that allow for both the killing of opposing military forces, and for the incidental death of civilians and destruction of civilian property during hostilities, even if the war is illegally triggered. Yet, the ex injuria jus non oritur principle is not completely jettisoned by this divorced operation of related legal regimes; the once-controversial crime against peace developed at Nuremberg has blossomed into the modern international crime of aggression, thus in theory condemning such a head of State under international criminal law for his role in launching an illegal invasion, thereby limiting his illegal gains. However, the prosecution of a head of State for the crime of aggression remains chimerical, {{at least for the time}} being, as the international community moves in fits and starts to enforce international law in the criminal arena. While the crime of aggression has not been prosecuted since its predecessor was controversially developed and implemented at Nuremberg, the international community has since witnessed numerous international prosecutions of war crimes [...] violations of international laws governing the battlefield. This Article explores whether the crime of aggression can be prosecuted as a war crime by exposing the intersection of war 2 ̆ 7 s two legal regimes within the war crime of disproportionate attack. It concludes that, exclusively for those State leaders responsible for crimes of aggression, the resultant collateral damage caused by such aggression [...] the civilian deaths and property destruction otherwise allowed by the international laws governing warfare [...] could be considered criminally excessive by building upon the contextual approach inherent in both bodies of law. Such an approach resides at the outer edges of the <b>lex</b> <b>lata,</b> but is one that normatively resonates with both common sense and the dictates of humanity...|$|E

Iustus Förlag 413 pp. Uppsala 1997. ISBN 91 - 7678 - 347 - 2 In this thesis, the author examines {{the extent to which}} the Swedish Labour Court accords significance to individual employment contracts, and other factors personal to the employer and employee, in determining the content of the employment relationship (i. e. the rights and duties of the parties). The first task is to establish the limits of the parties’ freedom of contract. Rules provided for by statute, collective agreement and case law may be either mandatory or default rules. A default rule governs the parties’ relationships unless they, explicitly or implicitly, contract out of it. The question here is how to determine whether a particular rule is mandatory or a default rule. Even mandatory rules, however, can leave a certain amount of space for individual contracts. Normally, a mandatory rule is only aimed at contractual clauses which involve disadvantages for one party. In addition, the mandatory character of the rule usually ceases at a certain point of time, e. g. when the right which the rule grants one of the parties has come into being. When the default character of a rule has been confirmed, the next question is under which circumstances the parties to an individual employment contract can be assumed to have exercised their right to diverge from that which is set out in the rule. These are the central legal questions in the thesis. The main place to look for answers to these questions is in the case law of the Labour Court. This collected case law is examined with three different purposes in mind. The primary purpose is to analyse the content of the law as it is today (the <b>lex</b> <b>lata).</b> A second purpose is to compare the solutions reached in the case law of the Labour Court in this area to those reached in other areas of the law of contracts. Finally, an attempt is made to shed light on the underlying goals of the case law of the Labour Court, in other words, the values which this case law seeks to protect.

40|$|Irrespective {{of whether}} one adheres to {{the premise that}} human rights {{is an area of}} {{international}} law that is characterised by its own telos-oriented legal rules or not, the undeniable fact is that the protection of human rights was and remains one of the cornerstones of international legal regulation, and its content is one that constantly evolves. In such an ever-shifting normative landscape, the present book aims to examine the role of human rights in regulating adequate provision of essential public services from a ‘law and governance’ perspective. These services include access to water, electricity and healthcare services. Within that context, the goal of this Chapter will be to shed some inquisitive light {{on the question of whether}} access to electricity, as one manifestation of access to energy, although not yet a recognised human right may, nonetheless, be protected under existing human rights instruments. Essentially, the question can be stripped down to whether, until access to energy and electricity becomes a recognised and regulated human right, its nucleus can in the meantime be found by virtue of interpretative methods to fall within the scope ratione materiae of existing human rights instruments. An exhaustive analysis of all relevant human rights treaties would be by virtue of their sheer number impossible, and by virtue of the inherently hypothetical nature of the inquiry counter-productive. For these reasons, a more qualitative approach has been opted for. The line of our inquiry will be the following: We will start from a very recent case taken from the domestic jurisprudence of Greece where access to electricity was both used as leverage for payment of taxes and formed the basis of the courts’ judicial reasoning. This will then open the door for reviewing whether in Europe there is an international legal framework that allows protection of access to electricity either directly (as a right in its own merit) or indirectly (through an evolutive interpretation of a right already protected under an international instrument). Since several European States are members of the European Union (EU) and all of them are members of the Council of Europe (CoE), the two main instruments that will be examined are respectively the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The need to examine both these instruments is underlined by the ongoing discussion surrounding EU’s accession to the ECHR, which, should it happen, would mean that the final say on the scope of a particular right would belong to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). In this manner, the present Chapter will offer an answer to the question of whether the socio-economic nature of the right of access to electricity is by virtue of the EU and CoE-relevant human rights instruments a <b>lex</b> <b>lata,</b> lex ferenda, or mere wishful thinking within Europe...|$|E
40|$|International {{humanitarian}} law' (IHL) {{has long}} differentiated between international and non-international armed conflicts, regulating the latter, {{at least at}} the level of treaty law, far less than the former. One of the starkest examples of this is in the case of administrative detention on security grounds or 'internment'. Thus, IHL applicable in international armed conflicts establishes a seemingly robust regime regarding internment. As such, it specifies the limited grounds on which an individual may be interned, the procedural safeguards that must be provided to internees, and {{the point at which the}} internee must be released. In the conventional IHL provisions applicable in non-international armed conflicts, on the other hand, no equivalent rules are made explicit. In addition, the application in such situations of international human rights law (IHRL), which also contains procedural rules applicable to detention, is considered by many to be very controversial. This has led to considerable confusion over the current state of the law governing detention in non-international armed conflict, and it is here that some of the most controversial practices and intractable debates within IHL of the last decade have developed. The present thesis seeks to clarify the law here and does so through a comprehensive examination of both IHL and IHRL. It begins with a discussion of the general context in which the thesis falls, i. e. the distinction between international and non-international armed conflicts. This is considered from an historical perspective, considering the basis for the distinction as well as its appropriateness in contemporary international law. Having considered this general question, the thesis then moves on to an examination of the current <b>lex</b> <b>lata</b> with regard to internment in non-international armed conflicts, with a comprehensive examination of both IHL and IHRL. Regarding IHL, it is shown that, whilst there remains a dearth of conventional and customary rules here, one can discern a general prohibition of internment that is not necessary as a result of the conflict. The application of the IHRL rules on detention in non-international conflicts and their interaction with relevant rules of IHL are then explored, with substantial reference to the practice of both states and human rights treaty bodies. It is shown that, absent derogation, human rights treaty rules continue fully to regulate detentions by states in relation to non-international armed conflicts, alongside the minimal rules of IHL. However, it is also demonstrated that the current law remains inadequate in this area. First, there is significant disagreement between the human rights treaty bodies on the extent to which derogation from these rules is permitted. Second, persons detained in non-international conflicts by non-state armed groups or by states with no human rights treaty obligations are protected by the far more basic customary rules in this area. The thesis, therefore, concludes with a set of concrete proposals for developing the law here, in a manner that builds upon and clarifies the current obligations of all states and non-state armed groups.

40|$|When {{activities}} of a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operation cause damage to third {{parties and the}} tort claim cannot be settled amicably, the injured third party does {{not have access to}} any remedies that could give effect to the recognized right to compensation. The thesis identifies and analyzes the content of the rules and practices of public international law and the internal law of the UN that give rise to this remedy gap. Further, based on the normative analysis, the thesis constructs and analyzes policy-oriented solutions to how the gap should be closed in order to safeguard the legitimate interests of both the UN and the injured party. Two recent cases related to the cholera epidemic in Haiti and the massacre in Srebrenica are used as case studies. The thesis identifies two principal factors that contribute to the emergence of the remedy gap: inadequacies related to the dispute settlement mechanism of third-party claims in the UN peacekeeping context and the organization's insurmountable immunity from suit before national courts. With regard to the former, the thesis distinguishes between problems related to the devised and actual mechanisms available for settling claims on the one hand, and inadequacies related to the determination of admissibility of tort claims on the other hand. It is submitted that the existing mechanism is inadequate as it leaves outside contentious claims without a legal justification. Further, the determination of admissibility based on the notion 'private-law claims' is uninformative on the international plane. An alternative and more precise model for testing admissibility based on the notion of justiciability is offered: if the standard principles of liability in tort can be determined by the adjudicative forum without having to review political decisions of the UN, tort claims should be receivable. With regard to the latter, the thesis distinguishes between the scope of UN immunity and human rights related arguments commonly used to overcome the bar of unqualified immunity. As regards the former, the thesis argues that <b>lex</b> <b>lata</b> the UN enjoys unqualified immunity due to the impossibility of finding a practicable test for 'functionality', and this immunity can only be lifted by express waiver that cannot be deduced from a commitment to settle disputes. The justification for comprehensive immunities is however greatly diminished where the organization fails to establish alternative modes of dispute settlement. As regards the human rights approach, the thesis analyzes whether the UN can be bound by duties for human rights vis-à-vis the claimants in a peacekeeping context; whether the claimants' right of access to court vis-à-vis the forum state can limit UN immunity; and finally whether a jus cogens hierarchy between immunity and human rights can solve the conflict to the latter's benefit. By applying institutional human rights theory and analyzing relevant case law, the thesis answers all three questions in the negative, and argues that human rights can only play the role of a policy imperative in UN peacekeeping. Linking the conflict between the internal legal order of the UN and the right of access to court to fragmentation, the thesis concludes that the former should accommodate the human rights regime by ensuring the availability of alternative modes of dispute settlement for third party tort claims arising in peacekeeping contexts. Based on the normative analysis, the thesis offers concrete policy recommendations for how the remedy gap should be closed. As for the dispute settlement mechanism, it is submitted that since the majority of tort claims in peacekeeping contexts are settled amicably, a new mechanism is not called for, and the UN should instead incur an obligation to arbitrate contentious cases. It is further submitted that the UN should devise an illustrative list of legal criteria to be applied by the selected adjudicatory forum in determining the admissibility of claims, taking into account the justiciability perspective offered in the study. The legal criteria should also comprehensively set out the applicable law, including internal customary law and general principles of tort law, to be applied to the merits of the claim. The recommendations would effectively remove the remedy gap, avoid the appearance of arbitrariness in the practice related to contentious tort claims, and promote the rule of law within the UN system...|$|E
