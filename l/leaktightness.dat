40|$|This is {{the final}} report on the INSP project entitled, ``Kola Confinement Leaktightness'' {{conducted}} by BNL under the authorization of Project Work Plan WBS 1. 2. 2. 1. This project was initiated in February 1993 to assist the Russians to reduce risks associated with the continued operation of older Soviet-designed nuclear power plants, specifically the Kola VVER- 440 / 230 Units 1 and 2, through upgrades in the confinement performance to reduce the uncontrolled leakage rate. The major technical objective of this-project was to improve the <b>leaktightness</b> of the Kola NPP VVER confinement boundaries, {{through the application of}} a variety of sealants to penetrations, doors and hatches, seams and surfaces, to the extent that current technology permitted. A related objective was the transfer, through training of Russian staff, of the materials application procedures to the staff of the Kola NPP. This project was part of an overall approach to minimizing uncontrolled releases from the Kola NPP VVER 440 / 230 s {{in the event of a}} serious accident, and to thereby significantly mitigate the consequences of such an accident. The US provided materials, application technology, and applications equipment for application of sealant materials, surface coatings, potting materials and gaskets, to improve the confinement <b>leaktightness</b> of the Kola VVER- 440 / 23 Os. The US provided for training of Russian personnel in the applications technology...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and explains}} {{the contents of}} bolt and bolted connection design rules included in the present 2012 edition of the French RCC-MRx code ([1], applicable to nuclear installation components). The aim of this work is to describe the rules and their technical and historical background, owing to the widespread fields of application in a NPP and to the relative complexity of methods; bolted connections have often a major safety-related role. The domain of the RCC-MRx covers high temperature sodium reactors, experimental nuclear facilities (Jules Horowitz Reactor, research reactor under construction in France), and fusion reactor components (ITER Vacuum Vessel). The first major application is at present for ASTRID (Advanced Sodium Technological Reactor for Industrial Demonstration). The bolt connection usual domain varies in a wide range, from very complex configurations, like high temperature, pressure retaining under cyclic load, to simpler flanges for low temperature piping. In order to fulfill such different needs in design, several sets of rules are included at present in RCC-MRx code, issued from {{the historical development of}} previous RCC-MR and RCC-MX codes, from which the "RCC-MRx " version is derived. In the following, the existing four configurations of bolted connections are identified, the respective rules are summarized, and, finally, a short comparison with other nuclear codes and industrial standards is provided. Available rules to-date concern respectively: 1) Preloaded bolts assuring <b>leaktightness</b> (type "B 1 ") 2) Preloaded bolts not assuring <b>leaktightness</b> ("B 2 ") 3) Non-preloaded bolts ("B 3 "...|$|E
40|$|Abstract − Typically, a car {{has over}} 80 {{dynamically}} stressed seals. Since many years, the radial seal {{in combination with}} the shaft is a critical component for the automotive industry. A helix-like structure due to the manufacturing process (as a fingerprint of said process) can lead to an unacceptable oil consumption. In collaboration with Daimler, an objective method for characterising such functionrelevant helix-structures better known as lead was developed. The lead parameters, which are relevant to <b>leaktightness,</b> are derived from a least square fit of complex exponential functions in both directions radial and circumferential. The basic measurement setup consists of a stylus instrument in combination with a rotation unit...|$|E
40|$|Use {{of natural}} gas as an {{eco-friendly}} and user-friendly fuel increases day by day, in parallel to developments in industry and need for comfort. The common use {{of natural gas}} arouses interest about gas transfer and joining of pipes in order to install gas pipe lines. In this study, two methods to join PE plastic pipes are compared: electro-melting welding and hot element (butt) welding methods. Tests are applied {{in order to measure}} the <b>leaktightness</b> and strength properties of the joined pipes in ambient conditions similar to actual working conditions. Results of the standardized tests are compared. Consequently, electro-melting welding is found to be the ideal method for pipes of certain diameters. However, for main transfer line pipes (of larger diameters), hot butt welding gave more successful results...|$|E
40|$|The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has {{initiated}} a {{program at the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory to provide assistance in their assessment {{of the effects of}} potential degradation on the structural integrity and <b>leaktightness</b> of metal containment vessels and steel liners of concrete containments in nuclear power plants. One of the program objectives is to identify repair practices for restoring metallic containment pressure boundary components that have been damaged or degraded in service. This report presents issues associated with inservice condition assessments and continued service evaluations and identifies the rules and requirements for the repair and replacement of nonconforming containment pressure boundary components by welding or metal removal. Discussion topics include base and welding materials, welding procedure and performance qualifications, inspection techniques, testing methods, acceptance criteria, and documentation requirements necessary for making acceptable repairs and replacements so that the plant can be returned to a safe operating condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of helium for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), at CERN, {{will require a}} large variety of transfer lines. At the time of qualification of possible technologies, Invar® was investigated as potential material for internal tubes. Intensive developments were made in industry to qualify the use of Invar® M 93 and its associated welding parameters. Although all tests showed good perspective, the risk associated {{with the lack of}} proven reference turned out to be dissuasive with respect to the possible cost savings for the LHC cryogenic system. However, since DN 100 transfer lines were necessary for the supply and return of a test facility over a distance of 100 m, an Invar® based solution was considered, as repair or exchange would have been less dramatic than in the LHC accelerator tunnel. After recalling the technical requirements, the required material qualification will be presented as well as the design principles and operating features. This equipment has been first cooled-down to 4. 5 K and accepted in 2001. More than sixty complete thermal cycles from 300 K to 4. 5 K have been performed since then without change of performance including helium <b>leaktightness...</b>|$|E
40|$|Advanced RTG {{concepts}} utilizing improved thermoelectric {{materials and}} converter concepts are under study at Fairchild for DOE. The design described here {{is based on}} DOE's newly developed radioisotope heat source, and on an improved silicon-germanium material and a multicouple converter module under development at Syncal. Fairchild's assignment was to combine the above into an attractive power system for use in space, and to assess the specific power and other attributes of that design. The resultant design is highly modular, consisting of standard RTG slices, each producing ~ 24 watts at the desired output voltage of 28 volt. Thus, the design could be adapted to various space missions {{over a wide range}} of power levels, with little or no redesign. Each RTG slice consists of a 250 -watt heat source module, eight multicouple thermoelectric modules, and standard sections of insulator, housing, radiator fins, and electrical circuit. The design makes it possible to check each thermoelectric module for electrical performance, thermal contact, <b>leaktightness,</b> and performance stability, after the generator is fully assembled; and to replace any deficient modules without disassembling the generator or perturbing the others. The RTG end sections provide the spring-loaded supports required to hold the free-standing heat source stack together during launch vibration. Details analysis indicates that the design offers a substantial improvement in specific power over the present generator of RTGs, using the same heat source modules. There are three copies in the file...|$|E
40|$|The review {{under this}} SRP section covers the {{radiological}} {{consequences of the}} release of fission products from irradiated fuel in a spent fuel cask that is postulated to drop during cask handling operations. SRP Section 15. 7. 4 covers the radiological consequences of fuel handling accidents in which an object is dropped onto irradiated fuel resulting in the release of fission products from the stored fuel. SRP Section 15. 7. 4 also includes {{the consequences of a}} fuel cask dropping or tipping onto irradiated fuel in the spent fuel pool. The ASB evaluates the spent fuel cask handling system under SRP Section 9. 1. 4. The AEB reviewer, as explained below, will verify various design and operations aspects of the system with the ASB as a secondary review branch. The points covered in the AEB review are as follows: 1. ASB is consulted to verify the potential drop height during handling of a loaded cask and the procedures for handling the cask with respect to the impact limiter. If the handling procedures meet all applicable criteria, then the radiological consequences of a spent fuel cask drop accident need not be estimated. 2. A design basis radiological analysis is performed if a cask drop exceeding 30 feet can be postulated or if limiting devices are removed during cask handling within the plant so the 30 -foot drop height is exceeded. If the radiological consequences of a cask drop accident are to be computed, then information on whether building <b>leaktightness</b> can be expected after a cask drop is obtained from ASB (e. g., whether the technical specifications. require large doors to be closed during fuel handling or whether ventilatio...|$|E
40|$|This is {{an interim}} status report for tasks carried out per Task Technical Plan SRNL-STI- 2011 - 00506. A series of tasks/experiments are being {{performed}} at the Savannah River National Laboratory to monitor the aging performance of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) Orings used in the H 1616 shipping package. The data will support the technical basis to extend the annual maintenance of the EPDM O-rings in the H 1616 shipping package and to predict {{the life of the}} seals at bounding service conditions. Current expectations are that the O-rings will maintain a seal at bounding normal temperatures in service (152 F) for at least 12 months. The baseline aging data review suggests that the EPDM O-rings are likely to retain significant mechanical properties and sealing force at bounding service temperatures to provide a service life of at least 2 years. At lower, more realistic temperatures, longer service life is likely. Parallel compression stress relaxation and vessel leak test efforts are in progress to further validate this assessment and quantify a more realistic service life prediction. The H 1616 shipping package O-rings were evaluated for baseline property data as part of this test program. This was done to provide a basis for comparison of changes in material properties and performance parameters as a function of aging. This initial characterization was limited to physical and mechanical properties, namely hardness, thickness and tensile strength. These properties appear to be consistent with O-ring specifications. Three H 1616 - 1 Containment Vessels were placed in test conditions and are aging at temperatures ranging from 160 to 300 F. The vessels were Helium leak-tested initially and have been tested at periodic intervals after cooling to room temperature to determine if they meet the criterion of <b>leaktightness</b> defined in ANSI standard N 14. 5 - 97 (< 1 E- 07 std cc air/sec at room temperature). To date, no leak test failures have occurred. The cumulative time at temperature ranges from 174 days for the 300 F vessel to 189 days for the 160 F vessel as of 8 / 1 / 2012. The compression stress-relaxation (CSR) behavior of H 1616 shipping package O-rings is being evaluated to develop an aging model based on material properties. O-ring segments were initially aged at four temperatures (175 F, 235 F, 300 F and 350 F). These temperatures were selected to bound normal service temperatures and to challenge the seals within a reasonable aging period. Currently, samples aging at 300 F and 350 F have reached the mechanical failure point (end of life) which is defined in this study as 90 % loss of initial sealing force. As a result, additional samples more recently began aging at {approx} 270 F to provide additional data for the aging model. Aging and periodic leak testing of the full containment vessels, as well as CSR testing of O-ring segments is ongoing. Continued testing per the Task Technical Plan is recommended in order to validate the assumptions outlined in this status report and to quantify and validate the long-term performance of O-ring seals under actual service conditions...|$|E
