25|$|After {{the arrival}} of the first {{production}} 707 in 1957 the Dash 80 was adapted into a general experimental aircraft and used by Boeing to test a variety of new technologies and systems. One of its most important tasks during the late 1950s was to test systems for the new Boeing 727, including the fitting of a fifth engine in the rear fuselage. Other tests included experiments with different airfoil shapes and a number of high <b>lift</b> <b>devices</b> such as blown flaps, in which compressed air bled from the engines is directed over the flaps to increase lift during takeoff and landing.|$|E
25|$|Kawasaki {{developed}} the C-X {{in parallel with}} the P-X, which it had also been selected to develop. As a cost saving measure, major airframe parts and system components were shared between the two aircraft. They use the same basic wing structure, although it is installed at different sweep angle and dihedral on the two versions, with different high <b>lift</b> <b>devices</b> and powerplant attachments. Common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the auxiliary power unit, cockpit panel, flight control system computer, anti-collision lights, and gear control unit. As of 2007, the total development cost for the two aircraft has been 345 billion yen (or roughly equal to $2.9 billion), which is low compared to similar programs; for example, the development contract for the Boeing P-8 Poseidon alone was $3.89 billion.|$|E

This web-based boot includes boot body, <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> and support to support the feet and the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> to fix on the boot body. The support uses the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> to connect {{to the bottom of}} the boot body, and through the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> function, it can have lifting displacement to the boot bottom. The workers put foot fixed on the support, so as to make the inflating lifting boots walk along with the workers. The adjusting <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> can make support member move far or near the bottom direction of boot body. The workers can lift higher or lower along with the support.

40|$|Among nurses, {{low back}} pain is a common {{musculoskeletal}} disorder. A significant proportion of back pain episodes {{can be attributed to}} events that occur during patient handling activities when nurses are exposed to heavy lifting, awkward back postures, and pushing and/or pulling. In the past years, many ergonomic interventions have been developed, like <b>lifting</b> <b>devices,</b> to reduce mechanical load related to patient handling activities in order to (partly) decrease the occurrence of {{low back pain}}. The efficacy of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> designed to reduce mechanical load has been demonstrated in several laboratory studies. However, the timely and integrated implementation at the workplace remains difficult. Various intervention studies have indicated that individual behaviour of nurses is a key factor in successful implementation of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> in healthcare. As examples, Evanoff et al. (2003) and Li et al. (2004) identified the lack of perceived need to use lifts as an important barrier in the effectiveness of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> at the workplace. Nelson et al. (2006) showed that acceptance of patient handling equipment by the staff was a crucial facilitator in the implementation process of a multiple intervention aimed at patient handling in healthcare. A previous study in hospitals and nursing homes showed that individual behaviour of nurses, i. e. nurses’ motivation to use <b>lifting</b> <b>devices,</b> was strongly associated with <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> use. This study also pointed at the influence of organisationallevel measures on nurses’ behaviour, comprising both factors in each ward {{as well as at the}} managerial level of the healthcare institute. Thus, the appropriate implementation of ergonomic devices requires a careful process whereby individual behaviour is supported by organisational measures in order to enable and support the individual to adopt the required behaviour to prevent musculoskeletal complaints. A recent systematic review corroborated that upstream organisational strategies had a profound impact on musculoskeletal health...|$|R
