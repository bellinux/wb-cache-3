5|$|For the Papuan Campaign, MacArthur awarded Blamey the American Distinguished Service Cross, and Blamey {{was created}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire on 28 May 1943. This was unusual {{as it was}} the Australian Labor Party's policy not to award knighthoods, but was done as a {{response}} to the British government's awards to British and American officers for the North African campaign. Blamey's and Herring's knighthoods would be the <b>last</b> <b>that</b> the Labor government would award to Australian soldiers.|$|E

He was nevertheless pleased to find that his descriptions of Paris in The Doll {{had been on the}} mark (he had based them mainly on French-language publications). From Paris he hurried home to recuperate at Nałęczów from his journey, the <b>last</b> <b>that</b> he would make abroad.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), {{the head}} {{writer of the}} sketch show TGS with Tracy Jordan, goes back to work {{following}} the summer break and prepares for the show's fifth season. At the 30 Rock building, where she works, Liz and TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) meet their boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to discuss cutting the show's expenses. During the meeting, Pete reveals that star Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) now has a producer credit because of changes in her contract that were not set to start until the fifth season of TGS (nobody thought that the show would <b>last</b> <b>that</b> long). Jenna takes this role seriously and takes on the job of firing people. Eventually, on reviewing the budget, she realizes that her producer credit is costly—and unnecessary—and asks Pete to fire her.|$|E

5|$|Pliny's Natural History {{became a}} model for later encyclopedias and {{scholarly}} works {{as a result of}} its breadth of subject matter, its referencing of original authors, and its index. The work is dedicated to the emperor Titus, a son of Pliny's close friend, the emperor Vespasian, in the first year of Titus's reign. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the <b>last</b> <b>that</b> he published. He began it in 77, and had not made a final revision at the time of his death during the AD79 eruption of Vesuvius.|$|E
5|$|Bengaluru FC {{began the}} season in good form and {{finished}} the first month {{on top of the}} table. Defeat to the previous season league champions Mohun Bagan in February saw the club slip into second place until the final month of the season. However, the club then went seven games unbeaten to return {{to the top of the}} table by April. The title was secured on 17 April when Bengaluru FC defeated Salgaocar at home. After the I-League season, the club were knocked out of the Federation Cup in the first round of the competition by Aizawl. The club started their AFC Cup campaign slowly, losing their first two group stage matches. Three victories in a row however saw Bengaluru FC qualify for the knockout stages. In the Round of 16 the club defeated Kitchee to qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time in club history. 26 different players represented the club in three competitions and there were 12 different goalscorers. Bengaluru FC's top goalscorer was Sunil Chhetri, who scored 9 goals in 20 games. This season was also the <b>last</b> <b>that</b> Bengaluru FC would be under their first coach Ashley Westwood. Westwood left the club after the season concluded.|$|E
5|$|The 1962 {{edition of}} the Roman Missal, {{published}} {{a few months before}} the Second Vatican Council opened, was the <b>last</b> <b>that</b> presented the Mass as standardised in 1570 by Pope Pius V {{at the request of the}} Council of Trent and that is therefore known as the Tridentine Mass. Pope Pius V's Roman Missal was subjected to minor revisions by Pope Clement VIII in 1604, Pope Urban VIII in 1634, Pope Pius X in 1911, Pope Pius XII in 1955, and Pope John XXIII in 1962. Each successive edition was the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass until superseded by a later edition. When the 1962 edition was superseded by that of Paul VI, promulgated in 1969, its continued use at first required permission from bishops; but Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum allowed free use of it for Mass celebrated without a congregation and authorised parish priests to permit, under certain conditions, its use even at public Masses. Except for the scriptural readings, which Pope Benedict allowed to be proclaimed in the vernacular language, it is celebrated exclusively in liturgical Latin.|$|E

25|$|On August 6, the Committee of Detail {{reported}} its proposed {{revisions to}} the Randolph Plan. Again the question of slavery came up, and again the question was met with attacks of outrage. Over the next two weeks, delegates wove a web of mutual compromises relating to commerce and trade, east and west, slave-holding and free. The transfer of power to regulate slave trade from states to central government could happen in 20 years, but only then. Later generations could try out their own answers.

25|$|The {{reason for}} the demise was not purely economic. Privateering {{represented}} a decentralization of power that was inconsistent with both technology {{and the evolution of}} the modern state. It fell victim to changes: steam power and gunnery in ships, more rapid communications that enabled greater central control, and the increasing reluctance of governments everywhere to relinquish power. It was this <b>last</b> <b>that</b> doomed privateering, according to Robinson, the primary modern historian of the Confederate privateers; his opinion is echoed by Luraghi. The effort of the Confederate government turned from privateers to their regularly commissioned raiders, which had spectacularly more success in attacking the northern mercantile fleet.|$|E

It was also the <b>last</b> <b>that</b> Father Neri had built {{although}} he did not live to see its completion. It has a cross layout and is topped with vaults and a cupola. Its decoration is almost purely Mexican Baroque with monumental oil paintings and groups of painted statues that are placed on the floor, walls and ceiling. The columns contain inscriptions of poems written by Father Neri. The three altars contain the best of the sculptures and enclose the transept. These sculptures depict the crucifixion, agony, and descent of Christ after his death.|$|E
25|$|A {{child born}} within 12months of a woman's most recent meeting {{with her husband}} is presumed to be legitimate, since Jewish law {{believes}} that in rare cases a pregnancy can <b>last</b> <b>that</b> long (4:14). However, if more than 9months have elapsed and she {{is known to have}} been unfaithful then the presumption does not apply (Even haEzer Rama 4:14). Modern assisted reproductive technology has complicated the issue. Moshe Feinstein ruled that if a married woman is inseminated by sperm from another man the child is not a mamzer, since it did not result from an act of adultery; Joel Teitelbaum (2005) disagreed, and ruled that since the child is known to be that of a man other than her husband it is a mamzer.|$|E
