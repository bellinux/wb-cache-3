5|$|Skimmers are a {{small family}} of {{tropical}} tern-like birds. They have an elongated <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish.|$|E
5|$|Gulls are {{typically}} medium to large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings {{on the head}} or wings. They have stout, stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. Terns are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species. They have an elongated <b>lower</b> <b>mandible.</b> They feed by flying low over the water surface with the <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> skimming the water for small fish. Thirty-two species of Laridae have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic was a heavy, parrotlike bill. The {{upper mandible}} hooked sharply downwards, while the heavy <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> hooked sharply upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper mandible. This structure left a gap between the two mandibles when the bird held its beak closed. It is believed that the bill was pale pink in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E
25|$|Depending on its usage, {{commissure}} may {{refer to}} the junction of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>mandibles,</b> or alternately, to the full-length apposition of the closed mandibles, {{from the corners of}} the mouth to the tip of the beak.|$|R

50|$|African skimmers fly {{in lines}} over calm waters, and dip their <b>lower</b> <b>{{mandible}}s</b> {{in the water}} to feed. When the mandible touches a fish, the skimmer snaps its mouth shut. They feed mostly at dawn and dusk and have good night vision. The following fish have been recorded as prey for African skimmers: Micralestes, Tilapia, Barbus, Marcusenius, Hepsetus, Aplocheilichthys and Petrocephalus.|$|R
5|$|The {{scaly-breasted munia}} feeds mainly on seeds but also eats small berries {{such as those}} of Lantana. Although the bill is suited for {{crushing}} small grains, they do not show lateral movements of the <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> which help European greenfinches in dehusking seeds. Like some other munias, they may also feed on algae, a rich protein source, prior to the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Generally duller and paler, {{the female}} {{has a more}} uniform and paler blue face, with highly {{contrasting}} cream bare skin around the eye. It lacks the red shoulder band, and the blue shoulder markings are darker and less distinct. The throat and chest are pale green and the belly is yellow. The upper mandible is paler brown-grey with a darker tip, and has been recorded as black while nesting. The <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> is pale grey to almost white. When flying, the female has a broad white bar visible on the underwing.|$|E
5|$|Wilson Popenoe and {{his wife}} in 1931, at a site in Honduras dating back to 600 AD, found the <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> of a young Mayan woman, with three missing incisors {{replaced}} by pieces of shell, shaped to resemble teeth. Bone growth around two of the implants, {{and the formation of}} calculus, indicates that they were functional as well as esthetic. The fragment is currently part of the Osteological Collection of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.|$|E

50|$|Ramphocelus is a Neotropical genus {{of birds}} of the tanager family. They have {{enlarged}} shiny whitish or bluish-grey <b>lower</b> <b>mandibles,</b> which are pointed upwards in display. However, this is greatly reduced in the females of most species. Males {{are black and}} red, orange or yellow, while females resemble a duller version of the males, or are brownish or greyish combined with dull red, orange or yellowish.|$|R
50|$|The musk lorikeet is 22 cm long. It {{is mainly}} green {{and it is}} {{identified}} by its red forehead, blue crown and a distinctive yellow band on its wing. Both upper and <b>lower</b> <b>mandibles</b> of the beak are red at the tip and darker near its base. The blue area on the crown of the female is smaller and paler than seen on the male.|$|R
5|$|Cockatoos {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill {{so that they can}} be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E
5|$|Gulls are {{typically}} medium-to-large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings {{on the head}} or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. Terns are in general medium-to-large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species.

Twenty-nine Laridae species have been recorded in South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Laridae is {{a family}} of medium to large seabirds, the gulls, terns, and skimmers. Gulls are {{typically}} grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish.|$|E
40|$|A dental {{articulator}} is {{a mechanism}} which simulates the temporo-mandibular joint. The articulator is essential as it replicates the basic {{motions of the}} upper and <b>lower</b> <b>mandibles,</b> both revolve and translational motions. In the present paper the stresses from an articulator TMJ modelled as a bronze sphere into a cylindrical steel cavity are analyzed by two methods, first applying the Hertzian contact theory and then numerically, by means of finite element analysis using the simulation module in CATIA...|$|R
40|$|A case of midline cleft of the <b>lower</b> lip, <b>mandible,</b> and {{the neck}} with {{complete}} duplication {{of the tongue}} repaired at neonatal period is reported here. Median cleft of the <b>lower</b> lip, <b>mandible,</b> and bifid tongue with ankyloglossia is reported in the literature, but cleft of the neck with complete duplication of the tongue {{as a part of}} the Tessier 30 cleft is very rare. We could not find such report in the available English literature...|$|R
50|$|Protrusion is the {{extension}} of the mouth or premaxilla towards the prey, via mechanical linkages. Protrusion is known only in modern bony fishes, which possess many forms of coupled linkages in their head. Remarkable examples are the slingjaw wrasse and the sand eel which can protrude their mouth by several centimeters. Another example of protrusion is seen in dragonfly larvae, or nymphs, which have hydraulic <b>lower</b> <b>mandibles,</b> protruding forward to catch prey and bring it to the top jaw.|$|R
5|$|The {{hammering}} of woodpeckers when drumming or feeding creates great {{forces which}} are potentially {{damaging to the}} birds. In the great spotted woodpecker {{and most of its}} relatives, the hinge where the front of the skull connects with the upper mandible is folded inwards, tensioned by a muscle that braces it against the shock of the impact when the bill is hammering on hard wood. The outer layer of the upper mandible is significantly longer than the more rigid <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> and absorbs much of the concussive force. Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb the shock, and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} among the subspecies. For T. l. ludovicianus, the crown is rich brown that appears more chestnut-colored on its rump and uppertail-coverts. Shoulders and greater coverts are a rich brown, {{with a series of}} small white dots on the lesser primary coverts. The secondary coverts are rich brown with a darker brown barring on both webs; the bars on the primaries are on the outerwebs only, but darker and more noticeable. The retrices are brown with 18 to 20 bars that span across the tail. The white supercilious streak borders thinly with a black above and below, and extends above and beyond its shoulders. The ear coverts are speckled gray and grayish-black. Its chin and throat are grey that becomes buff on its chest, flank and belly, though the latter two are of a warmer color. The underwing coverts sport a grayish buff color. Its iris is reddish-brown, the upper mandible is lemon-colored and paler at the base and <b>lower</b> <b>mandible.</b> The legs are flesh-colored.|$|E
5|$|Because its {{coloration}} {{is similar}} to Bendire's thrasher, the two birds are easily mistaken for one another. The bill of the curve-billed is all black, while that of Bendire's is paler down to the <b>lower</b> <b>mandible,</b> showing a dark grey with a basal area that does not feature a stark contrast. The upper and lower mandibles of the curve-billed are curved, while the upper is curved and lower is essentially straight for the Bendires'. Although geographic variances for the curve-billed can make discerning breast patterns difficult, the curve-billed {{has a tendency to}} display larger and rounder spots overall on its breast, in contrast to the Bendires' smaller, more pronounced markings shaped like arrowheads. However, curve-billed thrashers can also present this feature. Bendires' typically have yellow eyes while curve-billed eyes are typically orange, but Bendires' can have variations that appear yellow-orange while some curve-billed eyes are red-orange, yellow-orange, or yellow. The curve-billed is heavier and is more likely to inhabit suburban regions; Bendires' are likely to avoid dense vegetation such as mesquite and prefers open grassland with scattered yucca or around hedgegrows in agricultural areas. The song call of Bendire's is said to be more melodic and continuous with a chuck, while the curve-billed is known for its whit-wheet calls.|$|E
5000|$|Thick-billed fox sparrows {{are almost}} {{identical}} in plumage to slate-colored fox sparrows {{but have a}} more extensive blue-gray hood and a less rusty tail. The most striking feature of this bird is its enormous beak which can appear to be three times as large {{as that of the}} markedly small-billed slate-colored fox sparrows. A thick-billed fox sparrow's beak also differs in color from that of the slate-colored. Although the culmens of both groups are grayish brown, slate-coloreds have yellow <b>lower</b> <b>mandibles</b> instead of the steel blue of the thick-billeds'. (Rising & Beadle 1996) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{marsupial}} lion was {{a highly}} specialised carnivore, as is reflected in its dentition. Like other diprotodonts, it possessed enlarged incisors on both the upper (maxillae) and <b>lower</b> (<b>mandibles)</b> jaws. These teeth (the lower in particular) were shaped much more like the pointed canine teeth of animals such as dogs and cats than those of kangaroos. The most unusual feature of the creature's dentition were the huge, blade-like carnassial premolars {{on either side of}} its jaws. The top and bottom carnassials worked together like shears and would have been very effective at slicing off chunks of flesh from carcasses and cutting through bone.|$|R

5|$|On the bird's {{forehead}} was a {{naked and}} pale chalky-blue frontal shield. This {{was surrounded by}} short, velvety black feathers that extended {{from the base of}} the bill to the area just below and in front of the eye, while the area below the eye was a pinkish wash. The bird's chin and throat were sparsely covered with black, velvety feathers, while the neck was a slaty-blue that transitioned into a brownish-grey breast. The abdomen and undertail-coverts were a rich orange, while the undertail was a blackish-grey. The wing was slaty with a hint of brown at its base and became a warm, dark brown by the wingtips; the underwing was brown. The back was grey and transitioned into a browner rump, while the uppertail-coverts were a dark sooty-grey with blackish tips. The tail, which was short and rounded, was a very dark indigo that had a slightly purple iridescent sheen. The bill was bicoloured; the upper mandible was chalky-blue with a black tip while the <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> was red. The plumage of the juvenile is unknown. The bird's feet were a dull purplish-red and unfeathered up to the heel, while the iris was a dark brown.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies has a dark red head, neck, and rump; the red is glossy, reflecting bright light. The {{rest of the}} upper body is a blackish-brown, and the upper breast and under-body a light brownish-grey. The red of the head is sharply demarcated against the brown plumage, giving the bird the appearance of having a red hood. The bill is black or blackish-brown, and the gape is black or yellowish. There is a distinct black loral stripe that extends to become a narrow eye ring. The iris is dark brown. The adult female's head and neck are grey-brown with a pink-red tint to the forehead and chin. The rest of the female's upper body is grey-brown with darker shades on the wings and lighter shades on the breast and underparts. The gape is yellow. One study suggested {{a connection between the}} female's bill colour and breeding status, with birds that had a horn-coloured (grey) bill also having well-developed brood patches. Juveniles are similar to females though with an obvious pale yellow edge to the <b>lower</b> <b>mandible.</b> Initially lacking in red plumage, they begin to get red feathers on their faces after around a month of age. Males keep their juvenile plumage for up to three months, and take a similar period to come into full colour. M. e. infuscata is similar in appearance to the nominate race but has red extending from the rump onto the back, a darker grey belly, and is slightly larger overall.|$|E
25|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> is {{supported}} by a bone known as the inferior maxillary bone—a compound bone composed of two distinct ossified pieces. These ossified plates (or rami), which can be U-shaped or V-shaped, join distally (the exact location of the joint depends on the species) but are separated proximally, attaching {{on either side of the}} head to the quadrate bone. The jaw muscles, which allow the bird to close its beak, attach to the proximal end of the <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> and to the bird's skull. The muscles that depress the <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> are usually weak, except in a few birds such as the starlings and the extinct Huia, which have well-developed digastric muscles that aid in foraging by prying or gaping actions. In most birds, these muscles are relatively small as compared to the jaw muscles of similarly sized mammals.|$|E

5|$|Only {{the cheek}} teeth of Seorsumuscardinus are known; {{these include the}} fourth premolar and three molars in the upper (maxilla) and <b>lower</b> jaws (<b>mandible).</b> The teeth are {{medium-sized}} for a dormouse and have a flat occlusal (chewing) surface. S.bolligeri is slightly larger than S.alpinus.|$|R
25|$|The {{adults are}} bright rufous or bay {{on the head}} and back and are broadly barred with dark brown. The bill is long and {{slightly}} curved. A whitish supercilium is distinctive above a dark eye-line. The wing is darker and tail is graduated with a dark brown centre. The tail has a subterminal black band and white tips to the feathers. The sexes are alike. The iris is yellow and the bill is black while the base of the <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> is greenish grey. The tarsi are grey. The juvenile is similar but has a pale <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> and white fringes to the feathers of the upper body.|$|E
25|$|The {{cormorants}} and the darters have {{a unique}} bone {{on the back of}} the top of the skull known as the os nuchale or occipital style which was called a xiphoid process in early literature. This bony projection provides anchorage for the muscles that increase the force with which the <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> is closed and this bone and the highly developed muscles over it, the M. adductor mandibulae caput nuchale are unique to the families Phalacrocoracidae and Anhingidae.|$|E
25|$|The female is {{identical}} in appearance {{to the male}} except that her <b>lower</b> <b>mandible</b> is orange-red with a black tip. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} adult, but with duller and greener upperparts and paler underparts. Its bill is black, and the legs are also initially black. Feathers are moulted gradually between July and November with the main flight feathers taking 90–100 days to moult and regrow. Some that moult late may suspend their moult during cold winter weather.|$|E
50|$|The wrybill or (in Māori) ngutuparore (Anarhynchus frontalis) is {{a species}} of plover endemic to New Zealand. It is special {{since it is the}} only species of bird in the world with a beak that is bent {{sideways}} one way, always to the right (in the Crossbills eg. Loxia pytyopsittacus the tips of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>mandibles</b> cross because they are bent sideways in opposite directions, sometimes left over right and sometimes the other way). A 2015 study found it to actually be within the Charadrius clade, with its closest relatives other plovers found in New Zealand, the nearest the New Zealand plover or New Zealand dotterel (Charadrius obscurus), and then the double-banded plover or banded dotterel (Charadrius bicinctus).|$|R
