40|$|During the {{operation}} of hydrodynamically <b>lubricated</b> <b>devices</b> a fully formulated lubricant {{has the ability to}} form layers at the surfaces. A friction modifier's task is to adjust the interaction between lubricant and the surface so that friction is lowered. An antiwear additive creates a protective layer on the surface and this definitely influence the performance of the <b>lubricated</b> <b>device.</b> To gain fundamental understanding, models that address the modified liquid - solid interaction due to the formation of layers, but also models that may be used to study the effects of layers already formed on the contacting surfaces are required. In this paper, two non-Newtonian lubricant rheology models that may be used to simulate reacted layers resembling those created by lubricant additives are adopted for the simulation of the piston ring - cylinder liner lubrication problem. The possibility of layer to layer interaction, which is likely to occur in the convex conjunction between the ring and the liner, is considered and this extends the models found in the literature. The effects induced by this type of layering are studied by using a modified Reynolds' equation where the coefficients have been corrected with factors that accounts for the layer properties. This enables, effectively, studies of layers resembling those created by lubricant additives during {{the operation}} of the lubricated conjunction between a piston ring and a cylinder liner.

40|$|AbstractThe {{pressure}} field that develops inside a lubricated contact obeys an elliptic equation known as Reynolds equation, with coefficients {{that depend on}} {{the shape of the}} contacting surfaces. The load-carrying capacity of a contact, defined as the integral of the {{pressure field}}, is an important performance indicator that should be as high as possible to avoid wear and damage of the surfaces. In this article, the effect of arbitrary uniform periodic textures on the load-carrying capacity of <b>lubricated</b> <b>devices</b> known as thrust bearings is investigated theoretically by means of homogenization techniques and first-order perturbation analysis. It is shown that the untextured shape is a local optimum for the load-carrying capacity of the homogenized pressure field. This is proved for bearings of general shape and considering both incompressible and compressible models for the lubricant. The homogenization technique however implies an error.

The {{purpose of the study}} was to develop a prototype intra-oral <b>lubricating</b> <b>device</b> for the management of radiotherapy-related xerostomia and to evaluate patient acceptance. An intra-oral <b>lubricating</b> <b>device</b> was fabricated that incorporated a reservoir in the palatal vault and permitted slow release of saliva substitute by the patient. Preliminary clinical testing was done in five patients with radiotherapy-related xerostomia. A measure incorporating seven questions was used to explore patient acceptance. The device was simple to fabricate using materials available in a technical laboratory. All patients were able to wear the device for at least 4 h per day throughout the test period. The device was considered easy to use and clean. Some impairment of speech and chewing was noted although this appeared to be related to the bulkiness of the reservoir. General oral comfort was improved due to the lubricating effect. The bulk of the reservoir was reduced as a consequence of patient feedback. The design addressed key problems associated with previous lubricating systems.

Objectives: To determine {{the efficacy of}} non-pharmacological interventions on all outcomes in primary Sjögren's syndrome. Methods: A predefined list of databases were searched from inception to July 2013 {{with a list of}} search terms. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any non-pharmacological interventions for adults with PSS were included. Any comparator was allowed. Titles and abstracts of studies were considered according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Full texts were reviewed for inclusion independently by two authors. Two review authors separately extracted the data of included studies onto standardised forms. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Outcomes fell within the main domains addressed by the World Health Organisation International Classification of Functioning. Results: 996 studies were identified of which 17 full text articles were screened and 5 studies were included in this review with a total of 130 participants randomised. The included studies investigated effectiveness of an oral <b>lubricating</b> <b>device</b> for dry mouth, acupuncture for dry mouth, lacrimal punctum plugs for dry eyes and psychodynamic group therapy for coping with symptoms.

The prime motivation comes from the computer magnetic disk recording industry where higher recording density can be achieved if the read / write element which is attached to the taper-flat slider can be maintained at a closer spacing over the magnetic disk rotating at a high speed. The slider/disk separation is so thin that the flow can be considered as a lubricated flow.

40|$|International audience- Cavitation is a {{phenomena}} {{occurring in}} most of <b>lubricated</b> <b>devices</b> mostly in the regions of diverging contact geometry where sub-ambient pressures exist, and implying some diphasic aspect for the lubricant. There exist very different {{ways to deal with}} cavitation problems. From one hand widely used JFO Elrod Adams types of model who need only the knowledge of one primary parameter (a cavitation pressure) while another one (bulk modulus) appears as a perturbation parameter. To be noticed that in these models the fact that the pressure is constant in the cavitated area and never fall below the saturation pressure although some subambient pressure loop have been observed. From the other hand, analysis taking precise description of the flow or microscopic properties of the flow (evolution of the bubbles, initial density) into account and which seems to be retained only for specific situations. It will be shown in this paper that continuum methods in which the flow is treated as a compressible fluid employing a void fraction variable to quantify the intensity of cavitation seems to be a good compromise between these two ways. Moreover, they can be used not only using the full Navier Stokes equation, but using Reynolds approximation formulae: a generalized compressible Reynolds equation. It has been however pointed out that the fact of reintroducing some compressibility aspects in the Reynolds equation after some non-dimensionalization and simplification, starting from incompressible Reynolds equation can be logically questioned. So it is mandatory to begin the study by considering a full compressible Navier Stokes system and then proceed with a thin film approximation to get the desired equation. It will be seen in the first section that recent mathematical developments can justify this procedure. Various compressibility and viscosity law will be presented in the second section. At last we evidence the link between Reynolds compressible equation and JFO Elrod Adams model...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{management}} of dry mouth {{is essential for}} patients with Sjögren's syndrome. The symptomatic treatment has included using air humidifiers, rinsing the mouth with water or mouthwash, {{the application of a}} salivary substitute and administration of secretagogues. There are three secretagogues suitable for the alleviation of dry mouth in Sjögren's syndrome patients in Japan; cevimeline hydrochloride hydrate (cevimeline), pilocarpine hydrochloride, and anetholtrithione. A relationship between the effect of cevimeline on saliva secretion and the degree of salivary gland destruction evaluated by sialography and histopathological findings in the labial minor salivary glands has been reported. These diagnostic approaches could provide useful prognostic information on the efficacy of cevimeline in Sjögren's syndrome patients. Concomitantly, a bite guard was suggested as an effective <b>lubricating</b> <b>device</b> because it maintains the lubricants in the proper location. In addition, the {{management of}} the complications of dry mouth, such as tooth caries, periodontitis and oral candidiasis, which all lead to a reduction in the QOL, is also important.

40|$|Application of {{estimation}} {{and monitoring}} in drilling industry {{has found a}} wide-spread attention among researchers. One of the main areas relates to the efficient supervision and control of drilling operations. For instance, during drilling oil wells, a fluid is pumped into drill string. This fluid is circulated through drill pipe and drill bit to bottom of the well and then is directed to the surface via annulus to transfer cutting material, meanwhile, cooling and <b>lubricating</b> the drilling <b>devices</b> located {{at the bottom of}} well. This causes the pressure between the drilling fluid and formation to be varied, leading to kick phenomenon and ultimately resulting into probable blow out if it is left uncontrolled. Therefore, estimation and monitoring of bottom hole pressure is treated as a necessary requirement during well drilling operations [2], [3]. In this paper, we are interested to investigate the feasibility of using adaptive observer technique to realize monitoring of drilling operations in oil wells from the essential and critical operational problem views, being considered in the work. The resulting developed estimation and monitoring systems will be implemented and evaluated in simulation environment on the basis of accessible operational data from candidate oil wells...|$|R
40|$|Modelling and {{simulation}} in tribology, {{and more}} specifically of friction in lubricated contacts, has gained increasing attention over the past years. In a lubricated contact, the dissipation of energy {{is due to the}} relative motion of the mating surfaces and arise due to direct contact as well as shearing of the lubricant film. The presence of a thin lubricant film is crucial for the operation of various machine elements, e. g., for the concentrated contact between the rolling element and the raceway in a bearing. The contact in this type of applications is typically exhibiting substantial elastic deformation which together with hydrodynamics governs the formation of the lubricant film. Therefore, these type of contacts are said to operate in the Elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) regime. An elastohydrodynamically lubricated contact can be classified as line, circular or elliptical. The line contacts can also represent a truncated ellipse or be of finite length. The line contact that appears between two cylindrically shaped bodies of infinite length does of course not exist in reality. It does, however, constitute an important type of simplification of the contact in real applications where the contact length perpendicular to direction of motion is comparatively large. The {{reason for this is that}} it permits a 2 D-model for the flow and there are analytical solutions, at least in the most elementary cases. The circular and the fully elliptical contacts are more complicated. The case where the surfaces are fully separated by the lubricant film has, however, been addressed by many researchers and there are quite a few papers reporting numerical predictions validated by experimental data. The finite length line and truncated elliptical contact are even more challenging, but these are also the only physically reasonable models for EHL contacts exhibiting edge effects, created by profiled rollers or in cases where the contact ellipse becomes larger than the physical size of the contacting elements. This thesis presents the development of a fully coupled model that can be used to predict the pressure build-up and lubricant film formation in finite length line contacts. More precisely, in EHL contacts where the rolling element have profiled edges (fillets) and the surface of the counteracting element is wider than the roller, e. g., in a typical cam-roller follower contact. Hereafter this type of contact will be referred to as a 'finite EHL line contact'. The numerical analyses, conducted with the present model, were designed so that generic knowledge about friction in cam-roller follower applications would be generated, but also to provide for the development of a semi-analytical for fast and efficient estimation of friction. There are quite a few parameters that affect the friction in EHL contacts and it is already a challenge to include the most basic ones in the model. The most advanced and sophisticated models are very complex with millions of degrees of freedom and are, therefore, not yet feasible to conduct parametric studies with. The extreme conditions associated with EHL, i. e., nm thin films, with phase transition from liquid to solid, GPa pressure, temperature increase with considerable implications on lubricant flow and surface chemistry, etc., makes it even more difficult to model these systems. When modelling a cam-roller follower application, which typically results in a finite length EHL line contact, the size and geometry of the contacting parts further complicates modeling of EHL. The main objective, with this thesis project, was to design a low degree of freedom model that can be employed in a multibody dynamics model, to estimate EHL friction in milliseconds and yet capturing the most important features of a lubricated contact including edge effects. This resulted in a semi-analytical low degree of freedom (LDOF) model taking thermal effects into account and that include lubricant shear thinning and compressibility, in order to estimate the viscosity and volume of the lubricant. In addition, this LDOF model was extended to perform friction prediction covering the mixed lubrication regime where colliding asperities partially influence shearing of the lubricant. The extended, mixed lubrication LDOF, model was utilized to perform friction predictions covering a range of operating conditions, which were also covered in an experimental investigation using a ball-on-disk test device. The results turned out to compare well, suggesting that the model established in this project, is a usable tool that can be employed when designing <b>lubricated</b> <b>devices</b> and that it constitutes a suitable foundation for further developments...|$|R
