50|$|President Baltar {{meets with}} the Cylons who insist {{they will not}} attack unless the humans resist. They explain that New Caprica was found by {{accident}} when they detected, from over a <b>light-year</b> <b>away,</b> the signature of the nuclear explosion which destroyed Cloud Nine.

Meanwhile, Thrace, Tigh, Roslin, Tyrol, Cally and others watch as Cylon Centurions march through the New Caprica settlement, and vow to resist.|$|R
5|$|Located on {{the border}} with Circinus is the unusual {{planetary}} nebula NGC 5189, estimated to be around 1750light-years away from Earth. Its complex structure is due to multiple ejections of material from the ageing central star, which are distorted by the presence of a likely binary companion. Located 2.4° east of Eta Muscae is the magnitude-12.9 Engraved Hourglass Nebula (MyCn18), which lies about 8000 light-years distant from Earth. To Eta's west lies IC 4191, a compact bluish planetary nebula of magnitude 10.6, thought to lie around 10,750 <b>light-years</b> <b>away</b> from Earth. West of Epsilon Muscae is NGC 4071, a large, diffuse planetary nebula of magnitude 12.7 with a magnitude 12 central star, thought to lie around 4000 <b>light-years</b> <b>away</b> from Earth. The Coalsack Nebula is a dark nebula located mainly in neighbouring Crux that intrudes into Musca. NGC 4463 is an open cluster located on its southwestern border.

5|$|HD 28185 is {{a yellow}} dwarf star similar to our Sun located about 138 <b>light-years</b> <b>away</b> from Earth in the {{constellation}} Eridanus. The designation HD 28185 refers to its entry in the Henry Draper catalogue. The star is known to possess one long-period extrasolar planet.|$|E
5|$|NGC 2537, {{known as}} the Bear's Paw Galaxy, lies about 3 degrees north-northwest of 31 Lyncis. It is a blue compact dwarf galaxy that is somewhere between 17 and 30 million <b>light-years</b> <b>away</b> from Earth. Close by is IC 2233, a very flat and thin spiral galaxy that is between 26 and 40 million <b>light-years</b> <b>away</b> from Earth. A {{comparatively}} quiet galaxy with a low rate of star formation (less than one solar mass every twenty years), it was long suspected to be interacting with the Bear's Paw galaxy. This is now considered highly unlikely as observations with the Very Large Array showed the two galaxies lie at different distances.|$|E

5|$|Astronomical {{distances}} {{are sometimes}} expressed in light-years, especially in popular science publications and media. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, around 9461billion kilometres, 5879billion miles, or 0.3066 parsecs. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10trillion kilometres or nearly 6trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 <b>light-years</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 d is an {{exoplanet}} approximately 15 <b>light-years</b> <b>away</b> in {{the constellation}} of Aquarius. The planet was the third planet discovered orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876.

It is also noted for its one-sided radio jet—one of the brightest known—discovered in 1977.|$|E
5|$|At {{least four}} of the fifteen stars visible to the unaided eye are orange giants of {{spectral}} class K. The second brightest star in the constellation—at apparent magnitude 4.1—is Zeta Telescopii, an orange subgiant of spectral type K1III-IV. Around 1.53 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 512 times its luminosity. Located 127 light years away from Earth, it {{has been described as}} yellow or reddish in appearance. Epsilon Telescopii is a binary star system: the brighter component, Epsilon Telescopii A, is an orange giant of spectral type K0III with an apparent magnitude of +4.52, while the 13th magnitude companion, Epsilon Telescopii B, is 21 arcseconds away from the primary, and just visible with a 15cm aperture telescope on a dark night.

5|$|Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, {{commonly}} known as the Circinus Galaxy. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the Milky Way, since their dim light is obscured by gas and dust. This oblong spiral galaxy with 6.9by3.0arcminutes and 26,000light-years in diameter, is located 13 million <b>light-years</b> <b>away</b> from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane. It is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way, and therefore hosts an active galactic nucleus.|$|E
