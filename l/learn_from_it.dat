In the story, the deity Vahiyinin ("Existence") spat onto earth, and his spittle became the wapaq, and his saliva becomes the warts. After {{experiencing}} the power of the wapaq, Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>it.</b> Among the Koryaks, one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>it,</b> {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E
5|$|A {{major element}} of the plot {{is based on the}} wuxia film series Palm of Ru Lai (如來神掌), {{released}} in 1964. Sing studied the fighting style used in Palm of Ru Lai ("Buddhist Palm style"), from a young age and used it at the end of Kung Fu Hustle. In reality, the Buddhist Palm fighting style does not leave palm-shaped craters and holes on impact. Instead, the user delivers powerful punches using his palm. The Beast's name in Chinese, Huoyun Xieshen (火雲邪神; Evil Deity of the Fiery Cloud), and the fight with the Landlady and her husband are also references to the Palm of Ru Lai, in which a mortally wounded master strikes the patterns of his art's final techniques into a bell so that his apprentice can <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>it.</b> Kung Fu Hustle also contains direct references to characters from Louis Cha's wuxia novels. For example, the landlord and landlady refer to themselves as Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü, the names of characters in Cha's The Return of the Condor Heroes, when they met the Beast.|$|E

25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose {{the other part of the}} discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E

500|$|The use of {{the phrase}} as a {{reference}} to demagoguery and hypocrisy is traced to a Russian political joke about a dispute between an American and a Soviet man. After receiving criticism of his country beca{{use of the}} deaths caused by the 1905 anti-Jewish Kishinev pogrom, the Russian Ambassador to the United States pointed out [...] "Americans had recently lynched blacks". The Russian Ambassador said locals engaged in violence when drunk, [...] "just like Americans." [...] Soviet artist Dmitri Moor produced the lithograph Freedom to the Prisoners of Scottsboro!, after the 1931 trial of the Scottsboro Boys of Alabama. The treatment of the Scottsboro Boys popularized the phrase in usage by the Soviet Union against the U.S. {{as a form of}} criticism against those who themselves criticized human rights abuses. In his 1934 book Russia Today: What Can We <b>Learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>It?,</b> Sherwood Eddy wrote: [...] "In the most remote villages of Russia today Americans are frequently asked {{what they are going to}} do to the Scottsboro Negro boys and why they lynch Negroes." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of composing [...] "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for {{she did not know}} how her friend would respond. [...] "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." [...] However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: [...] "She said, 'Does it bother you that your name is in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl can kind of <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it." [...] With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded [...] "Fifteen" [...] with producer Nathan Chapman, who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to {{the fact that she is}} most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences. She went to say [...] "Fifteen" [...] usually gets her every time.|$|E

The two had already been embroiled in an argument after the previous Grand Prix in China, when Vettel felt that Kvyat had caused a collision between the two Ferrari drivers. This time around, Vettel reacted to his retirement with what The Telegraph described as [...] "one of the most explosive outbursts heard over team radio for years". He later demanded an apology from Kvyat, as did Red Bull teammate Ricciardo, who felt that Kvyat, who pushed Vettel into him, had ruined his race as well. Red Bull announced that they would summon Kvyat to talks about the incident, calling their race a [...] "disaster", with Helmut Marko, the team's young driver coordinator, calling him [...] "over-motivated". Kvyat received three penalty points on his licence {{as a result of the}} incident. He himself said after the race: [...] "I apologise to everyone who is involved and I will <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>it.</b> I think we have to speak.

[...] However, the team were beaten comprehensively in the next round to Chelsea at Highbury, losing 0–5. The result inflicted Arsenal's biggest defeat in over eight years and Wenger defended his team selection, virtually a 'second team': [...] "I knew before the game that this kind of thing might happen. You only had to look at the team sheets. If we had won I would still have gone on playing the same side because the players need the experience." [...] Bergkamp, who was rested for the match, echoed his manager's comments: [...] "We had a lot of young players on the field against Chelsea and, although they were feeling very down after losing like that, they will <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>it.</b> To be honest, the scoreline doesn't mean anything, whether it was 1–0 or 5–0.

Since it was very obvious that I didn’t, a minor schism developed". Mardas boasted that he could build a much better studio, with a 72-track tape machine, instead of the 4-track at Abbey Road—which was being updated at the time to an 8-track—so he was given the job of designing the new Apple Studio in the basement of Apple headquarters on Savile Row. One of Mardas' more outrageous plans was to replace the acoustic baffles around Starr's drums with an invisible sonic force field. Starr remembered that Mardas bought some [...] "huge" [...] computers from British Aerospace, which were stored in his barn, but [...] "they never left the barn", and were later sold as scrap metal.|$|E
500|$|Garland {{entered the}} season as one of four seniors on La Salle's men's {{basketball}} roster. Ramon Galloway, who led the team in scoring in 2012–13, graduated the previous year. Garland debuted as a senior in an exhibition game vs Indiana University of Pennsylvania on November 2, 2013, scoring 16 points on [...]500 shooting. He made his first official appearance in a double-overtime home contest against Manhattan. Garland led a 13–3 run, highlighted by two key shots, that forced overtime. He made a three-pointer with {{minutes left in the}} game, but his team ran out of time before they could rally. Nevertheless, Garland scored a career-high 28 points, hitting 12 free throws. He had an effective second game as well. Against Quinnipiac at the ESPN Tip-Off Marathon, despite scoring far fewer points, his last-minute rebound was instrumental to the Explorers' victory. Head coach John Giannini said, [...] "He had zero rebounds in 44 minutes against Manhattan. The rebound that really iced the game today was a defensive rebound by Tyrone. Sometimes you don't play well, you don't do something, and then you <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> and do better, so I am pleased with him". The guard had another notable performance on November 22, 2013, against Morgan State, when he led both teams with 25 points. He also added four three-pointers. On January 25, 2014, Garland notched a career-best 30 points vs VCU. His team's 10-point 2014 Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to St. Bonaventure, in which he contributed 0 points in 30 minutes, marked the end of his collegiate career. He finished the season averaging 12.6 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 0.7 steals. Garland, Sam Mills, Tyreek Duren, and Taylor Dunn, recorded the most wins for a single senior class at La Salle in 22 years.|$|E
