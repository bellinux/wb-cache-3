40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} work examined, from both the query side and the user behaviour side, the characteristics of medical and health-related searches. One of the core issues in medical information retrieval is diversity of tasks that lead to diversity of categories of information needs and queries. From the evaluation perspective, another related challenging issue is the limited availability of appropriate test collections allowing the experimental validation of medically task oriented IR techniques and systems. Since 2003, medical standardized evaluation benchmarks such as TREC and CLEF provide to information retrieval research community various controlled medical tasks specifications with related document collections, queries, relevance assessment and specific metadata. The literature clearly reports a rapid increase {{in the use of}} these evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we explore the peculiarities of TREC and CLEF medically oriented tasks and queries through the analysis of the differences and the similarities between queries across tasks, with respect to <b>length,</b> specificity <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> features <b>and</b> then study their effect on retrieval performance. More specifically, we developed an exploratory data analysis as well as a predictive data analysis using 11 TREC and CLEF medical test collections containing 374 queries and their corresponding document collections and expert relevance assessments, organized according to the involved medical tasks. Based on the outcome of our study, we show that, even for expert oriented queries, language specificity level varies significantly across tasks as well as search difficulty and that the most related predictive factors are linked to query <b>length</b> <b>and</b> query <b>clarity.</b> Additional findings highlight that query clarity factors are task dependent and that query terms specificity based on domain-specific terminology resources is not significantly linked to term rareness in the document collection. The lessons learned from our study could serve as starting points for the design of future task-based medical IR frameworks...|$|R

40|$|NetLogo {{has become}} a {{standard}} platform for agent-based simulation, yet {{there appears to be}} widespread belief that it is not suitable for large and complex models due to slow execution. Our experience does not support that belief. NetLogo programs often do run very slowly when written to minimize code <b>length</b> <b>and</b> maximize <b>clarity,</b> but relatively simple and easily tested changes can almost always produce major increases in execution speed. We recommend a five-step process for quantifying execution speed, identifying slow parts of code, and writing faster code. Avoiding or improving agent filtering statements can often produce dramatic speed improvements. For models with extensive initialization methods, reorganizing the setup procedure can reduce the initialization effort in simulation experiments. Programming the same behavior in a different way can sometimes provide order-of-magnitude speed increases. For models in which most agents do nothing on most time steps, discrete event simulation—facilitated by the time extension to NetLogo—can dramatically increase speed. NetLogo’s BehaviorSpace tool makes it very easy to conduct multiple-model-run experiments in parallel on either desktop or high performance cluster computers, so even quite slow models can be executed thousands of times. NetLogo also is supported by efficient analysis tools, such as BehaviorSearch and RNetLogo, that can reduce the number of model runs and the effort to set them up for (e. g.) parameterization and sensitivity analysis...|$|R

The PLCO Trial is a 23 -year randomized controlled clinical trial begun in 1992. The sample for this substudy, which was conducted from January to April of 1998, consisted of 900 control and 450 screened PLCO participants aged 55 – 74 years. Controls received either the DHQ or the PLCO FFQ by mail. Screenees, who had previously completed the PLCO FFQ at baseline, were administered the DHQ. Among controls, the response rate for both FFQs was 82 %. Average amounts of time needed by controls to complete the DHQ and the PLCO FFQ were 68 minutes and 39 minutes, respectively. Percentages of missing or uninterpretable responses were similar between instruments for questions on frequency of intake but were approximately 3 and 9 percentage points lower (p ≤ 0. 001) in the DHQ for questions on portion size and use of vitamin/mineral supplements, respectively. Among screenees, response rates for the DHQ and the PLCO FFQ were 84 % and 89 %, respectively, and analyses of questions on portion size and supplement use showed few differences. These data indicated that the shorter FFQ was not better from the perspective of response rate and data quality, and that clarity and ease of administration may compensate fo...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients are a {{valuable}} {{source of information}} about ways to prevent harm in primary care and are {{in a unique position to}} provide feedback about the factors that contribute to safety incidents. Unlike in the hospital setting, there are currently no tools that allow the systematic capture of this information from patients. The aim of this study was to develop a quantitative primary care patient measure of safety (PC PMOS). METHODS: A two-stage approach was undertaken to develop questionnaire domains and items. Stage 1 involved a modified Delphi process. An expert panel reached consensus on domains and items based on three sources of information (validated hospital PMOS, previous research conducted by our study team and literature on threats to patient safety). Stage 2 involved testing the face validity of the questionnaire developed during stage 1 with patients and primary care staff using the 2 ̆ 7 think aloud 2 ̆ 7 method. Following this process, the questionnaire was revised accordingly. RESULTS: The PC PMOS was received positively by both patients and staff during face validity testing. Barriers to completion included the <b>length,</b> relevance <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> of questions. The final PC PMOS consisted of 50 items across 15 domains. The contributory factors to safety incidents centred on communication, access to care, patient-related factors, organisation and care planning, task performance and information flow. DISCUSSION: This is the first tool specifically designed for primary care settings, which allows patients to provide feedback about factors contributing to potential safety incidents. The PC PMOS provides a way for primary care organisations to learn about safety from the patient perspective and make service improvements with the aim of reducing harm in this setting. Future research will explore the reliability and construct validity of the PC PMOS...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Obesity is a {{risk factor}} for {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). In an era of rapidly growing prevalence of obesity, it is important to explore the current knowledge, attitude, and practices of primary care physicians. Materials and Methods: Study participants were medical officers (MOs) of primary health centers in three districts of North Karnataka. The questionnaire was developed by a review of literature in the field and validated with five participants for scope, <b>length,</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarity.</b> Results/Discussion: Of the 102 participants, only 15 % were aware about the burden of obesity in India. HTN, DM, and CVD were indicated as comorbidities by 73, 78, and 60 participants, respectively. Only 25 and 12 participants indicated appropriate body mass index (BMI) cut-off values for overweight and obesity diagnosis. Of the 102 participants, 54 were not aware of the guidelines for obesity management. Practices and attitudes of the participants were encouraging. Nearly all of them felt that the adults with BMI within the healthy range should be encouraged to maintain their weight and, three-fourth of them agreed that most overweight persons should be treated for weight loss and small weight loss can achieve major medical benefit. However, nearly half of the participants′ responses were stereotypical as they felt only obese and overweight with comorbidities should be treated for weight loss. Two-thirds of them use BMI to diagnose overweight/obese and nearly all of them advice their patients to increase physical activity and restrict fat. Most of the participants were advising their patients to restrict sugar intake, increase fruits and vegetable consumption, reduce red meat, and avoid alcohol consumption. Conclusion: Present study exposed the lack of knowledge regarding obesity. However, practices and attitudes of the participants were promising. There is a need of in-service training to MOs to further improve their knowledge and practices towards management of obesity...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} work done {{as part of}} the {{development}} of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors of the LHCb experiment. The context of this work is set out in Chapter 1, which includes an overview of the physics of CP violation, followed by a discussion of other experiments that study B physics. LHCb itself is then described, with particular emphasis on its RICH detectors, and the photon detectors to be used therein. The work done by the author to ensure an adequate shielding of the photon detectors in the two RICH detectors from the magnetic fields produced by the LHCb dipole is then presented. A candidate photodetector for the RICH is the Pixel HPD. The author's contribution to the upgrade of the HPD test system to operate at the LHC bunch-crossing rate of 40 MHz is the subject of the following section. This system was used to investigate and optimise a method of minimising the threshold distribution of the Pixel HPD's encapsulated readout chip. The final chapter of the thesis concerns the aerogel radiator of the upstream RICH detector. The results of a test-beam experiment to measure the properties of some candidate aerogel samples are presented, along with simulation studies motivated by the test-beam results. The effect of an unexplained increase in the Cherenkov angle error observed at the test-beam on the channel Bs->DsK is simulated, followed by an investigation into the consequences for that channel of altering the aerogel <b>length</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarity.</b> A study into the effects on the RICH reconstruction performance due to the effects of delta-ray generation within the aerogel are presented.

40|$|Environmental education, as a {{component}} of the school curriculum, is unique. Some aspects of the content change rapidly with new research, and environmental education is a relative newcomer to the curriculum. Assessment of the status of environmental education, therefore, needs to be done at relatively short intervals in order to assure that the curriculum is relevant and current. No needs assessment instrument could be found which would not only collect information about {{the quantity and quality of}} environmental education in a school setting, but also would gather the opinions of both teachers and administrators. The assumption was that knowledge from both levels of staff could provide communication important to the process of developing or modifying an effective, consistent environmental education curriculum. The purpose of the thesis, then, was to determine whether a needs assessment instrument could be developed which would provide useful answers to several questions determined to be helpful to curriculum planners. The procedures included development of the instrument (a questionnaire was chosen due to the desire for anonymity and the number of individuals to be surveyed), pilot testing it for content, <b>length</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarity,</b> administration of the final form of the instrument to a test school district, analysis of the findings, and presentation of the findings in formats which illustrated the ability of the questionnaire to provide information useful to the planning process. It was concluded the needs assessment instrument did gather information about current and desired amounts of environmental education in the curriculum and effectively answered specific questions about topics and methods incorporated in environmental education. Furthermore, the questionnaire collected information which would allow planners to compare responses of teachers who have had environmental education training with responses of teachers who have not had such training. Finally, the survey provided a basis for comparing the opinions of teachers and administrators. In summary, the findings indicate the needs assessment instrument is a useful tool for curriculum planners in collecting much of the information necessary for a thorough needs assessment process. Additionally, the questionnaire is adaptable to diverse circumstances, and can be readily modified. This needs assessment instrument could prove valuable in the continuous process of evaluating and updating the various aspects of an environmental education curriculum with the goal of maintaining relevant and effective content.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In 1994 a pilot-study of the {{so-called}} PIENTER-project was carried out. The aim of this project {{is to establish a}} serum bank of a representative sample of the Dutch population. The serum bank will be used to estimate age-specific immunity of the general population against childhood diseases of the Netherlands Immunisation Programme, the incidence of infectious diseases with a frequent subclinical course and the prevalence of serum-derterminants of other illnesses. The questionnaire used in the pilot-study was evaluated in order to develop a questionnaire for the nation-wide data collection. AIM Evaluation of the questionnaire used for data collection in a pilot of a cross-sectional population-based study in the province of Utrecht. METHODS A sample of four municipalities weighted by the number of inhabitants was taken out of the municipalities in the Province of Utrecht. 510 persons in the age strata 0, 1 - 4, 5 - 9 to 75 - 79 years were randomly selected from the populations registers of these four municipalities. The participants have been asked to give some blood and to fill in a questionnaire. They have been requested to bring their vaccination certificates of the Dutch immunisation programme, of vaccination on the occasion travelling to the tropics and of military service. These vaccination data were registered on a study form. The opinion of the participants on the <b>length</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> of the questionnaire and the frequency of missing values for all questions were described. The population proportions weighted by age for self-reported vaccination history and the relation with religion were given. Self-reported vaccination history for diphteria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis and mumps, measles and rubella was compared with information on the vaccination history derived from the vaccination certificate of the Dutch immunisation programme. The proportions weighted by age for self-perception of health status, nationality and level of education were compared with the figures of the Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics for the Dutch general population. The expected number of persons in subgroups for level of education, religion, nationality, ethnicity and participation on the Dutch immunisation programme in the nation-wide study were calculated on the basis of results of the pilot. In order to calculate the expected precision of the estimates of the seroprevalence in these subgroups to be reached in the nation-wide study, the serological results for hepatitis A in the pilot were used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The results confirm a difference in vaccination history and attitude of persons who belong to specific religious groups who reject vaccination. These persons reported more frequent that they were not (completely) vaccinated and adhere more often the opinion that vaccination was not necessary. They also reported more frequently principal refusal as the reason for incomplete vaccination. However, most persons who belong to a religion from which it is known that vaccination is refused, reported that vaccination was completed. As religion and vaccination history are correlated, {{it is important for the}} analysis of seroprevalence data to collect data on religion. The self-reported vaccination history for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, mumps, measles and rubella did not agree with the vaccination certificates of the Dutch immunisation programme. Participants frequently reported that the questions on vaccination history were not clear to them. Therefore in the nation-wide study questions on vaccination history will be limited. Information on vaccination history registered in the vaccination certificates of the Dutch immunisation programme will be collected. In comparison with the figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics persons without the Dutch nationality were underrepresented in the pilot of the Pienter-project. The participants of the Pienter-project might have been not representative for the level of education. The self-perception of health status were comparable with the Central Bureau of Statistics. The precision of seroprevalence to be expected in the nation-wide data collection seems reliable for subgroups of sex, level of education and persons who report to have participated in the Dutch immunisation programme. In contrast no subgroup analysis (unless special actions are taken to increase the response) will be possible for persons with a non-Dutch nationality or ethnicity. For reliable seroprevalence estimates for persons (younger than 40 year) who have not participated in the Dutch Immunisation Programme and persons who belong to a religion from which it is known that vaccination is refused research has to be carried out in municipalities with a low vaccin coverage such that the number of persons in these subgroups will increase...|$|E
