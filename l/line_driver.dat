25|$|The first trials did {{not occur}} until October 1918 on the Flemington Racecourse <b>line.</b> <b>Driver</b> {{training}} continued on this line until 18 May 1919, when the first electric train ran between Sandringham and Essendon, simulating revenue services. Electric services started on 28 May 1919 with the first train running to Essendon, then on to Sandringham. Full services started the next day. The Burnley–Darling line, the Fawkner line, the reopened branch to Altona, and the Williamstown line followed in 1920.|$|E

With technology scaling, it is becoming increasingly challenging to maintain the yield while attempting to reduce the leakage power of SRAMs. The sources of SRAM power are the sum of the power consumed by decoders, memory array, write drivers, Sense amplifiers, and I/O <b>line</b> <b>drivers.</b> This paper is mainly focuses on the development of power and delay efficient SRAM structure. The paper describes the comparison of different CMOS tapper buffer topology's as word <b>line</b> <b>drivers</b> while driving large capacitive loads for minimizing {{power dissipation}} and propagation delay. The comparison has been designed and simulated using Cadence Virtuoso Spectre in 180 nm technology...|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{key role}} RSCS played in {{building}} networks, the line drivers {{became known as the}} “RSCS Protocols.” Ironically, the supported protocols were drawn from other programs. The CPREMOTE protocol may have been the very first symmetrical protocol (sometimes called a “balanced” protocol). To expand the RSCS network to include MVS, Hartmann reverse-engineered the HASP Network Job Interface protocol, which enabled the network to grow rapidly. He later added the JES2 Network Job Entry as an RSCS/VNET <b>line</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E
25|$|Buffer amplifiers, {{which may}} include emitter followers, provide a high {{impedance}} input for a device (perhaps another amplifier, or perhaps an energy-hungry load such as lights) {{that would otherwise}} draw too much current from the source. <b>Line</b> <b>drivers</b> are a type of buffer that feeds long or interference-prone interconnect cables, possibly with differential outputs through twisted pair cables.|$|R
