5000|$|A loan <b>line</b> <b>sheet</b> {{is a work}} {{document}} used by bank examiners who can {{be either}} bank regulators or bank [...] "third party" [...] or consulting examiners. The <b>line</b> <b>sheet</b> represents the examiner's review of a bank loan, whether a loan to a company or to an individual. The <b>line</b> <b>sheet</b> initially contains basic information about the particular loan in question, such as the original amount of the loan, the current balance, the monthly payment, etc. The examiner then uses the <b>line</b> <b>sheet</b> to review the loan file, and makes his/her own notations and analysis on the <b>line</b> <b>sheet</b> to document {{the review of the}} loan.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{inventor}}s {{tried to}} expand the amount of images {{that could be used}} in line screen technology, which was mostly limited to how wide the lines could be without making the image too dark. French inventor Maurice Bonnet (1907-1994) made several patented improvements with his Relièphographie system of the same name. He used a camera with a horizontal row of eleven lenses (French patent N° 774145, June 5, 1934), followed by one with 33 lenses in 1937 (French patent n°833891, July 2, 1937). The darkness of the images is remedied with a lightbox frame. While the pictures of Estanave could only be seen from the right viewpoint, the multiple images that formed the Relièphographs ensured a clear 3D image when viewed from different angles. Bonnet was the only creator of autostereograms with <b>line</b> <b>sheet</b> technology who managed to successfully market his technique, for which he founded his [...] "La Relièphographie" [...] company in 1937. About 13 extant Relièphographie pictures by Bonnet are known, including three advertisements, two portraits and eight medical subjects. With their 30x40 cm format these are the largest preserved <b>line</b> <b>sheet</b> autostereograms. Despite the success Bonnet abandoned <b>line</b> <b>sheet</b> technology after he developed a lenticular sheet around 1940.|$|E

50|$|A <b>line</b> <b>sheet</b> in {{wholesale}} sales is a sheet {{used by a}} manufacturer in the garment/fashion industry providing information on a product. It allows a garment to be listed with the sizes in its size range, great for inventory tracking. It typically includes a line drawing or photograph of the product (possibly computer generated), its identification or SKU number, the style, and perhaps a swatch showing color and fabric. In lieu of swatches industry color standards such as Pantone numbers may be used. Price, minimum order amounts, order cutoff dates, contact and delivery information are also included. In the Internet era, these paper copies are being replaced by online resources like Joor.|$|E
5000|$|French {{mathematician}} Eugène Estanave {{was encouraged}} by Gaumont to investigate the parallax stereogram and started working with the technique late in 1905. On January 24, 1906, Estanave filed for French patent 371.487 for a stereophotography device and stereoscopy using <b>line</b> <b>sheets.</b> It included his [...] "changing" [...] pictures that applied the principle of Ives' [...] "Changeable sign" [...] to animated photography, for instance {{the portrait of a}} woman with eyes open or closed depending on the viewing angle. On February 3, 1910 he requested an addition to his patent to include animated stereoscopic photography. This system used <b>line</b> <b>sheets</b> with vertical and horizontal lines, and combined four images: two stereoscopic pairs of two different moments. August 1, 1908 Estanave was granted French patent N° 392871 for an autostereoscopic photographic plate. This plate was exposed and developed to create a positive stereoscopic image, avoiding the trouble of aligning the interlaced photograph with a line screen. In the same year he was awarded a special price at the French Academy of Sciences by Gabriel Lippmann for an x-ray stereogram. In 1911 Estanave discovered another variation: the Joly colour screen (with lines in three colors) could be adapted to create color photographs with the hues shifting when the viewing angle was changed. Fifteen examples of Estanave's stereograms are known to have survived. He seems not have commercialized any of his methods. Others marketed very similar animated portraits, usually with plastic <b>line</b> <b>sheets,</b> with some success in the 1910s and 1920s.|$|R

5000|$|The oldest known {{publication}} {{about using}} a <b>line</b> <b>sheet</b> as a parallax barrier {{to produce an}} autostereogram is found in an article by Auguste Berthier in the French scientific magazine [...] "Le Cosmos" [...] of May 1896. Berthier's idea was hardly noticed, but American inventor Frederic Eugene Ives had more success with his very similar parallax stereogram since 1901. He also patented the technique for a [...] "Changeable sign, picture, &c." [...] in 1903, which showed different pictures from different angles (instead of one stereoscopic image from the right angle and distance). Léon Gaumont introduced Ives' pictures in France and encouraged Eugène Estanave {{to work on the}} technique. Estanave patented a barrier grid technique for animated autostereograms. Animated portrait photographs with line sheets were marketed for a while, mostly in the 1910s and 1920s. In the US [...] "Magic Moving Picture" [...] postcards with simple 3 phase animation or changing pictures were marketed after 1906. Maurice Bonnett improved barrier grid autostereography in the 1930s with his relièphographie technique and scanning cameras.|$|E

The complex function theory is employed to obtain the exact solution to a finite thin conductive layer.

The stress and electric field are found to have an inverse square root singularity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{investigation of the}} flow control in an air intake S-shaped diffuser with and without energy promoters. The S-shaped diffuser had an area ratio 3. 1 and turning angle of 45 °/ 45 °. The proposed energy promoter was named as stream <b>line</b> <b>sheet</b> energy promoter. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation was performed through commercial ANSYS-FLUENT 16. 2 software. The measurements were made inside annular subsection, 45 ° from 360 ° of the complete annular shape of the diffuser, at Reynolds number 5. 8 × 104 and turbulence intensity 4. 1 %. Results for the bare S-shaped diffuser (without energy promoters) showed the flow structures within the S-shaped diffuser were dominated by counter-rotating vortices and boundary layer separation especially in the outer surface. The combination of the adverse pressure gradient at the first bend of outer surface and upstream low momentum wakes caused the boundary layer to separate early. The combinations of proposed energy promoters were installed on {{the inner and outer}} surfaces at three installation planes. The use of energy promoters resulting in significantly decreased the outer surface boundary layer separation with consequential improving the static pressure coefficient and reduction of total pressure losse...|$|E
