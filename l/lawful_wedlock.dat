Joan's family were present, and Isabelle made an impassioned speech which began: [...] "I had a {{daughter}} born in <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock,</b> whom I had furnished worthily with the sacraments of baptism and confirmation and had reared in the fear of God {{and respect for the}} tradition of the Church... yet although she never did think, conceive, or do anything whatever which set her out of the path of the faith... certain enemies ... had her arraigned in religious trial... in a trial perfidious, violent, iniquitous, and without shadow of right... did they condemn her in a fashion damnable and criminal, and put her to death very cruelly by fire... for the damnation of their souls and in notorious, infamous, and irreparable damage done to me, Isabelle, and mine".|$|E

60|$|Berenger's own packet contained, in {{the first}} place, {{a copy of the}} cassation of the marriage, on the ground of its having been {{contracted}} when the parties were of too tender age to give their legal consent, and its having been unsatisfied since they had reached ecclesiastical years for <b>lawful</b> contraction of <b>wedlock.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{understand}} what you mean, sir. Mr. Monson, that would be degrading <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock</b> {{to the level of}} a bet--a game of cards--a mercenary, contemptible bargain. No, sir--nothing shall ever induce me to degrade this honorable estate to such pitiful conditions!" ...|$|E
60|$|There were {{a couple}} of delicate, olive-cheeked little girls--twins--with mild eyes and {{beautiful}} hair, who ran about the house, half-naked, like a couple of gazelles. They had a brother, somewhat younger--a fine dark boy, with an eye like a woman's. All these were the children of Po-Po, begotten in <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock.</b>|$|E
60|$|Richard having, as he said, kept {{these facts}} secret during his brother's lifetime, out of {{regard for the}} peace of the family, now felt it his duty to make them known, in order to prevent the wrong which would be done by {{allowing}} the crown to descend to a son who, not being born in <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock,</b> could have no rights as heir.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{poor little}} fellow--born in <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock,</b> thank God. And perhaps she feels, {{over and above}} other things, that I {{ought to have been}} in her place. I can't say. However, as for me, I am soon off from here. I've got Father to look after now, and we can't live in such a hum-drum place as this. I hope soon to be in a bar again at Christminster, or some other big town." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{she stood}} there that moment--proud, crimson, breathless--Walter Brydges would have married her if {{her father had been}} a tinker and her mother a gipsy girl. He drew her toward him tenderly. [...] "No, darling," [...] he cried, kissing her, for he was a chivalrous young man, as he {{understood}} chivalry; and to him it was indeed a most cruel blow to learn that his future wife was born out of <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock.</b> [...] "I'm proud of you; I love you. I worship the very ground your sweet feet tread on. Nothing on earth could make me anything but grateful and thankful for the gift of your love you're gracious enough to bestow on me." ...|$|E

Her death left the infant who survived her by a few hours (the infant born, you will remember, in <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock)</b> possessed, in due legal course, of the whole of Mr. Vanstone's fortune. On the child's death--if it had only outlived the mother by a few seconds, instead of a few hours, the result would have been the same--the next of kin to the legitimate offspring took the money; and that next of kin is the infant's paternal uncle, Michael Vanstone. The whole fortune of eighty thousand pounds has virtually passed into his possession already." ...|$|E
60|$|Let's get Mr. Carnegie {{to reform}} the alphabet, and we'll pray for him--if he'll take the risk. If we had adequate, {{competent}} vowels, with a system of accents, giving to each vowel its own soul and value, so every shade of that vowel would be shown in its accent, {{there is not a}} word in any tongue that we could not spell accurately. That would be competent, adequate, simplified spelling, in contrast to the clipping, the hair punching, the carbuncles, and the cancers which go by the name of simplified spelling. If I ask you what b-o-w spells you can't tell me unless you know which b-o-w I mean, and it is the same with r-o-w, b-o-r-e, and the whole family of words which were born out of <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock</b> and don't know their own origin.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the abbot}} saw Orlando weep, and his brow redden, {{and the light}} of his eyes become child-like for sweetness, he asked him the reason; but, finding him still dumb with emotion, he said, [...] "I {{do not know whether}} you are {{overpowered}} by admiration of what is painted in this chamber. You must know that I am of high descent, though not through <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock.</b> I believe I may say I am nephew or sister's son to no less a man than that Rinaldo, who was so great a Paladin in the world, though my own father was not of a lawful mother. Ansuigi was his name; my own, out in the world, was Chiaramonte; and this Milo was my father's brother. Ah, gentle baron, for blessed Jesus' sake, tell me what name is yours!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fine talking, fine talking!" [...] said Cap; [...] "all fine talking, Master Pathfinder, but d----d little logic. In {{the first}} place, the king's majesty cannot lend his crown, it being {{contrary}} {{to the laws of}} the realm, which require him to wear it at all times, in order that his sacred person may be known, just as the silver oar is necessary to a sheriff's officer afloat. In the next place, it's high treason, by law, for the eldest son of his majesty ever to covet the crown, or to have a child, except in <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock,</b> as either would derange the succession. Thus you see, friend Pathfinder that in order to reason truly, one must get under way, as it might be, on the right tack. Law is reason, and reason is philosophy, and philosophy is a steady drag; whence it follows that crowns are regulated by law, reason, and philosophy." ...|$|E
60|$|Colonel Kelmscott {{that day}} was strangely touched, even before he took up his morning paper. A letter from Granville, posted at Plymouth, had just reached him by the early mail, {{to tell him that}} the only son he had ever really loved or cared for on earth had sailed the day before, a disinherited outcast, to seek his fortune in the wild wastes of Africa. How he could break the news to Lady Emily he couldn't imagine. The Colonel, {{twisting}} his white moustache, with a quivering hand on his tremulous lip, hardly dared to realize what their future would seem like. And then--he turned to the paper, and saw to his horror this awful tale of a cold-blooded and cowardly murder, committed on a friend by one who, however little he might choose to acknowledge it, was after all his own eldest son, a Kelmscott of Tilgate, as much as Granville himself, in <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock</b> duly begotten.|$|E
6000|$|... "Grieve not," [...] {{said the}} kind-hearted old man, in distress; [...] "'tis I should grieve, whose brutal words have made you weep. Moreover, Emlyn is right; even foolish women should {{not trust the}} first Jack with whom they take a lodging. Still, since you swear that you do in your kindness, I'll try to show myself not all unworthy, my Lady Harflete. Now, {{what is it you}} want from the King? Justice on the Abbot? That you'll get for nothing, if his Grace can give it, for this same Abbot stirs up {{rebellion}} against him. No need, therefore, to set out his past misdeeds. A clean title to your large inheritance, which the Abbot claims? That will be more difficult, since the King claims through him. At best, money must be paid for it. A declaration that your marriage is good and your boy born in <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock?</b> Not so hard, but will cost something. The annulment of the sentence of witchcraft on you both? Easy, for the Abbot passed it. Is there aught more?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was a {{difficult}} tale for a mother to tell to so young a child--to a child whom she had regarded as being so very young. There were various little points of law which she {{thought that she was}} obliged to explain; how it was necessary that the Castle Richmond property should go to an heir-at-law, and how it was impossible that Herbert should be that heir-at-law, seeing that he had not been born in <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock.</b> All these things Lady Desmond attempted to explain, or was about to attempt such explanation, but desisted on finding that her daughter understood them as well as she herself did. And then she had to make it also intelligible to Clara that Owen would be called on, when Sir Thomas should die, to fill the position and enjoy the wealth accruing to the heir of Castle Richmond. When Owen Fitzgerald's name was mentioned a slight blush came upon Clara's cheek; it was very slight, but nevertheless her mother saw it, and took advantage of it to say a word in Owen's favour.|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend Colonel Hume," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "tells me {{that you}} are the son, born in <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock,</b> of Colonel Leslie and Amelie de Recambours. I am aware of the {{circumstances}} of the case, being distantly related to the lady's family, and will do that which Colonel Hume asks me, namely, discover the convent in which she is living. But I warn you, young man, that your position here is a dangerous one, and that were it known that Colonel Leslie's son is alive and in France, I consider your life would not be worth a day's purchase. When powerful people are interested in the removal of anyone not favoured with powerful protection the matter is easily arranged. There are hundreds of knives in Paris whose use can be purchased for a few crowns, of if seclusion be deemed better than removal, a king's favourite can always obtain a lettre-de-cachet, and a man may linger a lifetime in prison without a soul outside the walls knowing of his existence there.|$|E
6000|$|To {{all this}} the new young Earl of Douglas, {{a boy of}} eighteen, tacitly assented. He was the most {{powerful}} and wealthiest subject in Scotland; in France he was Duc de Touraine; he was descended in <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock</b> from Robert II.; [...] "he micht ha'e been the king," [...] as the ballad says of the bonny Earl of Moray. But he held proudly aloof from both Livingstone and Crichton, who were stealing the king alternately: they then combined, invited Douglas to Edinburgh Castle, with his brother David, and served up the ominous bull's head at that [...] "black dinner" [...] recorded in a ballad fragment. {61} They decapitated the two Douglas boys; the earldom fell to their granduncle, James the Fat, and presently, on his death (1443), to young William Douglas, after which [...] "bands," [...] or illegal covenants, between the various leaders of factions, led to private wars of shifting fortune. Kennedy, Bishop of St Andrews, opposed the Douglas party, now strong both in lands newly acquired, till (July 3, 1449) James married Mary of Gueldres, imprisoned the Livingstones, and relied on the Bishop of St Andrews and the clergy. While Douglas was visiting Rome in 1450, the Livingstones had been forfeited, and Crichton became Chancellor.|$|E
6000|$|A {{delegation}} {{was appointed}} to wait upon Richard and present the petition to him. Buckingham was {{at the head of}} this delegation. The petition was written out in due form upon a roll of parchment. It declared that, inasmuch as it was clearly established that King Edward the Fourth was already the husband of [...] "Dame Alionora Boteler," [...] by a previous marriage, {{at the time of his}} pretended marriage with Elizabeth Woodville, and that consequently his children by Elizabeth Woodville, not being born in <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock,</b> could have no rights of inheritance whatever from their father, and especially could by no means derive from him any title to the crown; and inasmuch as the children of Clarence had been cut off from the succession by the bill of attainder which had been passed against their father; and inasmuch as Richard came next in order to these in the line of succession, therefore he was now the true and rightful heir. This his right moreover by birth was now confirmed by the decision of the estates of the realm assembled for the purpose; wherefore the petition, in conclusion, invited and urged him at once to assume the crown which was thus his by a double title--the right of birth and the election of the three estates of the realm.|$|E
6000|$|The schismatics caused {{abundant}} trouble Captain Cornelius Clas [...] "went about sowing heretical tares {{amidst the}} true corn of the Gospel;" [...] amongst other damnable doctrines and subtleties, this nautical and volunteer theologian persuaded the blacks, whom he {{knew to be}} desirous of greater liberty in such matters, that baptism is the only sacrament necessary to salvation, because it takes away original sin, as {{the blood of the}} Saviour actual sin. He furthermore (impudently) disowned the real presence in the consecrated Host; he invoked Saint Anthony, although his tribe generally denies that praying to saints can be of any use to man; and he declared that priests should preach certain doctrines (which, by the way, were perniciously heretical). Thus in a single hour he so prevailed upon those miserable negroes that their hearts became quite as black as their faces. An especially offensive practice of the Hollanders, {{in the eyes of the}} good shepherds, was that of asking the feminine sheep for a whiff of tobacco--it being a country custom to consider the taking a pipe from a woman's mouth a [...] "probable earnest of future favours." [...] When an English ship entered the river, the priests forbade by manifesto the sale of slaves to the captain, he being a Briton, ergò a heretic, despite the Duke of York. The Count of Sonho disobeyed, and was excommunicated accordingly: he took his punishment with much patience, although upon occasions of reproof he would fly into passions and disdains; he was reconciled only after obliging 400 couples that lived in concubinage to <b>lawful</b> <b>wedlock,</b> and thus a number of [...] "strayed souls was reduced to matrimony." ...|$|E
