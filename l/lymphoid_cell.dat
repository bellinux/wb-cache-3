40|$|In the {{previous}} papers, <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> resembling mammalian lymphocytes {{are found in}} the peripheral blood and the promitive spleen of the hagfish (Tomonaga 1973). It is now a very important problem in comparative immunology whether true lymphocytes exist in the hagfish, which is the thymusless promitive vertebrate. As a step in the solution of it the distribution of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> in the epithelial layers of the hagfish were examined in this study using light and electron microscopes, for {{it is well known that}} lymphocytes enter into the epithelial layers as one of the characteristics of them. Animals used in this study were Japanese hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, which were the same as used in {{the previous}} study. To examine the occurrence of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> in the epithlial layers, serial sections of the whole body of a small hagfish and sections of various organs from many hagfish varing in body length were made. As a result, numerous lymphroid cells were found within the epithelial layer of the intestine. Predominant distribution of the <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> were a basal region below the level of the epithelial cell nuclei. Electron microscopic figures of these <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> (Fig. 3) are characterized by showing pale cytoplasm compared with that of thecirculatory blood. This finding coincide with the observation of Andrew (1965) in mammals. <b>Lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> are also seen at the level of the epithelial cell nuclei and in the apical region of the epithelial layer in a relatively low frequency. In the basal region mitotic figures of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> are observed (Fig. 1). On the contrary, <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> in the apical region show degenerating figures (Fig. 2). Degenerated <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> are also observed in the lumen of the intestine (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that some of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> within the intestinal epithelial layer of the hagfish proliferate in the basal region and migrate to the apical region, where many of them degenerate, and further to the lumen of the intestine. It is not clear that some <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> within the epithelial layer reenter the lamina propria as Meader and Landers (1967) and Fichtelius (1969) claimed. <b>Lymphoid</b> <b>cells</b> in the epithelial layer in the hagfish were also observed in other organs than the intestine, especially in the gill (Fig. 4). It should be noticed that numerous neutrophil granulosytes are also seen within the epithelial layers of the hagfish.

In some rare hematological cancers, the fusion of the FGFR1 gene with certain other genes due to Chromosomal translocations or Interstitial deletions create fusion genes that encode chimeric FGFR1 Fusion proteins that have continuously active FGFR1-derived tyrosine kinase activity and thereby continuously stimulate cell growth and proliferation. These mutations occur {{in the early stages}} of myeloid and/or <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cell</b> lines and are the cause of or contribute to the development and progression of certain types of leukemia, Myelodysplastic syndromes, and lymphomas which are commonly associated with greatly increased numbers of circulating blood eosinophils (i.e. hypereosinophilia) and/or increased numbers of bone marrow eosinophils. These neoplasmas are sometimes termed, along with certain other Myelodysplastic syndromes associated with eosinophilia as myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia, clonal eosinophilia, or primary eosinophilia.
