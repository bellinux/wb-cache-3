5|$|After the shootout in Tombstone, {{his pursuit}} {{and murder of}} those who {{attacked}} his brothers, and after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was often the target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers' reputation. His role in history has stimulated considerable ongoing scholarly and editorial debate. A <b>large</b> <b>body</b> of literature {{has been written about}} Wyatt Earp and his legacy, some of it highly fictionalized. Considerable portions of it are either full of admiration and flattery or hostile debunking.|$|E
40|$|The <b>large</b> <b>bodies</b> {{of various}} Mycoplasma and L-form organisms were studied by {{ultraviolet}} fluorescence microscopy of preparations stained with various fluorochromes. Primuline and Thioflavine S specifically stained the outer portion or {{rim of the}} <b>large</b> <b>bodies,</b> and the fluorescence characteristics of the stained bodies differed from those for other microorganisms and for spheroplasts and protoplasts. Small granular structures similar in size and morphology to minimal reproductive units were observed within some of the <b>large</b> <b>bodies</b> by phase microscopy and by fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange or Coriphosphine O. Micromanipulation probing of the <b>large</b> <b>bodies</b> revealed their elastic nature; many of the <b>large</b> <b>bodies</b> could be subdivided into two or more smaller circular bodies, each retaining the fluorescence staining properties of the parent body. Under these conditions, however, {{a few of the}} <b>large</b> <b>bodies</b> were ruptured, leaving the stainable outer boundary area as a stable residual structure. The <b>large</b> <b>bodies</b> were somewhat resistant to various rigorous treatments normally employed to eliminate viability of Mycoplasma and L-form cultures. Structures similr to <b>large</b> <b>bodies</b> were observed in various natural tissues, and structures resembling <b>large</b> <b>bodies</b> in size, morphology, fluorescence staining characteristics, and reaction to micromanipulation probing were reconstructed from an acetone extract of egg yolk. Overall, the <b>large</b> <b>bodies</b> of Mycoplasma and L-form organisms appeared to be structures resulting from accumulations of metabolic by-products and medium components within or on which minimal reproductive units had become entrapped, although it could not be ruled out that they might be defined structures specifically formed during culture as protective lipoidal sacs for the minimal reproductive units...|$|R

2500|$|In {{celestial}} mechanics, the Lagrangian points ( [...] ; also Lagrange points, L-points, or libration points) are {{positions in}} an orbital configuration of two <b>large</b> <b>bodies</b> {{where a small}} object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to the two <b>large</b> <b>bodies.</b> The Lagrange points mark positions where the combined gravitational pull of the two large masses provides precisely the centripetal force required to orbit with them. There are five such points, labeled L1 to L5, all in the orbital plane of the two <b>large</b> <b>bodies.</b> The first three {{are on the line}} connecting the two large bodies; the last two, L4 and L5, each form an equilateral triangle with the two <b>large</b> <b>bodies.</b> The two latter points are stable, which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to the two <b>large</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
5|$|D'Avalos, having {{waited for}} the arrival a <b>large</b> <b>body</b> of landsknechts {{dispatched}} by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, set off from Asti towards Carignano. His total force included 12,500–18,000 infantry, of which perhaps 4,000 were arquebusiers or musketeers; he was only able to gather about 800–1,000 cavalry, of which less than 200 were gendarmes. D'Avalos recognized the relative weakness of his cavalry, but considered it to be compensated by the experience of his infantry and {{the large number of}} arquebusiers in its ranks.|$|E

5|$|Initially, sauropods {{were thought}} to be mainly aquatic, inhabiting lush peat swamps and being captive to the {{buoyancy}} of water to support their giant body weights. In 1984, Cooper pointed out that Vulcanodon, the most primitive sauropod known at that time, lived in a desert like environment and therefore must have been terrestrial. This indicated that the <b>large</b> <b>body</b> size of sauropods, as already seen in Vulcanodon, had not evolved as an adaptation to an aquatic life style.|$|E
50|$|The loop is not closed {{but will}} drift forward or {{backward}} slightly each time, {{so that the}} point it circles will appear to move smoothly along the <b>larger</b> <b>body's</b> orbit {{over a long period}} of time. When the object approaches the <b>larger</b> <b>body</b> closely at either end of its trajectory, its apparent direction changes. Over an entire cycle the center traces the outline of a horseshoe, with the <b>larger</b> <b>body</b> between the 'horns'.|$|R
5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, runaway {{accretion}} begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate is proportional to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It {{is obvious that the}} specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of <b>larger</b> <b>bodies</b> at the expense of smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the <b>largest</b> <b>bodies</b> exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by <b>large</b> <b>bodies</b> on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of <b>larger</b> <b>bodies</b> stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|R
25|$|In astronomy, Lagrangian {{points are}} five {{positions}} in the orbital plane of two <b>large</b> orbiting <b>bodies</b> where a small object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to the two <b>large</b> <b>bodies.</b> The first three Lagrangian points (L1, L2, L3) lie along the line connecting the two <b>large</b> <b>bodies,</b> while the last two points (L4 and L5) each form an equilateral triangle with the two <b>large</b> <b>bodies.</b> The L4 and L5 points, although they correspond to maxima of the effective potential in the coordinate frame that rotates with the two <b>large</b> <b>bodies,</b> are stable due to the Coriolis effect. The stability can result in orbits around just L4 or L5, known as Tadpole orbits, where trojans can be found. It can also result in orbits that encircle L3, L4, and L5, known as horseshoe orbits.|$|R
5|$|Scientists have debated {{as to how}} sauropods {{were able}} to breathe with their <b>large</b> <b>body</b> sizes and long necks, which would have {{increased}} the amount of dead space. They likely had an avian respiratory system, which is more efficient than a mammalian and reptilian system. Reconstructions of the neck and thorax of Diplodocus show great pneumaticity, which could {{have played a role}} in respiration as it does in birds.|$|E

50|$|After small planetesimals—about 1 km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, runaway {{accretion}} begins.

50|$|Bergmann’s rule {{states that}} {{endothermic}} animal subspecies living in colder climates have <b>larger</b> <b>bodies</b> {{than that of}} the subspecies living in warmer climates. Individuals with <b>larger</b> <b>bodies</b> are better suited for colder climates because <b>larger</b> <b>bodies</b> produce more heat due to having more cells, and have a smaller surface area compared to smaller individuals, which reduces heat loss. A study by Frederick Foster and Mark Collard found that Bergmann’s rule can be applied to humans when the latitude and temperature between groups differ widely.|$|R
5|$|The head {{is small}} {{relative}} to the <b>large</b> <b>body,</b> and quite distinctive in shape, being flat and blunt at the front, like the snout of a pig. Some teeth are chisel-shaped, small and leaf-like, indicating a probable herbivorous diet, although peg-like teeth and a keratinous snout have been considered possible adaptations in some species for feeding on colonial insects. A study of the braincase of Stagonolepis robertsoni has shown that there are similarities between it and those of crocodylomorphs, which may indicate a close relationship.|$|E

In the Abdhidharmic analysis of mind, the ordinary thought is defined as prapañca ('conceptual proliferation'). According to this theory, perceptual experience is bound up in multiple conceptualizations (expectations, judgments and desires). This proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of concepts like self and other upon an ever changing stream of aggregate phenomena.|$|E

Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that a <b>large</b> <b>body</b> of Japanese troops {{was in the process}} of relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|A {{special case}} of natural {{selection}} is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, <b>large</b> <b>body</b> size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E
