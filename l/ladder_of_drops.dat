This paper reviews the use <b>of</b> the <b>ladder</b> <b>of</b> investment by regulators on a global basis and the logical end point for the upper rung. By reviewing the current regulation of loops and bitstream and by considering the deployment and operation of next generation networks and their associated access networks, we argue that the <b>ladder</b> <b>of</b> investment model may need to be confined to the legacy circuit switched world with broadband over copper and that efforts should be concentrated on interconnection of next generation access networks...|$|R
