A schematized ship is modeled {{into the lock}} chamber as a two degree of freedom rigid body to evaluate the hawser forces acting on it. Several definitions of hawser forces are tested and compared to each other. A comparison between simulations with and without ship is carried out to investigate of the forces appearing. A comparison with experimental measurement is also performed...|$|E
40|$|The Netherlands are {{protected}} against extreme high waters {{from the sea}} by an ingenious system of barriers. One {{of the most famous}} ones is the Maeslant barrier in the New Waterway near the port of Rotterdam. This barrier however, is subject to discussion, as it might not function as intended, because of the following reasons. It has a very low reliability regarding closing. Furthermore, because of the sea level rise, it is expected that the barrier should close much more frequently, causing more nuisance for navigation. Therefore a different solution is put forward by Spaargaren c. s. Namely to close off the New Waterway permanently by means of a barrier, consisting out of a pumping station, dewatering sluice and a lock complex. The latter one is further elaborated on by making a feasibility study for it. First of all, the best location is chosen for the barrier, which in this report is the location near Rozenburg, just east of the Maeslant barrier. Because of the high demands regarding both navigation and flood safety in combination with the uncertainty in these demands for the future, {{there is a need for}} a sophisticated design for the lock complex. This is done by first considering the boundary conditions for different (initial and adaptive) scenarios for both sets of requirements (navigation and flood safety). For navigation a larger vessel is taken into account in the adaptive boundary conditions. For flood safety, the adaptive boundary conditions results in a higher water level of about 1 meter to be retained, mostly due to a larger sea level rise. It turns out that the boundary conditions regarding navigation have a way larger impact in the design choices of the lock complex than the boundary conditions regarding flood safety. The above boundary conditions are used to create an overall solution for the barrier. 4 locks are needed (in case of an initial design) : one large lock for large seagoing vessels, one mid-sized lock for smaller seagoing vessels and two for inland going vessels. When looking at the adaptive requirements, another mid-sized lock should be added. For the large lock, different principal solutions are developed that also take the adaptive boundary conditions into account. First of all, an adaptive design of a lock head is considered by making the head modular. This makes it possible to place a larger gate in the head later on. It turns out that this is probably not cost-efficient. The second proposed solution is to use a retaining wall in combination with a relieving floor for the chamber walls of the large lock for seagoing vessels. The relieving floor will decrease the horizontal soil loads on the soil retaining wall beneath it, which is structurally beneficial. This relieving floor will be combined with a longitudinal filling system. A <b>longitudinal</b> <b>culvert</b> over the length of the lock is placed on top of the relieving floor. Filling and emptying will be done using openings in the floor of the superstructure. The load on vessels during levelling of the lock are determined for this system, which is the main requirement that determines the filling time. It turns out that this option results in much faster levelling times compared to other levelling systems. Levelling could be done a factor 3 faster than filling through the head. It is concluded that the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>culvert</b> in combination with the relieving floor can compete with conventional filling systems. Furthermore, it fits in an adaptive design approach, because even with a wider lock, faster levelling times are possible. However, there are still some considerations to be made regarding this solution. A thorough cost-benefit analysis should be made. Besides of this, the hydraulic computations should be validated by means of a scale model or computational fluid dynamics.

40|$|The {{waterway}} axis Rhine/Meuse-Main-Danube crosses Europe transversally {{from the}} North Sea at Rotterdam to the Black Sea in Romania. This corridor {{is one of}} the longest ones in the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) and crosses both EU countries and non-Member States. In order to increase the transport capacity along this axis, many projects are supported by the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency as part of the priority project 18. The increase of the lock capacity of the Meuse River in Belgium to reach class ECMT VIb, allowing the traffic of boats carrying up to 9, 000 tonnes, {{is one of the}}se projects. The new lock at Ampsin-Neuville will have a 225 m x 25 m chamber, with a 4. 70 m head. This lock will be built between an existing 136 m x 16 m lock and the weir. As the existing lock is equipped with lateral translation gates, these gates recesses constrain significantly the location of the new lock. Therefore, a through-the-head filling system has been preferred to the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>culvert</b> system selected for similar locks on the River Meuse. This paper focuses on the design of the upstream head of this new lock, equipped with short culverts and a dissipation chamber. In order to guide the design of this filling system, a scale model of the lock head has been set-up at the Hydraulics Research Laboratory of Walloon waterways administration. The specific aim of this model was to investigate different configurations of the conduit network and of the dissipation chamber in order to limit the hawser forces encountered by vessels in the lock chamber, through a reduction of waves and free-surface slopes in the lock itself, and a sufficient uniformity in flow distribution at the dissipation chamber outlet. A composite modelling approach has been used in conjunction with this physical model to optimise the design. The key parameter {{in the design of the}} dissipation chamber was the placement of energy and momentum dissipation devices. In order to guide this design, and to limit the number of tests in the scale model, 2 D numerical simulations of the flow inside the chamber were run in a variety of configurations such as e. g. longitudinal walls, square columns in aligned or staggered layout, round columns in aligned and staggered layouts. The best options were tested in the scale model. Head-losses and velocity distribution at the exit of the dissipation chamber were measured, for different combinations of upstream water level and discharge through the culverts, representative of different stages of the filling process. The measurements were finally compared with the predictions by the numerical models...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Three culverts, {{judged to}} be fish barriers, were {{replaced}} with "stream simulation" culverts on the Fremont National Forest of south central Oregon. The culvert sites {{are located in the}} Fort Rock Basin in streams that are home to resident Great Basin redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Great Basin redband trout is the common name for the native trout in the Great Basin and is informally recognized as O. m. newberrii. The design process is discussed and documented for the three culvert replacements. The fish passage conditions in the new culverts were compared to the old culverts both quantitatively and qualitatively. One assumption with stream simulation culverts is that fish will be able to move through a culvert if the flow conditions are {{similar to that of the}} natural channel. Velocity measurements and channel characteristics were compared between the natural stream and the culvert. The comparisons were used to define whether similarity was achieved between the culvert and the natural stream. Velocity and channel characteristic measurements were taken during one discharge condition of spring snowmelt, the migration period for spawning redband trout. The comparisons were further examined to determine which would be appropriate metrics in the determination of success or failure of the installation. Channel stability was quantified at each culvert through three systems of channel stability measurements. Regional design guidelines were found to lack information regarding the invert elevation placement for designing a stream simulation culvert. Invert placement is likely to be critical in terms of permanence of placed streambed material in a culvert. There was a qualitative and quantitative improvement of flow conditions at the replacement culverts over the old culverts. All new culverts satisfied the regulatory criteria for fish passage. Two of the three culverts appeared to be similar to the natural stream when comparing similar habitat unit types. The comparisons at the third culvert site were statistically different from the natural stream. The differences may be attributed to the narrow low flow channel that existed through the <b>culvert.</b> <b>Longitudinal</b> thalweg velocity, cross-sectional velocity, and thalweg velocity distribution comparisons between the culvert and the natural stream appear to be appropriate metrics in the determination of success or failure of stream simulation culverts. Streambed material in the culverts exhibited limited evidence of movement after a minimal spring snowrnelt discharge. Stability of streambed material in the culverts at higher discharges was not tested...|$|R
