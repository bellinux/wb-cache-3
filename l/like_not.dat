25|$|To {{make the}} {{comparison}} more obvious, the opera {{is set in}} a pseudo-Wild West America, with Mahagonny itself placed somewhere far from the rest of civilization. America was the land of unbridled capitalism, the frontier just as much so. The only difference is that bourgeois civility and civilization has yet to occupy the frontier, and thus there is no hiding the nature of capitalism beneath the facade of gentlemanly conduct. In Mahagonny, the characters are prostitutes, lumberjacks, criminals, and the <b>like.</b> <b>Not</b> one of them comes from the moneyed class, and yet the same system of exploitation was set up, but in a more naked manner. Instead of seducing a woman's love with power and influence, the residents of Mahagonny pay for a prostitute. But in Mahagonny, poverty is not just a condition the poor bring upon themselves, but a crime to be punished. Thus, Brecht and Weill tried to display capitalism as the meatgrinder they believed it to be.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the big}} {{activities}} is trips to base camp (aka trekking), which can be higher {{than some of the}} highest mountains. The other big activity is serious attempts {{to make it to the}} top of Everest, and those in support of those attempts. The peak time for this is late May, because that is when the monsoons push the jet stream away, there is another time later in the year when the monsoon ends yielding another break in the weather, but there is more snow then. Some technology for climbing include crampons, fixed ropes, various cold-weather gear, bottled oxygen, and weather prediction. Predicting the weather is critical, one of the big disasters came in 1996 when a storm hit during a summit bid. In modern times, there is greater on-demand logistical support available such as internet access, but also some new challenges <b>like</b> <b>not</b> offending the locals and watching out for oxygen-bottle thefts. Helicopter support has grown and the availability of helicopter rescues increased, but there are limits on how high and in what weather they are able to fly. Modern dangers remain unexpected avalanches (this claimed many in 2014 and 2015), sudden onset of altitude sickness, and that classic climbing danger- falling. For a price, permits are available from China in the Tibet region and from Nepal and there is a multitude of mountaineering firms world over operating on the mountain.|$|E

500|$|After {{being called}} to the Bar on 20 April 1578 Coke {{immediately}} began practising as a barrister. His first case was in the Court of King's Bench in 1581, and was known as Lord Cromwell's Case after the claimant, Lord Henry Cromwell, a landlord in Coke's home county of Norfolk. The case was a charge of slander against a Mr Denny, the Vicar of Northlinham and Coke's client. In a dispute with Denny, Cromwell had hired two unlicensed preachers to harass him, denounce the Book of Common Prayer and preach the gospel in his area. Denny retorted by telling Cromwell [...] "you <b>like</b> <b>not</b> of me, since you like those that maintain sedition". Cromwell argued that Denny was guilty of scandalum magnatum, slander against a peer of the realm, because his statement implied that Cromwell himself was seditious or had seditious tendencies.|$|E

The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman.

500|$|Dwarves {{need to be}} {{provided}} with food and drink (mostly {{in the form of}} alcohol). A dwarf will get negative thoughts for drinking plain water and even for drinking the same type of alcohol, making it necessary to grow different crops for producing different drinks. Things <b>like</b> <b>not</b> having a separate bedroom can upset a dwarf. They may make friends and sometimes marry; females give birth. Dwarves can get upset by sustaining injuries, having poor clothing, losing their pets, friends or relatives; interacting with or seeing their corpses can aggravate this. A frustrated dwarf may break furniture or attack others. Continuous stress will cause them to throw tantrums and eventually go insane, whether going [...] and attacking their comrades in a homicidal rage, becoming suicidally depressed and jumping off a cliff, or simply going [...] "stark raving mad" [...] and stumbling around randomly until their untimely death. Their quality of life can be improved by giving them luxurious personal bedrooms and a well-decorated dining room, medical care, and providing them with a variety of drinks and well-cooked meals. A chain reaction where a single dwarf's unhappiness causes the entire fortress's population to start throwing tantrums can begin when one dwarf throws a tantrum, attacks and kills another one with many friends, which drastically affects the happiness of many more.|$|E
500|$|Chilton took up {{electric}} guitar at thirteen, playing along with Beatles songs, later saying, [...] "I really loved the mid-sixties British pop music [...] all {{two and a}} half minutes or three minutes long, really appealing songs. So I've always aspired to that same format, that's what I <b>like.</b> <b>Not</b> to mention the rhythm and blues and the Stax stuff, too". Chilton abandoned his guitar-playing when with The Box Tops, then took up the instrument again; he met Roger McGuinn, guitarist for the Byrds, and developed particular interest in {{electric guitar}} and acoustic folk. Stephens enjoyed the music of Otis Redding, the Isley Brothers, the Who, the Kinks, and especially the Beatles. Hummel likewise was a member of more than one band during his early musical years, again influenced by the Beatles and other British Invasion acts. The bassist also played acoustic guitar for personal enjoyment, following the styles of Simon & Garfunkel and Joni Mitchell and using finger-picking techniques to play folk and bluegrass. Most songs on the first three albums are credited to either Bell/Chilton or Chilton, but some credit Hummel, Stephens and others, as either writer or co-writer. At the only seven live performances in the original era, the last of which took place before the second album's release, all four members contributed vocally.|$|E

Christel Loar from PopMatters found the album similar to Light Years and Fever and commended the production, opining that while [...] "dance pop with this much gloss and unabashed glee is relegated to the realms of guilty pleasure", Aphrodite is [...] "that rare representation of perfect production that is just pleasure, pure and simple". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone labelled the album Minogue's [...] "finest work since 1997's underrated Impossible Princess". Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph complimented Price for enlisting a [...] "top notch" [...] team of collaborators and termed Aphrodite a [...] "mainstream pop blast". Barry Walters from Spin commended Minogue for returning to her original style of music, saying [...] "Finally even the suits realize that no one wants ersatz hip-hop or Americanized AOR from Australia's ultimate pop tart".|$|E
