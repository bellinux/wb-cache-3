5000|$|A pipelay barge, or <b>lay</b> <b>barge,</b> {{is used to}} lay {{submarine}} pipelines by welding pipe sections to {{the pipeline}} on board, inspecting and coating the joint, and lowering the assembled part to the seabed over a projecting supporting structure called a stinger which guides the pipe and controls the curve {{at the end of}} the barge (overbend) in a more or less continuous process. As the pipe approaches the seabed, the pipe takes a convex-downward curve (the sagbend) before making contact with the bottom. the sagbend is controlled by tension applied from the vessel and tension wires from the pipeline on the bottom to anchors which prevent it from being dragged out of position by the barge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{offshore}} pipeline installation operations in Brazil {{have been performed}} in an S-Lay procedure employing the BGL- 1 barge, owned by Petrobras. In this method, the welded pipeline is supported on the rollers of the vessel and the stinger, forming the over-bend. Then it is suspended in the water {{all the way to}} seabed, forming the sag-bend. The over-band and sag-bend form the shape of an “S”. In this work, the focus concerns in the analysis of the interaction between pipeline and <b>lay</b> <b>barge</b> on the over-bend region. This analysis includes not only the contact between the pipeline and the launching structure but also the tensioner behavior. Two numerical models are proposed: (a) a rigorous contact model that provides important information related to the consequences of impact between pipeline and rollers. These consequences can be dents to the pipe or tearing of the coatings; and (b) a model for the simulation of the tensioner behavior. This model includes a delay between the instant that the tensioner is activated until it effectively starts working. It also considers how fast the tensioner can recover the desired tension level in the pipeline. Simulations of actual operations are shown, in order to illustrate the application of the proposed model...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe {{pipeline}} {{industry has}} developed its technical capabilities to enable operations in deeper water. In ultra deepwater developments, the offshore {{industry has been}} challenged to solve demanding tasks, to develop new and reliable installation technologies for deepwater and uneven seafloor conditions, and to discover technology to deal with harsh environmental conditions. Pipeline installation in deeper water area needs special considerations regarding the lay vessel capabilities. These capabilities are that the vessel should have enough tension capacity for the deeper water and good dynamic positioning system restricted to small movements only. Two common methods used to install pipeline are the S-Lay and J-Lay methods. Some parameters {{need to be considered}} when choosing the appropriate installation method, therefore limitations for each methods are investigated. For the S-Lay method, these important parameters Include vessel tension capacity, stinger length, stinger curvature, strain in the overbend region and bending moment in the sagbend region. The maximum depth at which a given pipeline can be laid could be increased with a longer stinger of the <b>lay</b> <b>barge</b> and bigger vessel tension capacity. However, choosing these options may require clamping to pull the pipeline that can cause a heavy mooring system and high risk associated with a very long stinger subject to hydrodynamic forces. In addition, these options also could destroy the pipe coating. On the contrary with the S-Lay method, the J-Lay method reduces any horizontal reaction on the vessel’s equipment, and because of this, the J-Lay technology might be used to meet project requirements in deeper water. However, the capability of the J-Lay method in deep and very deep waters requires barges with dynamic positioning capabilities. This is because positioning by spread mooring with anchors would always be worthless and often unfeasible due to the safety of operations. Under extreme conditions, the loading process induced by the <b>lay</b> <b>barge</b> response to wave actions in deep waters is less severe for J-lay method compared to other methods. However, special attention has to be paid to the complex nature of vortex shedding induced oscillations along the suspended pipeline span. Considering the aspects mentioned above, studies will be carried out in this master thesis. The thesis will expose two pipeline installation methods, i. e. S-Lay and J-Lay methods for various water depths and pipe sizes. Starting from 800 m to 4000 m water depth, pipe sizes more than 24 inch will be investigated. The effect of increasing strain in the overbend region and effect of reducing the stinger length will be studied to meet these challenges and to improve the laying efficiency especially using the S-lay method.

50|$|Diving work on <b>lay</b> <b>barges</b> {{includes}} shallow {{inspection and}} maintenance work on the stinger, and deeper work at the bottom associated with the pipe and pipeline connections. Shallow work is usually on air, and may include stinger inspection, Checks that the pipeline runs smoothly and is not damaged before leaving the stinger, placing and checking CCTV cameras for monitoring the pipe transit, operating manual valves on the stinger buoyancy system {{and work on the}} mooring system. Deep work will use breathing gas appropriate to the depth, and may include checking the as-laid condition of the pipe and coating, grout bagging long spans for support, connection of flanges, bolt tensioning and hyperbaric welding, Attachment, operation and removal of pigging equipment, and attachment, removal and moving of constant tension wires.|$|R
40|$|Actual {{offshore}} developments (steel {{platforms and}} subsea completions {{in up to}} 1025 ft. of water), the world energy situation, and continued increase in proven and probable oil and gas reserves in deep water suggest a boom in construction of submarine pipelines in over 600 ft. water depth. Human accomplishments frequently have been developed out of practice and years of experience, leaving for a later stage the theoretical aspects, which then are used as a help to get better understanding and improvement of these achievements. Installation and operation of submarine pipelines may be an example. Until now, any disaccord or lack of correlation {{between theory and practice}} might not show practical or relevant implications. However, as indicated by theoretical studies and some laboratory results, future installation of submarine pipelines in deeper waters than the present construction boundaries will require a close conformity between theory and practice. Some areas of concern may be the following: - 3 -dimensional analysis of suspended pipelines from <b>lay</b> <b>barges</b> - collapse and buckling phenomena - non-linearity behaviour of pipelines - short and long term design data related to environmental conditions - sea bottom configuration and soils - second-end connection problems - correct interpretation of Archimedes' Principl...|$|R

40|$|Floating {{structures}} use {{mooring system}} for station keeping in any water depths. Mooring {{system is a}} vital component {{for the safety of}} floating structures. Mooring accidents can cause serious injury or damage to the vessel, and hence it is necessary to establish a systematic risk-based decision making for safety assessment of mobile mooring system. This study uses the mobile mooring system of a semi submersible pipe <b>laying</b> <b>barge</b> as a case study. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a Methodology for Investigation of Critical Hazards (MIVTA), which is carried out by the development of preliminary risk analysis using HAZOP (Hazard and Operability), to generate the root causes using FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) and to construct the sequence of the consequences using ETA (Event Tree Analysis). HAZOP is a systematic examination of a system helpful to identify and evaluate the risks related to accidents/incidents in mooring system. FTA is a deductive method useful to generate the potential causes of mooring system failure into undesired events. ETA is an inductive method helpful to define all possible outcomes of accidental events. This study conducts risk-based decision making coupled with the knowledge of the experts of mooring system to identify the root causes, to evaluate the frequency of failure and to classify their class of consequences. This study provides a systematic methodology guideline for the risk-based decisio...|$|R

60|$|The {{assembly}} {{seemed so}} noisy and furious that the nobles in attendance on the king {{were afraid to}} allow him to land.

So the <b>barge</b> <b>lay</b> floating on the river, the oarsmen taking a few strokes {{from time to time to}} recover the ground lost by the drift of the current.

Just one or two minute black featureless figures of men toiled amidst these monster shapes. They {{did not seem to}} be controlling them but only moving about among them.

60|$|Don Sebastian agreed, {{and they}} went back to the hotel, and stayed there until word was sent that the last boat was ready to leave the mole.

It was obvious that she would not sail immediately, and if Kenwardine saw them come on board, he would have no trouble in leaving the vessel.

60|$|In {{good time}} next morning, however, we came again {{in sight of}} the detestable morass called Cairo; and {{stopping}} there to take in wood, <b>lay</b> alongside a <b>barge,</b> whose starting timbers scarcely held together.

But looking southward from this point, we had the satisfaction of seeing that intolerable river dragging its slimy length and ugly freight abruptly off towards New Orleans; and passing a yellow line which stretched across the current, were again upon the clear Ohio, never, I trust, to see the Mississippi more, saving in troubled dreams and nightmares. Leaving it for the company of its sparkling neighbour, was like the transition from pain to ease, or the awakening from a horrible vision to cheerful realities.|$|R
50|$|Already by 1160, {{the first}} loads of Bentheim {{sandstone}} were being shipped into the Netherlands. Up to 1,200 freight cranes, scows and <b>barges</b> <b>lay</b> each year at anchor and brought their goods to Holland. The Steinmaate (street) became a staple market. The like-named street still recalls today that Bentheim sandstone was shipped {{from here to}} many other countries. From it were built stately buildings such as the Royal Palace in Amsterdam, but also many mills, churches, locks, town halls and other public buildings. The returning ships brought spices, textiles, paper and foods as well as luxury articles such as coffee, tea, cacao and tobacco. Trade, crafts and agriculture were the region's economic foundations until the mid 19th century. Shipping on the Vechte and the canals (the Ems-Vechte-Kanal, the Nordhorn-Almelo-Kanal, the Süd-Nord-Kanal and the Coevorden-Piccardie-Kanal) together with the transported goods formed {{an important source of}} earnings at this time, when the town was also home to wealthy merchants, shipowners and mariners.|$|R
60|$|Long {{lines of}} <b>barges</b> <b>lay</b> {{one after another}} along the canal, many of them looking mighty spruce and ship-shape in their jerkin of Archangel tar picked out with white and green.

Children played on the decks, as heedless of the rain {{as if they had}} been brought up on Loch Carron side; men fished over the gunwale, some of them under umbrellas; women did their washing; and every barge boasted its mongrel cur by way of watch-dog. Each one barked furiously at the canoes, running {{alongside}} until he had got to the end of his own ship, and so passing on the word to the dog aboard the next. We must have seen something like a hundred of these embarkations in the course of that day's paddle, ranged one after another like the houses in a street; and from not one of them were we disappointed of this accompaniment. It was like visiting a menagerie, the Cigarette remarked.|$|R
