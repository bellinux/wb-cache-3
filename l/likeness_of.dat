5|$|A thermæ and caravanserai of {{the same}} period were also found, and {{is similar to the}} thermæ at Ashkelon and others in the nearby country. A row of rooms from an earlier, 1st century BCE to 1st century CE {{fortress}} revealed artefacts pointing to a Nabatæan occupation predating Roman annexation. Coins bearing the <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> Nabatæan kings were found, along with storage jars and other vessels.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{tradition}} {{refers to}} only five likenesses of the Buddha, made during his lifetime; two were in India, two in paradise, {{and the fifth}} is the Mahamuni Buddha image in Myanmar. According to the legend, the Buddha visited the Dhanyawadi city of Arakan in 554 BC. King Sanda Thuriya requested that an image was cast of him. After casting the Great Image, the Buddha breathed upon it, and thereafter the image became the exact <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> the Mahamuni.|$|E
5|$|At his request, Henry {{was buried}} in Westminster Abbey {{in front of the}} church's high altar, in the former resting place of Edward the Confessor. A few years later, work began on a grander tomb for the King and in 1290 Edward moved his father's body to its current {{location}} in Westminster Abbey. His gilt-brass funeral effigy was designed and forged within the abbey grounds by William Torell; unlike other effigies of the period, it is particularly naturalistic in style, but it is probably not a close <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> Henry himself.|$|E

5|$|Harrison was memorialized {{on several}} postage stamps. The {{first was a}} 13-cent stamp issued on November 18, 1902, with the {{engraved}} <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> Harrison modeled after a photo provided by his widow. In all Harrison has been honored on six U.S. Postage stamps, more than most other U.S. Presidents. Harrison also was featured on the five-dollar National Bank Notes from the third charter period, beginning in 1902. In 2012, a dollar coin with his image, part of the Presidential $1 Coin Program, was issued.|$|E
5|$|Heraldry {{developed}} in medieval Europe {{from the late}} 11th century, originally as a system of personal badges of the warrior classes, which served, among other purposes, as identification on the battlefield. The same insignia were used on seals to identify documents. The earliest seals bore a <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> {{the owner of the}} seal, with the shield and heraldic insignia included. Over time, the seals were reduced to just the shield.|$|E
5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E

5|$|Kevin McNally {{was cast}} as the {{antagonist}} Robert Osbourne; McNally was chosen because the producers {{thought he would be}} perfect to play the part, {{as is the case with}} Debra Stephenson, who portrayed his wife. Child actor Daniel Chenery, who played the part of their son, Sammy, was chosen due to his <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> a younger version of McNally. Also, Simon Crawford Collins's wife made a cameo appearance as a BT operator.|$|E
5|$|Phidias, who {{had been}} in charge of all {{building}} projects, was first accused of embezzling gold meant for the statue of Athena and then of impiety, because, when he wrought the battle of the Amazons on the shield of Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man, and also inserted a very fine <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> Pericles fighting with an Amazon.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which had been dead for three months. Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English alabaster effigy, with a tomb-chest and a canopy made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> Edward.|$|E

5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's {{guidance}} of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E
5|$|Although {{commerce}} did {{not require}} them, pennies bearing the <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> Elizabeth II were minted in 1953 in sets sold to the public, using an obverse design by Mary Gillick. One 1954 penny was struck, for internal Mint purposes. By 1961, new pennies were needed again for circulation, and were produced in large numbers. The officials who planned decimalisation in the 1960s did not favour keeping the large bronze penny, whose value had been eroded by inflation. The last for circulation were dated 1967—a final proof set was dated 1970. The old penny quickly went out of use after Decimal Day, 15 February 1971, and was demonetised on 31 August of that year.|$|E
5|$|Divine was an {{inspiration}} for Ursula the Sea Witch, the villain in the 1989 Disney animated film The Little Mermaid. Due to Divine's portrayal of Edna Turnblad in the original comedy-film version of Hairspray, later musical adaptations of Hairspray have commonly placed male actors {{in the role of}} Edna, including Harvey Fierstein and others in the 2002 Broadway musical, and John Travolta in the 2007 musical film. A 12-foot (4 m) tall statue in the <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> Divine by Andrew Logan can be seen on permanent display at The American Visionary Art Museum in Divine's hometown of Baltimore.|$|E

5|$|Kuhn {{denied that}} it is ever {{possible}} to isolate the hypothesis being tested from {{the influence of the}} theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued {{that it is}} not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure scientific progress across paradigms.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} versions of the events were set down and distributed due to the excitement around the trial and the public demand for entertainments based on the murder, making it hard for modern readers to discern fact from melodramatic embellishment. Good official records exist from the trial, and the best record of the events surrounding the case is generally considered to be that of James Curtis, a journalist who spent time with Corder and two weeks in Polstead interviewing those concerned. He was apparently so connected with the case that a newspaper artist who was asked to produce a picture of the accused man drew a <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> Curtis instead of Corder.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{nonetheless}} rejoiced at {{the death}} of Domitian, and immediately following Nerva's accession as Emperor, passed damnatio memoriae on his memory: his coins and statues were melted, his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records. Domitian and, over a century later, Publius Septimius Geta were the only emperors known to have officially received a damnatio memoriae, though others may have received de facto ones. In many instances, existing portraits of Domitian, such as those found on the Cancelleria Reliefs, were simply recarved to fit the <b>likeness</b> <b>of</b> Nerva, which allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material. Yet {{the order of the}} Senate was only partially executed in Rome, and wholly disregarded in most of the provinces outside Italy.|$|E
