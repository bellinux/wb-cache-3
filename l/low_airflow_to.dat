40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. This paper presents a one dimensional thermal model for an evacuated tube under transient conditions. The first order differential equations derived are solved with a fully explicit scheme using a fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm. The comparison between simulated and experimentally measured outlet air temperature showed a good agreement as a {{root mean square error}} on the outlet air temperature of about 0. 52 °C and a mean bias difference of 0. 20 °C were observed on a bright sunny day. Finally, the validated model applied for steady state heat transfer is used to conduct an analysis on different parameters. The airflow rate is the most important parameter acting on the defined performance indicators. Higher is the airflow, better is the efficiency and lower is the outlet air temperature. On the other side, a <b>low</b> <b>airflow</b> can lead <b>to</b> as much as 100 °C of temperature gain, but the efficiency is then reduced to values as low as 45 %. dc 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} re-entrainment and re-dispersion of powder {{particles}} is studied both theoretically and experimentally {{in order to}} discuss the possibilities of improvement of the quality of aerosol emitted from dry powder inhalers (DPI). The eddy fluid particle model (EFPM) is employed to solve turbulent flow structure in the microscale in a channel with various types of turbulence promoters. The resuspension process caused by the gas shearing forces is modeled with the Verlet algorithm taking into account the inter-particle cohesive interactions. Nondimensional numbers are introduced to define the domains of powder aerosolization. Computational results indicate the importance of the geometry of turbulence promoters for powder re-entrainment (fluidization) and de-aggregation of particle clusters. The theoretical findings, are supported by experimental results obtained in a model resuspension chamber with a pharmaceutical powder (disodium cromoglycate). A noticeable increase of emission and re-dispersion was obtained at <b>low</b> <b>airflow</b> rates due <b>to</b> the use of turbulence promoters mounted {{in the vicinity of the}} powder layer. The corresponding increase of flow resistance is acceptable in respect to the practical application in DPIs...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} {{and performance of}} total laryngectomy, voice restoration has become an important issue. Voice prostheses are widely used for this purpose. Based on experience with previous and current prostheses, the important characteristics for any voice prosthesis can be defined. These characteristics are: indwelling fixation, <b>low</b> resistance <b>to</b> <b>airflow,</b> less bothersome and easier insertion into the tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula. Also, predictable long device life span (resistance to Candida deterioration) and easy removal of the prosthesis to allow inspection or cleaning and consequent re-insertion are desirable.

Inspired by this clavate hair system, a one-axis biomimetic accelerometer has been developed and fabricated using surface micromachining and SU- 8 lithography. An analytical model ispresented {{for the design of}} the accelerometer, and guidelines are derived to reduce responsivity due to flow-induced contributions to the accelerometer's output. Measurements show that this microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) hair-based accelerometer has a resonance frequency of 320 Hz, a detection threshold of 0. 10 m/s^ 2 and a dynamic range of more than 35 dB. The accelerometer exhibits a clear directional response to external accelerations and a <b>low</b> responsivity <b>to</b> <b>airflow.</b> Further, the accelerometer's physical limits with respect to noise levels are addressed and the possibility for short-term adaptation of the sensor to the environment is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{nasal cavity}} {{is a vital}} {{component}} of the respiratory system that heats and humidifies inhaled air in all vertebrates. Despite this common function, the shapes of nasal cavities vary widely across animals. To understand this variability, we here connect nasal geometry to its function by theoretically studying the airflow and the associated scalar exchange that describes heating and humidification. We find that optimal geometries, which have minimal resistance for a given exchange efficiency, have a constant gap width between their side walls, but their overall shape is restricted only by the geometry of the head. Our theory explains the geometric variations of natural nasal cavities quantitatively and we hypothesize that the trade-off between high exchange efficiency and <b>low</b> resistance <b>to</b> <b>airflow</b> is the main driving force shaping the nasal cavity. Our model further explains why humans, whose nasal cavities evolved to be smaller than expected for their size, become obligate oral breathers in aerobically challenging situations.

40|$|An {{improved}} cathode {{structure on}} a membrane/electrode assembly {{has been developed}} for a direct methanol fuel cell, in a continuing effort to realize practical power systems containing such fuel cells. This cathode structure is intended particularly to afford better cell performance at a <b>low</b> <b>airflow</b> rate. A membrane/electrode assembly of the type for which the improved cathode structure was developed (see Figure 1) is fabricated {{in a process that}} includes brush painting and spray coating of catalyst layers onto a polymer-electrolyte membrane and onto gas-diffusion backings that also act as current collectors. The aforementioned layers are then dried and hot-pressed together. When completed, the membrane/electrode assembly contains (1) an anode containing a fine metal black of Pt/Ru alloy, (2) a membrane made of Nafion 117 or equivalent (a perfluorosulfonic acid-based hydrophilic, proton-conducting ion-exchange polymer), (3) a cathode structure (in the present case, the improved cathode structure described below), and (4) the electrically conductive gas-diffusion backing layers, which are made of Toray 060 (TradeMark) (or equivalent) carbon paper containing between 5 and 6 weight percent of poly(tetrafluoroethylene). The need for an improved cathode structure arises for the following reasons: In the design and operation of a fuel-cell power system, the airflow rate is a critical parameter that determines the overall efficiency, cell voltage, and power density. It is desirable to operate at a <b>low</b> <b>airflow</b> rate in order to obtain thermal and water balance and to minimize the size and mass of the system. The performances of membrane/electrode assemblies of prior design are limited at <b>low</b> <b>airflow</b> rates. Methanol crossover increases the required airflow rate. Hence, one way to reduce the required <b>airflow</b> rate is <b>to</b> reduce the effect of methanol crossover. Improvement of the cathode structure - in particular, addition of hydrophobic particles to the cathode - has been demonstrated to mitigate the effects of crossover and decrease the airflow required...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether small add-on spacers alone or equipped with a passive deagglomerating component would improve aerosol performances of passive <b>low</b> <b>airflow</b> resistance dry powder inhalers (DPIs) at a low inhalation flow rate. Depositions of beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) and salbutamol sulphate (SS) via the Asmabec Clickhaler and Asmasal Clickhaler at 30 L/min airflow rate in an oropharyngeal model and attached filter were determined. Three add-on spacers, one with 5. 0 cm length, and the other with the same features but incorporating a fine mesh, and the third one with the length of 8. 5 cm (long add-on spacer) were used. Incorporating mesh did not improve the filter dose for SS, and significantly reduced this dose for BDP. The long add-on spacer was the most efficient spacer as it had minimal effects on the filter doses, also significantly reduced drug depositions in the model. In conclusion, an optimum length of an add-on spacer is required to minimise oropharyngeal drug deposition via a <b>low</b> <b>airflow</b> resistance DPI at a low inspiratory flow rate without considerable reduction of the respirable dose. Incorporating sieves within add-on spacers may diminish aerosol performances of the DPIs at <b>low</b> <b>airflow</b> rates. 1558...|$|R

After high the consistency refining stage, the pulp samples were refined in a low consistency process in a laboratory Escher-Wyss refiner. The results show that the highest levels of tensile energy absorption and strain at break were achieved with curled and kinked fibres refined in a pressurised refiner at 175 C at a relatively low refining energy input, before the low consistency refining stage. These results were obtained at <b>low</b> <b>airflow</b> resistance, which is advantageous for sack paper.

Aiming at this problem, utilization of blended feedstock is proposed. In this work blends of two different biomasses (wood and coconut shells) were co-gasified using externally heated downdraft gasifier. The effects of varying biomass blending ratio and airflow rate on gaseous components of syngas and its heating value were investigated. The results obtained from the experiments revealed that W 20 :CS 80 blend yielded higher values for H 2 (20 Vol. %) and HHV (18 MJ/Nm 3) {{as compared to the}} other blends. The higher airflow rate has a negative effect on syngas profile and heating value.

The maximum H 2 and CH 4 were obtained at 2. 5 LPM airflow rate. The process was noticed more stable at low air flow rates.

In this study we used occupant exposure to pollutants integrated over time (referred to as 'dose') as the metric to evaluate the effectiveness and air quality implications of demand controlled ventilation in residences. We looked at air quality for two situations. The first is that typically used in ventilation standards: the exposure over a long term. The second is to look at peak exposures that are associated with time variations in ventilation rates and pollutant generation. The pollutant generation had two components: a background rate associated with the building materials and furnishings and a second component related to occupants. The demand controlled ventilation system operated at a <b>low</b> <b>airflow</b> rate when the residence was unoccupied and at a high airflow rate when occupied. We used analytical solutions to the continuity equation to determine the ventilation effectiveness and the long-term chronic dose and peak acute exposure for a representative range of occupancy periods, pollutant generation rates and airflow rates.
