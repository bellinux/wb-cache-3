Thus the resources can be utilised to power a green DEG energy system for an eco-community comprising of the POM itself {{as well as}} a <b>local</b> <b>residential</b> <b>community</b> in Iskandar Malaysia. Solar energy systems are also integrated to the DEG system to supply additional energy to ensure the system is fully RE operated, to drive the realisation of a low carbon society in Iskandar Malaysia. Thus in this work, a model that incorporates load shifting feature is developed, with the aim to design an optimal biomass and biogas power generation system, solar energy system, and energy storage system, with consideration of the variation of electricity and thermal energy requirement due to weekday/weekend profiles and operation status of palm oil mill...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} community- and individual-level {{characteristics}} associated with individuals’ perceptions of violence. We use data collected in the Australian Community Capacity Study Wave 3 survey of over 4000 individuals living in 148 <b>local</b> <b>residential</b> <b>communities</b> in Brisbane and employ multilevel models to examine the association between community context, individual perceptions of police effectiveness {{and the belief that}} people in one’s community support violence to resolve conflict. We find communities with histories of violent crime and more negative views about police effectiveness tend to be communities where residents perceive their neighbours will support the use of violence to resolve conflict.

50|$|From 2012 until present Ausgrid has {{received}} numerous complaints {{and requests for}} better stakeholder management and consultation of the local community. Ausgrid was seen as forcing their network capacity increasing (and therefore profit increasing) projects onto <b>local</b> <b>residential</b> <b>communities.</b> Affected residents groups from the suburbs of Leichhardt, Penshurst and East Lindfield protested against unwanted and dangerous electricity High Voltage cabling, transformers and transmission towers being installed {{in front of their}} residential homes without proper consultation or response to complaints by the community. The residents, after many urgent appeals to Ausgrid's COO Trevor Armstrong and the chairman Roger Massey-Green, had been given no other option to notify local MP's, the media, the Environmental Protection Authority and other authorities to get action against Ausgrid.|$|R
40|$|YesIn the UK {{there is}} no real time retail market, and hence no real time retail {{electricity}} pricing. Therefore domestic electricity consumers in the UK pay electricity prices that do not vary from hour to hour, but are rather some kind of average price. Real time pricing information was identified as a barrier to understanding the effectiveness of various incentives and interventions. The key question is whether we can evaluate energy management and renewable energy intervention in the behaviour of customers in real market terms. Currently only behaviour changes with respect to total consumption can be evaluated. Interventions cannot be defined for peak load behaviour. The effectiveness of the introduction of renewable energy is also hard to assess. Therefore, it is hard to justify introducing of renewable and demand side management at local community level, apart from when following government approved schemes, subsidies, and other initiatives. In this paper, a new criteria has been developed to help developers and planners of <b>local</b> <b>residential</b> <b>communities</b> to understand the cost of intervention, in order to evaluate where the load is when the prices are high...|$|R

40|$|The three {{successful}} headteachers at {{a school}} in England managed policy, i. e. applied power effectively, in three distinct but interacting arenas: the micro level within the school and its departments; the meso level with local government and communities; and the macro level of central government and its agencies. They influenced these arenas by persuading school members to support their vision of a successful school through creating a culture that made staff and students feel valued but responsible members of the school community. This was achieved through the public sharing of {{knowledge of how to}} act effectively within school, e. g. in lessons or break times; to be connoisseurs of external policy contexts at meso and macro level; to understand how staff, students, and parents might perceive their actions; to assert their views and values effectively within the common interests of the school community. These leaders also created relationships with the school’s <b>local</b> authority and <b>residential</b> <b>communities</b> that made their members feel welcome partners with the school...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{a study of the}} {{politics}} of development planning in London’s South Bank to examine wider trends in the governance of contemporary cities. It assesses the impacts and outcomes of so-called new localist reforms and argues that we are witnessing two principal trends. First, governance processes are increasingly dominated by anti-democratic development machines, characterized by new assemblages of public- and private-sector experts. These machines reflect and reproduce a type of development politics {{in which there is a}} greater emphasis on a pragmatic realism and a politics of delivery. Second, the presence of these machines is having a significant impact on the politics of planning. Democratic engagement is not seen as the basis for new forms of localism and community control. Instead, it is presented as a potentially disruptive force that needs to be managed by a new breed of skilled private-sector consultant. The paper examines these wider shifts in urban politics before focusing on the connections between emerging development machines and <b>local</b> <b>residential</b> and business <b>communities.</b> It ends by highlighting some of the wider implications of change for democratic modes of engagement and nodes of resistance in urban politics...|$|R
40|$|Balance and Mobility are {{important}} functions {{for older adults}} to maintain in later life. Numerous exercise interventions have been proposed for improving and maintaining high levels of mobility and balance. The majority of the research to date has evaluated different types of exercise programming (strength, flexibility, endurance, power, tai chi) but has not evaluated the necessary dose or frequency needed to achieve positive outcomes. Limited recent research has reported that the FallProof™ program results in improved scores on the Berg Balance Scale and decreased times on the 8 foot Up and Go when offered 2 times per week over 8 weeks. Purpose. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to compare the effect of dose (frequency: one day per week vs. two days per week) of the FallProof™ intervention on improvements in function and mobility, as well as adherence and attrition, when implemented in a <b>residential</b> retirement <b>community.</b> A secondary purpose was to determine if two questionnaires could be utilized, instead of physical assessments, for quantifying baseline function and mobility. The use of questionnaires would permit more cost effective assessment, and thus remove a potential barrier to program implementation. Methods. Participants (n= 23; mean age= 79. 1, one male) were recruited from a <b>local</b> <b>residential</b> retirement <b>community</b> and randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups, 1 day group (n= 12), or 2 day group (n= 11), utilizing the FallProof™ program. Participant eligibility criteria included age 65 - 95 years, ability to walk with or without a gait aid, and mild-moderate mobility impairment (based on the Motor Fitness Scale). The exercise program was conducted for 16 weeks, with baseline, 8 week and 16 week assessments of the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), 8 foot Up and Go (UG), 50 foot walk test and chair stands. Questionnaires evaluated were the Motor Fitness Scale (MFS) and Late Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI). Results.
