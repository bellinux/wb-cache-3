5000|$|In the CLNT the CPC {{utilizes}} special typographic {{devices in}} an effort to display the actual grammatical features of the Greek New Testament, rather than merely an interpretation of said features. These devices may be categorized as follows: (1) lightface and boldface type to indicate when an English word is inserted to complete the sense, (2) symbols for the verb, and (3) distinctive signs and abbreviations for other grammatical elements. Similar devices are used in the CVOT, in which boldface type, symbols and capital letters indicate the words actually found in the Hebrew text, and <b>lightface</b> <b>type</b> indicate English words added for clarity. Textual emendations are also noted. The extreme care taken by the CPC demonstrates the [...] "high" [...] view of Scriptural inspiration that guided its efforts.|$|E
50|$|Of Mr. Nadall's {{productions}} in England, American printers {{have not}} {{had an opportunity to}} judge, as there is very little type of English manufacture which finds its way into their offices. He is yet a young man, and really has his reputation to make, but he is bound to make it. The work he did for Barnhart Brothers & Spindler was not extensive, but showed an originality of treatment and a latent talent in letter designing which give promise of better things. For this firm he designed a considerable number of borders and ornaments, all of which have met with a hearty reception from Printers. His principal type designs are Mazarin, Mazarin Italic, Fifteenth Century, Tell Text and a <b>lightface</b> <b>type</b> of pleasing design known as Nadall. This latter was probably cut lighter than the designer intended, and its usefulness thus somewhat impaired, as it has not been found durable at the press.|$|E
40|$|By using vectors and {{defining}} appropriate operations between them, physical laws {{can often be}} written in a simple form. Since we will making extensive use of vectors in Dynamics, we will summarize some of their important properties. Vectors For our purposes we will think of a vector as a mathematical representation of a physical entity which has both magnitude and direction in a 3 D space. Examples of physical vectors are forces, moments, and velocities. Geometrically, a vector can be represented as arrows. The length of the arrow represents its magnitude. Unless indicated otherwise, we shall assume that parallel translation does not change a vector, and we shall call the vectors satisfying this property, free vectors. Thus, two vectors are equal {{if and only if}} they are parallel, point in the same direction, and have equal length. Vectors are usually typed in boldface and scalar quantities appear in <b>lightface</b> italic <b>type,</b> e. g. the vector quantity A has magnitude, or modulus, A = |A|. In handwritten text, vectors are often expressed using the arrow, or underbar notation, e. g. −→ A, A. Vector Algebra Here, we introduce a few useful operations which are defined for free vectors. Multiplication by a scalar If we multiply a vector A by a scalar α, the result is a vector B = αA, which has magnitude B = |α|A. The vector B, is parallel to A and points in the same direction if α> 0. For α < 0, the vector B is parallel to A but points in the opposite direction (antiparallel). If we multiply an arbitrary vector, A, by the inverse of its magnitude, (1 /A), we obtain a unit vector which ˆ is parallel to A. There exist several common notations to denote a unit vector, e. g. A, eA, etc. Thus, we have that Â = A/A = A/ | A|, and A = A A, ˆ |A | ˆ = 1. 1 Vector addition Vector addition has a very simple geometrical interpretation. To add vector B to vector A, we simply place the tail of B at the head of A. The sum is a vector C from the tail of A to the head of B. Thus, we writ...|$|R
