In parallel, the powders are subjected to shear testing in a range of high stresses, with the derived unconfined yield strength used, along with the indentation hardness to define the constraint factor (C).

40|$|Atherosclerosis {{begins as}} local {{inflammation}} of arterial walls at sites of disturbed flow, such as vessel curvatures and bifurcations with <b>low</b> shear <b>stress.</b> c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) {{is a major}} regulator of flow-dependent gene expression in endothelial cells in atherosclerosis.

We aimed to observe the effect of JNK on low shear stress–induced atherogenesis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE−/−) mice and investigate the potential mechanism in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We divided 84 male ApoE−/− mice into two groups for treatment with normal saline (NS) (n = 42) and JNK inhibitor SP 600125 (JNK-I) (n = 42). Perivascular shear stress modifiers were placed around the right carotid arteries, and plaque formation was studied at <b>low</b> shear <b>stress</b> regions. The left carotid arteries without modifiers represented undisturbed shear stress as a control. The NS group showed atherosclerotic lesions in arterial regions with <b>low</b> shear <b>stress,</b> whereas the JNK-I group showed almost no atherosclerotic lesions.
