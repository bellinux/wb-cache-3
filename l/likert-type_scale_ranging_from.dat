Design: Children's weight and height were objectively measured. Parental anthropometric and sociodemographic data were self-reported. Children and their parents were asked to comment on children's weight status based on five-point <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scales,</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 'I am much too thin' to 'I am much too fat' (children) and 'My child's weight is way too little' to 'My child's weight is way too much' (parents). These data were combined with children's actual weight status, in order to assess underestimation of children's weight status by children themselves and by their parents, respectively. Chi-square tests and multilevel logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the aims of the current study. Setting: Eight European countries participating in the ENERGY (EuropeaN Energy balance Research to prevent excessive weight Gain among Youth) project. Subjects: A school-based survey among 6113 children aged 10 - 12 years and their parents. Results: In the total sample, 42. 9 % of overweight/obese children and 27. 6 % of parents of overweight/obese children underestimated their and their children's weight status, respectively. A higher likelihood for this underestimation of weight status by children and their parents was observed in Eastern and Southern compared with Central/Northern countries. Overweight or obese parents (OR = 1. 81; 95 % CI 1. 39, 2. 35 and OR = 1. 78, 95 % CI 1. 22, 2. 60), parents of boys (OR = 1. 32; 95 % CI 1. 05, 1. 67) and children from overweight/obese (OR = 1. 60; 95 % CI 1. 29, 1. 98 and OR = 1. 76; 95 % CI 1. 29, 2. 41) or unemployed parents (OR = 1. 53; 95 % CI 1. 22, 1. 92) were more likely to underestimate children's weight status.

Based on data, participants increased in knowledge, ability, and skills on associated items. Each item could be used to improve a communicator’s ability to effectively manage a crisis. Virtual worlds appear to be an effective training mechanism and additional research should be focused in this area...|$|R
30|$|From literature, {{there are}} two types of {{requirements}} importance, namely: i) stated (reported) and ii) statistically inferred importance (derived importance). Self-stated importance is a self-reported importance. It is a direct method where requirements importance is captured directly from customers using a scale (Pezeshki et al. 2009). That is, the value of the requirement or feature as perceived by the user or customer that is stated by word of mouth. Grigoroudis and Spyridaki (2003), defines self-stated importance as “the straightforward customer preferences for the weight of a satisfaction criteria”. In the stated importance method, users or customers are asked to rate the importance of the requirement, attribute or feature on a Likert <b>scales</b> typically <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> “not important at all” to “very important”. However, this approach has some weakness. Customers tend to assign higher importance to attributes or features that represent basic functionality (Tontini and Silveira 2007). Stated importance usually tends to have low discrimination and customers are likely to find everything important. This happens because users or customers normally reason about the importance of requirements or features in terms of how they result into socially acceptable outcomes or at least maintain status quo, Garver as cited in (Tontini and Silveira 2007). However this bias is resolved or at least minimized by the use of higher sample sizes and by use of trained and skilled interviewers. Martilla and James as cited in (Tontini and Silveira 2007) used self-stated importance and performance of attributes with a two-dimensional plot (Tontini and Silveira 2007). Self-stated importance can be measured using an easy method that uses questionnaire that is designed using 7 -point <b>Likert-type</b> <b>scale</b> that <b>ranges</b> <b>from</b> 1 -totally unimportant to 7 - very important. This instrument is used to capture user/customer stated requirement importance (Matzler et al. 1996).|$|R
30|$|The {{items for}} the PCSAM were {{developed}} from {{the findings of the}} qualitative study. The original PCSAM consisted of 21 items that were thought to relate to three sub-scales; 1 / potential dysfunctional cognitions as a result of world/external causes (1. Fate/God/bad luck caused the event to happen; 2. Since the event I have a pessimistic view of life; 3. My faith/religion/beliefs have been challenged by the event; 4. Since the event I feel let down by the world; 5. Since the event I feel let down by fate/my beliefs/God/my faith; 6. Since the event I do not feel like I have a place in the world), 2 / communal (7. Since the event I have sacrificed my needs for the needs of significant others; 8. Since the event I feel like I am a burden to others; 9. I do not want anyone to know about the event; 10. Since the event I no longer feel close to others; 11. Since the event other people have become a priority; 12. Since the event my relationships have been damaged or challenged; 13. Since the event I find it hard to have relationships with others; 14. Since the event others have made the problem worse), and 3 / disintegration from cultural/social roles (15. Since the event I have lost my social role/identity (e.g. as a parent, husband, wife, at work); 16. Since the event I have failed in my role(s); 17. Since the event my values have changed; 18. Since the event I try harder to meet social or cultural expectations; 19. Since the event I have not lived up to social or cultural expectations; 20. Since the event I try to act appropriately; 21. Since the event I do not feel I am a significant member of my culture/society/community/group). Participants were asked to rate these items in relation to the trauma disclosed on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID-I; First et al. 2002). Participants were instructed ‘Please read each item and then indicate how much you agree with each statement in regards to the past seven days’. Items were rated on <b>Likert-type</b> rating <b>scales</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 1 (totally disagree) to 7 (totally agree).|$|R
