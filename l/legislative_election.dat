5|$|A student {{member of}} the Communist Party of Greece, Tsakalotos joined Synaspismos in the early 1990s and {{was elected to the}} Central Committee of Syriza in 2004 shortly after their formation. He was first elected as a Member of the Hellenic Parliament for Athens B in the May 2012 <b>legislative</b> <b>{{election}}</b> and has been re-elected in every election since. In opposition from 2012 to 2015, he was Syriza's shadow finance minister. When Syriza entered government in January 2015, Tsakalotos was appointed as an Alternate Minister within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In April, he took over as head of Greece's negotiating team on the third bailout package. On 6 July 2015, following Yanis Varoufakis's resignation, Tsakalotos was appointed as Minister of Finance.

5|$|In the 1999 <b>legislative</b> <b>election</b> the FPÖ won 26.9% of the vote, its best-ever {{result in}} a {{nationwide}} election, and came ahead of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) by a small margin. This led the ÖVP to agree to form a coalition government with the FPÖ in 2000. The FPÖ soon became uncomfortable with governing and fell sharply in the 2002 <b>legislative</b> <b>election,</b> in which it obtained only 10.0% of the vote; however, the two parties agreed to continue their coalition following the election. In 2005 increasing internal disagreements in the FPÖ led Haider and several leading members (including all the party's ministers) to defect and form the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), which replaced the FPÖ as government partner.|$|E

In subsequent years, the group was simply re-formed as the socialist group (groupe socialiste), starting on 3 April 1978 with 113 seats following <b>legislative</b> <b>elections,</b> on 2 July 1981 with 285 seats following <b>legislative</b> <b>elections,</b> on 1 April 1986 with 212 seats following <b>legislative</b> <b>elections,</b> on 16 July 1988 with 275 seats following <b>legislative</b> <b>elections,</b> on 2 April 1993 with 57 seats following <b>legislative</b> <b>elections,</b> on 12 June 1997 with 250 seats following <b>legislative</b> <b>elections,</b> and on 25 June 2002 with 141 seats following <b>legislative</b> <b>elections.</b> The group was reconstituted under a new name following the 2007 legislative elections; including 204 deputies, with 186 members and 18 related, it took {{the name of the}} Socialist, Radical and Citizen group (groupe socialiste, radical et citoyen), abbreviated as SRC; on 11 July 2007, it was renamed again to become the Socialist, Radical, Citizen and Miscellaneous Left group (groupe socialiste, radical, citoyen et divers gauche).|$|R

5|$|Sometime between 1888 and 1890, McKinley {{decided to}} run for president, but to have a {{realistic}} chance of attaining that goal, he needed to regain office. Foraker's ambition then was the Senate—he planned to challenge Sherman in the <b>legislative</b> <b>election</b> to be held in January 1892—and he agreed to nominate McKinley for governor at the state convention in Columbus. McKinley was elected, and Sherman narrowly turned back Foraker's challenge with considerable help from Hanna.|$|E
5|$|Beginning as a supporter, Greeley {{soon became}} disillusioned with President Johnson, whose Reconstruction {{policies}} allowed the quick formation of state governments without provision for suffrage for the freedman. When Congress convened and gradually {{took control of}} Reconstruction, Greeley generally supported their actions, favoring universal male suffrage and, his anger against the Confederates having cooled, amnesty. While Greeley generally supported the Radical Republicans, {{he did not like}} the harshness of Thaddeus Stevens. Greeley ran for Congress in 1866, but lost badly, and for Senate in the <b>legislative</b> <b>election</b> held in early 1867, to be defeated by Roscoe Conkling.|$|E

On 28 August, Thanou-Christophilou's caretaker cabinet was sworn in, with George Chouliarakis being sworn in as the interim Minister of Finance.|$|E
40|$|We {{test the}} effect of the {{importance}} of elections by focusing on turnout at presidential and <b>legislative</b> <b>elections</b> in countries with semi-presidential constitutions. These countries have two potentially first-order elections, but they vary considerably in the powers that are granted to their presidents and prime ministers. We hypothesise that turnout at <b>legislative</b> <b>elections</b> will vary inversely with presidential power and that above a certain degree of presidential power turnout at presidential elections will be higher than turnout at <b>legislative</b> <b>elections.</b> We test these hypotheses on the set of electoral democracies from 1989 - 2010 inclusive. Controlling for standard social, political and institutional variables, we find strong support for our propositions. The findings show that the importance of the electoral contest is a determining factor for turnout at <b>legislative</b> <b>elections</b> and that the relative importance of presidential and <b>legislative</b> <b>elections</b> can be understood as a continuous scale, and not merely dichotomously...|$|R

5|$|Since then, under Strache's leadership, {{the party}} has again {{attracted}} an increase in its popular support. In the 2013 <b>legislative</b> <b>election</b> the FPÖ won 20.5% of the vote and, more recently, it came ahead either of the SPÖ or the ÖVP in some state elections, entered in a SPÖ-led government in Burgenland and gained more than 30% {{of the vote in}} Vienna. Finally, in the 2016 presidential election, FPÖ member Norbert Hofer won the first round, receiving 35.1%, but was defeated by The Greens' candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, 53.8% against 46.2%, in the final run-off (an earlier run-off was invalidated).|$|E
5|$|As {{a student}} at the University of Oxford, Tsakalotos joined the Communist Party of Greece (Interior), a eurocommunist party that had split from the main Communist Party of Greece, a Marxist–Leninist party, in 1968. In the early 1990s, shortly after moving to Greece, Tsakalotos became a member of Synaspismos, a radical left-wing {{political}} party, which was to become the largest constituent party of Syriza. Syriza itself was formed in 2004, ahead of that year's <b>legislative</b> <b>election,</b> as a coalition of 13 left-wing political parties in Greece. Tsakalotos was elected to their Central Committee in December 2004. However, he also remained a prominent member of Synaspismos and served on both their Central Political Committee and their Political Secretariat until a July 2013 party congress, during which Syriza voted to become an independent political party and for all component parties to disband, including Synaspismos.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} phases of registration, 150 parties were {{registered}} with the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. However, this number was reduced to 50 and then 24 after scrutiny from the newly created General Election Commission. This reduction from the 48 parties that stood in the 1999 <b>legislative</b> <b>election</b> was largely attributed to new an election law that allowed only parties that had won two percent of seats in the DPR, or three percent of seats in provincial and regental legislatures in half of the provinces {{to stand in the}} 2004 election. Only six parties met this requirement, and the remaining parties were required to merge or reorganize into a new party.|$|E
50|$|At the <b>legislative</b> <b>elections,</b> December 5, 2001, {{the party}} won 1 out of 50 seats. The only MP was Joses Tuhanuku, elected from the Rennell and Bellona constituency. At the last <b>legislative</b> <b>elections</b> on 5 April 2006, the party won no seats.|$|R

50|$|At the <b>legislative</b> <b>elections,</b> 6 October 2002, {{the party}} won 1 out of 513 {{seats in the}} Chamber of Deputies and no seats in the Senate. At the <b>legislative</b> <b>elections</b> of October 1, 2006, the party won 9 seats in the chamber of deputies.|$|R
5|$|For the 2007 presidential {{election}}, Le Pen and Mégret {{agreed to}} join forces. Le Pen came fourth in the election with 11% of the vote, and the party won no seats in the <b>legislative</b> <b>election</b> of the same year. The party's 4.3% support was the lowest score since the 1981 election and only one candidate, Marine Le Pen in Pas de Calais, reached the runoff (where she was defeated by the Socialist incumbent). These electoral defeats partly accounted for the party's financial problems. Le Pen announced {{the sale of the}} FN headquarters in Saint-Cloud, Le Paquebot, and of his personal armoured car. Twenty permanent employees of the FN were also dismissed in 2008. In the 2010 regional elections the FN appeared to have re-emerged on the political scene after surprisingly winning almost 12% of the overall vote and 118 seats.|$|E
5|$|Hsu started helping {{members of}} the World United Formosans for Independence return to Taiwan in 1991.

In 1995, he was not nominated by the DPP, but was still elected as an independent candidate. He lost the election for the office of mayor of Tainan in 1997 and instead became the secretary-general of the New National Coalition (新國家連線) shortly after the establishment of the organization. He was re-elected legislator in the 1998 <b>legislative</b> <b>election.</b> Hsu stepped out of the New National Coalition and rejoined the DPP shortly after his re-election to the Legislative Yuan. He was nominated by the DPP Central Executive Committee as the party's candidate for the Tainan mayoral race.|$|E
5|$|Phan Quang Đán {{joined the}} {{rebellion}} and acted as the rebels' spokesman. The most prominent political critic of Diệm, Đán had been disqualified from the 1959 <b>legislative</b> <b>election</b> after winning his seat by {{a ratio of}} 6:1 despite Diệm having organised votestacking against him. He cited political mismanagement of {{the war against the}} Viet Cong and the government's refusal to broaden its political base as the reason for the revolt. Đán spoke on Radio Vietnam and staged a media conference during which a rebel paratrooper pulled a portrait of the president from the wall, ripped it and stamped on it. In the meantime, Thuy went about organising a coalition of political parties to take over post-Diệm. He had already lined up the VNQDĐ, Đại Việt, and the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài religious movements, and was seeking more collaborators.|$|E
