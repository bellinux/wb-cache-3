For example, if {{nonlinear}} <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> are predictable, {{we can take}} adequate action for problem of weather. In this study, we propose two prediction methods for <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> using coupled oscillators system. We predict chaos <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> like the natural phenomena by these methods. The chaos time-sires data are made by the Chua’s circuit. The prediction results of <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> are compared with two our methods. We show possibility of predictable by actual circuit. I. introduction Predictions of the <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> of natural world are very important for human, {{and a lot of}} researches are carried out up to now[1][2]. A lot of things of the natural world such as the atom, neurons, and planets are oscillating. These are connected by each other, and operate as a system. Therefore...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a class of}} {{algorithms}} for detecting the change points in <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> based on subspace identification, meaning a geometric approach for estimating linear state-space models behind <b>time-series</b> <b>data.</b> Our algorithms are derived from the principle that the subspace spanned by the columns of an observability matrix and the one spanned by the subsequences of <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> are approximately equivalent. In this paper, we derive an batchtype algorithm applicable to ordinary <b>time-series</b> <b>data,</b> i. e. consisting of only output series, and then introduce the online version of the algorithm and the extension to be available with input-output <b>time-series</b> <b>data.</b> We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithms with comparative experiments using some artificial and real datasets. 1...|$|R

The Automatic Bayesian Covariance Discovery (ABCD) system constructs natural-language description of <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> by treating unknown <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> nonparametrically using GP with a composite covariance kernel function. Unfortunately, learning a composite covariance kernel {{with a single}} <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> set often results in less informative kernel that may not give qualitative, distinctive descriptions of data. We address this challenge by proposing two relational kernel learning methods which can model multiple <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> sets by finding common, shared causes of changes. We show that the relational kernel learning methods find more accurate models for regression problems on several real-world data sets; US stock data, US house price index data and currency exchange rate data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{popularity}} of time-series databases in many applications has cre-ated an increasing demand for performing data-mining tasks (classification, clustering, outlier detection, etc.) on <b>time-series</b> <b>data.</b> Currently, however, no single system or library exists that specializes on providing efficient implemen-tations of data-mining techniques for <b>time-series</b> <b>data,</b> supports the necessary concepts of representations, similarity measures and preprocessing tasks, {{and is at}} the same time freely available. For these reasons we have designed a multi-purpose, multifunctional, extendable system FAP – Framework for Analysis and Prediction, which supports the aforementioned concepts and techniques for mining <b>time-series</b> <b>data.</b> This paper describes the architecture of FAP and the current version of its Java implementation which focuses on time-series similar-ity measures and nearest-neighbor classification.

When performing time-series smoothing, researchers are also reminded that maintenance of the original characteristics of the time-series profile is critical [25]. Just as with other high spatial resolution images, the trade-off is that HJ- 1 A/B <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> is spaced irregularly in time. Signal processing techniques (e.g., wavelet and Fourier analysis) require the <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> have regular, equidistant spacing [27, 28], hence they may not work well in the nonequidistantly spaced <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> derived from HJ- 1 A/B satellites.|$|R

Due to {{the costs associated}} with semiconductor fabrication, specialized processors are only viable for products with high production volumes. The emergence of low-cost sensor-based computing products in recent years has created an urgent need to process <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> with the utmost efficiency. Although most sensor data is fixed-point, the normalization process - an absolute necessity for highly accurate similarity search of <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> - converts the data to floating-point in order to avoid a loss in precision. The sensors that collect <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> are typically connected to low-power microcontrollers or RISC processors sans floating point units. The computational requirements of real-time similarity search would overwhelm such processors.

The main objective {{of this study is}} to characterize the vibration mechanism(s), based on the analysis of the <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> of the dynamical system, specifically acceleration for two different airspeeds with a sampling rate of 1024 Hz.

Some background in the theory of chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems is discussed, and techniques for the identification of chaos in <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> are presented. Several topics including delay-coordinate embedding theory, delay time and dimension calculation, and Lyapunov exponent computation for chaotic systems are described.
