5|$|When {{speakers}} of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge {{to become more}} similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this {{may lead to the}} formation of language areas in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the Balkan <b>language</b> <b>area,</b> the Mesoamerican <b>language</b> <b>area,</b> and the Ethiopian <b>language</b> <b>area.</b> Also, larger areas such as South Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific areal features.|$|E
5|$|Mesoamericans {{viewed the}} world as hostile and governed by {{unpredictable}} deities. The ritual Mesoamerican ballgame was widely played. Mesoamerica is linguistically diverse, with most languages falling within {{a small number of}} language families – the major families are Mayan, Mixe–Zoquean, Otomanguean, and Uto-Aztecan; there are also a number of smaller families and isolates. The Mesoamerican <b>language</b> <b>area</b> shares a number of important features, including widespread loanwords, and use of a vigesimal number system.|$|E
5|$|The {{left and}} right sides of the brain appear symmetrical, but they {{function}} asymmetrically. For example, the counterpart of the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling the left hand. There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language and spatial cognition. The left frontal lobe is dominant for language. If a key <b>language</b> <b>area</b> in the left hemisphere is damaged, it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand, whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills.|$|E

25|$|The French Community Commission {{has also}} another capacity: some {{legislative}} {{powers of the}} French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French <b>language</b> <b>area</b> of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual <b>language</b> <b>area).</b> The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community. This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact decrees, which are legislative acts.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of Romansh within its traditional <b>language</b> <b>area</b> varies from region to region. In 2000, 66 municipalities {{still had a}} Romansh majority, an additional 32 had at least 20% who declared Romansh as their language of best command or as a habitually spoken language, while Romansh is either extinct or only spoken by a small minority in the remaining 18 municipalities within the traditional <b>language</b> <b>area.</b> In the Surselva region, it is the habitually spoken language of 78.5% and the language of best command of 66%. In the Sutselva region by contrast, Romansh is extinct or only spoken by {{a small number of}} older people, with the exception of Schams, where it is still transmitted to children and where some villages still have a Romansh majority, notably {{in the vicinity of the}} Schamserberg. In the Surmiran region, it is the main language in the Surses region, but no longer widely spoken in the Albula Valley.|$|E
25|$|Its lineage {{goes back}} to the Tristano Veneto. Venice, at that time, {{controlled}} large parts of the Serbo-Croatian <b>language</b> <b>area,</b> engendering a more active literary and cultural life there than in most of the Balkans during this period. The manuscript of the Povest states that it was translated from a (lost) Serbian intermediary. Scholars assume that the legend must have journeyed from Venice, through its Balkan colonies, finally reaching a last outpost in this Slavic language.|$|E
25|$|However, the 19th century saw {{the rise}} of {{dialectology}} and the categorisation of dialects. German dialectologists termed the German varieties spoken in the mountainous south of Germany as Hochdeutsch ("High German"). Subsequently, German varieties spoken in the north were designated as Niederdeutsch ("Low German"). These were in the Dutch <b>language</b> <b>area</b> calqued as the exonyms Nederduits and Hoogduits and referred now to the German varieties of standard German. As a result, the Hoog ("High") was dropped in the Dutch exonym Hoogduits {{in the sense of}} the German standard language, meaning that Duits narrowed down as Dutch exonym for German. Moreover, Nederduits lost its meaning as endonym for Dutch, and Nederlands prevailed as sole Dutch endonym.|$|E

25|$|In 1921 the {{metropolitan}} area was expanded further. The municipalities of Laken, Neder-Over-Heembeek, and Haren were incorporated into the municipality of Brussels, while Sint-Pieters-Woluwe {{became part of the}} bilingual agglomeration by law. After the language census of 1947, Evere, Ganshoren, and Sint-Agatha-Berchem were added to the bilingual agglomeration, although the implementation of this change was postponed until 1954 due to Flemish pressure. This was the last enlargement of the agglomeration, which brought the number of municipalities in Brussels to 19. In the peripheral municipalities of Kraainem, Linkebeek, Drogenbos, and Wemmel, where a French-speaking minority of more than 30% existed, language facilities were set up, although these municipalities officially remain in the Dutch <b>language</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{successive}} linguistic disputes {{have made}} the successive Belgian governments very unstable. The three major parties (Liberal -right wing-, Catholic -center- and, Socialist -left wing-) all split in two according to their French- or Dutch-speaking electorate. A language border {{was determined by the}} first Gilson Act of November 8, 1962. The boundaries of certain provinces, arrondissements and municipalities were modified (among others, Mouscron became a part of Hainaut and Voeren became a part of Limburg) and facilities for linguistic minorities were introduced in 25 municipalities. On August 2, 1963, the second Gilson Act entered into force, fixing the division of Belgium into four language areas: a Dutch, a French and a German <b>language</b> <b>area,</b> with Brussels as a bilingual area.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch Low Saxon dialect area, {{comprising}} {{the provinces of}} Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel, {{and parts of the}} province of Gelderland as well. The IJssel roughly forms the linguistic watershed here. This group, which is not Low Franconian but instead Low Saxon and close to neighbouring Low German, has been elevated by the Netherlands (and by Germany) to the legal status of streektaal (regional language) according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It is regarded as Dutch for a number of reasons. From the 14th to 15th century onward, its urban centers (Deventer, Zwolle, Kampen, Zutphen and Doesburg) have been increasingly influenced by the western written Dutch and became a linguistically mixed area. From the 17th century onward, it was gradually integrated into the Dutch <b>language</b> <b>area.</b> Dutch Low Saxon used to be {{at one end of the}} Low German dialect continuum. However, the national border has given way to dialect boundaries coinciding with a political border, because the traditional dialects are strongly influenced by the national standard varieties. Cross-the-border dialects now separated by a plain gap also include South Guelderish and Limburgish on the Dutch side of the border and Meuse-Rhenish on the German side of the border.|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} <b>language</b> <b>areas</b> {{as from the}} 31 July 1921 law: the Dutch-speaking Flemish area, the French-speaking Walloon area, and the bilingual area of Brussels (capital city).

Thence a French-speaking unilingual municipality could, for instance, be part of the province of West Flanders.|$|R

25|$|Dutch dialects are {{primarily}} the dialects {{that are both}} related with the Dutch language and are spoken in the same <b>language</b> <b>area</b> as the Dutch standard language. Although heavily {{under the influence of}} the standard language, some of them remain remarkably diverse and are found in the Netherlands and northern Belgium. The area where they are spoken often correspond with former mediaeval counties and duchies. The Netherlands (but not Belgium) makes a distinction between a dialect and a streektaal ("regional language"). These words are actually more political than linguistic, because a regional language unite a large group of very differing varieties. Such is the case with the Gronings dialect, which is considered a variety of the Dutch Low Saxon regional language, but is in fact very distinct from other Low Saxon varieties due to a Frisian substrate. Also, some Dutch dialects are more remote from the Dutch standard language than some varieties of a regional language are. Such is the case with West Flemish, which is considered a Dutch dialect but is far more remote from the standard language than most Dutch Low Saxon varieties are. Within the Netherlands, a further distinction is made between a regional language and a separate language, which is the case with the (standardised) West Frisian language. It is spoken next to Dutch in the province of Friesland.|$|E
500|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{form part}} of the Mesoamerican <b>language</b> <b>area,</b> an area of linguistic convergence developed throughout millennia of interaction between the peoples of Mesoamerica. All Mayan languages display the basic diagnostic traits of this linguistic area. For example, all use relational nouns instead of prepositions to indicate spatial relationships. They also possess grammatical and typological features that set them apart from other languages of Mesoamerica, {{such as the use}} of ergativity in the grammatical treatment of verbs and their subjects and objects, specific inflectional categories on verbs, and a special word class of [...] "positionals" [...] which is typical of all Mayan languages.|$|E
