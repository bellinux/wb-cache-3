5|$|Radio is {{the debut}} studio album by American rapper <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J. It was on November 18, 1985, by Def Jam Recordings {{and was the}} record label's first {{full-length}} album release. Radio was recorded during 1984 to 1985 at Chung King House of Metal in New York City and produced primarily by Rick Rubin, who provided a sparse and minimal production style. The album also features a sound punctuated by DJ scratching, often brief samples, and emphasis of the downbeat. <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J's aggressive b-boy lyrics explored themes of inner city culture, teenage promiscuity, and braggadocio raps.|$|E
5|$|The album {{experienced}} {{a significant amount}} of commercial success and sales for a hip hop record at the time, earning U.S. Billboard chart success and selling over 500,000 copies within its first five months of release. On April 19, 1989, Radio was certified platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), following sales in excess of one million copies in the United States. Initial criticism of the album was generally positive, as <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J's lyricism and Rick Rubin's production were praised by several music critics. It has since been recognized by critics as <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J's greatest work.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) enlists a rap producer, Ridikolous (<b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J), {{to unload}} {{his line of}} {{inferior}} champagne while Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) reluctantly hosts the Source Awards.

5|$|KRS-One {{considered}} Run-D.M.C. {{the epitome}} of rap music in 1984 and had begun to rap following their lead. But he has also said that BDP's approach reflected {{a feeling that the}} early innovators like Run-D.M.C. and <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J were by 1986 tainted by commercial success and {{out of touch with the}} streets.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, there were popular hip hop songs, and the celebrities of the scene, like <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J, gained mainstream renown. Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness, or fused hip hop with jazz, heavy metal, techno, funk and soul. New styles appeared {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s, like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion, pioneered by rappers like De La Soul.|$|E

5|$|Reflecting the {{new school}} and ghettoblaster {{subculture}} in the U.S. during the mid-1980s, Radio belongs to a pivotal {{moment in the history}} and culture of hip hop. Its success contributed to the displacement of the old school with {{the new school}} form and to the genre's mainstream success during the period. Its success also served as a career breakthrough for <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J and Rick Rubin. Radio has been recognized by music writers {{as one of the first}} cohesive and commercially successful hip hop albums.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), meanwhile, is {{producing}} his own wine, called Donaghy Estate Sparkling Wine. He and Liz taste it, {{and realize that}} it is practically undrinkable. This leaves Jack with the problem of disposing with the wine. He decides to market it to hip-hop producer Ridikolous (<b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J), {{and at the same time}} patch up things between Tracy and Ridikolous, who was not allowed into one of Tracy's parties. Jack and Ridikolous have a meeting, resulting in the wine becoming the corporate sponsor of the Source Awards, which is being produced by Ridikolous. To further mend things with Tracy, Jack proposes to let Tracy host the award show. This backfires when Tracy refuses to host it in fear that he will get shot, but Jack still sees it as the only way to work things out with Ridikolous.|$|E
5|$|The {{new school}} of hip hop was a {{movement}} in hip hop music starting 1983–84 with the early records of Run–D.M.C. and <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J. Like the hip hop preceding it, it came predominantly from New York City. The new school was initially characterized in form by drum machine led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock. It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song its artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with the funk and disco influenced outfits, novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of artists prevalent in 1984, and rendered them old school. New school artists made shorter songs that could more easily gain radio play, and more cohesive LPs than their old school counterparts. By 1986 their releases began to establish the hip hop album as a fixture of the mainstream.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Jeff Hanneman was {{surprised}} by Rubin's interest in the band, and was impressed by his work with the hip hop acts Run DMC and <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J. During a visit by Slagel to a European music convention, Rubin spoke with the band directly, and persuaded them to sign with Def Jam. Slagel paid a personal tribute to Rubin, and said that Rubin was the most passionate of all the label representatives the band were in negotiations with. Following the agreement, Friedman brought the band members to Seattle for two days of publicity shots, possible record shots, and photos for a tour book; Rubin felt no good photos of the band had been taken before that point. One of the photos was used on the back cover of the band's 1988 release South of Heaven. The album became an American Recordings album after Rubin ended his partnership with Russell Simmons. It {{was one of only}} two Def Jam titles to be distributed by Geffen Records through Warner Bros. Records because of the original distributor's refusal to release work by the band.|$|E

500|$|Author of the 1985 book Fresh: Hip Hop Don't Stop, writer Nelson George further {{elaborated}} on {{the appeal}} of Radio to listeners at the time, describing <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J as a [...] "minimalist homeboy who knows his beats", and stating [...] "You can call it rap, hip hop or street, {{but it really is}} a way of hearing music—and partying hard—that expresses the experiences and attitudes of a great many inner city kids. <b>L.L.</b> <b>Cool</b> J {{is one of the best}} young talkologists around, because he speaks directly to and about his generation over large beats that recall Run-D.M.C., Trouble Funk, James Brown, and funky little bits of AC/DC and Yes ... This teenage music is built around beats, but not just any old beats. It is all about a beat with style, with personality, and <b>L.L.</b> <b>Cool</b> J has plenty of both." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J {{dropped out}} of Andrew Jackson High School in Queens to record his first studio album, also the first LP to be issued by Def Jam. Recording {{sessions}} for the album took place at Chung King Studios in Manhattan's Chinatown under Rubin's direction throughout 1984 and 1985.

A Queens native and former trombonist, Philpot met LL at a block party and they began performing together. The audio mastering was handled by engineer Herb Powers at 130 West 42nd Street in the Frankford Wayne Mastering Labs and the album was set for release as Radio in November 1985, containing a dedication in the liner notes from <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J {{to his mother and}} his grandparents. The album's release had been anticipated by many rap fans following <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J's appearance in the hip hop movie Krush Groove, which was based on the beginnings of the Def Jam label and featured the single [...] "I Can't Live Without My Radio" [...] from Radio.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} the cast {{is trying to}} get back to the {{elevator}} after hooking up actor Stellan Skarsgård to the helicopter is actually an accident that made it into the finished film. As Jackson explained, [...] "At one point three tons of water got thrown on us by accident and we got swept toward those cargo bays and everyone thought we were going into the drink and people were tumbling around this metal grating [...] We scrambled up and kept acting [...] That was not supposed to happen and we didn't have safety harnesses on and we were flailing around on this deck." [...] Jackson was initially offered the role played by <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J, but his management team did not like the idea of him playing a chef, so Harlin created the role of Russell Franklin for him. Additionally, <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J's character was supposed to die early on, but the director ultimately decided to keep him. The production team could not afford to have a fully trained parrot for <b>LL</b> <b>Cool</b> J's character, so they used two parrots: one that was good at flying, and another that could sit on his shoulder.|$|E
