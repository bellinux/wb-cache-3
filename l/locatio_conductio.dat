50|$|As noted above, in Roman law the {{contract}} of lease (<b>locatio</b> <b>conductio)</b> had three forms: the <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> rei, the <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operis and the <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operarum. Roman-Dutch law adopted this position, {{and it is still}} in force in South Africa. The modern {{contract of lease}} is therefore the Roman <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> rei, the rental or hire of a thing.|$|E
50|$|In Roman law the {{equivalent}} dichotomy was that between <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operarum (employment contract) and <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operis (contract for services).|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} South Africa's modern {{contract}} of employment lie in Roman law, where a distinction was made between {{the two types of}} contracts discussed above: <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operis and <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operarum.|$|E

50|$|This {{has long}} been a {{difficult}} task in South Africa, as it is not always immediately apparent whether the parties have entered into the <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operarum (contract of employment) or merely the <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operis (contract of work).|$|E

50|$|Justinian's Institutes {{classify}} {{the following}} contracts as consensu: emptio venditio, <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio,</b> societas and mandatum.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operis, or {{contract}} for the supply of services, like {{the construction of a}} building, between an employer and independent contractor.|$|E
50|$|If {{the price}} of the hiring is not fixed, the {{contract}} is not <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio,</b> but affords grounds for an action praescriptis verbis.|$|E
5000|$|... {{contract}} of emphyteusis, or perpetual lease {{at a fixed}} rent, which resembles both <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> and venditio, was placed by Zeno {{in a class by}} itself.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sequence}} {{of performance and}} counter-performance also depends on the contractual provisions. If, however, another intention does not appear, the contractor, in <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operis for example, must first perform.|$|E
5000|$|In SA Broadcasting Corporation v McKenzie, the Labour Appeal Court {{summarised}} {{the main}} {{differences between the}} contract of employment proper and {{what is called the}} [...] "contract of work" [...] (<b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operis): ...|$|E
50|$|In Roman law, <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> is a consensual contract, {{by which}} a person becomes bound to deliver to another {{the use of a}} thing for a certain time, or to do work at a certain price.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contracts}} whereby reciprocal obligations are created, {{the question}} of whether the obligations are so closely linked that the principle of reciprocity applies is basically a matter of interpretation. If, however, no other intention appears, the principle applies by operation of law to certain well-known contracts, such as, for example, the contract of sale and <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operis.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the right}} of {{withholding}} is seen as analogous to the holding of a pledge, this would entail that a party's own performance could be withheld until the counter-performance is fully rendered. In the case of <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operis, {{it is all the}} more the case that the contractor must fully perform before he is entitled to the contract price.|$|E
5000|$|A {{contract}} of employment comes into existence when the parties conclude an agreement that conforms {{to the requirements of}} the <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operarum. The {{contract of}} employment is traditionally defined as [...] "a contract between two persons, the master (employer) and the servant (employee), for the letting and hiring of the latter's services for reward, the master being able to supervise and control the servant’s work." ...|$|E
50|$|Like any contract, the <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operarum commences {{when the}} parties have agreed to its {{essential}} terms, unless both parties have agreed to suspend its operation for a particular period. If the contract's operation is suspended, the employer is obliged to allow the employee to commence work on the specified date. Failure to do so, without good cause, constitutes a breach of contract at common law and a dismissal under the Labour Relations Act 1995. It is important, therefore, to determine what the essentials of the contract of employment are.|$|E
50|$|In South African law, the {{distinction}} between employees (or servants) and independent contractors is based on {{the distinction}} between <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operarum and <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operis faciendi. These categories, being contractual, “should be defined with the law of contract in mind.” In the case of employment, the employer is vicariously liable for the delictual acts of the employee committed during course of his employment. In the case of an independent contractor, the principal or locator is not delictually liable. The case of Chartaprops (Pty) Ltd & another v Silberman, highly important, illustrates this principle. Mrs Silberman was injured in casu when she slipped and fell in a shopping mall owned by Chartaprops, which had appointed a company, Advanced Planning, to do the cleaning of the mall. A slippery substance was left undetected by the employees of Advanced Planning; Silberman sustained an injury as a result, and sued both companies—Advanced Planning {{on the basis of the}} negligence of its employees in failing to detect and remove the substance, which had been lying on floor for about thirty minutes. There was evidence also that Chartaprops was in habit of checking on and inspecting Advanced Planning’s activities. But Chartaprops, too, had failed to detect the substance. In court a quo, both respondents were found to be liable, jointly and severally. They appealed, and leave to do so was granted.|$|E
50|$|The {{principles}} {{relating to}} the rule huur gaar voor koop were discussed. Under Roman law, a lease of property (<b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> rei) conferred only jura in personam. More particularly, the lessee held no real right in the leased property; he merely enjoyed contractual jura in personam against the lessor {{by virtue of the}} agreement of lease. Consequently, if during the currency of the lease the lessor alienated the leased property in terms of, say, a contract of sale, the purchaser (and new owner) was not bound to recognise the lessees rights of occupation under the lease, unless he had undertaken to do so.|$|E
50|$|Mandate (mandatum or lastgeving) is a {{contract}} {{in which one}} person, the mandatary, undertakes to perform some lawful task for another, the mandator. In Roman-Dutch law, the contract {{was said to be}} essentially gratuitous. If the parties agreed on a payment for the services rendered, the contract was one of letting and hiring of work or services: <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operis or operarum respectively. It was accepted in practice, however, that the mandator might offer a reward or honorarium, not in payment but in gratitude, for the mandatary's services. There is no objection in modern law to the remuneration of the mandatary, with the result {{that it is difficult to}} distinguish the contract of mandate from that of letting and hiring of work or services.|$|E
50|$|The South African law of lease {{is an area}} of {{the legal}} system in South Africa which {{describes}} the rules applicable to a contract of lease (or letting and hiring, Lat <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio,</b> Afrik huur en verhuring). This is broadly defined as a reciprocal agreement between two parties, the lessor and the lessee, in terms of which one, the lessor, binds himself to give the other, the lessee, the temporary use and enjoyment of a thing, in whole or in part, or of his services or those of another person; the lessee, meanwhile, binds himself to pay a sum of money as compensation, or rent, for that use and enjoyment. The law of lease is often discussed as a counterpart to the law of sale.|$|E
50|$|Trajan resettled Dacia with Romans and annexed it as a {{province}} of the Roman Empire. Aside from their enormous booty (over half a million slaves, according to John Lydus), Trajan's Dacian campaigns benefited the Empire's finances through the acquisition of Dacia's gold mines, managed by an imperial procurator of equestrian rank (procurator aurariarum). On the other hand, commercial agricultural exploitation on the villa model, based on the centralized management of a huge landed estate by a single owner (fundus) was poorly developed. Therefore, use of slave labor in the province itself {{seems to have been}} relatively undeveloped, and epigraphic evidence points to work in the gold mines being conducted by means of labor contracts (<b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> rei) and seasonal wage-earning.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{not only}} in case law that one has {{difficulty}} with the term “independent contractor.” An example of a difficulty in statute law {{is to be found}} in the law relating to estate agents. The term “independent contractor” does not normally mean an employee, but rule 3.15 of the Estate Agent’s Code of Conduct speaks of an estate agent’s being “in the service of” another estate agent “as [...] [...] [...] an independent contractor.” Item 3 of the Specification of Services said that “a person rendering any of the aforesaid services paras (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) of the definition of ‘estate agent’ in the Act as an independent contractor shall be deemed to do so as an employee of an estate agent.” Delport suggests that the purpose of the Notice was to rectify the problem which arose as a result of the introduction of the expression “independent contractor” in section 26 of the Act. Kerr does not think that “deeming” all independent agents and mandataries (if that is what is meant in this context by “independent contractors”) to be “employees” either “solves, or is a suitable way to solve, the problem.” Section 26 of the Act was intended to ensure that all those practising as estate agents had fidelity fund certificates. It referred to “an independent contractor rendering services to” an estate agent. “Rendering services” appears to Kerr to have been be used in the general sense; “it does not appear to mean that independent agents have contracts of <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operarum.” ...|$|E
40|$|The {{contract}} of hire of service meant the employment of free labour {{in return for payment}} {{for the duration of the}} hire. In such cases a person obliged himself to place his services at the disposal of another and work for him against wages per hour, day, week, etc. The hire of services in Ancient Rome included primarily manual tasks. Although certain professional services could also be hired, high-standard intellectual activities belonging to the liberal arts could not be the object of <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio.</b> The hire of services gave rise to a synallagmatic bonae fidei obligation. The wage labourer was obliged to work according to the instructions of the employer and with a due standard of care. He was liable for culpa levis. The bearing of risks was divided between the parties. The general rule was that the risk was to be borne by the person within the sphere of whom the circumstance creating an obstacle in the way of performance occurred.

40|$|O alijamento é um instituto próprio do Direito Marítimo (romano). Trata-se do arremesso de mercadorias ou instrumentos da embarcação a fim de salvar ambas do naufrágio. Seu efeito é a repartição de danos entre os envolvidos (contributio), a qual caracteriza, com o tempo, as avarias grossas. No Digesto, é possível encontrar (quase) todos os elementos que o constituem. Dentre esses, discute-se sobre a intencionalidade do ato, ou seja, quem decide sua realização. Ao assumirem a <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> como tutela do instituto, os juristas romanos escolhem o magister navis [= capitão da embarcação] como único elo comum entre todos os interessados no evento, e, assim, capaz de decidir sobre esse (D. 14, 2, 2 pr.). Entretanto, também consideram a existência de uma junta deliberativa, formada pelos comerciantes a bordo e passageiros, que deveriam ser consultados (D. 14, 2, 2, 1). Da dúvida se o ato intencional faz referência ao magister navis ou também à junta deliberativa, revela-se um jogo de poder, que condiciona a leitura da lex Rhodia. É necessário determinar o papel desempenhado por cada um desses no alijamento para que se conheça seu conceito no período justinianeu e ajude a compreender esse aspecto na tradição jurídico-marítima posterior. The {{jettison}} is {{a specific}} Admiralty (Roman) Law institution. It means the sacrifice of cargo or ship instruments {{in order to save}} both from shipwreck. Its effect is the splitting damages between the involved parts (contributio), which characterizes, in time, the gross average. In the Digest, itś possible to find (almost) all elements that constitute it. Among them, the intentionality of the act is debated, it means, who can decide about that disposal. Once they agreed with the <b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> to patronize the institution, the Roman jurists chose the magister navis [= c̈aptain of the ship]̈ as the only common link between all interested parts in the occurrence and, therefore, capable of making this call (D. 14, 2, 2 pr.). Nonetheless, they also considered the existence of a deliberative commission, composed by the onboard merchants and passengers, who should be consulted (D. 14, 2, 2, 1). From the doubt whether the intentional act refers to the magister navis or also to the deliberative commission, a game of power unveils, conditioning the lex Rhodia reading. Determining the role played by each one of these characters in the jettison is necessary to know its concept in the Justinian period and help to comprehend this aspect in the posterior Admiralty Law tradition...|$|E
40|$|According to the Labour Code of 1974 the {{employment}} relationship is an obligation between a single employee and an employer. The basis {{of such a}} relationship is {{the employment}} contract concluded with each employee separately. The Polish labour legislation does not provide for the institution of so-called group employment relationships concluded by several people jointly {{on the one hand}} and an employer on the other. However, such contracts appear in connection with a new trend of introducing in state enterprises so-called group forms of work organization. By virtue of such contracts, a voluntarily established group of people assumes the obligation of performing jointly a given production task for a stated remuneration which is later divided among the members of a group by the independent decision of the whole group. According to the majority opinion of legal scholars, such contracts are not a legally separate type of contracts but are in fact only a sum of so-called „autonomous clauses", i. e. contractual stipulations which complement the contents of employment contracts concluded by an employer with each individual member of a group. The author criticizes the above view and tries to prove that the basis of employing in a group system of work is a separate contract for collective labour which may be characterized as an innominate contract concluded between an employer {{on the one hand and}} a group of employees on the other. The above contract is a source of a so-called joint obligation on the part of the members of a group. The said contract is not the employment contract yet it contains elements typical for a contract of employment as well as a contract for performing a specified task or work and — with respect to relations between the members of a group — elements similar to those appearing in the partnership contract. A complex structure of those group contracts indicates that they are mixed contracts (a type of innominate contracts) imposing the obligation to achieve a stated effect and burdening the employment with a part of the risk to carry out that task. Since the employment contract components prevail, the said contracts are subject to the labour law regulation. Hence, the members of a group enjoy full protection granted by the labour law to people employed by virtue of contracts falling under the Labour Code provisions. The author postulates to adopt the provisions regulating the said type of innominate contracts in the amendments to the Labour Code. In his way a new type of a contract — a contract for rendering collective work — would appear in the Polish labour law. The author agrees in principle that it is high time to break away from a stereotype of the employment contract as a due diligence contract (locatio conducilo operarum), radically different from a contract for performing a specified task or work (<b>locatio</b> <b>conductio</b> operis). The elimination of differences between those two kinds of contracts finds justification in the world trends to make the labour law more flexible in response to the incoming „third wave" of the civilization of our epoch.
