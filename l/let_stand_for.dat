In a study performed at North Carolina State University, the amount of lead migration was measured for port wine stored in lead crystal decanters.After two days, lead levels were 89 µg/L (micrograms per liter). After four months, lead levels were between 2,000 and 5,000 µg/L.White wine doubled its lead content {{within an hour of}} storage and tripled it within four hours.

40|$|AbstractLignocellulosic materials, such as {{agricultural}} residues, {{are abundant}} renewable resources for bioconversion to sugars. The {{sugar cane bagasse}} was studied here to obtain simple sugars {{for the production of}} alcohols and other chemicals. The crystalline structure of cellulose and the lignin that physically seals the surrounding cellulose fibers makes enzymatic hydrolysis difficult by preventing the contact between the cellulose and the enzyme. Two different samples of sugar cane (bagasse pulp and skin) were used and compared with microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel). The investigated samples were pretreated with SC-CO 2 explosion before hydrolysis. The experiments were conducted at 12, 14 and 16 MPa at a temperature of 60 °C. In this process, particles of celluloses within the size range from 0. 25 to 0. 42 mm were placed in defined amounts inside the experimental vessel, CO 2 was injected and <b>let</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> 5 and 60 min.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{extraction}} of pituitary gonadotropins utilizing attapulgite and acetone is presented and {{compared with the}} kaolin-acetone (Edinburg) method. The atta-pulgite-acetone extracts contained less inert material and were less toxic. The results of over 100 consecutive clinical assays are presented and analyzed. OF THE VARIOUS METHODS available for tile extraction of pituitary gonatropins from urine, {{the most widely used}} are based upon absorption on kaolin. Most prominent are the kaolin-acetone (Edinburg) method (8), kaolin-acetone (Geneva) (1, 3), benzoic acid-tungstic acid (4), tan-nic acid (6), ethanol precipitation and dialysis (7), and attapulgite by column-ethanol (11). In preliminary experiments we noted that much less inert material was carried through analysis with attapulgite extraction than with kaolin. We therefore thought it worthwhile to develop a method of ex-traction utilizing attapulgite and some of the more desirable features of other methods. The bioassay which we used was essentially the mouse uterus assay (5). Over 100 consecutive clinical specimens were assayed by the new attapulgite-acetone procedure and tile results analyzed statistically according to Borth (2). Methods Our new method was compared with the classical Edinburg kaolin-acetone procedure omitting the purification on tricalcium phosphate. In our hands the tricalcium-phosphate step gave aberrant results. Perhaps this was due to our commercial source of tricalcium phosphate.
