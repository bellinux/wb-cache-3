5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a <b>low-fat</b> product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E
5|$|In Asia, {{the normal}} diet {{includes}} rice and noodles {{as the main}} energy source, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians, will not eat root vegetables or avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The <b>low-fat,</b> high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, {{they appear to be}} just as effective.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers and {{academics}} have conducted studies and experiments {{in an effort}} to improve the stretchiness, melting characteristics, browning, fat content and water retention of pizza cheese. Several patents exist for specialized varieties of pizza cheese and for its processing. A study by Rudan and Barbano found that the addition of a thin layer of vegetable oil atop low- and reduced-fat pizza cheese increased meltability and reduced browning and dehydration when the product was cooked, but the texture remained overly chewy and tough. A study by Perry et al. found various methods to heighten the melt of <b>low-fat</b> pizza cheese by increasing its moisture, including the use of pre-acidification, fat-replacers, and exopolysaccharide starter cultures as well as higher pasteurization temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandwich}} {{has a high}} {{sodium and}} fat content, and has been specifically targeted by UK café chains {{in an effort to}} reduce salt and fat. Due to this, <b>low-fat</b> mayonnaise is a common substitute along with low salt bread and less fatty bacon. In 2009, seven large cafe chains in the UK made a commitment to reducing salt and fat through similar substitutions. A more visible solution is to use turkey bacon in lieu of normal bacon. One of the variations on the BLT is the club sandwich, a two-layered sandwich in which one layer is a BLT. The other layer can be almost any sort of sliced meat, normally chicken or turkey.|$|E
5|$|Burger King's supply {{contracts}} for non-carbonated beverages are {{separate from the}} ones for its sodas. When the company first chose to introduce a bottled water product, it chose Nestlé's Poland Spring brand over Coke's Dasani. When the contract expired in 2003, BK moved to Pepsi's Aquafina, the top-selling brand at the time. In 2008 Burger King renewed its relationship with Nestlé by entering into an agreement to sell Pure Life bottled water products. BK moved away from Pepsi's Tropicana brand juices in 2001 when it went with Coca-Cola's Minute Maid brands for the North America market. With the introduction of its Positive Steps nutrition program for children, the company turned to the Hershey Company to provide Hershey's branded <b>low-fat</b> milk in its North American stores. BK is utilizing a popular brand name to promote its products in a move to draw customers' attention to itself and its meal programs.|$|E
5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and <b>low-fat</b> diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Weight loss diets that {{manipulate}} {{the proportion of}} macronutrients (<b>low-fat,</b> low-carbohydrate, etc.) {{have been shown to}} be more effective than diets that maintain a typical mix of foods with smaller portions and perhaps some substitutions (e.g. <b>low-fat</b> milk, or less salad dressing). Extreme diets may, in some cases, lead to malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|Lower sugar intake — American <b>low-fat</b> and no-fat foods often contain high {{concentrations}} of sugar. French diets avoid these products preferring full-fat versions without added sugar.|$|E
25|$|Dietary {{influences}} {{have been}} examined for decades with conflicting results and have so far failed to confirm any significant link. One recent study suggests that <b>low-fat</b> diets may significantly decrease {{the risk of breast}} cancer as well as the recurrence of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Diet Coke Float and Coke Float – In 1991 McDonald's ran {{a limited}} time {{promotion}} selling a float made with Diet Coke or Coke with <b>low-fat</b> soft-serve frozen yogurt in a collectable Coke bell glass. It sold for $1.59 with 40 cents from every sale donated to Ronald McDonald Children's Charities.|$|E
25|$|During his incarceration {{between the}} second and third trials, Alcala wrote and self-published a book, You, the Jury, in which he claimed innocence in the Samsoe case and {{suggested}} a different suspect. He also filed two lawsuits against the California penal system, for a slip-and-fall incident and for refusing to provide him a <b>low-fat</b> diet.|$|E
25|$|A diet high in {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Evidence suggests that the Mediterranean diet may improve cardiovascular results. There is also evidence that a Mediterranean diet may be better than a <b>low-fat</b> diet in bringing about long-term changes to cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., lower cholesterol level and blood pressure).|$|E

Tower Dining offers six {{different}} dining options, including special dietary menus such as vegetarian and <b>low-fat.</b>|$|E
25|$|To clarify whether CRP is a {{bystander}} or {{active participant}} in atherogenesis, a 2008 study compared people with various genetic CRP variants. Those with a high CRP due to genetic variation had no increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those with a normal or low CRP. A study published in 2011 shows that CRP is associated with lipid responses to <b>low-fat</b> and high-polyunsaturated fat diets.|$|E
25|$|According to Roche, {{side effects}} are most severe when {{beginning}} therapy and may decrease in frequency with time; this {{is supported by}} the results of the XENDOS study, which found that 36% of people had gastrointestinal adverse effects during their fourth year of taking orlistat, whereas 91% of study subjects had experienced at least one GI-related side effect {{during the first year of}} treatment. It has also been suggested that the decrease in side effects over time may be associated with long-term compliance with a <b>low-fat</b> diet.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. federal {{government}} document Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 recommends consumption of three glasses of fat-free or <b>low-fat</b> milk {{for adults and}} children 9 and older (less for younger children) per day. This recommendation is disputed by some health researchers who call for more study of the issue, given {{that there are other}} sources for calcium and vitamin D. The researchers also claim that the recommendations have been unduly influenced by the American dairy industry, and that whole milk may be better for health due to its increased ability to satiate hunger.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things to take into consideration when either trying to lose or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy your body is using every day, so that your intake fits the needs of one's personal weight goal. Someone wanting to lose weight would want a smaller energy intake than what they put out. There is increasing research-based evidence that <b>low-fat</b> vegetarian diets consistently lead to healthy weight loss and management, a decrease in diabetic symptoms as well as improved cardiac health.|$|E
25|$|Research {{funded by}} the U.S. National Institutes of Health {{has shown that the}} average Adventist in California lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian. The research, as cited by the cover story of the November 2005 issue of National Geographic, asserts that Adventists live longer because they do not smoke or drink alcohol, have a day of rest every week, and {{maintain}} a healthy, <b>low-fat</b> vegetarian diet that is rich in nuts and beans. The cohesiveness of Adventists' social networks has also been put forward as an explanation for their extended lifespan.|$|E
25|$|As Vice President and Director of the National Health Promotion Program of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation from 1988-1991, he and {{his staff}} {{developed}} a community development strategy for grant making called the Social Reconnaissance method. Elements of this were adopted by other foundations after it was featured in Foundation News and won the Foundation Award of the Association of Prevention Professionals. A national media campaign organized by his staff, called Project LEAN (<b>Low-fat</b> Eating for America Now), won awards and helped launch many of the industry-professional collaborations that have contributed to the reduction of dietary fat in the American food supply.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{formulation}} for commercially made mayonnaise (not low fat) {{can contain}} {{as much as}} 80% vegetable oil, usually soybean but sometimes olive oil. Water makes up about 7% to 8% and egg yolks about 6%. Some formulas use whole eggs instead of just yolks. The remaining ingredients include vinegar (4%), salt (1%), and sugar (1%). <b>Low-fat</b> formulas will typically decrease oil content to just 50% and increase water content to about 35%. Egg content is reduced to 4% and vinegar to 3%. Sugar is increased to 1.5% and salt lowered to 0.7%. Gums or thickeners (4%) are added to increase viscosity, improve texture, and ensure a stable emulsion.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that prediabetes is a curable disease state. Intensive weight loss and lifestyle intervention, if sustained, may improve glucose tolerance substantially and prevent progression from IGT to type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study found a 16% reduction in diabetes risk for every kilogram of weight loss. Reducing weight by 7% through a <b>low-fat</b> diet and performing 150 minutes of exercise a week is the goal. In observational studies, individuals following vegetarian diets are about half as likely to develop diabetes, compared with non-vegetarians. The ADA guidelines recommend modest weight loss (5-10% body weight), moderate-intensity exercise (30 minutes daily), and smoking cessation.|$|E
25|$|On December 13, 2010, President Obama {{signed the}} Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010 (effective in 2014) that {{mandates}} schools that receive federal funding to offer healthy snacks and beverages to students. The act bans {{the selling of}} soft drinks to students and requires schools to provide healthier options such as water, unflavored <b>low-fat</b> milk, 100% fruit and vegetable drinks or sugar-free carbonated beverages. The portion sizes available to students {{will be based on}} age: eight ounces for elementary schools, twelve ounces for middle and high schools. Proponents of the act predict the new mandate it {{will make it easier for}} students to make healthy beverage choices while at school.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} focused on diets that reduce {{calories}} via a low-carbohydrate (Atkins diet, Scarsdale diet, Zone diet) diet versus a <b>low-fat</b> diet (LEARN diet, Ornish diet). The Nurses' Health Study, an observational cohort study, found that low carbohydrate diets based on vegetable sources of fat and protein are associated with less coronary heart disease. The same study also found no correlation (with multivariate adjustment) between animal fat intake and coronary heart disease (table 4). A long term study that monitored 43,396 Swedish women however suggests that a low carbohydrate-high protein diet, used on a regular basis and without consideration of the nature of carbohydrates or the source of proteins, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|After observing in {{southern}} Italy the highest concentration of centenarians in the world, Keys hypothesized that a Mediterranean-style diet low in animal fat protected {{against heart disease}} and that a diet high in animal fats led to heart disease. The results of what later {{became known as the}} Seven Countries Study appeared to show that serum cholesterol was strongly related to coronary heart disease mortality both at the population and at the individual level. As a result, in 1956 representatives of the American Heart Association appeared on television to inform people that a diet which included large amounts of butter, lard, eggs, and beef would lead to coronary heart disease. This resulted in the American government recommending that people adopt a <b>low-fat</b> diet in order to prevent heart disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} cuisine of Ivory Coast is {{very similar}} to that of neighboring countries in West Africa in its reliance on grains and tubers. Cassava and plantains are significant parts of Ivorian cuisine. A type of corn paste called aitiu is used to prepare corn balls, and peanuts are widely used in many dishes. Attiéké is a popular side dish in Ivory Coast made with grated cassava and is a vegetable-based couscous. A common street food is alloco, which is ripe banana fried in palm oil, spiced with steamed onions and chili and eaten alone or with grilled fish. Chicken is commonly consumed and has a unique flavor due to its lean, <b>low-fat</b> mass in this region. Seafood includes tuna, sardines, shrimp, and bonito, which is similar to tuna. Mafé is a common dish consisting of meat in a peanut sauce.|$|E
25|$|Secondary vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{is associated}} with chronic malabsorption of lipids, impaired bile production and release, and chronic exposure to oxidants, such as cigarette smoke, and chronic alcoholism. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin and depends on micellar solubilization for dispersion into the small intestine, which results in poor use of vitamin A from <b>low-fat</b> diets. Zinc deficiency can also impair absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamin A because {{it is essential for}} the synthesis of the vitamin A transport proteins and as the cofactor in conversion of retinol to retinal. In malnourished populations, common low intakes of vitamin A and zinc increase the severity of vitamin A deficiency and lead physiological signs and symptoms of deficiency. A study in Burkina Faso showed major reduction of malaria morbidity with combined vitamin A and zinc supplementation in young children.|$|E
25|$|The two eland {{species are}} now semi-domesticated as their docile dispositions, large {{quantities}} of meat, and resilience in Africa's harsh environments has made them ideal alternatives to cattle in some parts in Africa. In a 2014 comparison between the quality of meat from common eland and cattle, {{it was found that}} the meat from male elands was <b>low-fat</b> and more beneficial for human nutritional health but it lacks the sensory texture and flavor that makes cattle meat so appealing to consumers. In addition to being on farm as exotic lifestock, eland as well as the other species of spiral-horned antelope have also been brought to private game reserves across the planet (in particular parts in North America and Africa) for recreational hunting. Unlike eland however, most of the other species are not as docile or tolerant of humans as they avoid any contact as possible.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the United States Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee {{recommended}} that Americans eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible. Increased dietary intake of industrial trans fats {{is associated with}} an increased risk in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular diseases. Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL while increasing levels of LDL. Based on such evidence and evidence implicating low HDL and high LDL levels in cardiovascular disease (see Hypercholesterolemia), many health authorities advocate reducing LDL-cholesterol through changes in diet in addition to other lifestyle modifications. Rats subjected to high-fat or fructose diets became dyslipidemic. However, well designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials investigating patient-relevant outcomes of <b>low-fat</b> diets for otherwise healthy people with hypercholesterolaemia are lacking. Moreover, for familial hypercholesterolaemia, large, parallel, randomized controlled trials are still needed to investigate the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering diet and the addition of omega-3 fatty acids, soya protein, plant sterols or stanols.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{standing}} for 12 to 24 hours, fresh milk {{has a tendency}} to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger, <b>low-fat</b> milk layer. The cream often is sold as a separate product with its own uses. Today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators. The fat globules rise {{to the top of a}} container of milk because fat is less dense than water. The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. In fact, the cream rises in cow's milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins. These clusters rise faster than individual globules can. The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks.|$|E
25|$|Dietary and {{nutritional}} choices affect sleep duration and quality. Research is being conducted {{in an attempt}} to discover what kinds of nutritional choices result in better sleep quality. A study in the Western Journal of Nursing Research in 2011 compared how sleep quality was affected by four different diets: a high-protein diet, a high-fat diet, a high-carbohydrate diet, and a control diet. Results indicated that the diets high in protein resulted in fewer wakeful episodes during night-time sleep. The high carbohydrate diet was linked to much shorter periods of quiescent or restful sleep. These results suggest that ingested nutrients do play a role in determining sleep quality. Another investigation published in Nutrition Research in 2012 examined the effects of various combinations of dietary choices in regard to sleep. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} one perfect diet for sleep enhancement, this study indicated that a variety of micro and macro nutrients are needed to maintain levels of healthful and restful sleep. A varied diet containing fresh fruits and vegetables, <b>low-fat</b> proteins, and whole grains can be the best nutritional option for individuals seeking to improve the quality of their sleep.|$|E
500|$|Switching from {{saturated}} {{fatty acids}} to carbohydrates with high glycemic index values shows a statistically-significant increase {{in the risk of}} myocardial infarction. Other {{studies have shown that the}} risk of developing coronary heart disease is decreased by adopting a diet high in polyun{{saturated fatty acids}} but low in sugar, whereas a <b>low-fat,</b> high-carbohydrate diet brings no reduction. This suggests that consuming a diet with a high glycemic load typical of the [...] "junk food" [...] diet is strongly associated with an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease.|$|E
500|$|A <b>low-fat</b> pudding, Grandma Plopwell's, is {{the sponsor}} of a Springfield contest that {{promises}} a luxurious {{trip to the}} most disgusting and dimwitted contest participant in town. Many Springfield residents enter the contest, but things do not go well {{when one of the}} judges, Rainier Wolfcastle, declares himself the winner for [...] "being seen with you freaks". The contest ends in a riot and Lisa ends up hit in the face twice with pudding. She denounces Springfield for its anti-intellectualism in an open letter that ends up in the newspaper, which no one reads. This impresses the Springfield Mensa chapter, which accepts her for membership after Principal Skinner shared her placement tests and she brought them a pie for their latest meeting.|$|E
500|$|To address {{concerns}} over the increase in childhood obesity in Western nations and accusations of unhealthy offerings for children by {{groups such as the}} Center for Science in the Public Interest, the company created a nutritional program called [...] "BK Positive Steps" [...] that is aimed at children and their families. The program began with the introduction of products such as broiled Chicken Tenders, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, and apple [...] "fries", which are French cut apples served in a fry box that are featured in a new <b>low-fat</b> Kid's Club Meal. According to a statement by Burger King, the new Kid's Club meals contain no more than 560 calories per meal, less than 30 percent of calories from fat, less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, no added trans fats, and no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugars. Additional changes to its menu were announced in May 2009, including the reduction of sodium levels in its Chicken Tenders product by approximately 33 percent; a switch to non-fat milk products in the U.S.; and adding calcium-fortified apple juice to its beverage line-up. The broiled Chicken Tenders product is only sold in the UK/Ireland market. The product line has been expanded to include a boiled mini chicken sandwich for the kid's meals in this region.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{study showed}} no {{contribution}} of dietary fat intake on {{the incidence of}} breast cancer in over 300,000 women.
