This is done by adapting myocardial cells to <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> inflow and by activating glycolysis; the heart eventually begins using glycolysis instead of beta oxidation during real life ischaemic conditions. This reduces oxidative stress on cells, formation of cytotoxic products of fatty acid oxidation and subsequent cellular damage.

40|$|Importance of project: A sweet {{hazelnut}} flavor, a pliant texture, and large, {{evenly distributed}} 2 ̆ 2 eyes 2 ̆ 2 characterize high quality Swiss of Emmenthaler cheese. The typical sweet flavor is chiefly due to bacteria which produce propionic acid, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. The eyes are formed from the gas, mainly carbon dioxide, produced by {{these and other}} bacteria. Krett and Stine (20) {{have found that the}} <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> content of a Swiss cheese generally indicates its quality. A study of factors which may influence the amount and ratios of the volatile acids should be helpful in determining manufacturing and curing procedures which will give a fine flavored product. Purpose of investigation Commercially, Swiss cheese is usually made from raw or heat-treated milk. Experimentally, hydrogen peroxide treated milk has shown some promise. A comparison of these three milk treatments was made to determine the effect they have on the volatile fatty acid content and cheese quality. Some successful cheesemakers add no prepared cultures of propionic acid bacteria (Propionibacterium shermanii); some add small amounts, while others advocate larger inoculums. Cheese in this experiment was made with varying amounts of added Propionibacterium shermanii culture to study the relationship to the <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> content, eye formation, and quality.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that {{bacterial}} fermentation of cellulose in the rumen is associated with the production of a mixture of <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> methane and carbon dioxide. It was first shown by Pringsheim (1912) and later confirmed by Woodman & Stewart (1928) that the addition of toluene to thermophilic cultures of cellulose-splitting bacteria resulted in the accumulation of glucose, and Woodman (1930) suggested that glucose was the product that was of nutritional value to the animal. Broadly speaking, theories regarding digestion of cellulose fall into two categories; those that emphasize the importance of the chemical products of fermentation, glucose and the <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> and those that regard the food eaten by the animal as a substrate upon which the organisms of the rumen thrive, the bacteria and Protozoa forming the end-product which is subsequently digested by the sheep. Pochon (1935, 1938) put forward an ingenious explanation which belongs to the first school of thought; he isolated a cellulose-splitting organism which he named Plectridiwn cellulolytiam from the rumen of the ox and found that if the pH of the medium in which active cellulose fermentation was proceeding was reduced to 4, glucose accumulated. This change is similar to that which occurs when ingesta pas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Fish oils are {{abundant}} in polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n- 3 series (in particular eicosapen-taenoic, 20 : 5 and docosahexaenoic acid, 22 : 6). Such fatty acids are {{generally considered to}} be beneficial in the pre-vention of cardiac disease and to have anti-inflammatory properties. Neutrophil adherence is an essential early event in an acute inflammatory response, and we have demonstrated that both 20 : 5 and 22 : 6 stimulate adher-ence in vitro. Arachidonic acid (20 : 4, n- 6) was also stimulatory. Significant stimulation of adherence was seen from 5 to 80 tM (nontoxic concentrations) 22 : 6, 20 : 5, or 20 : 4. At the <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations tested (40 tM) 20 : 5 was less active than 22 : 6 or 20 : 4 at stimulating adherence. Above 40 tM there was no differ-ence in the ability of the three fatty acids to stimulate ad-herence. At the <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations tested (10 sM) 22 : 6 was less active than 20 : 4, whereas above 10 ptM they were equally active. Immunofluorescent flow cytometric analysis of neutrophil integrin (adherence) receptors showed that the complement C 3 bi receptor (CD 11 b) was up-regulated by these fatty acids. There was no change in CD 11 a or CD 11 c. Saturated fatty acids of the same chain length were without effect on adherence or receptor expression. The findings suggest that these poly-unsaturated fatty acids may, under certain conditions, be proinflammatory with respect to their acute effects on the interaction of neutrophils with microbes, endothelium...|$|E

The L-form, which was derived from Ps. aeruginosa IFO 3455 by treatment with EDTA-lysozyme, was comprised of 71. 5 % phospholipids(PL), 5. 3 % glycolipids(GL) and 23. 2 % neutral lipids(NL).

40|$|The obesity {{epidemic}} {{has led to}} {{an increased}} incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes. AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk) regulates energy homeostasis and is activated by cellular stress, hormones and the widely prescribed type 2 diabetes drug metformin 1, 2. Ampk phosphorylates mouse acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acc 1; refs. 3, 4) at Ser 79 and Acc 2 at Ser 212, inhibiting the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. The latter metabolite is a precursor in fatty acid synthesis 5 and an allosteric inhibitor of fatty acid transport into mitochondria for oxidation 6. To test the physiological impact of these phosphorylation events, we generated mice with alanine knock-in mutations in both Acc 1 (at Ser 79) and Acc 2 (at Ser 212) (Acc double knock-in, AccDKI). Compared to wild-type mice, these mice have elevated lipogenesis and <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation, which contribute to the progression of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and NAFLD, but not obesity. Notably, AccDKI mice made obese by high-fat feeding are refractory to the lipid-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of metformin. These findings establish that inhibitory phosphorylation of Acc by Ampk is essential for the control of lipid metabolism and, in the setting of obesity, for metformin-induced improvements in insulin action...|$|E

For this reason, the waste was fed in a concentrated form. The intensity of dry biogas production was 6. 44 mN 3 m− 3 d− 1 with the average methane content of 55. 1 vol% at the average load of 8. 23 kgVS m− 3 d− 1 during 203 days and the average hydraulic retention time of 148 days.

40|$|The {{community}} {{structure of}} pink-colored microbial mats naturally occurring in a swine wastewater ditch was studied by culture-independent biomarker and molecular methods {{as well as}} by conventional cultivation methods. The wastewater in the ditch contained acetate and propionate as the major carbon nutrients. Thin-section electron microscopy revealed that the microbial mats were dominated by rod-shaped cells containing intracytoplasmic membranes of the lamellar type. Smaller numbers of oval cells with vesicular internal membranes were also found. Spectroscopic analyses of the cell extract from the biomats showed the presence of bacteriochlorophyll a and carotenoids of the spirilloxanthin series. Ubiquinone- 10 was detected as the major quinone. A clone library of the photosynthetic gene, pufM, constructed from the bulk DNA of the biomats showed that all of the clones were derived from members of the genera Rhodobacter and Rhodopseudomonas. The dominant phototrophic bacteria from the microbial mats were isolated by cultivation methods and identified as being of the genera Rhodobacter and Rhodopseudomonas by studying 16 S rRNA and pufM gene sequence information. Experiments of oxygen uptake with <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> revealed that the freshly collected microbial mats and the Rhodopseudomonas isolates had a wider spectrum of carbon utilization and a higher affinity for acetate than did the Rhodobacter isolates. These results demonstrate that the microbial mats were dominated by the purple nonsulfur bacteria of the genera Rhodobacter and Rhodopseudomonas, and the bioavailability of <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in wastewater is a key factor allowing the formation of visible microbial mats with these phototrophs...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{accumulation}} of fatty acids and their derivatives can impair insulin-stimulated glucose disposal by skeletal muscle. To characterize {{the nature of}} the defects in lipid metabolism and to evaluate the effects of thiazolidinedione treatment, we analyzed the levels of triacylglycerol, long-chain fatty acyl-coA, malonyl-CoA, fatty acid oxidation, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, and fatty acid transport proteins in muscle biopsies from nondiabetic lean, obese, and type 2 subjects before and after an euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp as well as pre 9 ̆ 6 and post 9 ̆ 63 -month rosiglitazone treatment. We observed that low AMPK and high ACC activities resulted in elevation of malonyl-CoA levels and <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation rates. These conditions, along with the basal higher expression levels of fatty acid transporters, led {{accumulation of}} long-chain fatty acyl-coA and triacylglycerol in insulin-resistant muscle. During the insulin infusion, muscle fatty acid oxidation was reduced to a greater extent in the lean compared with the insulin-resistant subjects. In contrast, isolated muscle mitochondria from the type 2 subjects exhibited a greater rate of fatty acid oxidation compared with the lean group. All of these abnormalities in the type 2 diabetic group were reversed by rosiglitazone treatment. In conclusion, these studies have shown that elevated malonyl-CoA levels and decreased fatty acid oxidation are key abnormalities in insulin-resistant muscle, and, in type 2 diabetic patients, thiazolidinedione treatment can reverse these abnormalities...|$|E

To analyze its molecular basis, we analyzed protein expression of {{low and high}} flow samples (300 mg, 150 % of mean MBF, each n= 30) of six beagle dogs by 2 -D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (380 +/- 78 spots/gel). In low flow samples, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH 1) was increased greatly (+ 377 %, compared with high flow samples). This increase resulted in a 75 % reduction of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), the potent endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase, whereas eNOS showed no difference. Low flow samples exhibited enhanced expression of GAPDH (+ 89 %) and phosphoglycerate kinase (+ 100 %), whereas hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, electron transfer flavoprotein, myoglobin, and desmin were decreased. Assessing local MBF on different days within 2 weeks revealed {{a high degree of}} MBF stability (r 2 > 0. 79). Thus, stable differences in local MBF are associated with significant differences in local gene and protein expression. In low flow areas, the increased DDAH 1 reduces ADMA concentration and NOS inhibition, which strongly suggests enhanced NO formation. Low flow areas are also characterized by a higher glycolytic and a <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation capacity.

Strong aversions to linoleic acid (conditioned stimulus 100 lM) were generated in both O-M and S 5 B/Pl rats to concentrations as low as 2. 5 lM. Observed strain differences were in contrast to expectations based upon electrophysiological studies previously showing greater fatty acid–induced inhibition of delayed rectifying K+ channels in S 5 B/Pl rats. In the CTA assays, the O-M rats showed aversions at <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations withmore resistance to extinction in brief-access orosensory tests, suggesting that the obesity-prone strain may bemore sensitive in the detection and subsequent avoidance of linoleic acid than the obesity-resistant strain. The independent variable of sex produced even greater differences in the avoidance of linoleic acid following conditioning than the effects of strain. Female rats of both strains were significantly more sensitive to fatty acids, showed greater cross-generalization from linoleic to oleic acid, and showed greater avoidance of linoleic acid than male counterparts. These findings suggest genetic influences on yet to be identified mechanisms potentially within the gustatory system that affect the sensitivity to detect the fatty acid chemicals found in dietary fat during brief-access orosensory testing.

Methods: We tested the hypothesis that human, umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from infants born to obese (Ob-MSC) versus normal weight (NW-MSC) mothers demonstrate altered fatty acid metabolism consistent with adult obesity. In infant MSCs undergoing myogenesis in vitro, we measured cellular lipid metabolism and AMPK activity, AMPK activation in response to cellular nutrient stress, and MSC DNA methylation and mRNA content of genes related to oxidative metabolism. Results: We found that Ob-MSCs exhibit greater lipid accumulation, <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation (FAO), and dysregulation of AMPK activity when undergoing myogenesis in vitro. Further experiments revealed a clear phenotype distinction within the Ob-MSC group where more severe MSC metabolic perturbation corresponded to greater neonatal adiposity and umbilical cord blood insulin levels. Targeted analysis of DNA methylation array revealed Ob-MSC hypermethylation in genes regulating FAO (PRKAG 2, ACC 2, CPT 1 A, SDHC) and corresponding lower mRNA content of these genes. Moreover, MSC methylation was positively correlated with infant adiposity. Conclusions: These data suggest that greater infant adiposity is associated with suppressed AMPK activity and reduced lipid oxidation in MSCs from infants born to mothers with obesity and may be an important, early marker of underlying obesity risk...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} between primary producers and their consumers {{are of particular}} interest for the overall functioning of marine ecosystems. The biochemical composition of the organisms involved affects the efficiency of energy transfer in marine food webs. In addition to top-down control by grazers, bottom-up control of these interactions by primary producers and associated bacteria has recently received more attention. Planktonic copepods selectively feed on older diatom cells, a behaviour regulated by changes in exometabolites around diatoms. To test whether this also applies to benthic copepods, Seminavis robusta cells in lag, exponential and stationary growth phases were biochemically screened, and the diversity of associated bacteria was assessed. The diatoms were subsequently 13 C prelabelled and offered to the harpacticoid copepod Microarthridion littorale in a grazing experiment. Harpacticoid copepods incorporated more carbon from younger diatom cells in the lag growth phase, which might be based on (1) biochemical differences of diatom cells in different growth phases and (2) the bacteria associated with the diatoms. The younger diatom cells were characterised by a higher C:N ratio and more extracellular polymer secretions but a <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> content. The bacterial community on these cells differed from those on cells in the later growth phases. Our results thus suggest that the feeding strategies of benthic harpacticoid copepods {{differ from those of}} calanoid copepods.

A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was performed in adult male rats born from dams fed a low-protein diet during gestation and/or lactation, and subsequently exposed to a Western diet (WD) for 10 wk. Metabolomics was combined with targeted acylcarnitine profiling and analysis of liver gene expression to identify markers of adaptation to WD that influence the phenotype outcome evaluated by body composition analysis.

We have investigated strain-dependent differences in the susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in five commonly used inbred mouse strains (C 57 BL/ 6 J, 129 X 1 /SvJ, BALB/c, DBA/ 2 and FVB/N). Methods: Mice were fed either a low-fat or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. Whole-body energy expenditure and body composition were then determined. Tissues were used to measure markers of mitochondrial metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress and lipid accumulation. Results: BL 6, 129 X 1, DBA/ 2 and FVB/N mice were all susceptible to varying degrees to HFD-induced obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, but BALB/c mice exhibited some protection from these detrimental effects. This protection could not be explained by differences in mitochondrial metabolism or oxidative stress in liver or muscle, or inflammation in adipose tissue. Interestingly, in contrast with the other strains, BALB/c mice did not accumulate excess lipid (triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols) in the liver; this is potentially related to <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> uptake rather than differences in lipogenesis or lipid oxidation.

Linoleic acid and dehydroergosterol compete for the same site, but elicitin affinity is 27 times <b>lower</b> for <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> than for sterol. We show that C 7 to C 12 saturated and C 16 to C 22 unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are the best ligands. The presence of double bonds markedly increases the affinity of cryptogein for <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> A comparison between elicitins and known lipid transfer proteins is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} that lactic acid bacteria may increase the production of free <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> by lipolysis of milk fat, though no studies {{have been found in}} the literature show-ing the effect of kefir grains on the composition of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in milk. In this study the influ-ence of kefir grains from different origins [Rio de Janeiro (AR), Viçosa (AV) e Lavras (AD) ], different time of storage, and different fat content on the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> content of cow milk after fermentation was investigated. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition was determined by gas chromatogra-phy. Values were considered significantly different when p< 0. 05. The highest palmitic acid content, which is antimutagenic compost, was seen in AV grain (36. 6 g/ 100 g <b>fatty</b> <b>acids),</b> which may have contributed to increasing the antimutagenic potential in fermented milk. Higher monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (25. 8 g/ 100 g <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> and <b>lower</b> saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (72. 7 g/ 100 g <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> contents were observed in AV, when compared to other grains, due to higher Δ 9 -desaturase activity (0. 31) that improves the nutritional quality of lipids. Higher oleic acid (25. 0 g/ 100 g <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> and monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (28. 2 g/ 100 g <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> and <b>lower</b> saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (67. 2 g/ 100 g <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> contents were found in stored kefir relatively to fermented kefir leading to possible increase of antimutagenic and anticarcino-genic potential and improvement of nutritional quality of lipids in storage milk. Only high-lipidic matrix displayed increase polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> after fermentation. These find-ings open up new areas of study related to optimizing desaturase activity during fermenta-tion in order to obtaining a fermented product with higher nutritional lipid quality...|$|R

40|$|Globalization {{and global}} market {{have contributed to}} {{increased}} consumption of high-fat, energy-dense diets, particularly rich in saturated fatty acids(SFAs). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) regulate fuel partitioning within the cells by inducing their own oxidation through the reduction of lipogenic gene expression and the enhancement of the expression of those genes controlling lipid oxidation and thermogenesis. Moreover, PUFAs prevent insulin resistance by increasing membrane fluidity and GLUT 4 transport. In contrast, SFAs are stored in non-adipocyte cells as triglycerides (TG) leading to cellular damage as a sequence of their lipotoxicity. Triglyceride accumulation in skeletal muscle cells (IMTG) derives from increased FA uptake coupled with deficient FA oxidation. High levels of circulating FAs enhance the expression of FA translocase the FA transport proteins within the myocites. The biochemical mechanisms responsible for <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation involve reduced carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) activity, as a likely consequence of increased intracellular concentrations of malonyl-CoA; reduced glycogen synthase activity; and impairment of insulin signalling and glucose transport. The depletion of IMTG depots is strictly associated with an improvement of insulin sensitivity, via a reduced acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) mRNA expression and an increased GLUT 4 expression and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. In pancreatic islets, TG accumulation causes impairment of insulin secretion. In rat models, beta-cell dysfunction is related to increased triacylglycerol content in islets, increased production of nitric oxide, ceramide synthesis and beta-cell apoptosis. The decreased insulin gene promoter activity and binding of the pancreas-duodenum homeobox- 1 (PDX- 1) transcription factor to the insulin gene seem to mediate TG effect in islets. In humans, acute and prolonged effects of FAs on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion have been widely investigated {{as well as the}} effect of high-fat diets on insulin sensitivity and secretion and on the development of type 2 diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Formulated feeds for {{cultivated}} abalone {{have received}} considerable attention {{to improve the}} feeding costs, efficiency and productivity of the growing cultivated abalone industry in Australia. Less {{attention has been given}} to the resulting quality of the seafood product from formulated feeds and the effect of the reduction of marine ingredients in these feeds. Marine n- 3 fatty acids are particularly important nutritional factors of seafood that are lacking from feed ingredients {{at the base of the}} aquaculture production chain. Considering that this important category of nutrients is already deficient in the western diet, further erosion through cultivated seafood products is of concern. This study tested the effect of three diet categories on the fatty acid profiles of commercially farmed abalone. Two commercial formulated feeds, Ulva spp. macroalgae, and combinations of the formulated feeds and macroalgae were fed to six replicate baskets of 20 abalone (~ 62  mm) for 12  months in Victoria, Australia. The macroalgae diets represented overall <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> content, including eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA), but higher relative amounts of alpha linolenic acid (ALA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), than the formulated feeds. The total lipid content of abalone tissue did not vary substantially across diet categories; however, the ratio of n- 6 :n- 3 fatty acids decreased incrementally with the increasing macroalgae content in the diet and by a factor of two with a 100  % macroalgae diet. Also, equal or higher content of all important long chain n- 3 fatty acids was achieved with a macroalgae diet despite the lower dietary content of some of these fatty acids. Marine fatty acid-deplete aquaculture feeds can result in decreased n- 3 fatty acid content in the abalone tissue. The inclusion of macroalgae in the diet of abalone can offset this reduction...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} {{was intended to}} establish a reliable value for the gram-ionic mass susceptibility of the ammonium ion, since the values obtained by various workers are not in close agreement. The specific susceptibilities {{of a large number}} of ammonium compounds have been measured, using the modified Gouy method. The molecular mass susceptibility of each compound has been calculated by multiplying the specific susceptibility by the molecular weight, and from the resulting values the correcting constant for anion was subtracted, giving the gram-ionic susceptibility of the ammonium ion in combination with univalent and divalent anions, and in solution. Deviations were found to occur in the two latter cases. A similar procedure has been adopted for the substituted ammonium compounds. Measurements on the ammonium halides in solution, and in the solid crystalline state, show a linear relationship between molecular susceptibility and coordination number, ana mean values of the gram-ionic susceptibility of the sulphate and <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> anions have been found in alkali metal and ammonium salts. Several anionic correcting constants have been proposed-on the basis of the experimental results. A series of susceptibility/atomic number graphs have been plotted, showing the relation between the experimental results and those calculated by theoretical means. In almost every case theory has been confirmed by experiment. The values of bond depressions were found inapplicable in a number of cases, owing to the uncertainty of which of several resonance formulae is the most satisfactory. The gram-atomic susceptibility of the oxygen atom in sulphur- and chromium-oxyacids has been determined, and a mean value of the susceptibility of the CH 2 group agreeing closely with that of Pascal, has been found from several homologous series of compounds. Measurements on electronic and position isomers have confirmed the results of Bhatnagar and his co-workers. <p...|$|E
40|$|Milk fat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of goat milk. Another benefit of goat milk fat is its better digestibility in comparison with cow milk, which is caused by the smaller size of lipid micelles. Goat milk fat contains more <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (caproic, caprylic and capric), which affect the production and processing of milk and cause specific flavor of goat's milk and dairy products. In recent years, the subject of many studies the possibility of increasing the content of other health beneficial <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in goat milk, such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and omega- 3 and omega- 6 polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Animal nutrition is a significant factor how to achieve these changes in the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profile of milk fat. For these purposes can be used as additives for certain species of algae which are the source of nutritionally valuable lipids with a high content of polyene <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> especially omega- 3 and omega- 6 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The ability to change the composition of goat mikl fat, represents an opportunity for the development of new products.

40|$|In recent years, milk {{selection}} in retail stores has expanded. Conventional, rbST-free and organic labeled milk {{are characterized by}} different management practices. The <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition of milk can be modified by manipulating the cow's diet; however {{it is unclear whether}} the milk labeling differences in cow management affect the composition of milk fat. The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition of conventional milk with that labeled as rbST-free or organic. A total of 296 samples were collected in blocks containing conventional, rbST-free and organic milk from retail stores in the 48 contiguous states. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were extracted, methylated, and gas chromatography was used to quantify individual <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Conventional and milk labeled as rbST-free showed no differences in <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition. Organically labeled milk was similar, with minor statistical differences from conventional and rbST-free milk. These differences included greater levels of trans- 11 18 : 1 (vaccenic acid; VA), cis- 9, trans- 11 C 18 : 2 (rumenic acid; RA), as well as greater total saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>lower</b> monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and <b>lower</b> total trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The variation in RA and VA in organic milk was greater as compared to the variation observed for conventional and rbST-free milk samples.

40|$|High {{pressure}} homogenization (HPH) {{was tested}} for inducing autolysis {{in a commercial}} strain of Saccharomyces bayanus for winemaking. The effects on cell viability, the release of soluble proteins, glucidic colloids and amino acids in wine-like medium and the volatile composition of the autolysates were investigated after processing, in comparison with thermolysis. HPH seemed a promising technique for inducing autolysis of wine yeasts. One pass at 150 MPa was the best operating conditions. Soluble colloids, proteins and free amino acids were similar after HPH and thermolysis, but the former gave a more interesting volatile composition after processing, with higher concentrations of ethyl esters (fruity odors) and <b>lower</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (potential off-flavors). This might allow different winemaking applications for HPH, such as the production of yeast derivatives for wine ageing. In the conditions tested, HPH did not allow the complete inactivation of yeast cells; the treatment shall be optimized before winemaking use. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
