40|$|Uncertainty in {{operation}} and maintenance costs of offshore renewable installations can be incurred through failure to properly account for marine conditions. One such area, vessel utilisation scheduling, requires accurate forecasts of wind and wave conditions to minimise charter costs as well as plant downtime. Additionally, fuel usage and auxiliary costs will increase with longer transfer times. Exploiting auxiliary offshore measurement data and its relation to accessibility constraints could reduce idle charter periods by allowing operatives to better anticipate prevailing site conditions. Existing models omit the effect of direction on operations and fail to account for the complex relations between dependent environmental variables which can impact on operations such as crew transfers, <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>jacking</b> operations. In this paper, a methodology for improving the forecasting of offshore conditions through incorporating distributed meteorological and marine observations at multiple timescales is presented. Advancing towards a demonstration of a strategic maintenance approach of this kind will assist in both reducing direct costs and associated initial project finance. The developed model will be beneficial to developers and operators as better forecasting of when conditions are suitable for maintenance could reduce costs, lost earnings and improve mobilisation of vessels and technicians...|$|E

50|$|National and {{international}} standards {{have been developed}} to standardize the safety and performance requirements for <b>jacks</b> <b>and</b> other <b>lifting</b> devices. Selection of the standard is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance {{in the design of the}} jack. In the United States, ASME has developed the Safety Standard for Portable Automotive Service Equipment, last revised in 2014, including requirements for hydraulic hand jacks, transmission jacks, emergency tire changing jacks, service <b>jacks,</b> fork <b>lift</b> <b>jacks,</b> <b>and</b> other <b>lifting</b> devices.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} plant is set {{out as a}} series of platforms connected by lifts. To complete each level, the player must collect all the musical notes while avoiding monsters, moving <b>lifts</b> <b>and</b> stalactites. <b>Jack</b> can be moved left or right using his jet boots to hover or by ducking and sliding under fatal stalactites or monsters. By hovering, Jack can clear lift shafts but if he stops over the shaft, it is fatal. Jack's jet energy runs down, particularly if he stands still for a while, and must be replenished by collecting vinyl from overhanging pods. Two types of monsters can be killed for bonus points by jumping on the platform above them. A third type of monster is invincible. Bonus points are awarded when a screen is completed based on the vinyl refills unused.|$|R
2500|$|Before 1840 {{the firm}} had {{manufactured}} at least two steam engines, the first for Hayward of Yeovil, Somerset and the second for a mill in Glossop, Derbyshire. In that year they were successful in gaining much work {{in the manufacture of}} gas pipes and equipment for gasworks, a new and burgeoning industry. From 1842 until June 1847 the brothers were in partnership, as Galloways & Company, with Joseph Haley, in Manchester and Paris, as [...] "Manufacturers of Patent Screw or <b>Lifting</b> <b>Jacks,</b> <b>and</b> as Patentees of Machines for cutting, punching and compressing Metals, and of the Rivets and other articles constructed by the said last-mentioned Machines... as Cotton Banding Manufacturers". In that month the partnership was dissolved and the Galloways continued to manufacture the machines and rivets in Manchester and Haley continued with the rivets in Paris. By 1856 they had six of these machines in their factory and [...] manufactured two tons of rivets per machine per day, the devices being operated by one man and 20 boys. An example of a wooden-bodied Galloway-Haley lifting jack is in Museo del Ferrocarril (railway museum) in Madrid. The patents were Haley's; for example, patent number 8768 of 31 December 1840 for an improved <b>lifting</b> <b>jack</b> <b>and</b> compressor.|$|R

40|$|Ergonomic job analysis, {{intervention}} design, {{and intervention}} implementation are essential components of an ergonomics {{program designed to}} reduce worker exposure to risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders. As part of a 4 -year study to reduce overexer-tion injuries in the service parts division of a major automaker, intervention case studies were identified {{that could be used}} at multiple facilities across the division. Interventions were developed and implemented. The three case studies include 1) self-elevating powered vehicle for transporting parts throughout the facility and for reaching to high bin loca-tions; 2) <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> tilt pallet <b>jacks</b> for packing small parts into large bin-like containers; and 3) single-level telescoping conveyor used for delivering hand-held totes for subsequent sorting operations. Several analysis methods were used to assess worker exposure before and after intervention implementation (biomechanical analysis, posture analysis, worker interviews, and activity analysis). Following implementation, a decrease in exposure to risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders was documented. Worker interviews revealed accep-tance and agreement that risk factors associated with the targeted tasks were reduced. Each case study includes a description of the implementation hurdles and can serve as both pri...|$|R
5000|$|The diesel shed was in {{reinforced}} concrete and comprised three adjoining buildings. The servicing and maintenance building that covers roads 1-4 {{is on the}} western side of the shed; number 1 road is equipped with a wheel lathe <b>and</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks</b> for bogie changes. The central building was the Heavy Maintenance Shed; engines can be removed and repainting undertaken on the two roads, numbers 5 and 6. The final three roads were in the servicing shed on {{the eastern side of the}} site, where locomotives could be inspected and refuelled. There were covered fuelling points outside in the yard, supplied by a 45,000 gallon fuel tank. A small group of buildings house stores and a workshop for shed equipment and is situated between the main shed and the curve of the Sutton Harbour branch (now realigned to the west of the shed and known locally as the [...] "Speedway"). Carriage washing takes place south of the shed at Mount Gould, alongside the line to Plymouth Friary.|$|R
