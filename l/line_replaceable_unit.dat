40|$|Maintenance {{intervention}} {{is necessary for}} the equipment, such as aircraft structures and systems, to maintain their operational performance status during their lifetime. Generally maintenance costs make a significant contribution to overall operating costs. Accordingly, developing an optimal maintenance strategy to minimize maintenance costs and total lifetime operating cost (TLOC) is a critical task. This article proposes a methodology for the optimization of a reliability-centred maintenance strategy based on maintenance-free operating period (MFOP) philosophy by considering the TLOC. The method can be used to evaluate the TLOC of alternative maintenance strategies and determine the optimal maintenance interval while meeting the proposed reliability requirements. The method is also suitable for evaluating and optimizing the MFOP-based reliability design of the products. An example based on <b>line</b> <b>replaceable</b> <b>unit</b> replacement strategy is introduced to illustrate the proposed maintenance strategy optimization approach.

40|$|Maintenance {{decisions}} concerning {{repair of}} the <b>Line</b> <b>Replaceable</b> <b>Unit</b> (LRU) of an aircraft fleet {{need to be}} considered carefully while deciding the phasing out of the fleet. This is important for achieving higher degree of cost effectiveness and fleet availability at desired level. Discard rate and phasing out period for an aircraft fleet are the critical parameters for determining optimum time to stop the maintenance of LRU. The economic value of remaining useful life of an aircraft fleet should be taken into consideration by salvaging the LRU {{at the end of the}} phasing out. The paper suggests a methodology to arrive the time that will minimize the total life cycle cost and provide us economic basis to withdraw the maintenance resources. A mathematical model has been developed for the discard rate of aircrafts based on failure rate, mission life and remaining useful life of the aircrafts in the fleet. This will assist in fulfilling the managing demand of LRU while phasing out of the aircraft fleet.

40|$|Defective {{capital assets}} may be quickly {{restored}} to their operational condition by replacing the item that has failed. The item that is replaced {{is called the}} <b>Line</b> <b>Replaceable</b> <b>Unit</b> (LRU), and the so-called LRU definition problem {{is the problem of}} deciding on which item to replace upon each type of failure: when a replacement action is required in the field, service engineers can either replace the failed item itself or replace a parent assembly that holds the failed item. One option may be fast but expensive, while the other may take longer but against lower cost. We consider a maintenance organization that services a fleet of assets, so that unavailability due to maintenance downtime may be compensated by acquiring additional standby assets. The objective of the LRU-definition problem is to minimize the total cost of item replacement and the investment in additional assets, given a constraint on the availability of the fleet of assets. We link this problem to the literature. We also present two cases to show how the problem is treated in practice.

40|$|Probabilistic Structural Analysis (PSA) is now {{commonly}} used for predicting {{the distribution of}} time/cycles to failure of turbine blades and other engine components. These distributions are typically based on fatigue/fracture and creep failure modes of these components. Additionally, reliability analysis is used for taking test data related to particular failure modes and calculating failure rate distributions of electronic and electromechanical components. How can these individual failure time distributions of structural, electronic and electromechanical component failure modes be effectively combined into a top level model for overall system evaluation of component upgrades, changes in maintenance intervals, or <b>line</b> <b>replaceable</b> <b>unit</b> (LRU) redesign? This paper shows {{an example of how}} various probabilistic failure predictions for turbine engine components can be evaluated and combined to show their effect on overall engine performance. A generic model of a turbofan engine was modeled using various Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) tools (Quantitative Risk Assessment Software (QRAS) etc.). Hypothetical PSA results for a number of structural components along with mitigation factors that would restrict the failure mode from propagating to a Loss of Mission (LOM) failure were used in the models. The output of this program includes an overall failure distribution for LOM of the system. The rank and contribution to the overall Mission Success (MS) is also given for each failure mode and each subsystem. This application methodology demonstrates the effectiveness of PRA for assessing the performance of large turbine engines. Additionally, the effects of system changes and upgrades, the application of different maintenance intervals, inclusion of new sensor detection of faults and other upgrades were evaluated in determining overall turbine engine reliability...|$|E

40|$|During {{the shuttle}} era NASA {{utilized}} a failure reporting system called the Problem Reporting and Corrective Action (PRACA) it {{purpose was to}} identify and track system non-conformance. The PRACA system over the years evolved from a relatively nominal way to identify system problems to a very complex tracking and report generating data base. The PRACA system became the primary method to categorize any and all anomalies from corrosion to catastrophic failure. The systems documented in the PRACA system range from flight hardware to ground or facility support equipment. While the PRACA system is complex, it does possess all the failure modes, times of occurrence, length of system delay, parts repaired or replaced, and corrective action performed. The difficulty is mining the data then to utilize that data in order to estimate component, <b>Line</b> <b>Replaceable</b> <b>Unit</b> (LRU), and system reliability analysis metrics. In this paper, we identify a methodology to categorize qualitative data from the ground system PRACA data base for common ground or facility support equipment. Then utilizing a heuristic developed for review of the PRACA data determine what reports identify a credible failure. These data are the used to determine inter-arrival times to perform an estimation of a metric for repairable component-or LRU reliability. This analysis is used to determine failure modes of the equipment, determine the probability of the component failure mode, and support various quantitative differing techniques for performing repairable system analysis. The result is that an effective and concise estimate of components used in manned space flight operations.

Equipment level fault isolation expert systems are invoked to isolate the fault to a <b>Line</b> <b>Replaceable</b> <b>Unit</b> (LRU) level.

The system level fault isolation expert system compares the equipment input and output status for a data stream and performs loopback tests (if necessary) to isolate the faulty equipment. The equipment level fault isolation system utilizes the process of elimination and/or the maintenance personnel's fault isolation experience stored in its knowledge base.

40|$|The NASA Shuttle Logistics Depot (NSLD) is {{tasked with}} the {{responsibility}} for repair and manufacture of <b>Line</b> <b>Replaceable</b> <b>Unit</b> (LRU) hardware and components to support the Space Shuttle Orbiter. Due to shrinking budgets, cost effective repair of LRU's becomes a primary objective. To achieve this objective, is imperative that resources be assigned to those LRU's which have the greatest expectation of being needed as a spare. Forecasting the times at which spares are needed requires consideration of many significant factors including: failure rate, flight rate, spares availability, and desired level of support, among others. This paper summarizes {{the results of the}} research and development work that has been accomplished in producing an automated tool that assists in the assignment of effective repair start-times for LRU's at the NSLD. This system, called the Repair Start-time Assessment System (RSAS), uses probabilistic modeling technology to calculate a need date for a repair that considers the current repair pipeline status, as well as, serviceable spares and projections of future demands. The output from the system is a date for beginning the repair that has significantly greater confidence (in the sense that a desired probability of support is ensured) than times produced using other techniques. Since an important output of RSAS is the longest repair turn-around time that will ensure a desired probability of support, RSAS has the potential for being applied to operations at any repair depot where spares are on-hand and repair start-times are of interest. In addition, RSAS incorporates tenants of Just-in-Time (JIT) techniques in that the latest repair start-time (i. e., the latest time at which repair resources must be committed) may be calculated for every failed unit This could reduce the spares inventory for certain items, without significantly increasing the risk of unsatisfied demand...|$|E
