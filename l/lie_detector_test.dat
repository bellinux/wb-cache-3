Jones and Boldizs both gave written statements admitting to have been dating Sharon Kinne and both agreed to lie detector tests; Kinne gave an oral statement to police but declined to sign a written one or take a <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test.</b> Kinne was questioned again {{on the morning of}} May 30, and Boldizs on May 31. The scheduled polygraphs for the two men were performed on June 1, and both men were deemed to have been truthful in their statements.

Shockley, not trusting his employees, was sending their reports to Bell Labs for double-checking.

25|$|In {{a comment}} the {{following}} year on the same thread, Shelby questioned how {{it was that the}} dive shop employees failed to notice his son's truck in the parking lot throughout the day after he was last seen even though it was within their view the whole time. He is further critical of how the Holmes County sheriff's office handled the investigation, saying they should have treated it as a crime scene from the beginning. In particular, he claims, the <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test</b> that Taran passed was inadequate, as it had consisted of only three questions (he says he later learned that a properly administered examination with the device should take over an hour), and that Kelly and Cronin should have been asked to take the test as well.|$|E
25|$|Although the McDaniels {{continue}} to believe Ben's body is {{in an area of}} the cave beyond the reach of current search capabilities, they have also entertained the possibility that his death was not an accident but the result of foul play. A private investigator they hired believes that his body may have been removed before any authorities were contacted, or that he may even have been murdered on land and the narrative of his disappearance fabricated as a cover story. The family believes that the suspicious, supposedly accidental, death of Vortex Spring's owner late in 2011 is related to the case. They have also criticized the local police investigation as inadequate, particularly a <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test</b> passed by the employee who was the last person known to have seen Ben alive.|$|E

He was [...] "handsome in a rather cruel, caddish way—he seemed to exude arrogance and indifference....

And that's if Jeremy Jacobs asks him for another meeting and straightens out the whole situation. Otherwise he's gone." [...] Instead, Orr became a free agent, with Boston to receive compensation. Orr and Eagleson whittled down a list of potential teams to St. Louis and Chicago. Chicago offered a five-year guaranteed contract with the Black Hawks, and on June 8, 1976, he officially signed with the Black Hawks. The Bruins' general manager, Harry Sinden complained of tampering by the Black Hawks, and demanded that Chicago owner Bill Wirtz submit to a <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test.</b> According to documents held by Orr, they had a valid case. Orr signed with the Black Hawks at a secret meeting in May 1976, prior to becoming a free agent.|$|E

500|$|Hartford, Connecticut gangster Robert [...] "Bobby the Cook" [...] Gentile {{has been}} {{suggested}} on multiple occasions as knowing {{the location of the}} Gardner works. In May 2012, FBI agents searched Gentile's home in Manchester, Connecticut. They did not find any stolen works, despite searching his preferred hiding spot beneath a false floor {{with the help of his}} son. However, in the basement, they found a sheet of paper listing what each stolen piece might draw on the black market. In January 2016, the FBI contrived gun charges against Gentile to force him to reveal the location of the missing works. During a hearing, a federal prosecutor revealed significant evidence tying Gentile to the crime. The prosecutor stated that Gentile and mob partner Robert Guarente attempted to use the return of two stolen pieces to reduce a prison sentence for one of their associates. Guarente's wife told investigators in early 2015 that her husband once had possession of some of the art, and gave two paintings to Gentile before Guarente died of cancer in 2004. Also, while in federal prison during 2013–2014, Gentile told at least three people he had knowledge of the stolen art. [...] In 2015, Gentile submitted to a <b>lie</b> <b>detector</b> <b>test,</b> denying advanced knowledge of the heist or ever possessing any paintings. The result showed a 0.1% chance that he was truthful. According to Gentile's lawyer, federal agents are convinced that Gentile has the stolen works. Gentile's home was searched again by the FBI on May 2, 2016, even though his lawyer insists that if Gentile had the stolen artwork or knowledge of its whereabouts, he would have turned it in for the reward money a long time ago. On September 5, 2017, Gentile was scheduled to be sentenced for a separate weapons charge in Connecticut.|$|E
