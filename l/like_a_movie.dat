5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> set, and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately {{arrives at a}} crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player {{hooked up to a}} television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck in some sort of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E
25|$|Actually, {{the stage}} play, as written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E.

The invitation to expansion was hand-engraved in the play. Now {{it has been}} accepted by screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green and by the director, Morton DaCosta, who has reveled in the greater physical range.|$|E
25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He {{was still in his}} mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.|$|E

25|$|Mitigating {{damage to}} the {{environment}} was a concern, as part of creating an authentic experience of the landscape, which was to unroll <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> from the motorist's perspective. The median strip was therefore relatively narrow; trees were retained close to the highway and sometimes, for example in the oak forest near Dessau, in the median. In fact the driver's experience of the forest, assigned symbolic importance in German Romanticism and particularly under the Nazis, was maximized by avoiding straightaways in forested areas so that the driver remained enclosed by the trees as long as possible. To some extent the autobahn landscapers were influenced in this emphasis on the natural environment by the American parkways; Todt had a 1934 USDA bulletin on Roadside Improvement reprinted for his planners' use, and Nazi designers visited Westchester County to study them, {{about the same time}} that the Westchester County Parks Commission (WCPC) was partly overseeing the construction of what is today the Taconic State Parkway's southern stretches. But the Reichsautobahn aimed for a more natural, less parklike view from the road, and although in both countries using natively occurring plants in highway landscaping was important, the Americans selectively emphasized those with an attractive appearance. Also, the autobahn was at the time presented, by Todt and others, as an improvement to the natural landscape; Todt refused to avoid the Siebengebirge, a protected conservation area, arguing not only that the area should be opened up for visits but that the road would make it more beautiful. This was not the policy in the U.S., where, most famously, the Blue Ridge Parkway was designed to be narrow and unobtrusive. Cost had the opposite effect with respect to plantings than it did with respect to curves: the Reichsautobahn landscapers had performed pioneering analyses of local ecosystems that led them to plant intensively in order to reconstruct what they determined would have been naturally present at the site, but at the end of 1936, as a result of cost overruns as well as his personal philosophy, Todt severely curtailed plantings, calling for an emphasis on open views.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by David LaChapelle and shot on March 13 and 14, 2004, in Los Angeles. The lighting was described as [...] "saturated, but low and naturalistic" [...] to give the video a cinematic feel, referencing the 1995 film Leaving Las Vegas. It premiered on TRL on April 12, 2004. Spears called the show and explained the video explored reincarnation. She added, [...] "It's more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie.</b> It's different than anything I've ever done.

500|$|Approximately 75 ethnic, {{social, and}} {{religious}} Chicago organizations {{were asked to}} provide candidates whose faces would be photographed for integration into the fountain. The subjects were chosen from local schools, churches and community groups, and filming began in 2001 at the downtown campus of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). The SAIC students filmed their subjects with a $100,000 high-definition HDW-F900 video camera, the same model used in the production of the three Star Wars prequels. About 20 SAIC students took part in what became an informal master's course in public art for the project. Faculty from Columbia College Chicago was also involved in the production of the video. The high-definition equipment was used because of the scale of the project. [...] Because the image proportions were <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> screen with a width far exceeding its height, the camera was turned on its side during filming.|$|E
500|$|Community Trolls' {{first public}} {{performance}} was busking outside the 40 Watt Club in Athens in September, 1983. On September 30, Community Trolls played a set between two R.E.M. sets at the Stitchcraft in Athens, performing four songs: [...] "Six Stock Answers", [...] "My Roof to Your Roof", [...] "Tainted Obligation" [...] and [...] the Velvet Underground's [...] "Pale Blue Eyes". (R.E.M. biographer Marcus Gray {{believes it is}} likely that footage of the show, including the Trolls' set, was used in Just <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Movie.)</b> Part of R.E.M.'s performance, and the Trolls' four songs, have been released on the R.E.M. bootleg 20th Century Boys Volume 1. Sweet performed with members of R.E.M. at least one other time while he was in Athens: When R.E.M. shared a bill with Oh-OK on October 3, 1983, at the University of Georgia's Legion Field, Sweet joined R.E.M. onstage and played guitar.|$|E

Those with acting roles included Levine, Michael Stipe, Sweet, Hopper, Lynda Stipe, and R.E.M.'s Bill Berry.

500|$|Writer Steven Moffat {{stated that}} he wanted an [...] "epic" [...] quality to the Christmas special.

[...] Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen {{at the onset of the}} episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor (William Hartnell) in 1963 and the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) in 2005. He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s, but rejected by the production team at the time. Continuing the theme introduced with the series' first five episodes, [...] "The Snowmen" [...] was promoted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie.</b> A movie poster was released in the Radio Times, showing the Doctor and Clara ascending the ladder to the TARDIS.|$|E

The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special... She was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> star, right then and there...

She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike older {{game shows}} whose sets are or were {{designed}} to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, Millionaires set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> thriller than a typical quiz show. The floor is made of Plexiglas beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper. Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs {{in the center of}} the stage, known as [...] "Hot Seats"; these measured [...] high, were modeled after chairs typically found in hair salons, and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to Millionaire, Vieira stated in an interview with her Millionaire predecessor on his morning talk show that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by James Dooley, Bryan [...] "Brain" [...] Mantia, the New Orleans band Galactic, and Jonathan Mayer. All {{of the music}} was recorded live {{with a total of}} four hours of music being recorded. Starting from the first day of recording, the music was composed in a year. Many of the music's sounds were produced unconventionally, with some of the largest percussion coming from things such as fingernails on an amplified tin plate. Collaboration was considered a major part of writing the music, with the composers [...] "ripping each other off." [...] Themes were composed for the main characters, such as Cole and Nix. A dynamic music system was developed for non-mission gameplay. The game would track a music tension value with thresholds set to determine what the music would be. While missions used the dynamic music system too, the music was laid out more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> with set music occurring for specific events. The music of the game was inspired by the city, meant to be [...] "organic" [...] compared to the industrial and electronic music of the first Infamous.

It remakes {{a scene from the}} film Basic Instinct (1992), referred to by Natalie More of In These Times as an infamous scene. Knowles wears a white skirt and turtleneck to emulate Sharon Stone. She told Elysa Gardner of USA Today that she considered the video to be a movie scene; [...] "I put six months aside, worked with a coach for two months. And that carried through to my music. I treated the video for 'Ring the Alarm' <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> scene. I was thinking, 'I've got to make my acting coach proud." [...] The video premiered at Yahoo! Music on August 16, 2006 and was released to US iTunes Store on November 21, 2006. It debuted on MTV's Total Request Live at number ten on August 22, 2006, reached number one, and remained on the show for thirty-five days until it was replaced by the music video for [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] (2006).

500|$|Before {{the end of}} 1971, the Kinks {{signed a}} five-album deal with RCA Records and {{received}} a million-dollar advance, which helped fund the construction of their own recording studio, Konk. Their debut for RCA, Muswell Hillbillies, was replete with the influence of music hall and traditional American musical styles, including country and bluegrass. It is often hailed as their last great record, {{though it was not}} as successful as its predecessors. It was named after Muswell Hill, where the Davies brothers were brought up, and contained songs focusing on working-class life and, again, the Davies' childhood. Muswell Hillbillies, despite positive reviews and high expectations, peaked at number 48 on the Record World chart and number 100 on the Billboard chart. It was followed in 1972 by a double album, Everybody's in Show-Biz, which consisted of both studio tracks and live numbers recorded during a two-night stand at Carnegie Hall. The record featured the ballad [...] "Celluloid Heroes" [...] and the Caribbean-themed [...] "Supersonic Rocket Ship", their last UK Top 20 hit for more than a decade. [...] "Celluloid Heroes" [...] is a bitter-sweet rumination on dead and fading Hollywood stars (Mickey Rooney was still alive), in which the narrator declares that he wishes his life were <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> [...] "because celluloid heroes never feel any pain ... and celluloid heroes never really die." [...] The album was moderately successful in the United States, peaking at number 47 in Record World and number 70 in Billboard. It marks the transition between the band's early 1970s rock material and the theatrical incarnation in which they immersed themselves for the next four years.|$|E

[...] Variety's Brian Lowry praised the show for returning network HBO to top form, saying [...] "This is, quite simply, television at its finest, occupying a sweet spot that—for all the able competition—still remains unique to HBO: An expensive, explicit, character-driven program, tackling material no broadcast network or movie studio would dare touch... For those wondering when the channel would deliver another franchise to definitively put it on top of the world, Ma, the wait is over: Go directly to [...] "Boardwalk."" [...] "One of the unexpected joys of [...] "Boardwalk Empire," [...] though, lies in the way the show revels in the oddities of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a giddy shadow world of criminals and politicians collaborating to keep the liquor flowing," [...] says online magazine Salon's Heather Havrilesky who went on to call the pilot [...] "breathtaking." [...] Roberto Bianco from USA Today said in his review that Boardwalk Empire was [...] "Extravagantly produced, shockingly violent and as cold and hard as ice, Boardwalk Empire {{brings us back to the}} world's former playground at the start of Prohibition—and brings HBO back to the forefront of the TV-series race." ...|$|E
