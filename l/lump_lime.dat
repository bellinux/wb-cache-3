40|$|Radiocarbon dating {{was first}} applied to {{historic}} lime mortars during the 1960 s. However, despite the relative {{simplicity of the}} technique in principle, a number of subsequent studies have highlighted important aspects that should be considered. One {{of the most significant}} of these challenges arises from sample contamination by carbonaceous substances such as incompletely burnt limestone and aggregates of fossil origin containing "dead" 14 C. More recent studies have shown that in the majority of old lime-based mixtures the contamination problem can be avoided through selection of pure <b>lime</b> <b>lumps.</b> These particular types of lumps are believed to originate from areas where the lime is incompletely mixed with the aggregate. It has been demonstrated that even a single <b>lime</b> <b>lump</b> can provide sufficient material for a 14 C date of the mortar from which the lump was taken (Pesce et al. 2009). This paper describes the practical challenges associated with location, extraction, and preparation of 4 <b>lime</b> <b>lumps</b> extracted from 2 new sites for 14 C dating. These include distinguishing the <b>lime</b> <b>lumps</b> from other lumps present in the matrix and the removal of material surrounding the <b>lime</b> <b>lump.</b> The coherence of 14 C dating with other archaeological information on the chronology of historic sites is highlighted through case studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} {{contributing}} to binder formation during {{the set of}} a lime mortar reflects the atmospheric 14 C content {{at the time of}} construction of a building. For this reason, the 14 C dating of mortars is used with increasing frequencies in archaeological and architectural research. Mortars, however, may also contain carbonaceous contaminants potentially affecting radiocarbon dating. The Centre for Isotopic Research on Cultural and Environmental heritage (CIRCE) of the Second University of Naples (SUN) has recently obtained some promising results in mortar radiocarbon dating thanks {{to the development of a}} procedure (i. e. CryoSoniC/Cryo 2 SoniC) aiming to eliminate exogenous C contamination that may occur in a mortar. The construction history of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Modena (Italy) is still controversial and represents a challenging case study for the application of absolute dating methodologies for different reasons. From the point of view of 14 C dating, for example, given the high percentage of carbonate aggregates composing these samples, Modena mortars represent an experimental test particularly indicative of exogenous carbon sources suppression ensuring methodology accuracy. In this paper several AMS Radiocarbon dates were carried out on <b>lime</b> <b>lumps</b> with the aim to: (i) verify procedure accuracy by a comparison of the results obtainable from <b>lime</b> <b>lumps</b> dated after different treatments (i. e. bulk <b>lime</b> <b>lumps</b> vs. CryoSoniC purified lime lumps); (ii) compare different building phases absolute chronology for the medieval UNESCO site of Modena, with that assumed by historical sources in order to assess preliminary the 14 C dating feasibility for of the site. Historical temporal constraints and mortar clustering, based on petrography, have been applied to define a temporal framework of the analyzed structure.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies carried out over {{the last forty years}} {{describe}} the application of radiocarbon dating of lime mixtures such as mortars, plasters and renders. Despite the fact that this method is very simple in principle, several studies have highlighted various practical challenges and factors that must be considered. These arise mainly from the contamination of samples with carbonaceous substances such as incompletely burnt limestone and aggregates of fossil origin including limestone sand. However, recently studies have shown that accurate sample processing allow a significant reduction of these error sources and moreover adoption of a special sampling procedure based on the careful selection of lumps of incompletely mixed lime, provides an interesting alternative that avoids problems associated with contamination. The founding principle underlying this technique is the use of the pure <b>lime</b> <b>lumps.</b> These are thought to originate from imperfect mixing and are most prevalent in mortars, renders and plasters predating mechanical mixing. Previous sampling methods for radiocarbon dating did not discriminate between pure and contaminated <b>lime</b> <b>lumps.</b> As pure lumps contain the same lime as that used {{in other parts of the}} mixtures but importantly are free of contaminants such as sand grains or under burned pieces of limestone, they can dramatically reduce the errors in the radiocarbon dating...|$|R
30|$|The binder is a lime-based (calcitic), nearly homogeneous, micritic {{sometime}} microsparitic matrix, {{although some}} sparse uncarbonated rounded <b>lumps</b> of <b>lime</b> were also observed. The volume occupying by the lime binder is about 50  vol. %, the porosity {{is less than}} 20 % on the total volume of the sample and is due to voids occurring in the binder, in the lithic fragments of the aggregate and sporadically due to cracks at the grain-binder boundary. In its inner part the plaster base reveals a distinct layer, showing a lighter coloured matrix, which seem also distinguished by the finer grain size of the aggregate, a minor content of volcanic lithic fragments and a higher porosity in the binder. Such contrasting features could indicate the occurrence of an older plaster layer, different for, aggregate composition, binder concentration and porosity, which probably suffered carbonate dissolution-reprecipitation of the lime binder matrix.|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} developed “pure lime lumps” technique for the radiocarbon dating of old limebased mixtures {{has been applied}} with interesting results over several years. Contrary to alternative techniques, which involve physical and/or chemical pre-treatment of specimens, this technique {{is based on a}} careful selection of a specific type of lump usually embedded in old lime-based mixtures. The founding principle underlying this technique is, in fact, the use of the “pure lime lumps”. These are <b>lumps</b> of pure <b>lime</b> which are not mixed with the aggregate and thought to originate from imperfect mixing of the wet mix or from an incomplete slaking process of the <b>lime.</b> Pure <b>lime</b> <b>lumps</b> contain the same lime as that used {{in other parts of the}} mixtures but, importantly, as they are not mixed with aggregate they are free of contaminants such as sand grains or under burned pieces of limestone. For this reason this technique can dramatically reduce the errors in the radiocarbon dating. Although this technique has been used in several cases, a comprehensive study of its accuracy and precision is still missing. This paper will address this issue by showing radiocarbon results of 5 specimens of pure <b>lime</b> <b>lumps</b> coming from the same part (i. e. same stratigraphic unit in archaeological terms) and from the same depth of the external surface of a specifically chosen wall. The wall, in fact, is the façade of a medieval building located in the old city of Genoa (Italy) where it is based also one of the most experienced Italian research centres for the building archaeology. This wall has been dated independently from radiocarbon through the others archaeological methods commonly used in building archaeology such as mensiochronology of bricks. The lumps collected in this wall have been characterised with several techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and thermal analysis and then sent to the AMS laboratory. The precision of the radiocarbon dating results has been determined from the scattering of the data obtained from the analysed terms while accuracy has been estimated by comparing the 14 C results with those obtained by the archaeological analysis of the wall...|$|R

In spite of possible uncertainties, general conclusions about these mortars could be drawn. The Roman and Palaeochristian mortars are all comparable in containing a considerable amount of ceramic fragments, whereas their presence was not systematic during later times.

40|$|Abstract Historical mortars from sixteenth to {{seventeenth century}} {{military}} forts {{located at the}} mouth of the Tagus River in Lisbon have been characterized by polarized light microscopy (PLM), thermal analysis (TG/DTA), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy + energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM + EDS). The results indicate that the mortars used were all hydraulic lime-based. The presence of well-rounded <b>lime</b> <b>lumps</b> indicates a limited use of water during the lime hydration process. The detection of hydrated calcium chloroaluminate and carboaluminate compounds mostly at binder-aggregate interfaces provides evidence for the onset of pozzolanic reactions during mortar production as further confirmed by the presence of ceramic fragments in the aggregate fractions intentionally added by the fort builders to increase the hydraulic properties of the mortars. The higher mechanical strength and greater resistance to degradation processes imparted by these pozzolanic compounds could explain why, despite the extreme proximity of the investigated sites to the sea, salt weathering processes do not appear to have significantly affected the studied mortar...|$|R

Radiocarbon dating was performed on the selected fractions using high-precision (i. e. 0. 3 % prescision) Accelerator Mass Spectroscometry (AMS). Mineralogical investigations for mortar charcterization were performed on original mortars by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) of powders, observations of thin section with Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). An inter-comparison exercise has been performed between CIRCE and the Poznan Radiocarbon Laboratory to verify the efficiency of different separation methods (Cryo 2 SoniC vs stepped digestion) performed on the same samples.

It examines the three towers on the Asinara Island with the aim to identify the construction techniques and technologies through the characterization of stone materials and through subsequent identification and dating of the different phases of construction. In order to rationalize and optimize data collection and processing it was helpful to set up and test a common protocol to all buildings which is also applicable to a larger scale. The first phase of the protocol involved the archival research, mainly carried out in the Cagliari archives (Archivio di Stato, Archivio Storico, Archivio di manoscritti della Biblioteca Universitaria), and the documentation on the many bibliographical sources. The next steps, carried out directly on the site, have allowed the metric and / or photogrammetric survey of the three towers, and reasoned sampling of interstitial mortars, plasters, waterproofing materials and stones used. The absence of recent interventions or their easy location and demarcation, as well as the advanced state of decay has facilitated the retrieval of historical materials attributable to the original building. The analysis of the samples was set by observing the following steps: execution of photos of the samples with digital camera; macroscopic analysis, performed in situ, in order to obtain information on the stratigraphic position of the sample, the characteristics of the color, the texture and the way of working; petrographic analysis of thin section in transmitted light polarized (OM) and X-ray diffraction of samples such as to characterize the mineralogical composition of the aggregates and the binder; disintegration of mortar sample in order to define the size distribution and the proportions of the binder/aggregate; X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) to define the mineralogical-petrographic composition of the binder, aggregates separated by particle size, partially burnt limestone and <b>lumps</b> of <b>lime.</b> The synthesis of the tests carried out made ​​it possible, through the comparison of results obtained with the historical sources, to deliver an exact determination of important data on the construction techniques used in the three towers and on their chronological articulation and also to deliver a first indication of degradation and the causes that originated them.

40|$|Several {{scientific}} papers {{describe the}} radiocarbon dating of lime mortars and plasters [Folk and Valastro, 1976; Van Strydonck et al., 1992; Hale et al., 2003; Nawrocka et al., 2005] carried out using the 14 C dating {{contained in the}} calcium carbonate precipitated during the hardening process of lime. As the content of 14 C contained in the newly formed calcium carbonate reflects the 14 C concentration in the atmosphere {{at the time of}} hardening, this material can be used for the radiocarbon dating of old mortars and plasters. Although the method is quite simple in its basis principle, relevant issues come from the contamination problems with other carbon sources. Grains of carbonate sand or underburned pieces of the same limestone used to produce the lime, that are originally mixed with the binder cannot be, in fact, completely removed from the mixtures. These materials do not contain radioactive carbon but behave as the carbonated lime during the analyses. For overcoming this problem, over the past years, new techniques for the sample preparation have been developed and among these techniques, the so called “pure lime lumps” represents a fast and reliable method. The technique is based on the use of <b>lumps</b> of pure <b>lime,</b> very often embedded in old lime based mixtures as material for the radiocarbon dating. Because these lumps are made of pure lime any contamination problem is avoided. However, despite the remarkable results already achieved with this technique [Pesce et al., 2009; Pesce et al., 2012; Pesce et al., 2013], the sample collection is still a very important issue for a successful application of the radiocarbon dating.

40|$|The {{radiocarbon}} dating of inorganic {{materials such as}} lime mortars {{proved to be an}} innovative approach for the dating of the architectures, that allows to confirm data from the evaluation of the typological criteria, based on the archaeological stratigraphy. The tested method provides a an essential support where the dating obtained by the traditional method presents considerable limits. The protocol developed in this study is based on the CryoSoniC method, a physical-mechanical separation of the binder, focused on the separation of the binder from the aggregates and its purification from the potential contaminants that could affect the dating. The binder separation procedure, preceding the mortar dating, is followed to numerous analysis for the characterization and the control of the samples in order to test the quality of the isolation of the binder and the presence of contaminants. The procedure has been tested on 16 samples from archaeological site of Torba (province of Varese, Lombardy) which presents many construction phases between the Roman age and the early Middle age, therefore are represented various production techniques. The characterization of the samples prove the success of the binder purification protocol by sedimentation for the separation of the binder fraction from the sand fraction (aggregate), that permits to obtain reliable radiocarbon dates when the process of carbonation is prevalent on the pozzolanic reaction (that produces hydrate phases (C-S-H) and anionic clays). The samples dated through the accelerator mass spectrometry have been choosen based on three parameters: the ratio between the carbonate fraction and the silicate fractions of the sample, the stable carbon isotopes ratio δ 13 C, the intensity of the luminescence observed under microscope. In the cases where at least two parameters of three are satisfied, the results of the dating are in agree with the archaeological datas (Brogiolo et al. 2013), otherwise, the results from the binder taken directly from the mortar, the <b>lime</b> <b>lumps</b> and the samples made up of a high amount of clay are postdated if compared the expected date.

The {{church of}} St. Mary at the Pond with a wall {{painting}} depicting The Adoration of the Magi I {{the most important}} art and cultural monument of the Istrian town of Gologorica. It is an east-facing church, approximately 7 m long and 5 m wide. Typologically, it belongs {{to a group of}} single-nave Romanesque churches with an inscribed apse. The wall painting, located on the north wall of the church interior (5 m wide and ca. 2. 2 m high), was discovered in the late 1950 s by art historian Branko Fučić, who dated it to the turn of the 15 th century. Around 1651, a major renovation of the church took place. The inscribed apse was removed and the floor level was raised with the building material obtained. Further alterations to the interior and exterior followed in the period between the 18 th and the 20 th century. The support for the multilayered plaster of the wall painting is rubble masonry made of lime sandstone, i. e. sand limestone. It is coated with a 1. 5 -cm-thick arriccio with a calcite-based aggregate, i. e. aggregate bound by calcite. The arriccio is covered with a 0. 5 -cm-thick layer of intonaco of almost identical composition. On top of it, various paint layers are applied over a toned lime wash. The paint layers are bound by lime that contains organic elements. The fragmentarily preserved wall painting shows many damages: static cracks, cavities, structural damages of the plaster, damages of the paint layers, and in some portions, the original plaster is completely missing. In 2008 and 2009 a systematic research of the wall painting was conducted in order {{to come up with an}} acceptable concept for conservation, while bearing in mind the damage to the painting which required a prompt implementation of protective measures. The research was part of Bastian Hacker’s diploma thesis at the Potsdam University of Applied Sciences (Fachhochschule Potsdam, Fachbereich Architectur und Sttebau, Studiengang Restaurierung). Special attention was paid to the laboratory analyses of the composition and properties of multilayered medieval plaster. In addition, an assessment was made of the most common commercial injection materials which were compared to the original plaster. The discovery of fragments of the multilayered plaster withoat the paint layer beneath the present-day floor, enabled various laboratory investigations into its composition and properties. Since the content of components soluble in hydrochloric acid was high in the tested samples (90. 89 w% – 93. 34 w%), and these were interpreted as being lime binder, the results of the wet chemical analyses proved irrelevant. For this reason, it was impossible to give a more specific estimate of the binder and aggregate ratio or of the composition and shape of the aggregate. As a result, thin sections of the samples of the original arriccio layer were prepared, in which the binder and aggregate ratio was calculated by counting the presence of aggregate, pores and binder. Since the share of fine pores was disregarded in calculation, a very high binder con tent was obtained. However, by measuring the maximum water absorption capacity, the share of fine pores was obtained, which enabled the binder and aggregate ratio to finally be defined as 2 : 1. In addition, in the thin section, <b>lime</b> <b>lumps</b> were spotted in the binder, as well as aggregates of marble, limestone, calcite in the form of mineral and lime sandstone i. e. sand limestone. Measurement of the dynamic modulus of elasticity indicated a relatively low density of the arriccio plaster samples. The conclusion thereof could be made that the share of pores was large. To acquire more detailed information of the size and volume of pores in the arriccio, an analysis of the maximum water absorption capacity and the pore radius distribution was conducted. These parameters largely influence the properties of arriccio and therefore had to be considered in the making of replacement plaster. The share of maximum water absorption capacity was 35 w%, little above the usual values for brick. A large share of pores smaller than 3 μm was determined. Furthermore, imaging was done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) that determined the presence of calcium, aluminium, magnesium, iron, potassium, silicon and niobium in the medieval plaster. Analyses of the plaster samples indicated that the components of multilayered plaster – joint mortar, arriccio and intonaco – are lime plasters in composition, with specific characteristics such as a high binder and fine pores content, and that they contain calcite-based aggregates, i. e. aggregates bound by calcite. Given that the filling of cavities was assessed to be the protection priority, in addition to the fact that the treatment itself represents an irreversible intrusion into the core of the wall painting, it was important to choose an appropriate injection material. For that purpose, standardized samples of the most common injection grouts were prepared, whose static modulus of elasticity and biaxial flexural-tensile strength were compared to the values of the original arriccio. Values of these parameters of the injection grouts should be lower than those of the original plaster. Three standardized samples of the medieval arriccio were tested alongside samples of the materials KSE 500 STE-Modul-System, CalXnova, PLM-AL, PLMA and Ledan. The injection materials mostly showed higher values of static modulus of elasticity than the medieval plaster. Lower values than those of the original plaster were found only in CalXnova modified with hollow glass microspheres and PLM-AL prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. These materials were therefore used in the applying of protective measures on the wall painting. In order to consolidate the particularly endangered portions of the wall painting, appropriate replacement plasters for arriccio and intonaco needed to be prepared. As replacement plasters must have properties similar to those of the original plaster, in order for their behavior to be similar, local slaked lime was used for their preparation, in addition to the calcite-based aggregates, i. e. aggregates buond by calcite: marble, calcite in the form of mineral and local stone from the church surroundings, i. e. lime sandstone. In order to obtain softer replacement plasters, the binder content was reduced to 1 (binder) : 2 (aggregate) for the arriccio and 1 : 3 for the intonaco plaster. In one particularly endangered area of the wall painting, protection measures were applied in 2009. The consolidation consisted of the structural strengthening of the plaster, the filling of cavities and replacing the plaster layers with materials that were selected based on the results of research. By following the previously established methodology, the work in the church of St. Mary at the Pond has been under way since 2013, as part of practical training in conservation for students of the Department for Conservation and Restoration of Works of Art (OKIRU) of the Academy of Fine Arts (ALU), University of Zagreb...|$|R
