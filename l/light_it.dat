5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an objectâ€™s reflected <b>light.</b> <b>It</b> cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal {{in the belly}} of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E

On the Jazz Albums chart, it peaked at number 14, {{becoming}} McLaughlin's highest-charting album {{as an artist}} (which would later tie with his 2015 album Black <b>Light).</b> <b>It</b> also appeared on the Top Jazz Albums chart, where it peaked at number 9.|$|E
5|$|F. rubiginosa is also {{suited for}} use as a houseplant in low, medium or brightly-lit spaces, {{although}} a variegated form requires brighter <b>light.</b> <b>It</b> has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

5|$|Millepora alcicornis has no {{commercial}} uses but {{is sometimes}} kept in reef aquaria. It requires high water movement and bright light to flourish and its health can {{be judged by}} its colour, a yellow hue showing health whereas a darker brown colour can indicate too little <b>light.</b> <b>It</b> {{can be difficult to}} control because it grows fast and spreads over other objects in the tank.|$|E
5|$|The yellow {{stingray}} exhibits biofluorescence, that is, when {{illuminated by}} blue or ultraviolet <b>light,</b> <b>it</b> re-emits it as green, and appears differently than under white light illumination. Biofluorescence potentially assists intraspecific communication and camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little <b>light,</b> <b>it</b> {{would still be}} {{radiating}} the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of NASA is optimistic {{that it could be}} observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E

5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials. Buildings {{were made}} out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to <b>light</b> <b>it</b> at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, coated in clay. Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{diameter}} of Eris {{was measured to be}} , using images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The size of an object is determined from its absolute magnitude (H) and the albedo (the amount of <b>light</b> <b>it</b> reflects). At a distance of 97AU, an object with a diameter of 3,000km would have an angular size of 40milliarcseconds, which is directly measurable with the Hubble Space Telescope. Although resolving such small objects is at the very limit of its capabilities, sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution can be used to measure such angular sizes fairly accurately.|$|E
5|$|Located near Alnair is NGC 7213, a face-on type 1 Seyfert galaxy located {{approximately}} 71.7 million {{light years}} from Earth. It has an apparent magnitude of 12.1. Appearing undisturbed in visible <b>light,</b> <b>it</b> {{shows signs of}} having undergone a collision or merger when viewed at longer wavelengths, with disturbed patterns of ionized hydrogen including a filament of gas around 64,000 light-years long. It {{is part of a}} group of ten galaxies.|$|E

5|$|Next was a Hardcore {{match between}} Randy Orton and Cactus Jack for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. One {{spot in the}} match saw Cactus lie a barbed wire {{baseball}} bat between Orton's legs and perform a leg drop. Cactus continued to use the bat, as he poured gasoline on it and tried to <b>light</b> <b>it</b> on fire. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff interrupted and informed Cactus {{that he would be}} disqualified and the event would end if he lit the bat on fire. Orton executed an RKO on Cactus onto the barbed wire baseball bat to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|The dust {{present in}} the {{interstellar}} medium is opaque to visual <b>light.</b> <b>It</b> is more transparent to far-infrared, {{which can be used}} to observe the interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail. Infrared is also used to observe distant, red-shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier {{in the history of the}} Universe. Water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb a number of useful portions of the infrared spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for infrared astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{first floor}} {{comprises}} an entry hallway and two rooms. The hallways is set with tessellated tiles {{and still has}} the original desk for the visitor's book. Of the two rooms, one was the report room used for administrative work, record keeping and logbooks. It is currently used as a radio room. The second room housed a spare mantle holder. It currently houses the electrical controls, including the sensors responsible for starting the <b>light.</b> <b>It</b> also houses the backup batteries, backup diesel generator and fuel tank, {{as well as a}} small workshop.|$|E

5|$|The {{interplanetary medium}} {{is home to}} at least two disc-like regions of cosmic dust. The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in the inner Solar System and causes the zodiacal <b>light.</b> <b>It</b> was likely formed by {{collisions}} within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational interactions with the planets. The second dust cloud extends from about 10AU to about 40AU, and was probably created by similar collisions within the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|The lone {{surviving}} Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, {{has been}} a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include Judith Green's search for evidence of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, has studied the roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites. Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what <b>light</b> <b>it</b> can shine on Henry I's judicial system, {{as well as on}} the growth of royal courts during Henry's reign. The historian C. Warren Hollister used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the rewards of royal service during Henry's reign.|$|E
5|$|The trial De Iniusta details {{took place}} at Salisbury in November 1088, and {{concerned}} St-Calais' equivocal actions in the revolt against King William II's rule {{that had taken place}} earlier in the year. The work is one of the primary sources for the early part of King William II's reign, and was probably compiled from notes taken by the bishop's subordinates and then worked into a tractate that was designed to present the bishop's case in the best <b>light.</b> <b>It</b> was probably composed during the 1090s when St-Calais was engaged in an effort to regain the favour of King William after his return from the sentence of exile he received at the trial.|$|E

5|$|Usher {{made his}} acting debut on the UPN {{television}} series Moesha, {{which resulted in}} a recurring role on the series and subsequently his first film role in 1998's The Faculty. Usher's extracurricular activities outside of the recording industry gathered momentum over the following year as he was cast in the soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful. He completed two more films, She's All That, and his first starring role in <b>Light</b> <b>It</b> Up. He also appeared in the Disney TV movie Geppetto.|$|E
5|$|White silver nitrate, AgNO3, is a {{versatile}} precursor {{to many other}} silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to <b>light.</b> <b>It</b> was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver {{was associated with the}} moon. It is often used for gravimetric analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the silver halides which it is a common precursor to. Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits <b>light.</b> <b>It</b> produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E
