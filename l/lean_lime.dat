In the first part, it describes the properties and characteristics of CaLoSiL ® – a new stone strengthener based on colloidal suspensions of lime nanoparticles in various solvents. It further summarizes the results of recent tests on the influence of applying nano-agents based on colloidal calcium hydroxide dispersed in ethanol or isopropyl alcohol (CaLoSiL®), and compares them with the effects of lime water and with a traditional barium hydroxide treatment. The tests were carried out on non-standard test specimens fabricated from a lean mortar (1 : 9) and developed specially for the purpose of testing the relatively low strengthening effects that are typical for lime water consolidation. The comparison presented in this paper is based on the mechanical characteristics of consolidated lime mortar...|$|E

50|$|Golden tree snake or ornate flying snake, Chrysopelea ornata (Shaw, 1802): This is {{the largest}} species of flying snake, {{reaching}} up to four feet in length. Though {{it is called the}} golden tree snake, there are other colour variations; for example, some phases tend to <b>lean</b> towards <b>lime</b> green in colour rather than pure yellow, while in India, it has orange to red markings and small black bars on the dorsum, almost as rich in colouration as the paradise tree snake. Due to their size, their gliding ability is considered weak.|$|R
50|$|Otaru {{attends a}} meeting at the castle to discuss a {{disastrous}} future event. Faust reveals that every 80,000 years a catastrophic plasma storm develops with strength enough to destroy the planet. Additionally, Otaru learns that Marine is a prototypical saber marionette, developed by New Texas to have a tolerance to plasma and utilize it as a weapon. However, because of overlooked design flaws, these features greatly overpower her and death is certain if she continues to mature. Otaru realizes what that means and refuses to sacrifice her to save the planet. Unbeknown to them, Marine eavesdropped on the conversation and now understands, and wishes to fulfill, her existence. Lime is particularly against this and rushes off to save her friend in the newly developed plasma-defusing experimental vessel. Despite incredible speed and strength, she fails to arrive in time; Marine has already absorbed most of the energy and is ready to defuse it herself. This proves to be gravely damaging, with Lime being the only conscious survivor of the two. Marine is taken to the castle for recovery and repairs; Lorelei promises to fix her. The group departs from their visit but not before <b>Lime</b> <b>leans</b> a conch shell next to Marine's ear, reiterating their promise of one day, visiting the sea together.|$|R
