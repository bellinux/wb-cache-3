40|$|One of {{the most}} common goals in {{manufacturing}} is to improve the quality and accuracy of the parts being fabricated without reducing productivity. Aiming at this goal, many different manufacturing processes have been developed. Among them, machining {{plays a major role in}} increasing product accuracy. As an important machining process, grinding is a vital step that can produce both fine finish and dimensional accuracy for applications in which the workpiece material is either hard or brittle. Currently, the ball screw is the most frequently used setup for grinding machine tool feed drive. However, the existence of transmission components induces wear, high friction, backlash, and also lower system stiffness; therefore, applications of conventional feed drives for high speed and high accuracy machining are very limited. As a promising technology, a <b>linear</b> motor <b>feed</b> drive discards the transmission system; therefore, it eliminates transmission induced error, such as backlash and pitch error, and avoids stiffness reduction as well. As a result, a linear motor drive can achieve both high speed and high accuracy performance. A <b>linear</b> motor <b>feed</b> drive will be subject to external disturbances such as friction, force ripple and machining force. Due to the lack of a transmission unit, the tracking behavior of a <b>linear</b> motor <b>feed</b> drive is prone to be affected by external disturbances and model parameter variations. Thus, in order to deliver high performance, a controller should be capable of achieving high accuracy in the presence of external disturbance and parameter uncertainty. This dissertation proposes a general robust motion control framework for the CNC design of a <b>linear</b> motor <b>feed</b> drive to achieve high speed/high precision as well as low speed/high precision. An application to the <b>linear</b> motor <b>feed</b> drives in grinding machines was carried out. One of the developed algorithms is the HSMC, which combines the merits of a reaching law based sliding mode control and a modified disturbance observer for precision tracking to address the practical issues of friction, force ripple, and grinding force disturbances. Another algorithm presented is ASMC, which combines the reaching law based sliding mode control with adaptive disturbance estimation to achieve an adaptive robust motion control. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{precision}} {{control of}} <b>linear</b> <b>feed</b> axes in machine tools is {{examined in this}} thesis. Al¬though high precision in machining has been {{a focal point for}} engineers for over 200 years, the traditional solutions have often been based on complex mechanical designs. In this thesis, two aspects of feed axis controller design are examined: i) the use of appropriate mathematical models and ii) the signiﬁcance of three of the most common performance limiting factors that have traditionally affected precision in <b>linear</b> <b>feed</b> axes. The three particular performance limiting factors considered are: i) dynamic stiffness, ii) torsional vibrations and iii) backlash. The most effective way of obtaining knowledge about a control system is through appro¬priate mathematical modelling. A new two-body model for a simple motor-transmission¬load system is presented in this thesis. This new model is shown to provide a more accurate representation of both the total inertia and lowest natural frequency of a system, when compared with the two-body model that is traditionally used by researchers and system designers. A new model to represent backlash in a two-body system is also pre¬sented. These new models are then extended to provide accurate mathematical models of four common <b>linear</b> <b>feed</b> axis drive conﬁgurations: i) a rotary motor driving a rack and pinion transmission, ii) a rotary motor directly driving a ballscrew transmission, iii) a rotary motor driving a ballscrew transmission via a synchronous belt, and iv) a linear motor directly driving the axis. Different control solutions to the problems of dynamic stiffness, torsional vibrations and backlash are examined in this thesis, with each controller implemented on specially con¬structed test-beds. An approach using Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is presented xxi for systems with inherently low dynamic stiffness. This QFT approach is shown to pro¬vide a transparent design process, which results in high dynamic stiffness. Different controllers for torsional vibrations are compared both theoretically and experimentally, with many previously published solutions shown to be theoretically equivalent. A new backlash controller is also presented, which is shown experimentally to provide dynamic stability and good tracking performance at both high and low velocities. The importance of treating these performance limiting factors simultaneously is also ad¬dressed in this thesis, with the control solutions developed to address some factors shown to also affect the other factors. The QFT approach is shown to provide a suitable inte¬grated design process, where the implications of any compromises, on the control of each factor, are clearly visible...|$|E

The objective function of this problem was to optimize penicillin productivity by determination of feed rate trajectory. This study compared the optimized results derived from the proposed algorithm and from the iterative dynamic programming. Three decision variables for the proposed algorithm comprised ts (switching time from exponential to <b>linear</b> <b>feeding</b> schedules), K (constant in feed rate equation), and ε (a multiplier on substrate requirement). Estimation of this set of decision variables employed Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures (the Gibbs parameter sampling and the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm) using an originally given set of initial values.

The calculation procedure of the first period of fermentation time had been proposed by integrating Pontryagin’s optimum principle and Luedeking-Piret equation. The feed rate profile during the later period was obtained from the direct substitution of desired substrate requirement derived from Monod equation. The optimal feed-rate profile corresponded to the values of decision variables as follows [ts K ε] = [35. 9370. 096 2. 087].
