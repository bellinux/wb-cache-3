500|$|Heskey {{played as}} a forward, being a {{powerful}} targetman gifted with pace and physical strength; {{he is also}} a hard working player. His play has been likened to [...] "a blunt instrument with which to bludgeon defences". His main contributions to the team lie in the way he holds the ball up and draws defenders out, leaving space behind him for another player to score. He has been credited as being an unselfish player who allows other forwards to benefit. He is not a prolific goalscorer but is able to provide a significant number of assists as a second striker. He has been quoted as saying [...] "Forwards are judged on their goalscoring. But I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> bring a lot more to the game and I do get pleasure from assisting". He impressed the England staff with his versatility, as he can also play down the left wing. However, he has been criticised by the media for his lack of goals; lapses in his goalscoring have been described as being [...] "hardly uncommon". In 2008 it was stated that [...] "It is only the perception of his talents that changes" [...] after Heskey stated he was no better or worse than before.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, Coulthard again {{competed with}} Williams {{alongside}} Damon Hill. He was optimistic for the season, saying: [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{can win a}} Grand Prix this year. That's really my aim, plus to score points in as many races as possible." [...] Coulthard's season started off with controversy when he and Benetton driver Michael Schumacher were disqualified for fuel irregularities {{in the first round}} in Brazil, where Coulthard finished second. On appeal, the original results of both drivers were reinstated. The next five races saw four retirements for Coulthard, plus a fourth-place finish in San Marino.|$|E

[...] "If people <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{was a single}} man, I don't care; it's {{got nothing to do}} with them. Besides, she lives at Stepney, and I don't 'ear from 'er once in six months; she don't interfere with me and I don't interfere with her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she returned. [...] "I {{think we}} reduce {{ourselves}} to the bare bones too much. I wish we didn't always recognize the facts as we do. Sometimes I should like to blink them. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was devouter than I am, and younger and prettier." ...|$|E

[...] He paused, and his voice was strained as he resumed: [...] "For a while we prospered here, and I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> led you well; but the times began to change without our recognizing it. I cannot change, but you must, for you are young; the future lies before you. I am old, and I feel my age to-night. The burden of rule gets heavy; I want to lay it down.

6000|$|I {{was given}} {{yesterday}} {{at a club}} your volume [...] "Boon, etc.," [...] from a loose leaf in which I learn that you kindly sent it me and which yet appears to have lurked there for a considerable time undelivered. I have just been reading, to acknowledge it intelligently, {{a considerable number of}} its pages--though not all; for, to be perfectly frank, I have been in that respect beaten for the first time--or rather for the first time but one--by a book of yours; I haven't found the current of it draw me on and on this time--as, unfailingly and irresistibly, before (which I have repeatedly let you know.) However, I shall try again--I hate to lose any scrap of you that may make for light or pleasure; and meanwhile I have more or less mastered your appreciation of H. J., which I have found very curious and interesting after a fashion--though it has naturally not filled me with a fond elation. It is difficult of course for a writer to put himself fully in the place of another writer who finds him extraordinarily futile and void, and who is moved to publish that to the world--and I think the case isn't easier when he happens to have enjoyed the other writer enormously from far back; because there has then grown up the habit of taking some common meeting-ground between them for granted, and the falling away of this is like the collapse of a bridge which made communication possible. But I am by nature more in dread of any fool's paradise, or at least of any bad misguidedness, than in love {{with the idea of a}} security proved, and the fact that a mind as brilliant as yours can resolve me into such an unmitigated mistake, can't enjoy me in anything like the degree in which I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> may be enjoyed, makes me greatly want to fix myself, for as long as my nerves will stand it, with such a pair of eyes. I am aware of certain things I have, and not less conscious, I believe, of various others that I am simply reduced to wish I did or could have; so I try, for possible light, to enter into the feelings of a critic for whom the deficiencies so preponderate. The difficulty about that effort, however, is that one can't keep it up--one has to fall back on one's sense of one's good parts--one's own sense; and I at least should have to do that, I think, even if your picture were painted with a more searching brush. For I should otherwise seem to forget what it is that my poetic and my appeal to experience rest upon. They rest upon my measure of fulness--fulness of life and of the projection of it, which seems to you such an emptiness of both. I don't mean to say I don't wish I could do twenty things I can't--many of which you do so livingly; but I confess I ask myself what would become in that case of some of those to which I am most addicted and by which interest seems to me most beautifully producible. I hold that interest may be, must be, exquisitely made and created, and that if we don't make it, we who undertake to, nobody and nothing will make it for us; though nothing is more possible, nothing may even be more certain, than that my quest of it, my constant wish to run it to earth, may entail the sacrifice of certain things that are not on the straight line of it. However, there are too many things to say, and I don't think your chapter is really inquiring enough to entitle you to expect all of them. The fine thing about the fictional form to me is that it opens such widely different windows of attention; but that is just why I like the window so to frame the play and the process! ...|$|E

5000|$|From {{a letter}} to his mother, Helen Pancake, that Pancake wrote in Charlottesville, where he was {{studying}} writing: I'm {{going to come back to}} West Virginia when this is over.

50|$|I {{think there}} is a {{noticeable}} shift in my tone from the first book to the third simply because (I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think)</b> <b>I</b> knew a lot more and had read a lot more. People often say after reading the first book that they think I really admire Jews, but they are unlikely to say that about the last two and especially about CofC. That is because by the time I wrote CofC I had changed greatly from the person who wrote the first book.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{question}} of Sir Samuel Griffith's English translation of Dante Alighieri which had received numerous unflattering reviews, {{it was reported that}} when Griffith presented a copy to Salomons, the latter asked Griffith to autograph the fly leaf, explaining that [...] "I should not <b>like</b> anyone <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> had borrowed the book, even less should <b>I</b> <b>like</b> anyone <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> had bought it". Salomons was a supporter of religion being a moderator of human behaviour. [...] He endowed a local public school on the basis that religion was taught as a subject and was upset when it was not. [...] In an address on Australian Federation, he said that having an [...] "education without religion is like putting a sword into the hands of a savage".|$|R
40|$|Since I started {{teaching}} drafting, <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> {{have continued to}} learn some lessons about teaching both the substance and the skills of transactional drafting. One of those lessons that I {{am going to be}} talking about today is one that I stumbled across by happy accident rather than one that I consciously sought. Specifically, I want to talk about and highlight the ways that law students can use law firm marketing materials to increase their understanding of both drafting and lawyering skills in law school and, hopefully, in practice...|$|R

60|$|DEAR MR. CROCKETT, - I do not owe you two letters, nor yet nearly one, sir! The {{last time}} I heard of you, {{you wrote about}} an accident, and I sent you a letter to my lawyer, Charles Baxter, which {{does not seem to}} have been presented, as I see nothing of it in his accounts. Query, was that lost? I should not <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> had been so unmannerly and so inhuman. If you have written since, your letter also has miscarried, as is much the rule in this part of the world, unless you register.|$|R

[...] At the end of the 2010-11 season, Duff made 27 appearances and scored 4 goals in all competitions, including making 24 Premier League appearances.
