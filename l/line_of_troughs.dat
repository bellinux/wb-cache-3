40|$|AbstractIn a {{parabolic}} trough system, the solar flux distribution {{on the surface}} of absorber tube is non-uniform which results in circumferential temperature gradient. Thus, bending moment is induced and leads to the deflection in absorber tube from the focal <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>trough.</b> It is concluded that during zero angle of incidence of sun rays (angle made by sun rays with trough's aperture normal), absorber tube will not deflect from the focal line. However, during non-zero angle of incidence, the absorber tube will deflect. It is {{because of the fact that}} during non-zero angle of incidence, the absorber tube does not receive any concentrated flux near the end facing the sun. In the current work, an analytical expression is derived for finding the deflection in the central axis of absorber tube from the focal <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>trough.</b> Results for deflection are plotted for different values of angle of incidence taking the dimensions of LS 3 {{parabolic trough}} with Schott 2008 PTR 70 receiver...|$|R
40|$|The {{portion of}} {{absorber}} tube <b>of</b> parabolic <b>trough,</b> facing the reflector, receives concentrated rays and the portion facing the sun receives direct incident rays resulting in circumferential non-uniform flux distribution. It leads to circumferential non-uniformity in {{the temperature of}} absorber tube. Thus, the absorber tube experiences differential expansion that results in tension and compression in its different parts leading to bending of the tube. Using the distribution of solar flux on the absorber tube incorporating the effects of Gaussian sun shape and optical errors, explicit expressions for finding the absorber's temperature distribution and corresponding deflection in the central axis of absorber tube (from the focal <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>trough)</b> are derived in the current work. Deflection due to {{the weight of the}} absorber tube is also accounted. The absorber tube is considered to be supported at its ends. To allow the absorber tube to elongate freely, supports are chosen such that they can move axially. Two types of conditions are considered: (i) the ends of absorber tube are allowed to rotate in the planes passing through focal <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> and (ii) rotation is not allowed. Keeping solar radiation, ambient conditions, receiver's dimensions, trough's aperture width, fluid and material's properties of absorber tube fixed, calculations have been carried out to study the effects of desired rise in fluid temperature, optical errors and rim angle <b>of</b> <b>trough</b> on absorber's temperature distribution and deflection in the absorber tube. For the chosen system dimensions, fluid's properties and absorber's material, as fluid's temperature rise increases from 0. 1 degrees C/m (averaged over the receiver's length) to 0. 5 degrees C/m, the maximum circumferential difference in absorber's temperature increases from 9 degrees C to 23 degrees C and the maximum deflection increases from - 5. 9 mm to - 13. 7 mm (positive and negative signs indicate deflections away and towards the vertex <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> respectively). As optical errors increase from 0 mrad to 20 mrad, the maximum circumferential difference in absorber's temperature decreases from 14 degrees C to 11 degrees C and the maximum deflection decreases from - 8. 8 mm to - 7. 2 mm. As rim angle increases from 60 degrees to 140 degrees, the maximum circumferential difference in absorber's temperature decreases from 16 degrees C to 7 degrees C and the maximum deflection decreases from - 9. 0 mm to - 1. 7 mm.

50|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{is a type}} of solar thermal collector that is straight in one dimension and curved as a parabola in the other two, lined with a polished metal mirror. The energy of sunlight which enters the mirror parallel to its plane of symmetry is focused along the focal line, where objects are positioned that are intended to be heated. For example, food may be placed at the focal <b>line</b> <b>of</b> a <b>trough,</b> which causes the food to be cooked when the trough is aimed so the Sun is in its plane of symmetry.

40|$|Surface {{pressures}} {{have been}} measured at various positions along the center <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> during the compression of monolayers of vinyl stearate (VS) and poly(vinyl stearate) (PVS).

40|$|In a {{parabolic}} trough system, {{the portion of}} the absorber tube facing the sun receives incident rays directly, whereas the other side receives concentrated rays resulting in circumferential non-uniform flux distribution. Near the sun facing end of the absorber tube, the flux also varies along the length depending upon the rim angle <b>of</b> <b>trough</b> and angle <b>of</b> incidence of sun rays. This circumferential and axial distribution of the solar flux and variation in the fluid temperature result in non-uniform temperature of the absorber tube. The temperature gradient, thus produced, can lead to bending of the tube which may pose the risk of glass cover damage. The absorber tube considered in this work is equidistantly supported at hinges. An analytical expression for deflection in the central axis of the absorber tube (from the focal <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trough)</b> is derived using circumferential and axial distribution of solar flux incorporating Gaussian sun shape and optical errors. Expressions for radial, circumferential and axial distributions of normal stress and strain induced in the absorber tube are also derived. Effects of angle of incidence of sun rays, optical errors, rim angle <b>of</b> <b>trough,</b> desired rise in fluid temperature and types of supports on deflection and stresses have been studied keeping solar radiation, ambient conditions, fluid, material of absorber tube, receiver's dimensions, aperture width and distance between the consecutive supports fixed. For a desired rise of 0. 1 degrees C/m (averaged over the receiver's length) in the fluid temperature, maximum deflections of - 0. 57 mm and - 1. 51 mm have been found out for two types of supports which elevate to - 2. 71 mm and - 7. 14 mm respectively when the fluid temperature-rise increases to 1 degrees C/m (positive and negative signs indicate deflections away and towards the vertex <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> respectively). Maximum compressive (negative) stresses increase from 19. 29 MPa to 66. 61 MPa and tensile (positive) stresses increase from 10. 14 MPa to 49. 67 MPa as fluid temperature-rise increases from 0. 1 degrees C/m to 1 degrees C/m. It is found that axial variation in solar flux near the sun facing end of absorber tube {{plays an important role in}} deflection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This comparative study showed improved dried strength for the cement containing compositions. Increasing amount of non‐oxide components (like graphite or SiC) resulted in reduced densification and strength properties for both the bonding system at all the processing temperatures.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the solar flux on the circumference of the absorber tube <b>of</b> the parabolic <b>trough</b> concentrator is non-uniform. It leads to circumferential non-uniformity in the tube temperature which causes bending and stresses in the absorber tube. Thus, the absorber tube gets deflected from the focal <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> which can damage the glass cover. In the current work, an experimental set-up has been described which is created to achieve a non-uniform {{distribution of}} the temperature on the circumference of the tube (using electrical heating) and to measure the corresponding deflection of the tube due to bending (in the vertical plane passing through the central axis of the tube). The deflection of the tube has also been calculated using analytical equations (derived in the previous work) and compared with the measurements. The {{results show that the}} analytical calculations differ from the measurements within the range of - 0. 26 mm to + 0. 50 mm (i. e. - 15. 4 % to 16. 9 %). For the chosen tube dimensions and the maximum circumferential temperature difference of 30 degrees C, the maximum deflection due to bending is 3. 2 mm. It decreases to 2. 6 mm for the maximum circumferential temperature difference of 22 degrees C. The bending (due to circumferential temperature gradient) between 1 st and 2 nd support is downwards. Between 2 nd and 3 rd support, it is upwards. It is again downwards for the portion of the tube lying between 3 rd and 4 th support. The same trend of bending has been found out by analytical calculations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The correlation between the geological structure and large-scale magnetic anomalies is excellent. Along the North Greenland coast the data indicate that the Late Mesozoic Kap Washington volcanics might have a larger areal extent than known from onshore geological mapping.

This massive magmatism have occurred latest in conjunction with the Oligocene initial stages of plate divergence between Svalbard and North Greenland that {{led to the development of}} Fram Strait. Both plateaux, the Morris Jesup Rise and the Yermak Plateau, are interpreted to be of continental origin and, in the initial rift stage of the Eurasia Basin around 56 Ma, to have been contiguous with the Lomonosov Ridge.

The 5 -kW solar receiver/reactor is fabricated and positioned along the focal <b>line</b> <b>of</b> one-tracking parabolic <b>trough</b> concentrator. As a result, the chemical conversion of methanol can reach levels higher than 90 %, and the volumetric concentration of hydrogen in the gas products can account for 66 - 74 % above the solar flux of 580 Â W/m 2. The obtained maximum hydrogen yield per mole of methanol is 2. 65 - 2. 90 Â mol, approaching the theoretical maximum value, and the experimentally obtained thermochemical efficiency of solar thermal energy converted into chemical energy is in the range of 30 - 50 %, which is competitive with other high-temperature solar thermochemical processes.
