These video demos were previously accessed via the Guitarist CD/DVD, or the online Guitarist Vault download archive.

40|$|This paper investigates how minimal user {{interaction}} paradigms and markerless image recognition technologies {{can be applied}} to matching print media content to online digital proofs. By <b>linking</b> <b>print</b> material to online content, users can enhance their experience with traditional forms of print media with updated online content, videos, interactive online features etc. The proposed approach is based on extracting features from images/text from mobile device camera images to form fingerprints that are used to find matching images/text within a limited test set. An important criterion for these applications is to ensure that the user Quality of Experience (QoE), particularly in terms of matching accuracy and time, is robust to a variety of conditions typically encountered in practical scenarios. In this paper, the performance of a number of computer vision techniques that extract the image features and form the fingerprints are analysed and compared. Both computer simulation tests and mobile device experiments in realistic user conditions are conducted to study the effectiveness of the techniques when considering scale, rotation, blur and lighting variations typically encountered by a user. 2012 IEEE...|$|R

It was this assertion, unchallenged by Heirens's defense counsel at sentencing, that helped prompt him to confess to the murders he was charged with. In a 2002 clemency petition, however, his lawyers question the validity of those prints on the ransom note due to the timing of discoveries of fingerprints on the card, the broken chain of evidence, its handling by both inexperienced law enforcement and civilians.|$|R

50|$|Those {{with special}} {{requirements}} can use touch with fingers or pointer {{to gain access}} to the digital environment. Typing, currently a traditional method for accessing the digital world, can be replaced for users who are missing fingers or are not capable of typing. Touching a <b>link</b> on <b>printed</b> paper takes advantage of the ubiquitous presence of printed paper while it removes barriers of entry to the digital world. Further, removing the need to type pathways removes errors from the entry process, potentially protecting companies and organizations that have potential users going to a cybersquatting site due to a misspelling. Typing is also time consuming. A touch interface provides a reduction in time to get where the reader wants to go in the digital world.|$|R

It remains to be said how pixel data bits are assigned to the bits 0 to 71 used in the figure. For grey-scale pixels, this is a trivial one-to-one mapping; for colour pixels with a multiple of 8 bits per colour, the colours are simply concatenated in the order red, green and blue (from LSB to MSB). For 12-bit RGB data, the lower 8 bits of each colour are assigned to data bits 0-7,16-23,32-39; the higher 4 bits of each colour to bits 8-11,12-15,40-43.|$|R

40|$|URL] paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} to evaluate design alternatives for high-speed <b>links</b> on <b>printed</b> circuit boards. The approach combines evaluations of signal integrity and link input power. For a comprehensive analysis, different link designs are made comparable {{through the application of}} identical constraints, with the link input power as the single figure of merit for a systematic, quantitative comparison of design alternatives. The analysis relies upon a combination of efficient physics-based via and trace models, statistical time-domain simulation, and an analytical input power evaluation, which allows it to handle links consisting {{of a large number of}} channels while fully taking into account interchannel crosstalk. The proposed approach is applied to study two fundamental design decisions at the PCB level—single-ended versus differential signaling and signal-to-ground via ratios of 1 : 1 versus 2 : 1 —for a link consisting of 2048 vias and up to 175 striplines with an aggregate data rate of 1 Tb/s. It is found that both design decisions have a considerable impact on the required input power of the link...|$|R

It's extremely rare that two people have the exact same DNA pattern, therefore DNA testing is highly successful.|$|R
40|$|Many {{people use}} the Web as {{the main source of}} {{information}} in their daily lives. However, most web pages contain noninformative components such as side bars, footers, headers, and advertisements, which are undesirable for certain applications like printing. We demonstrate a system that automatically extracts the informative contents from news- and blog-like web pages. In contrast to many existing methods that are limited to identifying only the text or the bounding rectangular region, our system not only identifies the content but also the structural roles of various content components such as title, paragraphs, images and captions. The structural information enables re-layout of the content in a pleasing way. Besides the article text extraction, our system includes the following components: 1) print-link detection to identify the URL <b>link</b> for <b>printing,</b> and to use it for more reliable analysis and recognition; 2) title detection incorporating both visual cues and HTML tags; 3) image and caption detection utilizing extensive visual cues; 4) multiple-page and next page URL detection.
