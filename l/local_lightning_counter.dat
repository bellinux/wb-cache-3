50|$|Lightning {{interferes with}} AM (amplitude modulation) radio signals {{much more than}} FM (frequency modulation) signals, {{providing}} {{an easy way to}} gauge <b>local</b> <b>lightning</b> strike intensity. To do so, one should tune a standard AM medium wave receiver to a frequency with no transmitting stations, and listen for crackles amongst the static. Stronger or nearby lightning strikes will also cause cracking if the receiver is tuned to a station. As lower frequencies propagate further along the ground than higher ones, the lower medium wave (MW) band frequencies (in the 500-600 kHz range) can detect lightning strikes at longer distances; if the longwave band (153-279 kHz) is available, using it can increase this range even further.|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrences of}} {{positive}} and negative polarity cloud-to-ground lightning flashes were detected by ground-based <b>lightning</b> flash <b>counters</b> CGR 4 in Brisbane, Australia. Positive (negative) flashes constituted 2 - 5 per cent (95 - 98 per cent) of total cloud-to-ground flashes. These results were compared with data obtained by a GPATS lightning location system over the period 2005 - 2008. It was found that prior to January 2007 the GPATS lightning location system was reporting an excessive proportion of ground flashes as being positive, with a correspondingly low proportion as negative. Over the same period, the CGR 4 <b>lightning</b> flash <b>counter</b> reported positive to negative ground flash ratios consistent with those obtained by other researchers both in Australia and elsewhere using a range of instrumentation. The high proportion of positive ground flashes (up to 50 per cent) recorded by the GPATS lightning location system in Australia prior to 2007 may be attributed to one or more possible factors, including (i) changes in the processing of raw GPATS sensor data implemented in January 2007, (ii) upgrades to sensor firmware, and (iii) the installation of more GPATS sensors...|$|R

Besides the {{well-known}} global excitation of the Earth-ionosphere cavity Schumann resonances (SR) in the ELF frequency band of several tens Hz (Nickolaenko and Hayakawa, 2002), <b>local</b> <b>lightning</b> transients and large ULF noise enhancement in the frequency range of several Hz in the thunderstorm proximity were observed (Fraser-Smith, 1993). A peculiar feature of the geomagnetic field variations in the ULF band just below the fundamental tone of SR is the occurrence of Spectral Resonant Structure (SRS), observed at low (Bösinger et al., 2002), middle (Belyaev et al., 1987, 1990) and high (Belyaev et al., 1999; Yahnin et al., 2003) latitudes. The lowest frequency of the SRS was about fraction of Hz, and the difference between the equidistant spectral harmonics was about 0.3 – 0.5 Hz. Analysis of the SRS at mid-latitude demonstrated evident seasonal variation in the occurrence rate with the maximum at the September–January period and almost complete absence of SRS at the spring-early summer time (Molchanov et al., 2004).

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} lightning data collected through the LDN-SIPAM, which covers considerable area of the Brazilian eastern Amazonia. Four sites were selected, among the twelve locations where its VAISALA, LPATS-IV model sensors are installed. The sites chosen were: São Luis, Belém, Paragominas and Tucuruí. They are supposed to represent an ocean-continent interface zone, an urban area {{at the mouth of}} the Amazon River, an agricultural area and a continental forest area, next to large hydro-electric dam lake. By means of a GIS software, a circle area of 30 km radius centered at each one of those four sites was drawn. For each site a separate sub-set of data was compiled with the lightning occurrences, registered during the November, 2006 to March, 2007, period. This corresponds to the transition period between the regional dry and the rainy seasons. An analysis of the time behavior of the lightning variables was made, considering the climatic and physiographic differences of the selected locations.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{wave impedance}} approach for locating close lightning strokes based on single station observation was proposed and practiced. In the approach, a lightning stroke was modelled with an electrical dipole carrying current components in VLF/LF frequency bands. For a lightning stroke, {{the ratio of}} its electrical and magnetic fields at ground is theoretically {{a function of the}} frequency and distance to the stroke. Distance of the stroke can then be obtained by fitting the theoretical function with the observed data. The approach was examined by applying it to broadband VLF/LF electrical and magnetic fields observed simultaneously at one station for several strokes in ranges of 10 - 50 km. Furthermore, a prototypal single-station lightning location system (S-LLS), which can be analogized to a modified VLF/LF broadband magnetic direction-finder programmed with the proposed lightning stroke distance determining approach, was built up and tested. Comparisons of individual stroke locations with the <b>local</b> <b>lightning</b> location network show that the S-LLS has a good location accuracy of 0. 1 - 4 km for close strokes in ranges of 15 - 60 km, but has a poor location accuracy of 12. 4 - 26 km for distant strokes in ranges of 80 - 130 km.

40|$|Significant {{temporal}} {{variability of}} the nighttime D region is well known, but its inaccessibility {{means that the}} time scales, magnitudes, and sources for that variability are not well understood. We probed the ionospheric D region by measuring the high-power broadband very low frequency (VLF) signals launched by lightning and propagating in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. We analyzed broadband sferic data of July and August 2005 recorded by our sensors located near Duke University by comparing measured sferic spectra to model results and extracted the height of an assumed exponential electron density profile for each measurement. The measured nighttime D region electron density profile heights showed large temporal variations of several kilometers on some nights and relatively stable behaviors on others. The measured hourly average heights in 260 h ranged between 82. 0 and 87. 2 km, with a mean value of 84. 9 km and {{a standard deviation of}} 1. 1 km. The maximum variation in the 5 h period was around just above 4. 0 km and the maximum variation in the 1 h period was around 1. 3 km, with sharper gradients observed over shorter time periods. We also observed spatial variability as large as 2. 0 km over 5 ° latitudes on some nights and no spatial variability on others. On some nights, the temporal variability exhibited a close correlation with the occurrence rate of lightning discharges under the probed region. This suggests that the direct energy coupling between lightning discharges and lower ionosphere can be a significant source of the D region variability. However, on other nights, the measured height temporal variability showed weak to no correlation with <b>local</b> <b>lightning,</b> displaced lightning (as would be expected for lightning-induced electron precipitation), or geomagnetic activities. These measurements suggest that nighttime D region variability may be driven by many sources. Copyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R

30|$|Some of {{the factors}} that {{distinguish}} the pine forest on Rincon Peak from others are that forests on Rincon Peak are relatively small and isolated by rugged topography. The dissected and highly variable topography of Rincon Peak produces a landscape of fragmented fuel conditions compared to other, more continuous ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forests in the southwest. As a result, forests on Rincon Peak often border non-forested areas such as steep talus slopes, rock outcrops, and chaparral (Figure 1). To the east, the study area borders steep (> 40 °) slopes sparsely vegetated with oak shrubs and stringers of Arizona cypress (Cupressus arizonica). To the west, there are steep rock escarpments with sparse vegetation, flanked by dense fields of chaparral (Figure 1). North of the study area, the topography is broken, with areas of dense oak and pinyon-juniper forest as well as some barren rock faces. Some fires probably spread from these areas into the Rincon Peak forests. It is unlikely, however, that this occurred frequently enough to support the history of frequent fires (i.e., every 10 yr to 15 yr) recorded on Rincon Peak prior to 1763. Instead, {{it is more likely that}} ignitions came primarily from <b>local</b> <b>lightning</b> strikes and from fires spreading upslope from the grassy woodlands at the southern edge of the study area. South of Rincon Peak the topography is less rugged and fuels transition from grasslands to oak woodlands and into pine forests (Figure 1). These ignition and fuel differences likely contributed to the fire history differences during certain time periods (i.e., 1763 – 1819).|$|R
40|$|A {{previous}} hypothesis advanced from observational studies such as METROMEX {{suggests that}} the intensity, frequency, and organization of cumulus convection may be impacted by the forcing of enhanced merger activity downstream of urban zones. A resulting corollary is that cities may exert an indirect anthropogenic forcing of parameters related to convection and associated phenomena such as lightning and precipitation. This paper investigates the urban merger hypothesis by examining the role of convective cell mergers on the existence and persistence of the Houston <b>lightning</b> "anomaly", a <b>local</b> maximum in cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity documented to exist over and east of Houston. Using eight summer seasons of peak columnar radar reflectivity, CG lightning data and a cell-tracking algorithm, a two-dimensional cell merger climatology is created for portions of eastern Texas and Louisiana. Results from the tracking and analysis of over 3. 8 million cells indicate that merger-driven enhancements in convection induce a positive response (O 46 %) in ground-flash densities throughout the domain, with areas of enhanced lightning typically being co-located with areas of enhanced merger activity. However, while mergers over the Houston area (relative to elsewhere in the domain) do result in more vigorous convective cells that produce larger CG flash densities, we find that CG lightning contributions due to mergers are distributed similarly throughout the domain. Hence while we demonstrate that cell mergers do greatly impact the production of lightning, the urban cell merger hypothesis does not uniquely explain {{the presence of a}} <b>local</b> <b>lightning</b> maximum near and downstream of Houston...|$|R
40|$|Seven-year {{measurements}} of precipitation, lightning flashes, and visibility from 2000 to 2006 have been analyzed in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, China, {{with a focus}} on the Guangzhou megacity area. Statistical analysis shows that the occurrence of heavy rainfall (> 25 mm per day) and frequency of lightning strikes are reversely correlated to visibility during this period. To elucidate the effects of aerosols on cloud processes, precipitation, and lightning activity, a cloud resolving – Weather Research and Forecasting (CR-WRF) model with a two-moment bulk microphysical scheme is employed to simulate a mesoscale convective system occurring on 28 Match 2009 in the Guangzhou megacity area. The model predicted evolutions of composite radar reflectivity and accumulated precipitation are in agreement with measurements from S-band weather radars and automatic gauge stations. The calculated lightning potential index (LPI) exhibits temporal and spatial consistence with lightning flashes recorded by a <b>local</b> <b>lightning</b> detection network. Sensitivity experiments have been performed to reflect aerosol conditions representative of polluted and clean cases. The simulations suggest that precipitation and LPI are enhanced by about 16 % and 50 %, respectively, under the polluted aerosol condition. Our results suggest that elevated aerosol loading suppresses light and moderate precipitation (less than 25 mm per day), but enhances heavy precipitation. The responses of hydrometeors and latent heat release to different aerosol loadings reveal the physical mechanism for the precipitation and lightning enhancement in the Guangzhou megacity area, showing more efficient mixed phase processes and intensified convection under the polluted aerosol condition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{electrostatic}} field is measured below thunderstorms at two sites in south-western France {{thanks to a}} field mill. It is recorded with a 1 -s time resolution, simultaneously to the precipitation current measured with a specific sensor. The variations of both parameters are analyzed for two cases out of three storms considered in the study. Cloud-to-Ground (CG) lightning data from Météorage network and scans from a C-band radar included in the French network ARAMIS are used to characterize the storms. The magnitude of the {{electrostatic field}} can reach large values below the weak precipitation regions compared to the convective regions: between 5 and 6 kVm− 1, and between 2 and 3 kVm− 1, respectively. The field polarity is commonly negative (downward field) but it can reverse as the rainfall carries positive charge to the ground. So, the mirror effect is generally observed between the electrostatic field and the precipitation current. The electrostatic field magnitude can indicate the presence of large amounts of charge within the weak precipitation region above, although the lightning ground strokes remain relatively far. The fast field variations produced by CG flashes are analyzed. A strong dissymmetry for both CG polarities is observed: the +CG flashes can produce larger field discontinuities (~ 10 kVm− 1) even when their striking points are at about a distance of 40 km from the sensor, while the −CG flashes produce discontinuities lower than 4 kVm− 1 even when the striking points are within 4 km around the sensor. This indicates that either the charge removed by a +CG flash can be horizontally displaced {{with respect to the}} ground stroke location, or it can be much larger compared to that removed by a negative CG flash. Our observations suggest the surface electrostatic field measured below these regions may provide valuable information for estimating <b>local</b> <b>lightning</b> risk...|$|R
40|$|The high power, {{broadband}} {{very low}} frequency (VLF, 3 [...] 30 kHz) and extremely low frequency (ELF, 3 [...] 3000 Hz) electromagnetic waves generated by lightning discharges and propagating in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide {{can be used to}} measure the average electron density profile of the lower ionosphere (D region) across the wave propagation path due to several reflections by the upper boundary (lower ionosphere) of the waveguide. This capability makes it possible to frequently and even continuously monitor the D region electron density profile variations over geographically large regions, which are measurements that are essentially impossible by other means. These guided waves, usually called atmospherics (or sferics for short), are recorded by our sensors located near Duke University. The purpose of this work is to develop and implement algorithms to derive the variations of D region electron density profile which is modeled by two parameters (one is height and another is sharpness), by comparing the recorded sferic spectra to a series of model simulated sferic spectra from using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) code. In order to understand the time scales, magnitudes and sources for the midlatitude nighttime D region variations, we analyzed the sferic data of July and August 2005, and extracted both the height and sharpness of the D region electron density profile. The heights show large temporal variations of several kilometers on some nights and the relatively stable behavior on others. Statistical calculations indicate that the hourly average heights during the two months range between 82. 0 km and 87. 2 km with a mean value of 84. 9 km and a standard deviation of 1. 1 km. We also observed spatial variations of height as large as 2. 0 km over 5 degrees latitudes on some nights, and no spatial variation on others. In addition, the measured height variations exhibited close correlations with <b>local</b> <b>lightning</b> occurrence rate on some nights but no correlation with <b>local</b> <b>lightning</b> or displaced lightning on others. The nighttime profile sharpness during 2. 5 hours in two different nights was calculated, and the results were compared to the equivalent sharpness derived from International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) models. Both the absolute values and variation trends in IRI models are different from those in broadband measurements. Based on sferic data similar to those for nighttime, we also measured the daytime D region electron density profile variations in July and August 2005 near Duke University. As expected, the solar radiation is the dominant but not the only determinant source for the daytime D region profile height temporal variations. The observed quiet time heights showed close correlations with solar zenith angle changes but unexpected spatial variations not linked to the solar zenith angle were also observed on some days, with 15 % of days exhibiting regional differences larger than 0. 5 km. During the solar flare, the induced height change was approximately proportional to the logarithm of the X-ray fluxes. During the rising and decaying phases of the solar flare, the height changes correlated more consistently with the short (wavelength 0. 5 - 4 Å), rather than the long (wavelength 1 - 8 Å) X-ray flux changes. The daytime profile sharpness during morning, noontime and afternoon periods in three different days and for the solar zenith angle range 20 to 75 degrees was calculated. These broadband measured results were compared to narrowband VLF measurements, IRI models and Faraday rotation base IRI models (called FIRI). The estimated sharpness from all these sources was more consistent when the solar zenith angle was small than when it was large. By applying the nighttime and daytime measurement techniques, we also derived the D region variations during sunrise and sunset periods. The measurements showed that both the electron density profile height and sharpness decrease during the sunrise period while increase during the sunset period. Dissertatio...|$|R

In Darwin (latitude 12 S), the lightning ground flash activity increased by over three orders of magnitude over a 7 C range of Tw,max. The corresponding increases for Coffs Harbour (latitude 30 S) and for Melbourne (latitude 38 S) were about one and a half orders of magnitude and about half an order of magnitude, respectively, each over a 10 C range of Tw,max.

The results were compared with the corresponding thunder-day data, T d, to obtain an empirical formula of the form N g = a T d b.

The derived N g values were compared with the values obtained from three other established formulae developed by earlier workers in different countries. The N g values were also compared with values derived using present methods of estimating lightning ground flash density which utilises the ratio of cloud flashes to ground flashes. Taking into account the improved method of calculation and the relatively long period of observation, we believe that the new empirical formula presented in this paper gives the best estimates of lightning ground flash density in Australia...|$|R
50|$|The {{band was}} formed in Hatch End, then in Middlesex, in July 1964 from two <b>local</b> bands, The <b>Lightnings</b> and the Madisons, who had all met at Harrow County School. The {{original}} line-up consisted of Glover on bass, Andy Ross on vocals, siblings Sheila Carter-Dimmock on keyboards and vocals and Graham Carter-Dimmock on guitar and vocals, with guitarist Tony Lander and drummer Harvey Shield. The band initially rehearsed at the Carter-Dimmocks' family house, and initial influences came from The Beach Boys, The Lovin' Spoonful and The Beatles.|$|R
40|$|Impulse over-voltages {{are very}} common {{phenomena}} in electric power systems. Switching impulses {{are created by}} switching surges or <b>local</b> faults while <b>lightning</b> impulses are due to lightning strikes to overhead lines. Both impulses can travel as waves in the system, damaging insulation components and equipment. This paper shows that {{there may well be}} a reduction in electric field strength of the insulation of a power cable that experiences a lot of lightning impulse over-voltages. The paper also provides insight into the dominant ageing processes through the analysis of dielectric spectroscopy measurement data...|$|R
50|$|The Sioux of the Standing Rock Reservation, which {{straddles}} {{the border between}} North and South Dakota, {{have a long history}} of familiarity with dinosaur bonebeds. They interpreted the bones as the remains of monstrous, evil serpents that tunneled underground. Lightning continuously sought to kill the serpents and successful kills became numbered with the abundant <b>local</b> fossils. The <b>lightning</b> had been so devastating to the area that it was responsible for the conversion of the region to badlands and the Sioux avoid physical contact with the fossils out of fear that doing so might make themselves more likely to be killed by lightning.|$|R
