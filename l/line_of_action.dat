In 2003, McFarlane was interested in creating a new video game based on the Spawn comic book franchise; his search for a developer resulted in a deal with Soul publisher Namco. When the topic of toys arose in discussions, McFarlane and Namco reached an agreement to release a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> figures based on Soulcalibur II characters. Afterward, Namco proposed that their company design a new character for video game console ports of the game, an idea that McFarlane accepted because he considered it an opportunity to create a toy based on Necrid's finished design.|$|E

25|$|As the pennate {{muscle is}} activated, the fibers rotate as they shorten and pull {{at an angle}}. In pennate muscles, fibers are {{oriented}} {{at an angle to}} the muscle's <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and rotate as they shorten, becoming more oblique such that the fraction of force directed along the muscle's <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> decreases throughout a contraction. Force output is dependent upon the angle of fiber rotation, so changes in muscle thickness and the vector of change in thickness vary; based upon the force being produced. Due to the rotational motion; pennate muscles operate at low velocities (low shortening distance). The shortening velocity of the pennate muscle as a whole is greater than that of the individual fibers. This gives rise to the property of AGR. Fiber rotation decreases a muscle's output force but increases output velocity by allowing the muscle to function at a higher gear ratio (muscle velocity/fiber velocity). Azizi and Brainerd demonstrated that the gear ratio of pennate muscle can vary; dependent on external load.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the reason}} that {{positive}} science, according to Giddens, is never possible in the social sciences: every time an investigator tries to identify causal sequences of action, the actors can change their further <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The problem is, however, that conflicting viewpoints in social science result in a disinterest of the people. For example, when scientists don't agree about the greenhouse-effect, people will withdraw from that arena, and deny that there is a problem. Therefore, the more the sciences expand, the more uncertainty there is in the modern society. In this regard, the juggernaut gets even more steerless.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Tyco Toys created a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> figures called The Incredible Crash Dummies {{based on the}} {{characters}} from the NHTSA television advertisements.

Dummies and vehicles were easily reassembled. They prompted a one-hour television special, The Adventures of the Incredible Crash Dummies. Unique for its time, the cartoon was produced entirely using 3D computer animation techniques. A comic book series and a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy were produced.|$|E
25|$|After Franco's {{death in}} November 1975 and the {{beginning}} of Spain's transition to democracy, the CNT was the only social movement to refuse to sign the 1977 Moncloa Pact, an agreement amongst politicians, political parties, and trade unions to plan how to operate the economy during the transition. In 1979, the CNT held its first congress since 1936 as well as several mass meetings, the most remarkable one in Montjuïc. Views put forward in this congress would set the pattern for the CNT's <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for the following decades: no participation in union elections, no acceptance of state subsidies, no acknowledgment of works councils, and support of union sections.|$|E
