40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{the work of}} the academician Zhang Xianglong (b. 1949), focussing on his idea of establishing a “special zone for Confucianism ” in China. Zhang argues that special protection is needed for Confucian traditions which he perceives as the <b>leading</b> <b>culture</b> of China. Confucian culture should find its way out of the museum, says Zhang. He also refers to the political concept of “one country, two systems ” that was implemented when Hongkong was restored to Chinese rule. Zhang applies this to his idea of a “special zone for Confucianism”, suggesting that this political concept could be extended to “one country, three systems”. In my view Zhang is developing new, creative ideas for possible experimental fields dealing with Confucianism {{in the context of the}} People’s Republic of China. In the end it is my argument that it would be helpful to conduct in-depth research on the possible role of Confucianism in today’s China...|$|E
40|$|Radićevoj teoriji o dvlje (odvojene) kulture: narodnoj i gospodskoj suprotstavljena je Gramscijeva teorija o suodnosu kulture vodećih i one podređenih klasa. Prikazana je razrada Gramscijeve teorije u suvremenoj talijanskoj etnologljl (Cirese, Clemente) i Burkeova hipoteza o visokoj i niskoj kulturi kao krajnjim točkama između kojih se događaju povijesni kulturni procesi. Autorica se zalaže, za suvremenu primjenu Gramscijeve hipoteze u etnologiji. Radić 2 ̆ 7 s {{concept of}} two cultures, the "elite" and other, "popular", {{is built into}} Croatian {{cultural}} and historical ethnology. It creates a closed circle within which one observes the "people", excluding research of any phenomenon which is not "popular" or genuine. Ethnology thus restricts its options for insight into and interpretation of culture. In this paper Gramsci 2 ̆ 7 s concept of a two-tiered model of culture is discussed, and contingently folklore as a concept {{of the world of}} subordinated classes. Gramsci is referring to the "folklore" of the subordinated as opposed to official concepts, to expressions of the superior and educated strata of society. According to Gramsci 2 ̆ 7 s opinion, the totality of the subordinated classes and strata, are instrumental to every form of society to date. The process of interaction, that goes on in the form of confrontation, is present in modem times as well. Seen in this light, "folklore" is close to a popular philosophy, often termed common sense, and which, to a lesser or greater degree of visibility, always maintains an active position on religion and organized or institutionalized ideologies. Therefore, in Gramsci 2 ̆ 7 s opinion, contradiction is always present in folklore, and the people are not a homogenous community. In Italian demo/ethnology Gramsci 2 ̆ 7 s ideas were formulated by A. Cirese as a correlation between the hegemonistic culture and the subaltern cultures, with which he established the basis of ethnological and folklore analysis. In cultural research the correlation of power is introduced as a variable and this correlation is not treated in a simplified manner. It is assumed, that, contrary to tendencies that are a direct expression of power, several tendencies are more likely to appear rather than a single, or a uniform one, expressing resistance and divergement from the leading ideology, culture, etc. It is also possi ble to assume various centers of power and their varied cultural interests and activity. Cirese stresses that in societes that we term "higher", the social differences, division, stratification and conflict are generally echoed by certain cultural differences, divisions, stratifications. This interaction of various social layers is manifested by unequal participation in production and use of cultural goods. In this sense he formulates the concept of "dislivello" in which the <b>leading</b> <b>culture</b> is not being considered {{from the vantage point of}} value, but from the vantage point of its position. Peter Burke also discusses the "variable" of power in his historical research of popular culture. He accepts Gramsci 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesis with a parenthesis on the simplified interpretation of what are, in essence, very complex and interwoven historical processes. Italian ethnology has already pointed this out, when it uses Gramsci 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesis as an intellectual backdrop for both historical and for contemporaryresearch of folk culture. The autor of the text agrees with this position...|$|E
