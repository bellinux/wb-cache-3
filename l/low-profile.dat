5|$|The casting of <b>low-profile</b> actors aided {{in keeping}} the {{production}} budget low by avoiding the larger salaries attached to stars. To prepare for the role and create a believable friendship between the leads, Brown, Cooper, and Mann were sent to Disneyland together and spent a weekend in a cabin at Big Bear City, California.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{to power}} of the Bolsheviks marked the turning point for the {{newspaper}} however, as the new government enacted increasingly repressive measures against the publication of dissident literature and against anarchist agitation in general, {{and after a few}} years of <b>low-profile</b> publishing, the Golos Truda collective was finally expunged by the Stalinist regime in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Murray M Chotiner (October 4, 1909– January 30, 1974) was an American {{political}} strategist, attorney, government official, {{and close}} associate {{and friend of}} President Richard Nixon {{during much of the}} 37th President's political career. He served as campaign manager for the future president's successful runs for the United States Senate in 1950 and for the vice presidency in 1952, and managed the campaigns of other California Republicans. He was active in each of Nixon's two successful runs for the White House in <b>low-profile</b> positions.|$|E
5|$|Romney raised $56million during 2011, {{more than}} double the amount raised by any of his Republican opponents, and refrained from {{spending}} his own money on the campaign. He initially pursued a low-key, <b>low-profile</b> strategy. Michele Bachmann staged a brief surge in polls, which preceded a poll surge in September 2011 by Rick Perry who had entered the race the month before. Perry and Romney exchanged sharp criticisms of each other during a series of debates among the Republican candidates. The October 2011 decisions of Chris Christie and Sarah Palin not to run effectively settled the field of candidates. Perry faded after poor performances in those debates, while Herman Cain's 'long-shot' bid gained popularity until allegations of sexual misconduct derailed it.|$|E
5|$|The son of {{a wealthy}} {{southern}} landowner, Thơ {{was born in the}} province of Long Xuyên in the Mekong Delta. He began his bureaucratic career in 1930, serving the French colonial authorities as a <b>low-profile</b> provincial chief. During World War II, Thơ rose to become the first secretary of the Resident Superior of Annam, the French governor of the central region of Vietnam. During this time, he crossed paths with Ngô Đình Diệm, a former Interior Minister under the French regime in the 1930s. The French thought that Diệm was working with Imperial Japan and tried to have him arrested, but Thơ tipped off Diệm and the Kempeitai, resulting in their escape.|$|E
5|$|When Lincoln {{failed in}} 1989 it cost the federal {{government}} over $3 billion and about 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds. In the early 1990s, Keating was convicted in both federal and state courts of many counts of fraud, racketeering and conspiracy. He served {{four and a half}} years in prison before those convictions were overturned in 1996. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to a more limited set of wire fraud and bankruptcy fraud counts, and was sentenced to the time he had already served. Keating spent his final years in <b>low-profile</b> real estate activities until his death in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Schwarzkopf {{published}} a memoir, It Doesn't Take a Hero, about his life; {{it became a}} bestseller. Schwarzkopf sold the rights to his memoirs to Bantam Books for $5,000,000. In 1993, Schwarzkopf {{was found to have}} prostate cancer, for which he was successfully treated. Among the many honors he received was the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. Queen Elizabeth II honorarily knighted Schwarzkopf and he was awarded many other military accolades from foreign countries. He led the Pegasus Parade at the Kentucky Derby and was an honorary guest at the Indianapolis 500. He supported several children's charities and national philanthropic causes, and he was a spokesperson for prostate cancer awareness, recovery of the grizzly bear from endangered species status, and served on the Nature Conservancy board of governors. Schwarzkopf otherwise sought to live out a <b>low-profile</b> retirement in Tampa, though he briefly served as a military commentator for NBC.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{there are}} three basic formats of USB connectors: the default or {{standard}} format intended for desktop or portable equipment (for example, on USB flash drives), the mini intended for mobile equipment (now deprecated except the Mini-B, which is used on many cameras), and the thinner micro size, for <b>low-profile</b> mobile equipment (most modern mobile phones). Also, there are 5 modes of USB data transfer, in order of increasing bandwidth: Low Speed (from 1.0), Full Speed (from 1.0), High Speed (from 2.0), SuperSpeed (from 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from 3.1); modes have differing hardware and cabling requirements. USB devices have some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specifications suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).|$|E
5|$|NASCAR {{spokesperson}} Jim Hunter however insisted Smith was {{not forced}} below the yellow line, and stated drivers were warned beforehand in the pre-race drivers' meeting about gaining a position illegally. Earnhardt felt Smith deserved {{to win the}} race, saying {{there was a lack}} of clarity over what going below the yellow line meant. Smith stated he did not ask for clarification of the rule because of his <b>low-profile</b> status. NASCAR president Mike Helton stated that race officials had correctly awarded the penalty to Smith, and clarified that no driver would be allowed to advance their position by going below the yellow line at any time during a race. Similarities were also made between Smith's overtake, and Earnhardt's pass of Kenseth below the yellow line at Talladega at the 2003 Aaron's 499.|$|E
5|$|Roxburgh was {{succeeded by}} Craig Brown, {{who had been}} his assistant. Brown had first joined the Scotland {{coaching}} setup in 1986, when the team was managed by Alex Ferguson. His appointment was greeted critically, as Brown had a <b>low-profile</b> career in football beforehand. Despite limited resources, Brown managed to lead Scotland to qualification for two major tournaments, UEFA Euro 1996 and the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Scotland played well in a narrow defeat against Brazil and a draw against Norway, but were eliminated after suffering a 3–0 defeat against Morocco. During 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification, Brown continued {{to rely on a}} group of ageing players, including Colin Hendry and Tom Boyd. None of his strikers were playing regularly for their clubs and the team lacked pace. Brown resigned immediately after the last qualification match.|$|E
5|$|The win {{continued}} Kiprop's meteoric rise of 2010 – a year {{in which}} he had gone from a <b>low-profile</b> circuit runner to the 10,000 metres Kenyan and African champion, with a sub-60 minute half marathon best after wins in Paris and Lille. Silver medallist Zersenay received some consolation as he was given the AIMS/Citizen World's Fastest Time Award days after the competition in respect of his position as world record holder, becoming only the second half marathon athlete to be selected for the accolade after Lornah Kiplagat. There were no surprise breakthroughs in the men's race as all the top performers were those predicted to make an impact before the race. However, there were some other achievements of note including: Kitwara's first individual medal for Kenya, personal bests for Birhanu Bekele and Tomoya Onishi in eighth and ninth place respectively, and (much further back in the field) a national record for Bhutanese racer Passang Passang.|$|E
5|$|Chapman played {{infrequently}} in 1936, and the captaincy {{was shared}} {{between him and}} two others. He was reluctant to bat, {{to the extent of}} dropping down the batting order to avoid doing so, and his friends believed that his nerve had gone. At the end of the season, he announced that business commitments forced him to give up the captaincy. Over the following three seasons, Chapman played for Kent in three more matches: against the New Zealand touring side in 1937 and in two Championship games in 1938. He also captained a non-representative England XI in a festival game against the New Zealanders in 1937, batting at number ten in the order and scoring 61. His remaining first-class matches were <b>low-profile</b> games against Oxford and Cambridge Universities; he played 13 games in his final three seasons. In his last first-class game, in 1939, he captained MCC against Oxford, scoring 12 and 0. In all first-class cricket, Chapman scored 16,309 runs in 394 matches at an average of 31.97, and held 356 catches. By the time his career ended, his weight had increased even further, and Lemmon believes that he had become an embarrassment to other cricketers. Subsequently, Chapman faded away without much comment.|$|E
5|$|Eichengrün sent ASA to Dreser's {{pharmacology}} {{group for}} testing, {{and the initial}} results were very positive. The next step would normally have been clinical trials, but Dreser opposed further investigation of ASA because of salicylic acid's reputation for weakening the heart—possibly {{a side effect of}} the high doses often used to treat rheumatism. Dreser's group was soon busy testing Felix Hoffmann's next chemical success: diacetylmorphine (which the Bayer team soon branded as heroin because of the heroic feeling it gave them). Eichengrün, frustrated by Dreser's rejection of ASA, went directly to Bayer's Berlin representative Felix Goldmann to arrange <b>low-profile</b> trials with doctors. Though the results of those trials were also very positive, with no reports of the typical salicylic acid complications, Dreser still demurred. However, Carl Duisberg intervened and scheduled full testing. Soon, Dreser admitted ASA's potential and Bayer decided to proceed with production. Dreser wrote a report of the findings to publicize the new drug; in it, he omitted any mention of Hoffmann or Eichengrün. He would also be {{the only one of the}} three to receive royalties for the drug (for testing it), since it was ineligible for any patent the chemists might have taken out for creating it. For many years, however, he attributed Aspirin's discovery solely to Hoffmann.|$|E
5|$|The son of {{a wealthy}} Mekong Delta landowner, Thơ rose through the ranks as a <b>low-profile</b> provincial chief under French colonial rule, and he was briefly imprisoned by Imperial Japan when they invaded and deposed the French during World War II. During this time he met Minh {{for the first time}} as they shared a cell. Following World War II, he became the Interior Minister in the French-backed State of Vietnam, an {{associated}} state in the French Union. After the establishment of the Republic of Vietnam following the partition, Thơ was sent to Japan as ambassador and secured war reparations. Recalled to Vietnam within a year, he helped to dismantle the private armies of the Hòa Hảo religious sect in the mid-1950s. Tho led the political efforts to weaken the Hòa Hảo leadership. While Minh led the military effort, Thơ tried to buy off Hòa Hảo leaders. One commander, Ba Cụt, was personally hostile to Thơ, whose father had confiscated the land of Ba Cụt's family decades earlier. The stand-off could not be ended peacefully in this case, and Ba Cụt was captured and executed.|$|E
5|$|The {{year after}} the Olympics, Dix began {{the season with a}} world-leading time of 10.00seconds in Tallahassee in April. He also set a world-leading relay time of 37.92seconds with Travis Padgett, Shawn Crawford and Darvis Patton at the Penn Relays. However, he failed to {{maintain}} this strong form through the rest of 2009. Coach Teddy Long planned to improve Dix's start and acceleration in his races, but the two parted company in April. He placed third behind Michael Rodgers and Asafa Powell at the Prefontaine Classic but, unusually, this proved to {{one of the highlights of}} a <b>low-profile</b> year for Dix. He competed at the US Championships, but injuries forced him out of both the 100m and 200m races and he did not qualify for the World Championships. Furthermore, he entered a legal battle with his management company, regarding whether they merited the 20% portion of his multimillion-dollar sponsorship contract with Nike. The dispute with his agent Kimberly Holland was resolved in July: although the terms were undisclosed, Dix left Holland's Icon Management and decided to be his own agent. With his father as his coach, a legal battle and no major races to prepare for, Dix ran only a handful of local meetings in the rest of 2009.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom {{possessed the}} largest navy {{in the world}} for the whole of the ironclad period. The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships, and it applied them {{worldwide}} in their whole range of roles. In the age of sail, the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy. Because of the limited endurance of steamships, this was no longer possible, so the British at times considered the risk-laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out. To this end, the Royal Navy developed a series of 'coast-defence battleships', starting with the Devastation class. These 'breastwork monitors' were markedly different from the other high-seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship. As long-range monitors they could reach Bermuda unescorted, for example. However, they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions (and enemy monitors) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War. The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of Kronstadt by the close of the Crimean War, but never considered running the smoke-ridden, shallow-water gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads. Likewise, monitors proved acutely unable to 'overwhelm' enemy fortifications single-handed during the American conflict, though their <b>low-profile</b> and heavy armor protection made them ideal for running gauntlets. Mines and obstructions, however, negated these advantages—a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period. The British never laid down enough Devastation-class 'battleships' to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg, Kronstadt or even New York City with gunfire. Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals, by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the Naval Defence Act, which promulgated the idea of a 'two-power standard', that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined. This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E
