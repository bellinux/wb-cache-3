40|$|Two recent {{sounding}} rocket experiments have yielded VLF wave data with spectral structures {{ordered by the}} hydrogen gyrofrequency. The spectral structures occur near and above the <b>lower</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>frequency</b> in association with auroral hiss. These structures are observed within and near regions of auroral electron precipitation and transverse ion acceleration. They are accompanied by auroral hiss but are anticorrelated with spectral peaks at the <b>lower</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>frequency.</b> They are typically found above 500 km altitude, have no measurable magnetic component, and are at least occasionally short wavelength. Because the spectral structures appear to be electrostatic, are ordered by the hydrogen gyrofrequency, and are short wavelength, the structures are interpreted as modes which connect the lower hybrid mode with the hydrogen Bernstein modes. A study of the plasma wave mode structure {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>lower</b> <b>hybrid</b> <b>frequency</b> is presented to substantiate this interpretation. These results imply that these waves are a common feature of the auroral zone ionsphere above 500 km altitude and exist any time that auroral hiss exists.

40|$|Whistler mode {{waves in}} the {{magnetosphere}} {{play an important role}} in the energy dynamics of the Earth's radiation belts. Previous theoretical work has been extended to include ions in the fully adiabatic warm plasma theory. Using a finite electron and ion temperature of 1 eV, refractive index surfaces are calculated for 1 - 10 kHz whistler mode {{waves in the}} inner magnetosphere (L less than or similar to 2. 5). For the frequencies of interest, a finite ion temperature is found to have a greater effect on the refractive index surface than the electron temperature and the primary effect is to close an otherwise open refractive index surface. Including a finite ion temperature is especially important when the wave frequency is just above the local <b>lower</b> <b>hybrid</b> resonance <b>frequency.</b> For wave frequencies more than approximate to 1 kHz above the local <b>lower</b> <b>hybrid</b> resonance <b>frequency,</b> including the ion temperature has a negligible effect on the refractive index surface calculation.
