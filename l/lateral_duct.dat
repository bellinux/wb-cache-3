5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of females consist of paired ovaries, lateral oviducts, spermatheca, and a genital chamber. The lateral ducts are where the eggs leave the body, while the spermatheca is where sperm is stored. Unlike other insects, the gonopore, or genital opening {{is behind the}} seventh abdominal segment. The ovaries are primitive {{in that they are}} polytrophic (the nurse cells and oocytes alternate {{along the length of the}} ovariole).

40|$|The cocoon, {{produced}} by most holometabolous insects, is built with silk {{that is usually}} {{produced by}} the larval salivary gland. Although this silk has been widely studied in the Lepidoptera, its composition and macromolecular arrangement remains unknown in the Hymenoptera. The macromolecular array patterns of the silk in the larval salivary gland of some meliponids, wasps, and ants were analyzed with polarized-light microscopy, and they were {{compared with those of}} Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera). There is a birefringent secretion in the glandular lumen of all larvae, due to filamentous structural proteins that display anisotropy. The silk in the distal, middle and proximal regions of the secretory portion of Formicidae and Vespidae glands presented a lattice optical pattern. We found a different pattern in the middle secretory portion of the Meliponini, with a zigzag rather than a lattice pattern. This indicates that the biopolymer fibers begin their macromolecular reorganization at this glandular region, different from the Formicidae and the Vespidae, in which the zigzag optical pattern was only found at the <b>lateral</b> <b>duct.</b> Probably, the mechanism of silk production in the Hymenoptera is a characteristic inherited from a common ancestor of Vespoidea and Sphecoidea; the alterations in the pattern observed in the Meliponini could be a derived characteristic in the Hymenoptera.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the liquid metal with the plasma confinement magnetic field constitutes a challenge {{for the design of}} fusion reactor blankets, due to the arise of MHD effects: increased pressure drops, heat transfer suppression, etc. To overcome these issues, a dielectric fluid can be employed as coolant for the breeding zone. A typical configuration involves pipes transverse to the liquid metal flow direction. This numerical study is conducted to assess the influence of pipe conductivity on the MHD flow and heat transfer. The CFD code ANSYS CFX was employed for this purpose. The fluid is assumed to be bounded by rectangular walls with non-uniform thickness and subject to a skewed magnetic field with the main component aligned with the cylinder axis. The simulations were restricted to Re = (20, 40) and M = (10, 50). Three different scenarios for the obstacle were considered: perfectly insulating, finite conductivity and perfectly conducting. The electrical conductivity was found to affect the channel pressure penalty due to the obstacle insertion only for M = 10 and just for the two limiting cases. A general increment of the heat transfer with M was found due to the tendency of the magnetic field to equalize the flow rate between the sub-channels individuated by the pipe. The best results were obtained with the insulating pipe, due to the reduced electromagnetic drag. The generation of counter-rotating vortices close to the <b>lateral</b> <b>duct</b> walls was observed for M= 50 and perfectly conducting pipe {{as a result of the}} modified currents distribution...|$|E
40|$|Indwelling {{catheters}} {{were used}} to collect fluid directly from the medial and lateral segments of duck nasal salt glands showing, for the first time, that the secretions are fully hypertonic before reaching the medial and <b>lateral</b> drainage <b>ducts.</b> Using this method {{it was possible to}} show that (a) there is a functional symmetry between the left and right salt glands, (b) the medial segment always secretes fluid at approximately twice the rate of the lateral segment and (c) fluid secreted by the medial segment has the same ionic composition but variable ion concentrations when compared with fluid from the lateral segment. A 12 % increase in post-segmental fluid osmolality was probably due to the evaporation of water from epithelial surfaces in the nasal cavities during breathing.

40|$|Differential autoregulation of {{androgen}} receptors (AR) {{has been}} previously described for the separate lobes of the rat prostate gland. While AR are up-regulated by testosterone in the ventral, dorsal, and LP 1 lateral lobes, the epithelial cells of the LP 2 <b>lateral</b> <b>ducts</b> show continued expression of the AR protein following androgen withdrawal. To determine the mechanism of this differential autologous regulation, the present study examined the autoregulation of AR mRNA in the separate regions of the rat prostate gland. Northern blot analysis revealed that AR mRNA levels are down-regulated by androgens in all prostate lobes, since their levels increase following cas-tration and decrease upon testosterone replacement. In situ hybridization confirmed {{that the increase in}} AR mRNA levels immediately following androgen withdrawal is due to increased transcripts per cell. When normalized to DNA content, the AR mRNA elevation upon androgen withdrawal was transient, and the value returned to control levels in the ventral and dorsal lobes within three days, while the elevation of AR message in the lateral lobe was prolonged. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction studies revealed that elevated AR mRNA levels in the prolonged absence of androgens were confined to the LP 2 <b>ducts</b> of the <b>lateral</b> lobe. Nuclear run-on experiments showed no alteration in AR gene transcription two days after castration in the ventral, dorsal, or LP 1 lateral lobes when compared to the values in intact rats, indicating that posttranscriptional mechanisms are involved in AR mRNA autoregulation. In contrast, the AR gene transcription rate doubled in the <b>lateral</b> LP 2 <b>ducts.</b> The elevated AR mRNA levels in the LP 2 ducts due to increased AR gene transcription following castration may, in part, explain the continued expression of AR protein in that region in the absence of testosterone...|$|R

Here, we report the case of a left hepatic trisectionectomy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma with a rare aberrant biliary duct of segment 5, which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been reported in previous literature. Case presentation A 56 -year-old Asian female initially presented with intrahepatic bile duct dilatation in the left lateral sector, left paramedian sector, and right paramedian sector. Simultaneous cholangiography from a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage tube in biliary duct of segment 8 and endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube in biliary duct of segment 3 revealed drainage of the right lateral sectoral branch into the common hepatic duct and the aberrant drainage of segment 5 into the right lateral sectoral branch. The left hepatic duct, right paramedian sectoral duct, and the confluence of the right <b>lateral</b> sectoral <b>duct</b> were narrowed. Left hepatic trisectionectomy was successfully performed with careful dissection and division of the aberrant biliary duct of segment 5.

40|$|During puberty, mouse mammary {{epithelial}} ducts {{invade the}} stromal mammary fat pad {{in a wave}} of branching morphogenesis to form a complex ductal tree. Using pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we find that mammary gland branching morphogenesis requires transient matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity for invasion and branch point selection. MMP- 2, but not MMP- 9, facilitates terminal end bud invasion by inhibiting epithelial cell apoptosis at the start of puberty. Unexpectedly, MMP- 2 also represses precocious lateral branching during mid-puberty. In contrast, MMP- 3 induces secondary and tertiary <b>lateral</b> branching of <b>ducts</b> during mid-puberty and early pregnancy. Nevertheless, the mammary gland is able to develop lactational competence in MMP mutant mice. Thus, specific MMPs refine the mammary branching pattern by distinct mechanisms during mammary gland branching morphogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Morphological and histochemical {{aspects of}} the early {{development}} of inner ear and adjacent ganglia have been studied in abnormal mouse embryos bearing gene Dc (Dancer) and collected at the 9 - to the 12 -day stages. Abnormalities {{have been found in}} embryos of all stages studied. Abnormal Dancer embryos (Dc/Dc and Dc/+) show a delay in neural tube closure and in cephalic neural crest migration. The developing otic region shows bilateral asymmetries. Otocyst and ganglionic defects show considerable variations, even between both sides of the same animal. Dancer embryos also exhibit a general delay in body growth and other cephalic anomalies. The invaginating otic placode does not make contact with the rhombencephalic neural wall. This defect is accompanied by a delay in otic vesicle closure and in presumptive ganglionic cells migration from the primary auditory epithelium. A delayed modelling characterizes the anterior region of the otocyst. The main structures affected are the superior and <b>lateral</b> semicircular <b>ducts</b> and the utriculus. Sensory areas of the superior and lateral ampullae and of the utricular macula show a defectuous differentiation or are missing. The posterior region of the otocyst develops normally. The lateral portion of the stato-acoustic ganglion primordium is smaller in Dancer embryos. Abnormalities also appear later on in the ganglionic lateral arm of the medial portion. The branches of the developing superior vestibular nerve may be thinner, aberrant or absent. The utricular branch is always missing. The fibers of the future inferior vestibular nerve are not affected. Certain central nerve connections are reduced or absent, or their formation is delayed in Dancer embryos.

40|$|The {{prototype}} Alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SIN), {{relies on}} cyclic transmission between the mosquito and vertebrate hosts {{in order to}} be maintained in nature. This broad host range suggests that alphaviruses use a universally expressed molecule for attachment. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), a ubiquitous SIN receptor present on the cell surface of most eukaryotic cells, has been reported in the salivary glands and midguts of mosquitoes. These organs are essential for virus transmission from this hematophageous invertebrate. Variable host cell response in the mosquito following intrathoracic inoculation with SIN has been documented. In this study, per os infection of Aedine species with variants of SIN was used to determine organ specific responses to virus as well as the temporal kinetics of SIN dissemination via leg assay. Analysis indicated AR 339 virus dissemination in samples at day 14 days post infection (p. i.). TR 339 was identified at day 12 in legs of virus fed individuals. AR 339, the HSPG adapted variant resulted in SIN-associated pathology in salivary glands of Aedes albopictus. This pathology was limited to lateral lobes, while the median lobe remained unaffected. Infection with TR 339, a HSPG-independent variant, did not result in virus-associated pathology in the salivary gland to day 28 post infection. Immunohistochemistry determined that HSPG was located in the <b>lateral</b> lobe <b>duct</b> region of the salivary glands. It has been suggested that human lactoferrin (hLF) may interfere with virus receptor attachment and is involved in inhibition of virus infection in vertebrate cells. To that end, the effects of bovine LF inhibition on virus attachment were compared between AR 339 and TR 339 in the mosquito cell line C 7 - 10. Cytopathic effect was observed earlier and with greater intensity in TR 339 infected monolayers when compared to AR 339 infected monolayers. This suggests that bovine LF has an inhibitory effect on AR 339 infection in invertebrate cells, possibly due to this variants use of HPSG for attachment...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{assessed}} {{whether the}} degree of bile-duct dilatation in liver-transplanted patients is correlated with the time from intervention {{and the type of}} underlying biliary stricture. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-seven 3 D magnetic resonance cholangiograms (MRCs) performed on 42 liver-transplanted patients were retrospectively evaluated. Diameter was measured {{at the level of the}} extrahepatic bile duct (EBD), right hepatic duct (RHD), left hepatic duct (LHD), anterior and posterior right hepatic ducts (aRHD, pRHD) and left <b>lateral</b> and medial <b>ducts</b> (LLD, LMD). Data were stratified according to the type of biliary stricture (all types, anastomotic, ischaemic-like, mixed) and compared, on a per-examination basis: (a) between two groups based on time from transplantation using a 1 -year threshold (nonlongitudinal analysis); (b) among 26 repeated examinations on 11 patients (longitudinal analysis); (c) among different stricture groups. RESULTS: The biliary tree was slightly dilated within 1 year from transplantation (2. 9 ± 1. 3 to 6. 1 ± 3. 2 mm). In general, nonlongitudinal analysis showed minimally larger duct size after 1 year (mean + 1. 4 ± 0. 5 mm) despite significant differences at most sites of measurement considering all types of strictures (p 0. 01; Kruskal-Wallis test). No significant difference in bile-duct size was observed when comparing types of stricture (p> 0. 01; Kruskal-Wallis test). CONCLUSIONS: Biliary dilatation after liver transplantation is mild and develops slowly regardless of the underlying type of stricture, possibly in relation to graft properties.

This is the first record of this zoanthid genus serving as the host of an ascothoracidan and the second species of Baccalaureus from Japan. The morphology of the adult females, nauplii, and ascothoracid larva is described based upon a detailed study combining light microscopy and SEM. The female of this new species is characterized by a coiled carapace but very short, more or less distally upturned thoracic horns, and very long, ventrally directed papillae for seminal receptacle <b>ducts</b> <b>lateral</b> to thoracopods II-IV. Much variability is recognized in the antennule, thoracopods, penis, and abdominal ornamentation. Larval specimens were individually reared in the laboratory. Six lecithotrophic naupliar instars with rudimentary endites on the antennae and mandibles are present before the ascothoracid larva. The nauplii swam for about one month without feeding until the metamorphosis to the ascothoracid larva. Naupliar instars II-VI have a sculpture of concentric cuticular ridges on the marginal area of the dorsal shield. A nauplius eye is present through all naupliar instars {{as well as in the}} ascothoracid larva.

Regarding pharyngeal anatomy, N. nawei is similar to most species of the genus, presenting a cylindrical pharynx. Considering that these features of the external morphology and pharyngeal anatomy can also occur in other genera of Geoplaninae, we found in its genital anatomy the main reasons to propose {{the inclusion of the}} new species into the genus Notogynaphallia, namely an intrabulbar prostatic vesicle broadly communicated with the folded male atrium, an eversible penis, female <b>ducts</b> <b>lateral</b> to the posterior region of the female atrium and joining each other behind it and a dorso-anteriorly flexed female genital canal, arising from the posterior region of the female atrium.

Notogynaphallia plumbea exhibits a dark grey to dark brown pigmentation on the back and greyish ventral surface. However, no clear halos occur surrounding the eyes, which are situated only along body margins (Froehlich 1956; Carbayo 2003).

Diameter was measured on thin source images at the common bile duct (CBD), right hepatic duct (RHD), left hepatic duct (LHD), anterior- and posterior-right hepatic <b>ducts</b> (aRHD,pRHD), left <b>lateral</b> and medial <b>ducts</b> (LL,LM). Presence of dilatation was assessed for peripheral ducts (2 -mm treshold). Data were stratified according to the type of stricture (all types, anastomotic, ischaemic-like, and mixed) and compared: (i) between two groups based on the timing of MRC from liver transplantation (OLT) (within or after 1 year, respectively); (ii) within types of strictures. Results: Except for the CBD and peripheral ducts, the biliary tree resulted slightly dilated within 1 -year from OLT (2. 9 ± 1. 4 - 4. 7 ± 3. 1 mm), especially at LHD and pRHD (4. 7 ± 3. 1 and 3. 6 ± 1. 9 mm, respectively). A trend towards increase in diameter after 1 -year characterized all biliary ducts, showing statistical significance for all types (p= 0. 0005 - 0. 0351;t-test) and mixed-type (0. 0002 - 0. 0394;t-test) of strictures. Increase was homogeneous for all biliary ducts and types of stricture (mean= 1. 5 ± 0. 5 mm). Biliary dilatation occurred more frequently after 1 -year in peripheral ducts (p 0. 05;ANOVA). Conclusion: Upstream dilatation in LTPs with bile-duct stricture is higher in late post-liver-transplantation period, especially for the mixed-type. MRCP is optimal as a panoramic first-line imaging evaluation...|$|R
