Midway through her answer, pageant host Paolo Bediones encouraged her off-microphone to continue in Tagalog, though she proceeded with her response in English.|$|E
5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval {{of what she was}} saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, but she did not stay to listen.|$|E
5|$|Ken Levine {{remarked that}} the whole {{audience}} laughed during the filming of an office scene between Coach and his daughter {{at the end of}} the episode. It was reshot but the audience still laughed. Glen and Les Charles decided to lift the <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> office scene, so it is not heard in the final cut. Before portraying Tim—a minor insignificant character—in multiple episodes, Tim Cunningham portrays Chuck, who works at the lab that mutates viruses. Jacqueline Cassel and Teddy Bergeron are credited as a couple, to whom Diane shows her botched artwork.|$|E

25|$|Many drum dances are {{competitive}} in nature, featuring two song cousins who humorously sing and dance, while {{pointing out the}} flaws in the other.

25|$|The {{incident}} was largely met with disbelief and <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> passengers {{and some of}} the flight attendants, as they thought it was an exercise. Passengers described two of the hijackers as calm and with a good comprehension of Swedish, while one was clearly nervous and did not understand Swedish. The hijackers calmly answered questions regarding the action and stated that they intended to have the ambassador's murderer released. They then started making references to the Munich massacre ten days earlier and hinted that a similar situation could arise in the aircraft. Passengers described the hijackers as generally friendly.|$|E

500|$|For {{a reason}} {{which was not}} specified, the sound of Lois's {{footsteps}} when going down the basement stairs during her dream of killing Stewie, had to be overcome by Stewie talking more often. This line of Stewie making general conversation in the same scene, was altered several times {{due to lack of}} <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience. MacFarlane comments that the scene of Peter standing up to his teacher who was giving the class a test, is a reference to [...] "80's TV bullshit".|$|E

Without these, [...] "the Earth will cease to exist". When Icke said laughter was the best way to remove negativity, Wogan replied of the audience: [...] "But they're laughing at you. They're not laughing with you." ...|$|E
500|$|The Earl of Essex accused Lopez {{of conspiring}} to poison the Queen in January 1594. Insisting on his innocence, {{the doctor was}} convicted of high treason in February and hanged, drawn and {{quartered}} in June, reportedly after averring from the scaffold that [...] "he loved the Queen {{as well as he}} loved Jesus Christ"—a statement that, from a man of Jewish background, prompted mocking <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crowd. Elizabeth's three-month delay signing Lopez's death warrant is sometimes interpreted as evidence that she doubted the case against him. In any case she returned almost all of his estate to his widow and children.|$|E

500|$|At the October 30, 2007 {{debate in}} Philadelphia and the November 15 debate in Las Vegas, Biden was noted for some one-liners that drew some <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience. First, when {{speaking}} about Rudy Giuliani at the Philadelphia debate, Biden stated, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11." [...] At the Las Vegas debate Biden seemed to attack all his opponents when he stated, [...] "I know there's more to say, Campbell. I appreciate {{you asking me}} the question and I'm sorry I answered it. I know you're not supposed to answer questions, based on what I've heard." ...|$|E
500|$|Lopez {{arrived on}} the red carpet of the 42nd Grammy Awards in the company of then-boyfriend Sean Combs; he was dressed in a gray suit. Although the fashion house Versace had only loaned the dress, it {{subsequently}} decided to give it away as a token of gratitude for the enormous publicity generated. The singer immediately monopolized the attention and curiosity of the public and photographers at the event. Actor David Duchovny appeared on stage with Lopez to present the award for Best R Album and declared to the audience, [...] "This {{is the first time in}} five or six years that I'm sure that nobody is looking at me", eliciting <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience and Lopez.|$|E
500|$|During his speech, Ahmadinejad criticized Israel's {{policies}} {{towards the}} Palestinians; called {{for research on}} the historical accuracy of the Holocaust; raised questions as to who initiated the 9/11 attacks; defended Iran's nuclear power program, criticizing the UN's policy of sanctions on his country; and attacked U.S. {{foreign policy in the}} Middle East. In response to a question about Iran's treatment of women and homosexuals, he asserted that women are respected in Iran and that [...] "In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country... In Iran, we do not have this phenomenon. I don't know who told you this." [...] The latter statement drew <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office accused Columbia of accepting grant money from the Alavi Foundation to support faculty [...] "sympathetic" [...] to Iran's Islamic republic.|$|E

500|$|On June 3, Biden {{participated in}} the second Democratic Debate {{featured}} on CNN, and set in the first primary state of New Hampshire. Biden discussed the War in Iraq, his recent vote to continue the funding of the troops and briefly about illegal immigration. On immigration Biden stated that it would cost too much money to send all 14 million illegal immigrants back to their native countries. He stated that those who commit crimes should be sent back and the rest {{should be given a}} pathway to citizenship. His statement: [...] "Folks, being commander in chief requires you to occasionally be practical." [...] drew some <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience. Later in the debate Biden addressed his opposition to the [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy of the military and touched on the situation in Darfur.|$|E
500|$|Vince Costello, an {{assistant}} coach with the Cincinnati Bengals, was chosen as head coach/general manager. A {{few days after the}} announcement, he turned down the job to become {{an assistant}} with the Miami Dolphins. Jack Gotta, head coach of the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League (CFL), was hired. [...] Gotta put together a solid squad, including veteran quarterback George Mira, rookie passer Matthew Reed, wide receiver Dennis Homan, running back Charley Harraway of the Redskins, and former St. Louis Cardinals and Auburn standout safety Larry Willingham. [...] Johnny Musso, a former Alabama fullback with the CFL's BC Lions, was the Americans' first round pick in the WFL's [...] "pro draft" [...] in March 1974. Birmingham selected 42-year-old retired professional basketball player and former Atlanta Hawks head coach Richie Guerin in the fortieth and last round of that draft, drawing <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience. [...] Radio play-by-play duties were handled by Larry Matson with color commentary provided by a series of guest commentators.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} [...] "Til It Happens to You" [...] {{live for}} the first time on October 29, 2015 at the annual amfAR gala, along with cover versions of [...] "Call Me Irresponsible", [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" [...] and [...] "La Vie en rose". She also performed the song at the Billboard Women in Music event on December 11, 2015, where she was presented with the award for Woman of the Year. The song was also performed at an intimate gathering at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills. The audience consisted of the filmmakers and the rape survivors featured in the documentary. Gaga reportedly became emotional while performing the song, and thanked the filmmakers for including the song in the film. She also performed the song at the 2015 Producers Guild of America Awards, where The Hunting Ground was awarded a special recognition trophy. Actress America Ferrera introduced Gaga but she did not appear on stage for sometime leading to a few moments of [...] "nervous <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience" [...] as Ferrera tried to joke about the situation, until the singer finally arrived in front of her piano on stage.|$|E
60|$|In despair I {{tried to}} force the thing, but the cold, unyielding stone might well have laughed at my futile, puny endeavors. In fact, I could have sworn that I caught the faint {{suggestion}} of taunting <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> beyond <b>the</b> baffling panel.|$|R

500|$|The play {{received}} overwhelmingly negative reviews, {{although some}} critics had minor compliments for Bara. Biographer Eve Golden described the reviews of Bara's acting as [...] "nothing less than vicious", but the commentary about the {{play as a}} whole was even more negative. Variety expected Bara to draw audiences to the theater for at least a few weeks, but said opinions in the daily press were united about how bad the play was. In The New York Times, Alexander Woollcott mocked the dialogue, which included lines such as, [...] "Have you brought the cocaine?" [...] and [...] "You make my heart laugh and I feel like a woman of the streets." [...] Delivered seriously, this dialog drew <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience. Woollcott highlighted one particular line: [...] "I'm going to be so bad, I'll be remembered always." [...] He said Bara was bad, but not bad enough to be memorable. He credited her for speaking clearly and for not losing her composure when the audience laughed at her. Other reviewers gave Bara similarly faint praise: she had [...] "average competence" [...] or [...] "was not so bad". Some complimented her looks or her glamorous wardrobe.|$|E
500|$|A general {{election}} debate, attended by party nominees Shumlin, Milne, Diamondstone and Feliciano and Independent candidates Ericson, Peters and Peyton, {{was held on}} October 9. It attracted considerable media attention and was described variously as [...] "funny", [...] "strange", [...] "crazy", [...] "one of the strangest of this election cycle", [...] "very, very special" [...] and [...] "beard-filled". Comments {{by all of the}} candidates apart from Shumlin drew media attention and <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> studio audience, such as Milne describing himself as [...] "third-generation, born in Vermont", only to correct himself and state that he was born in Brooklyn; Ericson, who sported a large bow-topped hat, suggesting that poor Vermonters use their food stamps to buy lottery tickets and decrying [...] "chemtrails"; Diamondstone, who wore jean shorts with suspenders and long socks and sported a large beard, calling for revolutionary socialism, the legalisation of all drugs and secession from the union, as well as comparing students to [...] "slaves" [...] because of the cost of higher education and responding to a question about the Department of Children and Families by railing against the U.S. military and the [...] "Zionist regime"; Peters answering a question about the affordability of college in Vermont by saying that he had [...] "no idea"; and self-described [...] "light worker" [...] Peyton shouting at Shumlin for allegedly closing highway restrooms and using her closing remarks to ask Vermonters if they'd rather choose money or love.|$|E
500|$|The Armistice renewed the {{war between}} Stengel and Dreyfuss, and the outfielder held out again to begin the 1919 season. Both wanted to see Stengel traded, but no deal was {{immediately}} made. By then, Stengel's position as regular right fielder had been taken by Billy Southworth, and he had difficulty breaking back into the lineup. Stengel played better than he had before he enlisted, {{and by the time}} Dreyfuss traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies for Possum Whitted on August 9, he was batting [...]293 with four home runs. But before being traded, Stengel pulled one of his most famous stunts, on May 25 at Ebbets Field, {{as a member of the}} visiting Pirates. It was not unusual at Ebbets Field for right fielders of either team, rather than go to the dugout after three were out, to go to the Dodgers' bullpen, in foul territory down the right field line, if they were not likely to bat in the upcoming inning. Stengel did so to visit old friends, and discovered that pitcher Leon Cadore had captured a sparrow. Stengel took it, and, called to bat in the sixth inning, quietly placed it under his cap. He received mixed boos and cheers from the Brooklyn crowd as a former Dodger, took a deep bow at the plate, and doffed his cap, whereupon the bird flew away to great <b>laughter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crowd.|$|E
