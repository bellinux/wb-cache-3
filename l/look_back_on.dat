5|$|As I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> it today, I see {{the whole}} picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be}} one of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E

For the next game, , Ubisoft allowed players to move the game camera and interact with the video while it is playing {{through the use of}} the ALIVE game engine.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute {{who at the}} age of 50 can <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{a varied}} life that has {{included}} a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War. His reputation secure, he lives quietly, on good but not close terms with his neighbours; his Roman Catholicism sets him slightly apart in the local community. He has a pronounced distaste for most aspects of modern life, and has of late become somewhat lazy, given to drinking more than he should. To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold has taken to dosing himself with a powerful sedative of chloral and bromide. He conceals this practice from his doctor.|$|E

25|$|In April 1998, the Mint {{announced}} the Millennium Coin Design Contest, a contest {{open to all}} Canadians to submit designs for twenty-four millennium quarters, one for each month of 1999 and 2000.

While the 1999 coins were labeled with their month of issue, the 2000 coins were labeled with the relevant theme (see below).|$|E

25|$|Painters {{continued}} to include Jane Seymour in pictures of King Henry VIII long after she died, mainly because Henry {{continued to}} <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her with favour {{as the only}} wife who gave him a son.

I can still appreciate how odd it was that we had the chance to do that because it doesn’t really happen in a lot of cases.|$|E
25|$|As the {{collective}} security {{system of the}} League of Nations started to crack with the Abyssinia crisis, and the approach of World War II, Sweden could <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> 120 years of successful neutralist politics – with one singular exception: the backup force on Jutland during the First war of Schleswig. Sweden now pursued a policy of forging a block of neutralist countries in Northern Europe. Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Finland and the Baltic countries were all members of this club of neutral states. Of them, only Sweden would be fortunate enough to remain unattacked during World War II.|$|E

25|$|As a group, the {{students}} were {{under the influence of}} Romanian Symbolist clubs, which were at the time the more radical expressions of artistic rejuvenation in Romania. Marcel and Jules Janco's first moment of cultural significance took place in October 1912, when they joined Tzara in editing the Symbolist venue Simbolul, which managed to receive contributions from some of Romania's leading modern poets, from Alexandru Macedonski to Ion Minulescu and Adrian Maniu. The magazine nevertheless struggled to find its voice, alternating modernism with the more conventional Symbolism. Janco was perhaps the main graphic designer of Simbolul, and he may even have persuaded his wealthy parents to support the venture (which closed down in early 1913). Unlike Tzara, who refused to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Simbolul with anything but embarrassment, Janco was proud of this moment in life, depicting it as his first participation in artistic revolution.|$|E

500|$|Neighborhoods was {{released}} to mixed reviews from critics; some {{felt it was}} a natural evolution from the band's previous releases, while others found it stale and disjointed. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and [...] "Up All Night" [...] and [...] "After Midnight" [...] were released as singles, with both attracting modest success on Billboards Alternative Songs chart. Despite this, Neighborhoods did not sell as well as earlier releases and the band would depart from Interscope the following fall. The group would later <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> their comeback album with divided feelings; DeLonge would admit that the recording methods perhaps created less unity within the group.|$|E
500|$|.....Bane {{managed to}} capture {{much of the}} ex-mayor's character: Her eyes are {{friendly}} and her hair as wild as ever. But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little too aggressive. Leaning forward, she looks {{as if she might}} take a bite out of the next passerby. Which by the way, seems appropriate when you <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work.|$|E
500|$|He {{released}} Diamond Dreams in 2008. The {{album was}} a collaboration with Kent Goodson, pianist for country star George Jones. It tells baseball stories inspired by West's umpiring career. Goodson later said, [...] "As I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> how this CD came together, I realize that I am a musician and Joe is an umpire. But {{his love for}} music and my love for baseball bonded us in this project." [...] Sports blogger Voodoo Brown described West as [...] "in creepmode from the gate." [...] Sportswriter Doug Miller said that the album was [...] "a fun, humorous and often touching collection of spoken-word gems in which the listener gets a perfect sampling of the true personality of Cowboy Joe West." ...|$|E

He is the philanderer of the nations. But a man may have learnt much about women in flirtations, and still be ignorant of first love; a man may have known as many lands as Ulysses, and still be ignorant of patriotism.|$|R

In it she said [...] "I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> my life like a good day's work, it was done and I feel satisfied with it. I was happy and contented, I knew nothing better and made {{the best out of}} what life offered. And life is what we make it, always has been, always will be."

500|$|Although {{the film}} {{develops}} on these themes of oppression, both {{the narrator and}} Pintilie <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the age of Greater Romania with a dose of nostalgia. Simon writes: [...] "What was the most horrible summer {{in the life of}} a young mother, driving her to drink and wasting away, was for her small son the most unforgettably lovely season of his life." [...] Variety argues: [...] "The frantic crescendo of the final sequence has an eerie resonance, as the narrator's final remarks reframe all that has gone before in a different, deeply ironic light." [...] Discussing this aspect, Pintilie stated: [...] "Maybe I'm even a bit perverse to begin the film in a light and playful way: people fall into the trap of thinking it's not a serious film." ...|$|E
500|$|Affleck is pro-choice. In a 2000 interview, {{he stated}} that he {{believes}} [...] "very strongly in a woman's right to choose". In 2012, he supported the Draw the Line campaign, describing reproductive rights as [...] "fundamental". Affleck was a longtime supporter of legalizing gay marriage, saying in 2004 that he hoped to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the marriage debate [...] "with some degree of embarrassment for how antiquated it was". Also that year, he remarked that it was [...] "outrageous and offensive" [...] to suggest members of the transgender community were not entitled to equal rights. He appeared alongside his gay cousin in a 2005 Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays print advertising campaign. Affleck filmed a public service announcement for Divided We Fail, a nonpartisan AARP campaign seeking affordable, quality healthcare for all Americans, in 2007.|$|E
