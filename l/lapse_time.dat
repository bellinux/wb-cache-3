40|$|The {{attenuation}} in Southeastern Sicily {{has been}} investigated using 40 aftershocks of the December 13 1990, earthquake. The quality factor of coda waves (Qc) was estimated in the frequency range 1. 5 – 24 Hz, applying three different methods in time and frequency domains. On the whole, a clear dependence of Qc on frequency was observed, according to the general law Q = Q 0 (f/f 0) n. The frequency dependence relationships obtained from the analysis of coda waves at three <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> windows (10, 20 and 30 seconds) show that, for all methods, Q 0 (Qc at 1 Hz) signiﬁcantly increases with <b>lapse</b> <b>time.</b> In particular, Q 0 is approximately 20 at short <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> (10 s) and increases to about 70 at longer <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> (30 s). This is attributed {{to the fact that}} larger lapse times involve deeper parts of the crust and upper lithosphere which may be characterized by larger quality factors. Moreover, the value of the exponent n decreases with increasing coda lengths from about 1. 3 to 0. 9, suggesting a decrease in heterogeneity of the medium with depth. Finally, Qc-values here found are of the same order as those reported from other tectonic regions like the Anatolian Highlands or Southern Spain, while signiﬁcantly higher than in the neighboring volcanic area of Mt.

These earthquakes waveforms, recorded on five broadband seismographs sited over the island {{from north to south}} during Nov. 2003 to March 2004, have been used to calculate the frequency dependent Coda Q (Qc) applying the time domain coda-decay method. The Coda Q, computed at central frequencies from (0. 5 – 12) Hz and five-lapse time windows from 40 to 80 s, progressively increases from 105 f 0. 88 in the north Andaman to 135 f 0. 79 in the south Andaman with an average of 119 f 0. 80. The average Qc values vary from 75 ± 42 at 0. 5 Hz to 697 ± 54 at 12 Hz central frequency for 40 s <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> window, while for 80 s <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> window its variation is from 117 ± 38 at 0. 5 Hz to 1256 ± 115 at 12 Hz.

Most, if not all, professional sports teams or individuals use some form of video analysis through a computer and software packages. However there is little research into the efficiency of match analysis systems, furthermore, the areas of human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence in match analysis systems have also been neglected. Human-computer interaction {{is the study of}} the relationship, which exists between human users and the computer systems they use in the performance of their various tasks (Faulkner 1998). Whilst there are many definitions of artificial intelligence, it is first important to understand intelligence. There are very many definitions of intelligence; Negnevitsky (2001) defined intelligence as, ‘The ability to learn and understand, to solve problems and make decisions. The definition offered by Lapham and Bartlett (1995) was, ‘The faculty of understanding’; ‘the action or process of understanding’. Negnevitsky considered artificial intelligence to be a science that aims, ‘To make machines do things that would require intelligence if done by humans’. Lapham and Bartlett expressed the concept as, ‘The capacity of a machine to simulate or surpass intelligent human behaviour’. This paper therefore investigates and discusses the efficiency and ergonomics of selected squash match analysis systems. The three systems analysed were Focus X 2 manual system using a mouse, Focus X 2 Voice Interactive system and the SWEAT (Murray and Hughes, 2001) system using keyboard data entry.

40|$|Seismic wave {{attenuation}} in the lithosphere {{has been}} studied in various regions by the analysis of coda amplitudes of S-waves for local earth-quakes. On {{the basis of the}} observed facts, the attenuation factor of coda waves (〓_c) is assumed to reflect the averaged 〓 for S-waves (〓_s) in an area within the ellipsoid of the scattering medium in the lithosphere. In this study, layered models of 〓_s for the lithosphere in two tectonically different regions of shield and island arc were estimated from the observed 〓_c at the various lapse times defined as 2 ̆ 7 time from origin of earthquake 2 ̆ 7. As for the representative of stable shield regions, five shallow earthquakes observed with a local telemetry seismic network around the Lutzow-Holm Bay region, East Antarctica, were re-analyzed to calculate 〓_c for the <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> ranging from 20 s to 70 s in the 4, 8 and 16 Hz frequency bands. As for the tectonic active island arc region, 〓_c for intra-plate earthquakes observed by the telemetered network in the middle and northern Kinki district, Japan was found in eight <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> ranges from 20 s to 85 s at the same three frequency bands. From the resultant 〓_s structure in both regions, it is remarkable that (1) 〓_s for each layer of the same depth in the Lutzow-Holm Bay region takes larger values than those of the Kinki district, particularly in high frequency range; (2) 〓_s for the Lutzow-Holm Bay region has a stronger frequency dependency than in the Kinki district. Another noticeable point is that 〓_s for both regions has a rapid increase near the surface layer, which is attributed to the dependence of 〓_c on <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> in the short <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> range. This is predominant in the Kinki district where 〓_s is characterized by low values in the surface layer and a noticeable increase with depth in the upper 5 km of the crust...|$|E

40|$|Weak and {{irregular}} boreal winter MJO in the NCAR CAM 3 corresponds to very low CAPE background, {{which is caused}} by easy-to-occur and over-dominant deep convection indicating the deep convective scheme uses either too low CAPE threshold as triggering function or too large consumption rate of CAPE to close the scheme. Raising the CAPE threshold from default 70 J/kg to ten times large only enhances the CAPE background while fails to noticeably improve the wind mean state and the MJO. However, lengthening the CAPE <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> from one to eight hours significantly improved the background in CAPE and winds, and salient features of the MJO. Variances, dominant periods and zonal wave numbers, power spectra and coherent propagating structure in winds and convection associated with MJO are ameliorated and comparable to the observations. Lengthening the CAPE <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> to eight hours reduces dramatically the cloud base mass flux, which prevents effectively the deep convection from occurring prematurely. In this case, partitioning of deep to shallow convection in MJO active area is about 5 : 4. 5 compared to over 9 : 0. 5 in the control run. Latent heat is significantly enhanced below 600 hPa over the central Indian Ocean and the western Pacific. Such partitioning of deep and shallow convection is argued necessary for simulating realistic MJO features.

Along the fault, the variations in the Qc with <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> are determined via, Qc = (136 ± 25) f(0. 96 ± 0. 027), Qc = (208 ± 22) f(0. 85 ± 0. 02) Qc = (307 ± 28) f(0. 72 ± 0. 025) at 20, 30, 40 sec lapse times, respectively. The estimated average frequency-dependence quality factor for all <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> are; Qc(f) = (189 ± 26) f(0. 86 ± 0. 02) for Karliova-Tokat region; Qc(f) = (216 ± 19) f(0. 76 ± 0. 018) for Tokat-Çorum region; Qc(f) = (232 ± 18) f(0. 76 ± 0. 019) for Çorum-Adapazari region; Qc(f) = (280 ± 28) f(0. 79 ± 0. 021) for Adapazari-Yalova region; Qc(f) = (252 ± 26) f(0. 81 ± 0. 022) for Yalova-Gulf of Saros region.

Data set is six crustal earthquakes observed with local telemetry network installed around Syowa Station (69 °S, 39 °E). For the crust Q_c^ is estimated as 0. 00495 f^ (f= 4 - 16 Hz) with short <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> of 20 - 40 s, and for the crust and upper mantle, 0. 00335 f^ (f= 1 - 24 Hz) with long <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> of 150 - 210 s, respectively. Essential features of our results are; (1) considerably large Q_ 0 ^ (1 Hz), (2) extremely smaller values in higher frequency range and (3) consequent strong dependence on frequency. Coda Q_c^ appears to be a geophysical measure for tectonic activity; positive correlations are reported between Q_c^ and activity; larger attenuation around 1 Hz and stronger dependence on frequency are found in the regions more active in tectonics and seismicity. The East Antarctic continental shield {{is one of the most}} aseismic areas in the world. Seismic activity around Syowa Station is also very low. Coda Q_c^ reflects absorption of medium and scattering loss of energy by heterogeneities such as perturbation of velocity and density, cracks and faults, etc. Taking account of the tectonic condition of the region, absorption caused by internal friction and crack friction must be very small in the wide frequency range of 1 - 24 Hz. Thereby, considerably large Q_c^ in the lower frequency around 1 Hz should be attributable to the scattering loss due to the heterogeneity with linear dimension longer than corresponding wave length, 3 - 4 km. The decrease of Q_c^ with <b>lapse</b> <b>time</b> suggests that the existing heterogeneity decreases rapidly with increasing depth in the lithosphere...|$|E

The fate of arsenic in environmental compartments is closely linked to the microbial transformations of the inorganic species AsIII and AsV.

The principle of the test is based on the monitoring of oxidation of 1 mM AsIII in a basal medium inoculated with environmental samples. Results are interpreted considering of oxidation rate or rate constant, and <b>lapse</b> <b>time.</b> Several phenomena are likely to influence the global oxidation rate, such as the relative activity of diverse oxidizing microbes and the competition between oxidizing and reducing processes, in relation to organic matter bioavailability. AsIII oxidizing activities of microorganisms in eight surface soils from polluted sites were quantified with and without addition of organic substrates to the basal medium. Results suggested that AsIII oxidation rate constant was limited by the low concentration of organic substrate, this limitation being removed by supplying 0. 08 g/L of organic carbon. Higher organic carbon input negatively affected AsIII oxidation rate constant.
