40|$|Link {{disclosure}} {{between two}} individuals {{in a social}} network could be a privacy breach. To <b>limit</b> <b>link</b> disclosure, previous works modeled a social network as an undirected graph and randomized a link over the entire domain of links, which leads to considerable structural distortion to the graph. In this work, we address this issue in two steps. First, we model a social network as a directed graph and randomize the destination of a link while keeping {{the source of a}} link intact. The randomization ensures that, if the prior belief about the destination of a link is bounded by some threshold, the posterior belief, given the published graph, is no more than another threshold. Then, we further reduce structural distortion by a subgraph-wise perturbation in which the given graph is partitioned into several subgraphs and randomization of destination nodes is performed within each subgraph. The benefit of subgraph-wise perturbation is that it retains a destination node with a higher retention probability and replaces a destination node with a node from a local neighborhood. We study the trade-off of utility and privacy of subgraph-wise perturbation...|$|E

Research in this area has concentrated on improving the visual organization of nodes and links according to graph drawing aesthetics criteria, such as minimizing link crossings and the longest link length. Semantic substrates offer a different approach by which node locations represent node attributes. Users define semantic substrates for a given dataset according to the dataset characteristics and the questions, needs, and tasks of users. The substrates are typically 2 - 5 non-overlapping rectangular regions that meaningfully lay out the nodes of the network, based on the node attributes. Link visibility filters are provided to enable users to <b>limit</b> <b>link</b> visibility to those within or across regions. The reduced clutter and visibility of only selected links are designed to help users find meaningful relationships.

40|$|In MANET, nodes (mobile devices) {{can move}} freely {{and hence the}} network changes it {{topology}} very frequently. Due to mobility of nodes, link expires and the node has to find another route for sending the data. So, that route must be found in which link does not expire before all the packets reach the destination. In this paper a new secure routing protocol is proposed, On-demand secure routing protocol based on LET (ODSRP-LET), {{which is based on}} Link Expiration Time (LET) for sending the data packets from source node to the destination node. The conventional routing protocols like AODV, DSDV, DSR, etc. sometimes form unreliable link which causes link breakage. To revive broken link, route maintenance activity is initiated which generates heavy control traffic. During link disconnection, loss of data packets also occurs. In this paper, a secure routing protocol is proposed which proposed to form a reliable link and link remain connected till all the packets reach the destination. The uninterrupted link time or link connectivity is determined using predicted Link Expiration Time (LET). With link reliability, security of data is also required. So, to provide security to the data of transmitted packets, asymmetric key cryptography (RSA algorithm) is used which provides confidentiality. On-demand secure routing protocol based on LET (ODSRP-LET) proposes to form reliable links to <b>limit</b> <b>link</b> disruptions. ODSRP-LET proposes to provide security as well as reliability...|$|E

This dissertation presents 5 detailed case studies (3 long-term and 2 short-term) that report on sessions with professional users working on their own datasets using successive versions of the NVSS (Network Visualization by Semantic Substrates, [URL] software tool. Applications include legal precedent (with court cases citing one another), food-web (predator-prey relationships) data, scholarly paper citations, and U. S. Senate voting patterns. These case studies, which had networks of up to 4, 296 nodes and 16, 385 links, helped refine NVSS and the semantic substrate approach, as well as understand its limitations. The case study approach enabled users to gain insights and form hypotheses about their data, while providing guidance for NVSS revisions. The proposed guidelines for semantic substrate definitions are potentially applicable to other datasets such as social networks, business networks, and email communication. NVSS appears to be an effective tool because it offers a user-controlled and understandable method of exploring networks. The main contributions of this dissertation include the extensive exploration of semantic substrates, implementation of software to define substrates, guidelines to design good substrates, and case studies to illustrate the applicability of the approach to various domains and its benefits...|$|E
