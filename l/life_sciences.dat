In this study, we examined Japanese <b>life</b> <b>science</b> researchers' attitudes towards <b>life</b> <b>science</b> {{information in}} the media. Using a semi-structured interview format, we interviewed 64 Japanese front-line <b>life</b> <b>science</b> researchers. Main topics were as follows: (1) role for <b>life</b> <b>science</b> researchers in the information transmission to society, (2) quality of <b>life</b> <b>science</b> {{information in the}} media, (3) interactions with the media.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the regional distribution of new <b>life</b> <b>science</b> company formation and highlights 'hotspots' of where new activity is relatively intense. The analysis {{indicates that there}} are generally two types of region, the first type contains <b>life</b> <b>science</b> clusters that were established during the early 2000 s and the second type displayed little or no significant <b>life</b> <b>science</b> activity during this period. This study analyses survey data (n= 580) and evidences new patterns of <b>life</b> <b>science</b> company activity within peripheral UK regions. The study shows that new <b>life</b> <b>science</b> activity is occurring away from the traditional 'Golden Triangle' of London, Cambridge and Oxford. New <b>life</b> <b>science</b> company activity {{can be found in}} peripheral regions such as the East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside, the North West and in Scotland. The evidence contained in this study suggests that new UK <b>life</b> <b>science</b> company activity is supported by the presence of UK biotechnology incubators. During the early 2000 s there were only a handful of biotechnology incubators in the UK, by 2012 there over twenty-five. This study provides evidence to suggest that UK biotechnology incubators {{play an important role in}} supporting new <b>life</b> <b>science</b> companies. Since the early 2000 s, biotechnology incubators have appeared in the same regions that display significant levels of new <b>life</b> <b>science</b> company activity. Furthermore, significant proportions of new <b>life</b> <b>science</b> companies are located in biotechnology incubators within regions that displayed little or no significant <b>life</b> <b>science</b> activity during the early 2000 s. This study demonstrates that biotechnology incubators have an important role to play in supporting regional innovation systems, especially within peripheral regions in the UK...|$|R
