50|$|A <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> is a {{computer}} printer that is a compromise between a line printer and a dot matrix printer. Basically, it prints a page-wide line of dots. It builds up a line of text by printing lines of dots.|$|E
50|$|For years laser {{printers}} {{have been the}} popular choice, however line matrix printers have improved technological aspects and now claim to hold significant benefits over {{laser printers}} in terms of energy savings, cost per page, reliability in industrial environments and media flexibility (multi part forms, oversize media, peel off labels, cloth, or card stock). Every aspect of the <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> is designed to deliver higher reliability, fast throughput, and greater resistance to rough handling and hazardous environmental conditions. The result is a product that provides a substantially lower cost {{over the life of}} the product. Industry today continues to use line matrix in the print production of mission critical business document production. These documents are critical to keeping the enterprise operation functioning. If these documents don't print the business workflow stops.|$|E
50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> {{are used}} for {{high-speed}} printing applications in industries such as manufacturing, banking, supply chain and back office environments. In these high-volume printing industries, <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> are used to produce invoices, bank statements, product shipment and transportation documentation as well as product compliance labels.|$|R

50|$|Printronix is an American {{supplier}} of <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers.</b> For more than 40 years, Printronix has been addressing global customer {{needs in the}} supply chain space by providing enterprise grade industrial printing solutions. Featuring robust energy-saving <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers,</b> Printronix products streamline operations, reduce costs and help organizations sharpen their competitive edge.|$|R
50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> {{can print}} text, bar codes and graphics. <b>Line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> were {{originally}} popularized by the mini-computer craze and continued its growth as {{a bar code}} printer. Today they are sold in virtually {{every corner of the}} world and while they print as rapidly as line printers, they can print bar codes and other graphics as well. When implemented as impact printers, they can be the least expensive to operate per page.|$|R
5000|$|Often {{considered}} the [...] "backbone" [...] of many industrial and back-office systems, {{there are several}} types of <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> used today across diverse enterprise production environments including: manufacturing, supply chain, distribution & logistics, transportation, finance and banking. Dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers,</b> also known also as impact printers, represent the oldest printing technology, are still widely used today, due to its lowest 'cost per page' ratio. Dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> are divided on two main groups: serial dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> and <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> [...] <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{printing}} {{speed of}} serial dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> with moving heads varies from 30 to 1550 cps. In contrast to this, <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> {{are capable of}} printing much more than 1000 cps, resulting in a throughput of up to 800 pages/hour.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 6400 {{family of}} <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> are modern {{highspeed}} business computer printers introduced by IBM in 1995. These printers {{are designed for}} use on a variety IBM systems including mainframes, servers, and PCs.|$|R
50|$|Comb <b>printers,</b> {{also called}} <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers,</b> {{represent}} the fifth major design. These printers are {{a hybrid of}} dot <b>matrix</b> printing and <b>line</b> printing. In these printers, a comb of hammers prints {{a portion of a}} row of pixels at one time, such as every eighth pixel. By shifting the comb back and forth slightly, the entire pixel row can be printed, continuing the example, in just eight cycles. The paper then advances and the next pixel row is printed. Because far less motion is involved than in a conventional dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printer,</b> these printers are very fast compared to dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> and are competitive in speed with formed-character line printers while also being able to print dot matrix graphics. The Printronix P7000 series of <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> are still manufactured as of 2013.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the merger}} of Tally and Genicom on August 7, 2003, GENICOM LP, was one of leading {{manufacturers}} of printers. The company designed and marketed {{a wide range of}} high-performance laser, serial and <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> that it offered with a complementary line of consumables, parts and services.|$|R
5000|$|Both <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> and serial dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers,</b> use pins {{to strike}} against the inked ribbon, making dots {{on the paper}} and forming the desired [...] characters. The {{differences}} are that <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> use a hammer bank (or print-shuttle) instead of print head, this print-shuttle has hammers instead of print wires, and these hammers are arranged in a horizontal row instead in vertical column. The hammer bank uses the same technology as the permanent magnet print head with the small difference that instead of print wires the print-shuttle has hammers.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 6400 series <b>printers</b> are <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> {{manufactured}} by Printronix Corpand rebranded for IBM. All internal parts have the Printronix Logo and/or artwork.Although they once did, IBM no longer manufactures printers. One {{of their old}} printer divisionsbecame Lexmark The other became the IBM Printing Systems Division, which was recently spun off to Ricoh. IBM now uses several different manufacturers to fill their printerrequirements under the IBM brand.|$|R
50|$|A {{stored energy}} printer is a {{computer}} printer that uses the energy stored in a spring or magnetic field to push a hammer through a ribbon to print a dot. As compared to dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> that print a single column of dots at a time, this printer generally creates an entire line of dots at a time. Therefore, it {{is also known as}} a <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers.</b> This technology produces premium impact printers that print for millions to billions of dots per hammer. The advantage of this technology is that it has the lowest known cost of ownership: ink is transferred by conventional typewriter-style ribbons.|$|R
50|$|Comb <b>printers,</b> {{also called}} <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers,</b> printed a <b>matrix</b> of dots instead of {{individual}} {{characters in the}} same way as single-character dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers,</b> but using a comb of hammers to print a portion of an entire row of pixels at one time (for example, every eighth pixel). By shifting the comb back and forth slightly, the entire pixel row could be printed (continuing the example, in eight cycles). The paper then advanced and the next pixel row was printed. Because far less print head motion was involved than in a conventional dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printer,</b> these printers were much faster, and competitive in speed with formed-character line printers without being restricted to a set of available characters, thus being able to print dot-matrix graphics and variable-sized characters.|$|R

Printronix now owns the intellectual property and worldwide sales distribution rights for TallyGenicom <b>line</b> <b>matrix</b> and laser technologies, including printers, supplies and consumables. TallyGenicom AG retained all intellectual property and worldwide distribution {{rights for the}} TallyGenicom serial matrix, inkjet and thermal technologies, including printers and options, supplies and consumables. [...] In June 2009, DASCOM acquired the key assets of TallyGenicom AG and TallyGenicom Computerdrucker GmbH {{in order to establish}} its European operation, which is named DASCOM Europe. DASCOM Europe manufacture and market a range of dot matrix, passbook, flatbed, mobile and thermal printers under both the 'Tally' and 'Tally Dascom' brand names.

50|$|The ImageWriter is {{a product}} <b>line</b> of dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> {{formerly}} manufactured by Apple Computer and then designed to be compatible with their entire line of computers. There were three different models introduced over time, which were mostly popular among Apple II and Macintosh owners.|$|R
50|$|In a {{considerably}} different configuration, so called <b>line</b> dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> use a fixed print head almost {{as wide as}} the paper path utilizing a horizontal line of thousands of pins for printing. Sometimes two horizontally slightly displaced rows are used to improve the effective dot density through interleaving. While still line-oriented, these printers for the professional heavy-duty market effectively print a whole line at once while the paper moves forward below the print head.|$|R
50|$|Using GML, a {{document}} is marked up with tags that define what the text is, {{in terms of}} paragraphs, headers, lists, tables, and so forth. The document can then be automatically formatted for various devices simply by specifying a profile for the device. For example, {{it is possible to}} format {{a document}} for a laser printer or a <b>line</b> (dot <b>matrix)</b> <b>printer</b> or for a screen simply by specifying a profile for the device without changing the document itself.|$|R
5000|$|Impact {{printers}} {{rely on a}} forcible {{impact to}} transfer ink to the media. The impact printer uses a print head that either hits {{the surface of the}} ink ribbon, pressing the ink ribbon against the paper (similar to the action of a typewriter), or, less commonly, hits the back of the paper, pressing the paper against the ink ribbon (the IBM 1403 for example). All but the dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> rely on the use of fully formed characters, letterforms that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing. In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome, or sometimes two-color, printing in a single typeface at one time, although bolding and underlining of text could be done by [...] "overstriking", that is, printing two or more impressions either in the same character position or slightly offset. Impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, daisywheel <b>printers,</b> dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> and <b>line</b> <b>printers.</b> Dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed. An overview of impact printing contains a detailed description of many of the technologies used.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} software {{developed for}} atmospheric cloud microphysics experiments {{conducted in the}} laboratory as well as aboard a KC- 135 aircraft is described. A group of four programs was developed and implemented on a Hewlett Packard 1000 series F minicomputer running under HP's RTE-IVB operating system. The programs control and read data from a MEMODYNE Model 3765 - 8 BV cassette recorder, format the data on the Hewlett Packard disk subsystem, and generate statistical data (mean, variance, standard deviation) and voltage and engineering unit plots on a user selected plotting device. The programs are written in HP FORTRAN IV and HP ASSEMBLY Language with the graphics software using the HP 1000 Graphics.
