5000|$|Much work in database-systems has {{aimed at}} {{efficient}} implementation of joins, because relational systems commonly call for joins, yet face difficulties in optimising their efficient execution. The problem arises because inner joins operate both commutatively and associatively. In practice, {{this means that}} the user merely supplies the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>tables</b> for joining and the join conditions to use, and the database system has the task of determining {{the most efficient way to}} perform the operation. A query optimizer determines how to execute a query containing joins. A query optimizer has two basic freedoms: ...|$|E
50|$|Autocompletion in {{database}} query tools {{allows the}} user to autocomplete the table names in an SQL statement and column names of the tables referenced in the SQL statement. As text is typed into the editor, {{the context of the}} cursor within the SQL statement provides an indication of whether the user needs a table completion or a table column completion. The table completion provides a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>tables</b> available in the database server the user is connected to. The column completion provides a list of columns for only tables referenced in the SQL statement. SQL Server Management Studio provides autocomplete in query tools.|$|E

The second edition's revised Dungeon Master Screen & Master Index contains a screen and an index. There are two screens included with a complete <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>tables</b> for quick reference including every table: critical hits, miscellaneous equipment and the location of various planes. The two indices contained within the Master Index codify rules and lists from the seven core second edition books, detailing every rule, adjustment, bonus, modifier, magic item, spell and scroll in alphabetical order and cross-referenced with their location in the books.|$|E
50|$|This 128-page book {{begins with}} a table of {{contents}} with a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>tables</b> found in the book, followed by a brief introduction on page 4. Chapter 1: Building a Stronghold (pages 4-14) details a step-by-step process by with DMs and players can design a stronghold. Notes provided include how to stock the structure with gear and fill it with people, and figuring how much it costs. Chapter 2: Stronghold Components (pages 14-86) describes where and how to place items such as walls and doors, and various locations that can be placed within a stronghold. Also described are {{suggestions on how to}} place magic items, spells, traps, and siege weapons in a stronghold. Chapter 3: Strongholds in Your Campaign (pages 87-104) includes tips for building a campaign with a stronghold as the setting, as well as how to use the book in adventures that have already been established. This chapter also details how a stronghold can be attacked or defended during combat. Chapter 4: Example Strongholds (pages 104-128) provides room-by-room descriptions and maps for five detailed structures {{that can be used in}} a campaign. These include a simple keep, an undersea castle made of coral, a dwarven redoubt, a floating tower, and a citadel of the planes.|$|E
