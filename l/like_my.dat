But the original writers were happy {{for me to do}} that—Cher didn't actually write it so she didn't get approval about what happened to the song. Now apparently she's heard what I've done and she doesn't like it.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the first}} Miss World contest (originally the Festival Bikini Contest), was {{organized}} by Eric Morley. When the winner, Kiki Håkansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. Håkansson remains {{the first and last}} Miss World to be crowned in her bikini, a crowning that was condemned by Pope Pius XII who declared the swimsuit to be sinful. Bikinis were banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy. In 1949 the Los Angeles Times reported that Miss America Bebe Shopp on her visit to Paris said she did not approve the bikini for American girls, though she did not mind French girls wearing them. Actresses in movies <b>like</b> <b>My</b> Favorite Brunette (1947) and the model on a 1948 cover of LIFE were shown in traditional two-piece swimwear, not the bikini.|$|E

25|$|In the 2000s McGann's film {{appearances}} {{began to}} increase with films <b>like</b> <b>My</b> Kingdom (2001), Listening (2003) and Gypo (2005). Perhaps his most iconic role since Doctor Who came in 2002, when McGann {{appeared in the}} film adaptation of the third story from Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles, Queen of the Damned. McGann played the part of David Talbot, {{a member of the}} secret organisation the Talamasca, which researches and investigates the supernatural. Talbot has appeared in many of Rice's novels and has become a central character over the years. The film also starred Stuart Townsend, Marguerite Moreau and R singer Aaliyah. McGann has also been in demand for voice-over work in Britain in recent years, particularly on television documentaries and commercials.|$|E
25|$|The records between 1998 and 2000 {{showed the}} basis of the Magnétophone sound to be rooted in the {{electronic}} field, but it was also moving outside of it as its 'organic-ness' and obvious human intervention and performance appeared to be informed by guitar bands <b>like</b> <b>My</b> Bloody Valentine and MC5, and it is this that separates them from other electronica records of the same period and which caught the attention of 4AD's A department. These records were still instrumental and took in elements of drum'n'bass, IDM, ambient-techno and avant-garde sound sculpting, and were tied together by strong, though sometimes hidden or intermittent melodies. The pieces were performed live and captured as whole performances, rather than being multi-tracked. John Peel was an ardent supporter of the band's output at this time and they recorded two Peel sessions, one at the BBC Maida Vale Studios, and one at the Irish Centre in a live performance in Birmingham in 2000.|$|E

500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{a nearly}} five-minute long R song. The first verse {{of the song}} begins with Beyoncé reminiscing about the times she and her father/manager, Mathew Knowles shared {{as a child and}} through her adolescence. She sings about wanting to be with a man and a child who has similar qualities as her father. This is {{illustrated}} in the lyrics: [...] "I treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why I want my unborn son to be <b>like</b> <b>my</b> daddy, I want my husband to be <b>like</b> <b>my</b> daddy, there is no one else <b>like</b> <b>my</b> daddy." [...] According to Marc Anthony Neal of the PopMatters, Beyoncé also confidently embraces her womanhood in the song. In a way, Beyoncé pays tribute to her father through this song.|$|E
