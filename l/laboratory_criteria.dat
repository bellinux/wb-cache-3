Participants: Convenience sample of 332 patients presenting to the ED with possible coronary syndromes. Results: Spearman correlation coefficient for experienced versus laboratory was 0. 83 (95 % CI 0. 78 – 0. 87), occasional users versus laboratory was 0. 76 (95 % CI 0. 71 – 0. 81), and experienced versus occasional users on POC was 0. 82 (95 % CI 0. 76 – 0. 87). Using local troponin cut-off of 0. 1 ng/mL, kappa coefficient was 0. 94 for occasional users versus laboratory, 0. 91 for experienced versus laboratory and 0. 94 for experienced versus occasional users. Bland–Altman plots showed good agreement across {{the range of}} measured values. The sensitivity of i-Stat (vs <b>laboratory</b> as <b>criterion</b> standard) was 92. 2 % (95 % CI 83. 8 %– 97. 0 %) with the local cut-off but only 70. 1 % (95 % CI 60. 5 %– 78. 6 %) using the lowest cut-off associated with acceptable reproducibility (10 % coefficient of variation). Conclusions: The i-Stat POC device produces similar results {{in the hands of}} experienced and occasional operators in ED.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} fetal and neonatal deaths among patients with maternal near miss and the factors associated with this fatal outcome. MethodsThe authors conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional, analyzing medical records of patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary obstetric Recife (Brazil), between January 2007 and December 2010, who {{had at least one}} criterion of near miss defined by WHO. Statistical analysis was performed with Epi-Info 3. 3. 2, using chi-square and Fisher's exact test, considering a significance level of 5 %. For multivariate analysis was constructed as a hierarchical model with the response variable fetal and neonatal deaths. ResultsWe included 246 cases of maternal near miss. Among women in the study, hypertensive disorders occurred in 62. 7 % to 41. 2 % in HELLP syndrome and the <b>laboratory</b> <b>criteria</b> for near miss in 59. 6 %. There were 48 (19. 5 %) stillbirths and 19 (7. 7 %) neonatal deaths.

40|$|Abstract: Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APS) is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} cause of antibody-mediated thrombosis manifesting in venous thrombosis (DVT and PE), arterial thrombosis (most commonly stroke), and pregnancy complications. The diagnosis of definite APS requires both clinical and <b>laboratory</b> <b>criterion</b> as established by the working group of the International Congress on Antiphospholipid Antibodies (based on expert opinion). Since thrombosis and pregnancy loss are common in the general population, and antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) occurs in {{a small percentage of}} the healthy public, it is important to demonstrate antibody persistence in patients who have the proper clinical indications in order to avoid misdiagnosis. Unfortunately, laboratory testing in this area lacks standardization, resulting in wide inter-laboratory variance. However, due to the commercialization of tests and automation, inter-laboratory variance has improved. Data on several new non-criterion tests suggest that they may improve the specificity or risk stratification for thrombosis. A new guidance document on aPL testing strives to achieve better consistency, but much work remains to be done in the area of standardization...|$|R
40|$|Antiphospholipid {{syndrome}} (APS) is an {{autoimmune disease}} with recurrent thromboses and pregnancy complications (90 % are female patients) {{that can be}} primary and secondary (with concomitant autoimmune disease). Antiphospholipid antibodies are prothrombotic but also act directly with brain tissue. One clinical and one <b>laboratory</b> <b>criterion</b> {{is necessary for the}} diagnosis of APS. Positive serological tests have to be confirmed after at least 12 weeks. Clinical picture consists of thromboses in many organs and spontaneous miscarriages, sometimes thrombocytopaenia and haemolytic anaemia, but neurological cases are the most frequent: headaches, stroke, encephalopathy, seizures, visual disturbances, Sneddon syndrome, dementia, vertigo, chorea, balism, transitory global amnesia, psychosis, transversal myelopathy and Guillain-Barre syndrome. About 50 % of strokes below 50 years of age are caused by APS. The first line of therapy in stroke is anticoagulation: intravenous heparin or low-weight heparins. In chronic treatment, oral anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy are used, warfarin and aspirin, mostly for life. In resistant cases, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis are necessary. Prognosis is good in most patients but some are treatment-resistant with recurrent thrombotic events and eventually death...|$|R

30|$|A {{particular}} effort {{should be}} paid to seek {{for the presence of}} streptococci (GAS, essentially) from sterile since its presence defines “confirmed” cases of STSS (Table  1). The presence of GAS in non-sterile site defines “probable” cases in addition to clinical criteria. Similar to other types of infections, bacterial cultures (including blood cultures) should be performed rapidly, and prior to the administration of antibiotics. Depending on the suspected source of infection, the following sites should also be cultures: skin, deep soft tissue, peritoneal fluid, urine, sputum, pharyngeal swab, and synovial fluid. Antibiotics must be administered as soon as possible, just after the first blood culture, in case of high suspicion of streptococcal invasive infection with or without shock. Blood cultures will come back positive in about half of all cases with streptococcal STSS. Of note, staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome is rarely associated with positive blood cultures, being a “purer” toxin disease. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>criterion</b> for STSS diagnosis is “positive” if GAS is isolated in any microbiological test from sterile sites.|$|R

40|$|A {{debate on}} {{updating}} the <b>laboratory</b> <b>criteria</b> of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was recently opened in view {{to lower the}} risk of over diagnosis of the syndrome. Based on data related to thrombotic APS, it proposes the exclusion of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-beta 2 -glycoprotein 1 (a-beta 2 -GPI) IgM detection. Here, we examine this possibility in a study which focuses on obstetrical APS (OAPS). We report new data on a prospective multicenter European cohort of 109 pregnant women having APS. Among them, 73 had purely obstetrical APS, not associated to autoimmune diseases or thrombosis. Isolated antibodies and isolated aCL positivity were present in 50 / 109 (46 %) and in 34 / 109 (31 %) of the women, respectively. An isolated a-beta 2 -GPI IgM was present in three women. These results suggest that aCL and a-beta 2 -GPI IgM cannot be dropped for the diagnosis and classification of OAPS. The low level of some antibodies associated with severe obstetrical complications raise the issue of keeping or not the same <b>laboratory</b> <b>criteria</b> for OAPS and for thrombotic APS and whether additional criteria after large prospective studies could further improve diagnosis...|$|E
