5|$|Richard Vines, whilst {{writing for}} Bloomberg, advised readers {{to not be}} put off the hype; and while the courses are not as <b>life</b> <b>changing</b> as those served at The Fat Duck, there are stand out dishes such as the meat fruit and the tipsy cake.

Marina O'Loughlin visited the restaurant twice for the Metro newspaper, once just after opening and again several months later to compare how it had settled in. She thought it was a well-oiled operation, but a little too much so, and questioned the originality of it as a version of the meat fruit had previously been available at the restaurant Amber in another Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong and little touches as the years of origin which appear next to the menu items have been used before by Marco Pierre White. Jan Moir for The Daily Mail thought that the ice cream trolley was a sensation, along with the meat fruit, but could not understand the reason behind recreating the salamagundy dish.|$|E
5|$|Coulter {{appeared}} as a contestant on the Australian reality television show Celebrity Circus in May 2005, alongside eight other celebrities. The show's task was to train contestants as circus performers. In February 2008, she was a mentor on the third season of the celebrity singing show, It Takes Two, and was partnered with professional golfer and tennis player Scott Draper. Coulter and Draper were the third duo to be eliminated from the competition on 4 March. Later that year, she returned to Australian Idol as a host and reporter alongside James Mathison and Andrew Günsberg. Coulter co-hosted the show for two seasons, and received a nomination at the 2009 Logie Awards for Most Popular New Female Talent. Coulter became a mentor for the first season of The Voice Australia in 2012, and paired up with coach Seal to prepare the contestants in his team for the show's battle rounds. In 2014, Coulter became a contestant on the fourteenth season of Dancing with the Stars Australia and was partnered with professional dancer Jarryd Byrne. She {{made it to the}} grand finale and placed third in the competition. Coulter hosted the television program <b>Life</b> <b>Changing</b> Adventures, which premiered on 7Two on 11 June 2017. Filmed in New Zealand's South Island in April 2015, the show featured nine ordinary Australians taking on challenges to raise money and awareness for the CanDo4Kids charity.|$|E

The model is structured according to three risk factor groups including molecular structure, body system vital sign and bioenergy symphony. The model had also been compared with 5 existing models. Comparison results show that the model has better structure, adaptability and accessibility. Validation test using 120 subjects shows that the model prediction accuracy is 96. 2 %. This shows that the model is suitable to be used widely for CHD risk prediction both healthy and risk subjects as a preventive method in getting CHD in the earlier age...|$|R

5|$|In 1750 Rückerschöld married Jonas Jakobsson Dahl, an {{accountant}} {{employed by the}} high court in Stockholm. Dahl was educated at Uppsala University and {{was the son of}} a factory owner. Rückerschöld kept her maiden name throughout her <b>life,</b> <b>changing</b> it only after her father was knighted in 1751 and -schöld ("shield") was added to his last name. Rückerschöld was 25 years old when she married and Dahl 33, eight years her senior. The couple had their first child, Emerentia, in 1751, and moved to Sätra gård in modern-day Upplands Väsby, north of Stockholm in 1760. Rückerschöld gave birth to three more children between 1759 and 1765, Maria, Fredrica and Christopher. A fourth child, Chierstin, died only seven hours after her birth. The other three children reached adulthood. Emerentia married a lawspeaker in Småland while her sister Maria Fredrica remained a spinster. Christopher went to sea, but was never heard from after that. The family moved from Sätra gård to Stockholm. The earliest record of their residence in Stockholm is from 1775, and the couple remained there the rest of their lives. Both parents survived their children; Dahl died in 1796 and Rückerschöld nine years later, in 1805, at the age of 80.|$|E

25|$|Although {{she became}} known first and {{foremost}} as an author, Tove Jansson considered her careers as author and painter to be of equal importance. She painted her whole <b>life,</b> <b>changing</b> style from the classical impressionism of her youth to the highly abstract modernist style of her later years. Jansson displayed a number of artworks in exhibitions during the 1930s and early 1940s, and her first solo exhibition was held in 1943. Despite generally positive reviews, criticism induced Jansson to refine her style such that in her 1955 solo exhibition her style had become less overloaded in terms of detail and content. Between 1960 and 1970 Jansson held five more solo exhibitions.|$|E

In its year-end music review for 2008, Under the Radar stated about the band members, [...] "They are so solid and so confident that it seems inevitable that they will get many chances to slowly drift into more daring lands. But without more risk, they may be destined to make albums like Intimacy – accomplished and intriguing, but not <b>life</b> <b>changing,</b> not classic." [...] The record figured in several publications' end-of-year best album lists for 2008—notably, at number14 by Gigwise, at number36 by Drowned in Sound, and at number49 by NME.|$|E

In a {{departure}} from Green, the band members often wrote the music with non-traditional rock instrumentation including mandolin, organ, and acoustic guitar instead of adding them as overdubs later in the creative process. Released in March 1991, Out of Time was the band's first album to top both the US and UK charts. The record eventually sold 4.2million copies in the US alone, and about 12 million copies worldwide by 1996.
