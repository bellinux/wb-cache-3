Recent studies demonstrated, by means of KI (Kübler Index) data, that the locations of this boundary given in the maps are uncorrect, and that the boundary occurs more eastwards than previously suggested, mainly in correspondence of the Val Bordaglia Line. The present review critically summarizes all data existing in the literature (Kübler Index, Árkai Index, vitrinite reflectance, Colour Alteration Index of Conodonts, fluid inclusions) concerning the location of the eastern boundary of the Hercynian metamorphism, and discusses the occurrence and possible significance of a <b>local</b> Alpine <b>overprint</b> to the east of the Val Bordaglia Line...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{discovery}} of lawsonite eclogite is presented from the Lancône glaucophanites within the Schistes Lustrés nappe at Défilé du Lancône in Alpine Corsica. The fine-grained eclogitized pillow lava and inter-pillow matrix are extremely fresh, showing very {{little evidence of}} retrograde alteration. Peak assemblages in both the massive pillows and weakly foliated inter-pillow matrix consist of zoned idiomorphic Mg-poor (< 0. 8 wt% MgO) garnet + omphacite + lawsonite + chlorite + titanite. A <b>local</b> <b>overprint</b> by the lower grade assemblage glaucophane + albite with partial resorption of omphacite and garnet is locally observed. Garnet porphyroblasts in the massive pillows are Mn rich, and show a regular prograde growth-type zoning with a Mn-rich core. In the inter-pillow matrix garnet is less manganiferous, and shows a mutual variation in Ca and Fe with Fe enrichment toward the rim. Some garnet from this rock type shows complex zoning patterns indicating a coalescence of several smaller crystallites. Matrix omphacite in both rock types is zoned with a rimward increase in XJd, locally with cores of relict augite. Numerous inclusions of clinopyroxene, lawsonite, chlorite and titanite are encapsulated within garnet in both rock types, and albite, quartz and hornblende are also found included in garnet from the inter-pillow matrix. Inclusions of clinopyroxene commonly have augitic cores and omphacitic rims. The inter-pillow matrix contains cross-cutting omphacite-rich veinlets with zoned omphacite, Si-rich phengite (Si = 3. 54 apfu), ferroglaucophane, actinolite and hematite. These veinlets are seen fracturing idiomorphic garnet, apparently without any secondary effects. Pseudosections of matrix compositions for the massive pillows, the inter-pillow matrix and the cross-cutting veinlets indicate similar P-T conditions with maximum pressures of 1. 9 - 2. 6 GPa at temperatures of 335 - 420 °C. The inclusion suite found in garnet from the inter-pillow matrix apparently formed at pressures below 0. 6 - 0. 7 GPa. Retrogression during initial decompression of the studied rocks is only very local. Late veinlets of albite + glaucophane, without breakdown of lawsonite, indicate that the rocks remained in a cold environment during exhumation, resulting in a hairpin-shaped P-T path...|$|R
40|$|Hydrological {{changes that}} {{occurred}} during the last 4700 years have been reconstructed using multi-proxy analyses of sediment cores from the volcanic crater lake of Laguna Cháltel (50 °S, 71 °W). The chronology is based on AMS 14 C age modeling constrained by paleomagnetic secular variations. Chemical and physical properties of the lake water together with results of lake-water surface-temperature monitoring, as well as sediment characteristics reveal conspicuous features archived as different sedimentary carbonate phases and morphologies which are attributed to lake-level changes. Sedimentological, geochemical and biological proxies together suggest the development from an initial playa lake-phase towards a system with progressively rising lake level. In detail, proxies indicate the existence of an ephemeral lake since 4700 cal BP until a glauberite-bearing carbonate crust formed around 4040 cal BP which probably is associated to the globally recognized 4. 2 ka event. This crust is interpreted as a desiccation event terminating the ephemeral lake phase. Following this desiccation a shift towards conditions with a positive hydrological balance of Laguna Cháltel occurs, which leads {{to the development of a}} saline lake with ooid formation between 4040 and 3200 cal BP. Further lake-level increase with initially high minerogenic input until 2700 cal BP resulted in a lake freshening which allowed the preservation of diatoms. Sigmoidal and star shaped carbonate crystals occurred until 1720 cal BP indicating a syn- or post-depositional formation of ikaite. Anoxic conditions and increased deposition of clay and sand through fluvial and eolian input are interpreted as a further lake-level rise and/or a prolonged winter ice cover culminating during the Little Ice Age. The highest lake level was probably reached at that time and since then dropped to its present day height. Previous studies have shown that the southern hemisphere westerly winds (SWW) exert an oppositional control on hydrological regimes at the eastern and the western sides of the Patagonian Andes. At Laguna Cháltel SWW forcing is changing evaporation rates by varying wind intensities, air temperatures and lake ice coverages as well as by precipitation rates (easterly vs. westerly sources of moisture). Our data suggests that the lake-level history of Laguna Cháltel reflects changes in the SWW during the last 4. 7 ka on the eastern side of the Andes. However, the elevated location of Laguna Cháltel on an 800 m high plateau at the leeward side of the Andes potentially leads to a <b>local</b> <b>overprint</b> of the SWW influence on the hydrological balance...|$|R
40|$|Glacial sediments, {{particularly}} diamicts, can be ambiguous to interpret. Fabric analyses, such as anisotropy {{of magnetic}} susceptibility (AMS), {{have been shown}} to provide specific information on the formation and subsequent deformation of glacial sediments. In this thesis, detailed investigations utilising the AMS technique have been combined with traditional sedimentological and structural techniques, to help resolve a number of current problems in glacial geology. At the same time, limitations of such uses of AMS have been established. In the modern environment (Tunabreen, Svalbard), magnetic lineations develop parallel to glacier flow and reveal dynamic behaviour during past surges. In a Quaternary glaciotectonite (Bacton Green Till Member, Norfolk, UK), AMS fabric develop in response to glacial deformation and reveal strain vectors that can be related to ice flow from contrasting directions. Finally in Neoproterozoic diamictites (Wilsonbreen Formation, Svalbard), despite <b>local</b> tectonic <b>overprinting</b> and diagenetic change, AMS can be used to reveal a dominant ice-flow to direction to the north. In combination with other sedimentological techniques, this has allowed the identification of glaciotectonic features and an ice-marginal, terrestrial and subaqueous model is proposed. These results support the use of AMS as a fast, objective and accurate technique that can facilitate the interpretation of cryptic glacial sediments...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{investigations}} in the Gander area have revealed {{the presence of}} two previously unrecognised terranes with contrasting structural, metamorphic and intrusive histories. These are named the metasedimentary terrane and the sedimentary and volcanic terrane. Older pre-Middle Ordovician polydeformed and metamorphosed rocks, mainly sediments of the Gander Group, are assigned to the metasedimentary terrane. The Gander Group is informally subdivided into the amphibolite-psammite member, the mixed member, and the pelite-mafic volcanic member. These members structurally overlie undifferentiated, predominantly psammitic metasediments of the group. The sedimentary and volcanic terrane includes the lower and upper members of the Davidsville Group. Mafic agglomerates occur {{at the base of}} this mid-Ordovician greywacke-slate sequence. [...] Intrusive into the Gander Group are schistose, pre- or early-kinematic garnetiferous leucocratic granite, mafic and ultramafic bodies, as well as late-kinematic 'porphyritic granite' and apparently undeformed gabbro and diabase. Early gabbro, pyroxenite and serpentinite, and post-tectonic diabase dykes intrude the Davidsville Group. [...] The Gander Group contains southeast facing, major recumbent F₂ folds, with two later crenulation fabrics and associated folds. Major structures are refolded into steep attitudes in the East near the contact with the basement, and in the West close to the Davidsville Group. This step-like refolding is considered to be Acadian (Devonian) in age. Rocks of the Gander Group have undergone greenschist to low amphibolite facies metamorphism, and <b>local</b> thermal <b>overprinting.</b> Within the Davidsville Group, upright open to close folding and later crenulation or kinking are attributed to the Acadian deformation. This terrane is much less recrystallized and of lower metamorphic grade (sub-greenschist facies). [...] Greywackes of the Davidsville Group contain metamorphic detritus derived from the metasedimentary terrane, indicating deformation, meta-morphism, uplift and erosion of the Gander Group before mid-Ordovician time. A fault now separates rocks of the metasedimentary terrane and volcanic terrane in the Gander area...|$|R
40|$|This study {{covers a}} 300 km long, NE/SW {{oriented}} transect including five outcrop sections, and provides new biostratigraphic data and a sequence stratigraphic {{interpretation of the}} Albian, Cenomanian and Turonian sediments (Kazhdumi and Sarvak Formations) present in Coastal Fars (SW Iran). Two different carbonate depositional systems are distinguished, one for the Albian {{and one for the}} Cenomanian/Turonian. During the Albian eustatic control was the dominant factor influencing sedimentation, while during the Cenomanian and Turonian large and small scale tectonics were dominant. This resulted in significant thickness variations and <b>local</b> diagenetic <b>overprint</b> of the sequence boundaries. Regional correlations were established constrained by ammonite data, as well as sedimentological and sequence stratigraphic considerations. In the Albian interval, including the Kazhdumi Formation and redated Mauddud Member, three 3 rd order sequences have been distinguished. The depositional system consists of muddy carbonate ramps, rich in orbitolinid benthic foraminifers, which laterally interfinger with green marls. Albian deposits are present throughout the area and vary in thickness from 100 to 160 m. Subaerial exposure has only been observed on top of the Albian- 3 sequence (Top Mauddud Member). In {{the upper part of the}} succession, which is of Cenomanian/Turonian age, the depositional system changed to rudist-rimmed carbonate platforms surrounding local organic-rich, intra-shelf basins. The thickness in this interval varies greatly, from 0 to 300 m, which was controlled by both large scale (Qatar-Fars high) and local scale (salt domes) tectonic processes. In this tectonically active setting, three Cenomanian and one Turonian 3 rd order sequences have been distinguished. Several sequence boundaries show evidences for long-lasted subaerial exposures (up to 13 Ma), with the local preservation of soil sequences and continental deposits. The expression of these exposures varies laterally considerably, and macroscopic evidences are sometimes lacking. Petrographic and C & O stable isotope investigations supplement classic sedimentology to reveal the record of these exposures. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Modern shallow-water {{carbonate}} systems commonly {{display a}} complex pattern of juxtaposed depositional environments with a patchy facies distribution (facies mo saics). On ancient carbonate platforms, {{the reconstruction of}} lateral facies distribution is often hampered not only by discontinuous outcrop but also by lack of suffi ciently high time resolution. This case study from the Oxfordian (Late Jurassic) of the Swiss Jura Mountains demonstrates a way to improve the temporal and spatial resolution for the interpretation of carbonate rocks. Sequence-stratigraphic and cyclostratigraphic analyses have been performed that {{provide a basis for}} defi ning depositional sequences, which formed through sea-level changes that were induced by the 400 -, 100 - and 20 -kyr orbital cycles. On the 100 -kyr scale, sequence boundaries are well developed and can be correlated between sections. However, identifi cation and correlation of sequences related to the 20 -kyr cycle may be diffi cult if <b>local</b> processes <b>overprinted</b> the record of orbitally controlled sea-level changes. The reconstruction of facies distribution along selected time lines gives a dynamic picture of platform evolution with time steps of a few ten thousand years and helps to interpret the controlling factors such as differential subsidence, low-amplitude eustatic sea-level fl uctuations, climate and ecology of the carbonate-producing organisms. Reefs and ooid shoals developed preferentially on topographic highs and thus accentuated platform morphology. Siliciclastics were shed onto the platform during sea-level falls and increased rainfall in the hinterland; their distribution was controlled by platform morphology. Siliciclastics and associated nutrients hindered carbonate production and thus indirectly infl uenced platform morphology. In addition to these controls, random processes acted on the smaller-scale facies relationships. Sedimentation rates can be estimated for each facies type over time spans of 10 – 20 kyr. They can thus be compared more easily with Holocene rates than if averaged over millions of years. This study shows that the Oxfordian platform in the Swiss Jura was as complex and dynamic as Holocene carbonate systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChina's largest gold {{resource}} {{is located in}} the highly endowed northwestern part of the Jiaodong gold province. Most gold deposits in this area are associated with the NE- to NNE-trending shear zones on the margins of the 130 – 126 Ma Guojialing granite. These deposits collectively formed at ca. 120 ± 5 Ma during rapid uplift of the granite. The Dayingezhuang deposit is a large (> 120 t Au) orogenic gold deposit in the same area, but located along the eastern margin of the Late Jurassic Linglong Metamorphic Core Complex. New 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology on hydrothermal sericite and muscovite from the Dayingezhuang deposit indicate the gold event is related to evolution of the core complex at 130 ± 4 Ma and is the earliest important gold event that is well-documented in the province. The Dayingezhuang deposit occurs along the Linglong detachment fault, which defines {{the eastern edge of the}} ca. 160 – 150 Ma Linglong granite–granodiorite massif. The anatectic rocks of the massif were rapidly uplifted, at rates of at least 1 km/m. y. from depths of 25 – 30 km, to form the metamorphic core complex. The detachment fault, with Precambrian metamorphic basement rocks in the hangingwall and the Linglong granitoids and migmatites in the footwall, is characterized by early mylonitization and a <b>local</b> brittle <b>overprinting</b> in the footwall. Gold is associated with quartz–sericite–pyrite–K-feldspar altered footwall cataclasites at the southernmost area of the brittle deformation along the detachment fault. Our results indicate that there were two successive, yet distinct gold-forming tectonic episodes in northwestern Jiaodong. One event first reactivated the detachment fault along the edge of the Linglong massif between 134 and 126 Ma, and then a second reactivated the shears along the margins of the Guojialing granite. Both events may relate to a component of northwest compression after a middle Early Cretaceous shift from regional NW–SE extension to a NE–SW extensional regime...|$|R

40|$|Past river run-off is an {{important}} measure for the continental hydrological cycle and the as-sessment of freshwater input into the ocean. However, paleosalinity reconstructions applying different proxies in parallel often show offsets between the respective methods. Here, we compare the established foraminiferal Ba/Ca and d 18 OWATER salinity proxies for their capability to record the highly seasonal Orinoco freshwater plume in the eastern Caribbean. For this purpose we obtained a data set comprising Ba/Ca and d 18 OWATER determined on multiple spe-cies of planktonic foraminifera from core tops distributed around the Orinoco river mouth. Our findings indicate that interpretations based on either proxy could lead to different conclu-sions. In particular, Ba/Ca and d 18 OWATER diverge in their spatial distribution due to different governing factors. Apparently, the Orinoco freshwater plume is best tracked by Ba/Ca ratios of G. ruber (pink and sensu lato morphotypes), while d 18 OWATER {{based on the same}} species is more related to the <b>local</b> precipitation-evaporation balance <b>overprinting</b> the riverine freshwater contribution. Other shallow dwelling species (G. sacculifer, O. universa) show a muted response to the freshwater discharge, most likely due to their ecological and habitat prefer-ences. Extremely high Ba/Ca ratios recorded by G. ruber are attributed to Ba 2 +-desorption from suspended matter derived from the Orinoco. Samples taken most proximal to the freshwater source do not show pronounced Ba/Ca or d 18 OWATER anomalies. Here, the suspension loaded freshwater lid developing during maximum discharge suppresses foraminiferal populations. Both proxies are therefore biased towards dry season conditions at these sites, when surface salinity is only minimally reduced...|$|R
40|$|Sediments from (a) a flush, two peat mires and two ponds from a 94 km {{transect}} {{along the}} Mohaka Fault trace (a northern {{extension of the}} Wellington Fault) set in the eastern foothills of the Ruahine Range, in western Hawkes Bay, New Zealand, and (b) from a lake at Te Pohue in northwestern Hawkes Bay, are analysed for their pollen and charcoal records to reconstruct the late Holocene vegetational and climatic history of the region. Western Hawkes Bay lies westward of an obliquely converging plate boundary, the Hikurangi Trough. This oblique convergence has resulted in tectonic strain being partitioned into domains of extension, contraction and strike-slip across Hawkes Bay. Within the study area, strain has resulted dominantly in primary tectonic landforms such as fault scarps and fault lines, and secondary tectonic landforms such as tilted and folded surfaces. Features of movement along the Mohaka Fault in the geomorphology include right-laterally offset streams, ridges with distinctive linear troughs {{along the line of}} the fault and the formation of triangular spurs. The region generally has a warm, dry climate, and suffers from drought periodically, with the drought often being broken by heavy rains in the autumn. These rains may be of cyclonic proportion. Due to both seismic and co-seismic activity in the region, the landscape is both uplifted and broken, and continually subject to mass movement; localised topoclimates are also common. This study determines how the western Hawkes Bay vegetational cover and its composition have changed in response to late Holocene climate changes through analysis of sediment cores. Also addressed {{is the extent to which}} tectonism, volcanicity, fire, major storm events and human activity have left a <b>local</b> <b>overprint</b> on the regional vegetational pattern. Climatically the region may be divided into three sectors: a dry central sector, (Big Hill site); flanked by moister southern and northern sectors. The regional vegetation in the southern sector was dominated by a Nothofagus- mixed podocarp forest in the Kashmir region from c. 800 yrs BP. up to when the site was affected by fire in 1888. In the Hinerua region, 14 kms farther north, Nothofagus fusca with a minor Dacrydium cupressinum-dominated/ mixed podocarp forest, was established by c. 2790 yrs BP. The regional vegetation of the central sector from c. 3700 to 3000 yrs BP. was predominantly a Prumnopitys taxifolia/mixed podocarp forest. There was also a notable Nothofagus component. There is a c 1900 year hiatus in the vegetation record between c. 3000 and 1150 yrs BP when no sediment accumulated at the Big Hill site. The regional forest of the central sector at c. 1150 yrs BP. was still a predominantly Prumnopitys taxifolia-dominated/mixed podocarp forest. However, Nothofagus was less important in this latter forest. At Willowford, 18 kilometres north of Big Hill, the same Prumnopitys taxifolia -dominated/mixed podocarp forest was evident at about 500 yrs BP. At Hawkstone, 10 kms north of Willowford, a Nothofagus/ P. taxifolia-dominated mixed podocarp forest was established by 6500 yrs BP. About 3400 yrs BP Dacrydium cupressinum became the dominant podocarp, thus placing the Hawkstone region within the northern climatic sector from this date, up to the present. The regional vegetation of the northern sector from 1850 yrs BP. until European land clearance in the late 19 th century at Te Pohue, was a Dacrydium cupressinum -dominated/mixed podocarp assemblage with a notable Prumnopitys taxifolia component. Several erosional events have been identified in the stratigraphy of the sites. By estimating the age of these events by sediment accumulation rates, some of these events have been tentatively linked to Grant's (1985) hypothesis of periodic climate-forced erosional events having partially destroyed the forest cover in the western Hawkes Bay region. Using radiocarbon dates from this study, often in conjunction with sediment accumulation rates, it has been possible to identify some erosional events as earthquake generated by linking these events to other known and radiocarbon dated movements along the Mohaka Fault trace in western Hawkes Bay. Volcanicity has been identified as a factor influencing forest cover in the northern pari of western Hawkes Bay. At Hawkstone, microscopic charcoal has been identifed at several levels throughout the 6500 year pollen record of the site. However, the sediment accumulation rate was too low to determine the exact nature of the disturbance, and the forest quickly recovered in each case. Although a 0. 20 m layer of reworked lapilli from the Waimihia eruption (3280 ± 20 yrs BP.) was recorded at the site, no fire or disturbance to the vegetation was recorded. However, above the Taupo Tephra (1850 ± 10 yrs BP.) fire is continually recorded at the site. As a result the regional forest did not return. Primary ignimbrite from the Taupo eruption forms the base of the Te Pohue site. The regional forest was destroyed by fire in conjunction with this event. A similar forest to before the event, was re-established within c. 230 years. Polynesian deforestation is identified by the advent of high frequencies of Pteridium exculentum and microscopic charcoal in the pollen record in the Willowford region c. 480 ± 170 yrs BP., and in the Big Hill region c. 435 ° 140 yrs BP.; and are coincident with the decline of indigenous forests in each case. European settlement, commencing in the mid-nineteenth century at Te Pohue and about 1880 AD. at Hinerua, is identified by the decline of indigenous forests in these areas, coincident with the appearance of exotic pollen types such as Pinus.

This study aims to assess use of sediment organic matter and grain size as indicators of former tidal level to aid diatom based RSL reconstructions. This study firstly investigates modern (top 1 cm) sediments from Loch Laxford in northwest Scotland. Grain size analysis in these sediments shows <b>local</b> processes are <b>overprinting</b> the general expected pattern of decreasing grain size away from the sea. Analysis of the modern total carbon distribution shows there a linear increase in percentage total carbon with elevation (r= 0. 92) between the low marsh and high marsh. Comparison of the modern total carbon distribution at a contrasting site, Beluga Slough in Alaska, shows the linear relationship still exists, but with lower total carbon values for equivalent elevations. This shows the importance of location, and climate, for total carbon distribution. Secondly, this study applies the modern Loch Laxford total carbon – elevation distribution to reconstruct paleo marsh surface elevation (PMSE) and RSL at Loch Laxford, and in an older sediment sequence from Mointeach Mhor in western Scotland. These are compared with diatom based reconstructions from the same sites. Decomposition complicates the use of organic carbon as a sea-level proxy but does appear to stabilise. At Loch Laxford, this occurs after approximately 100 years. Sediment grain size appears to influence the total carbon value and should also be investigated. Total carbon has most potential as a sea-level proxy in sediments from the last millennium, where a local modern distribution is available and {{it is unlikely that}} large changes in grain size or volume, or organic matter accumulation have occurred. ...|$|R
40|$|Like {{the larger}} Cyclades Islands (e. g. Naxos, Paros, Ios) the Small Cyclades Islands {{form part of}} the Attic-Cycladic {{crystalline}} basement belt. Subduction in the Paleogene was associated with high-pressure metamorphism, followed by a Barroviantype <b>overprint,</b> <b>local</b> partial melting and granitic plutonism in the Neogene. On the islands of Iraklia and Schinoussa Neogene metamorphism did not exceed mid-greenschist grade, {{and there are some}} well preserved older high-pressure/low temperature metamorphic assemblages. The rocks and structural geology of both islands had previously not been analysed in detail. Rocks present are calcite and dolomite marbles, in part with preserved paleosoils (metabauxites and metalaterites), and a suite of metapelitic schists with associated glaucophane schists and piemontite quartzites. There is a ductile deformation history comprising four events. The two older ones (D 1, D 2) are associated with high strains, and have resulted in a subhorizontal foliation, a N-S trending stretching lineation, and recumbent isoclinal folds with variable axial orientations. At least D 1 is bracketed by the growth of glaucophane, with uncertain kinematics. D 2, syn-blueschist grade on Iraklia, however, has a clear top-to-north sense of shear. D 3 and D 4 caused upright folds with N-S and E-W trending fold axes, respectively. This is evidence for late, two-phase horizontal shortening. As the deformed rocks show only a slight static metamorphic overprint, we have estimated flow stresses from dynamically recrystallized grain sizes of quartz and calcite. Coincident flow stress estimates are 28 - 62 MPa in quartzites, and 31 - 56 MPa in the marbles. Together with syntectonic temperature extimates, and applying published flow laws, this leads to estimated deformation rates on the order of 10 − 12 to 10 − 14 sec− 1. Even though deformation history and kinematics is very similar to that on Naxos Island, the clear relation of the earlier part to high-pressure metamorphism on Iraklia and Schinoussa speaks in favour of a subduction-related setting here. This is in contrast to the later formation of metamorphic core complexes in the north (Naxos) and south (Ios) ...|$|R
40|$|The Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) is an {{important}} climate system, affecting {{over half of the}} global population. Understanding past ASM changes is therefore crucial for assessing potential impacts of future climate change in Asia. However, previous reconstructions of ASM precipitation intensity generally rely on the local-scale catchments of lake, cave and vegetation-based records. There is significant disparity between these records, possibly attributable to <b>local</b> microclimate responses <b>overprinting</b> the regional signal. This thesis reconstructs precipitation-driven river flux to the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), a major river system in China, to record monsoon variability over a more regional scale. A suite of biornarker-based ratios indicative of terrestrial organic matter (TOM) flux (the concentration ratio of terrestrial to marine n-fatty acids, n-alcohols and sterols, and the BIT Index), are analysed in contemporary grab samples and a sediment core from 6. 5 ka to present. Additionally, carbon isotope (813 C) values of leaf wax n-fatty acids are analysed from 6. 5 ka to present to assess potential vegetation change. TOM input to the modem PRE generally decreases from river to ocean. Superimposed on this decrease, the biomarker distributions record a rapid decrease across the delta toe, indicating that organic matter (OM) burial is largely dictated by the sedimentary regime. From 6. 5 ka to present, BIT indices show strong covariance with a precipitation record within the drainage basin, indicating that soil OM input to the PRE covaried with paleoprecipitation 6. 5 ka to present. The other three biomarker ratios also record a general decrease in TOM. However, these ratios record some disparity at 5. 5 ka, suggesting a change in vegetation OM input to the core. Leaf wax 813 C values record a significant enrichment at 2 ka, consistent with a previously published bulk 813 C record, suggesting an anthropogenically-driven shift to a greater C 4 plant component with the onset of agriculture. 111.

40|$|M. Sc. (Geology) Abstract: The Main Karoo Basin of South Africa, {{especially}} the Whitehill Formation of the Ecca Group is estimated as possessing shale gas reserve potential of between 368 bcm to 13734 bcm {{on a wide}} land area of over 183 000 km 2, thus placing South Africa as the 8 th largest potential shale gas resource in the world. However, this reserve could be overestimated due to the poorly studied thermal impact of voluminous magmatic intrusions into the basin strata. Jurassic-aged Karoo Large Igneous Province (KLIP) emplaced a myriad network of dykes and sills that takes up 0. 55 x 106 km 2 of the basin and up to 30 % of the total thickness. This could bring additional heat to the thermal evolution of the basin likely to create thermal over-maturation and/or disrupt the preservation of generated hydrocarbon of the Main Karoo Basin source rocks. Here organic-rich mudstones of the Ecca Group with mineralogical, mineral chemistry, organic geochemistry and Ar – Ar age dating proxies were analysed. Illite crystallinity and chlorite chemistry studies show thermal evolution controlled by diagenesis and regional metamorphism as well as <b>local</b> contact metamorphic <b>overprints</b> {{in the vicinity of}} dolerite sills. 13 Corg and TOC vary in proximity to the dolerite intrusions. Rock-Eval pyrolysis data show that the organic matters are mainly Type III gas-prone kerogens of mature to post mature thermal maturity. The source rocks are mainly over-mature, having poor generation potential which could reflect the thermal overcooking/exhaustion, probably accompanied by gas migration, driven by the thermal impact of dolerite intrusions. The clay mineral ages also show full and partial recrystallized ages in the metamorphic aureoles of dolerite sills. Overall, the finding of this research reveals that the shale gas potential of the basin could be much lesser than originally estimated. Load metamorphism and dolerite intrusions influenced organic matter transformation in the basin. The impact on the thermal maturity and hydrocarbon generation of the basin’s organic matter is greater around multiple to closely spaced thermal aureoles of intrusions. These findings correlate with results from other boreholes studied in the Main Karoo Basin and provide {{a better understanding of the}} thermal evolution of the Ecca Group organic rich mudstones and its shale gas potential...|$|R
40|$|Numerous Fe-Cu {{deposits}} are hosted in {{the late}} Paleoproterozoic Dongchuan and Dahongshan Groups in the Kangdian region, SW China. The Dongchuan Group is composed of siltstone, slate, and dolostone with minor volcanic rocks, whereas the Dahongshan Group has undergone lower amphibolite facies metamorphism and consists of quartz mica-schist, albitite, quartzite, marble and amphibolite with local migmatite. Deposits in the Dongchuan Group are commonly localized in the cores of anticlines, in fault bends and intersections, and at lithological contacts. Orebodies are closely associated with breccias, which are locally derived from the host rocks. Fe-oxides (magnetite and/or hematite) and Cu-sulfides (chalcopyrite, bornite) form disseminated, vein-like and massive ores, and typically fill open spaces in the host rocks. The deposits have extensive albite alteration and <b>local</b> K-feldspar alteration <b>overprinted</b> by quartz, carbonate, sericite and chlorite. Deposits in the Dahongshan Group have orebodies sub-parellel to stratification and show crude stratal partitioning of metals. Fe-oxide ores occur as massive and/or banded replacements within the breccia pipes, whereas Cu-sulfide ores occur predominantly as disseminations and veinlets within mica schists and massive magnetite ores. Ore textures suggest that Cu-sulfides formed somewhat later than Fe-oxides, but are possibly within the same mineralization event. Both ore minerals predated regional Neoproterozoic metamorphism. Both orebodies and host rocks have undergone extensive alteration of albite, scapolite, amphibole, biotite, sericite and chlorite. Silica and carbonate alterations are also widespread. Ore-hosting strata have a LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb age of 1681 ± 13 Ma, and a dolerite dyke cutting the Fe-oxide orebodies has an age of 1659 ± 16 Ma. Thus, the mineralization age of the Dahongshan deposit is constrained at between the two. All ores from the two groups have high Fe and low Ti, with variable Cu contents. Locally they are rich in Mo, Co, V, and REE, but all are poor in Pb and Zn. Sulfides from the Fe-Cu deposits have δ 34 S values mostly {{in the range of}} + 2 to + 6 per mil, suggesting a mix of several sources due to large-scale leaching of the strata with the involvement of evaporites. Isotopic dating and field relationships suggest that these deposits formed {{in the late}} Paleoproterozoic. Ore textures, mineralogy and alteration characteristics are typical of IOCG-type deposits and thus define a major IOCG metallogenic province with significant implications for future exploration. © 2011 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The Tambo high-sulfidation deposit, {{located within}} the El Indio–Pascua belt in Chile, {{produced}} almost 25 t (0. 8 M oz) of gold from altered Tertiary rhyodacitic volcanic rocks. Episodic magmatic-hydrothermal activity in the district occurred over at least 4 my and is characterized by several stages of acid-sulfate alteration, including magmatic-hydrothermal, magmatic steam, steam-heated, and apparent supergene assemblages. Two stages of Au±Ag mineralization are recognized and are hosted in barite and alunite within hydrothermal breccias and veins. Isotopic compositions of fluid in alunite show a dominant magmatic signature, with only a variable 18 O-enriched meteoric water component throughout the entire hydrothermal process. Alunite 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages constrain the timing of alteration and {{the duration of the}} hydrothermal system. Pre-ore alteration occurred at about 10 to 11 Ma and was contemporaneous with the volcanism of the Tambo Formation. Alunite from this stage of alteration occurs in the matrix of barren breccias and as fine intergrowths of alunite–quartz±clays that selectively replaced feldspars and pumice fragments. The textural relationships combined with stable-isotope systematics suggest a magmatic-hydrothermal origin for the alunite, with a <b>local</b> magmatic steam <b>overprint.</b> Early ore-stage alunite (8. 7 ± 0. 2 Ma) occurs with barite and gold±walthierite within open spaces of the breccia matrix, and has δ 34 S values (24 – 27 %◦) typical of magmatic-hydrothermal alunite, reflecting equilibrium between aqueous H 2 S and SO 2 ̶ 4. Fluid-inclusion ratios of H 2 S/SO 2 (approximately 6) are consistent with ratios determined from stable-isotope data, and indicate reduced fluid conditions during ore deposition. Vaporphase transport of Au, and deposition from condensed magmatic vapor rising from the brittle–ductile transition is inferred. Late gold coprecipitated with a third stage of alunite (8. 2 ± 0. 2 Ma) that is characterized by nearly uniform chemical compositions and δ 34 S values (1 %◦) similar to those for associated enargite, reflecting disequilibrium between H 2 S and SO 2 ̶ 4. This third-stage of alunite is isotopically and chemically similar to that of post-ore, coarse, banded alunite±hematite-quartz veins that crosscut the breccias in the Tambo area. Analyses of fluid-inclusion gas from alunite in these veins indicate high SO 2 and disequilibrium CO 2 –CO–CH 4 –H 2 species, consistent with a magmatic-steam origin. The gases are also depleted in He, and the late goldbearing alunite was probably precipitated from rapidly ascending SO 2 -rich vapors that were flashed from condensed magmati...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution stable {{oxygen and}} carbon isotope {{analyses}} and detailed sedimentological and geochemical investigations were performed {{in order to}} i) reconstruct the paleoclimate and paleoceanography of the Greenland Sea associated with late Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles, and ii) to link the terrestrial and deep-sea climatic records. The reconstruction of the paleoenvironmental history of the East Greenland margin and {{the correlation between the}} terrestrial and deep sea records are major objectives of the ESF-PONAM-Programme (European Science Foundation - Polar North Atlantic Margins). For this study 16 gravity and 2 box cores were recovered along the East Greenland continental margin between 69 °N and 72 °N on three W-E transects running from the shelf to the deep sea. The glaciomarine sediments recovered from the heavily ice-covered East Greenland continental margin reflect changes associated with the glacial/interglacial climatic cycles of the last 240 ka. The glaciomarine sediments are characterised by a dominance of terrestrially derived components and a lower content of biogenic components. Glaciomarine sedimentation processes, terrigenous sediment input, and biogenic productivity in the study area are strongly influenced by fluctuations in the extent of the Greenland Ice Sheet, extent of the sea-ice cover, rate of iceberg drifting, meltwater input, and changes in the East Greenland Current (EGC). The relatively low carbonate content (95 %) throughout the sediment sequences indicate a low biological productivity in the surface water resulting from the extensive sea-ice cover and the strong influence of cold and low-saline polar waters of the EGC. An increase in the surface-water productivity, on the other hand, occurred during certain periods within interglacial and glacial stages. This indicates that the sea ice along the Western margin of the Greenland Sea was at least seasonally reduced during these time intetvals. Based on the accumulation rates of the coarse terrigenous matter (> 63 µm) and amounts of IRD, the advance and retreat of East Greenland glaciers over the past 200 ka can be correlated with those postulated from the terrestrial records. At least five repeated advances and retreats of glaciers beyond the coastline are proposed between the late Early to Middle Weichselian (65 - 61, 59 - 51, 48 - 42, 35 - 31, and 28 - 25 ka). Maximum fluxes of IRD recorded along the continental margin between 21 and 16 ka, reflect the maximum extent of East Greenland glaciers probably reaching the shelf break at that time. The stable oxygen isotope records measured on the planktonic foraminifer N. pachyderma sin. reveal some excursions from the global climate record due to a <b>local</b> andlor regional <b>overprint</b> through meltwater supply andlor cold water masses of the EGC. Distinct meltwater events are documented during Terminations II and l and at the beginning of Stage 3 resulting from the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The early period of all glacial stages (i. e. 716, 514, and 312) was subjected to an abrupt and rapid build-up of a sea-ice cover. Hence, a distinct decrease in the carbonate content, the low number of planktonic foraminifers, and light d 13 C values reflect the strong reduction in the C 02 exchange between the atmosphere and ocean, and the surface-water productivity, resulting from a meltwater cap andlor an extensive sea-ice cover. The onset of Termination l is characterised by a distinct shift towards light d 180 values, a dramatic decrease in the IRD-flux, and a marked increase in organic matter, indicating the rapid retreat of East Greenland glaciers and a reduced sea-ice cover. According to distinct shifts toward light d 180 and heavy d 13 C values of N. pachyderma sin. and O. umbonatus, the present-day circulation Patterns of surface- and deep-water masses were probably established between 7. 4 and 6. 1 ka. This is very similar to the timing estimated from studies On microfossil assemblages of the Greenland Sea. In particular, the distinct IRD peaks correlate with the fluctuations of the Greenland Ice Sheet during the last two glacial-interglacial cycles. Most of the major IRD peaks correspond to periods of cooling of air temperatures over Greenland. During the interval between 225 and 60 ka, the IRD peaks are in phase (at the 23 -kyr orbital processional cycle) with maximum Summer Insolation at 70 °N This suggests that the Greenland Ice Sheet may have experienced a predominantly 23 -kyr cycle of growth and decay, and therefore, collapsed and discharged large volumes of icebergs to the Greenland Sea when Summer insolation reached its maxima. During the last glacial period, there is a strong correlation between major pulses in the supply of IRD, and the Bond Cycles and the Heinrich Events recorded in the GRIP ice core and North Atlantic deep-sea sediments. Furthermore, the higher frequency of IRD events on millennial scales matches the cooling phase of the abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger Cycles recorded in the GRIP ice core. Consequently, the apparent evidence of millennial scale IRD events in the North Atlantic and the GIN Sea suggests coherent fluctuations of the large northern hemisphere ice sheets (i. e. the Fennoscandian/Barents Sea and Laurentide/Greenland ice sheets) during the last glacial period...|$|R
