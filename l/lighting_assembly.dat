40|$|The ongoing {{development}} towards increasing functional {{density and}} performance drives {{the improvement of}} IC packaging and interconnection technologies. However, new integration technologies, such as through silicon vias (TSVs) for 3 D stacking for heterogeneous systems as well as rigid micro-bumps together with the utilization of delicate new (porous ultra low-k) materials weaken the mechanical stability. As a result, the risks of cracking or delaminations increase e. g. in back-end-of-line (BEOL) structures or in the surrounding of TSVs. Chip package interaction (CPI) under thermal loading, assembly loading as well as residual stresses from different processing steps provide the dominating thermo-mechanical stress situations. In this field, qualified Finite Element Modeling (FEM) techniques play a well accepted key role to manage damage, cracking and delamination risks in the package design phase and also during failure tolerance optimization. Well defined/measured materials properties, loadings, boundary conditions and residual stresses from manufacturing are preconditions {{to ensure the quality}} of simulation results. Unfortunately, stress/strain singularities at certain locations within the designs under investigation call for advanced approaches taking into account the stress singularities, i. e., fracture mechanics approaches, instead. The contribution explains classic fracture mechanics approaches for bulk fracture and material interface delamination investigations as well as their recently realized extensions and current limitations. In contrast, advanced approaches allowing the simulation of crack initiation and propagation like cohesive zone modeling (CZM) and extended FEM (X-FEM) will be explained and discussed with respect to their advantages/disadvantages. Their benefits for the thermo-mechanical reliability optimization will be explained with the aid of 3 D IC-integration, TSV and a smart <b>lighting</b> <b>assembly,</b> in detail...|$|E
40|$|Light is {{undoubtedly}} {{the most important}} environmental variable for plant growth and development; plants not only use radiant energy in photosynthesis, they also respond to the quantity, quality, direction and timing of incident radiation through photomorphogenic response that can have huge effects on {{the rate of growth}} and the pattern of development. It is surprising, therefore, that the manufacturers and suppliers of controlled environment facilities have been singularly uninventive {{in the design of the}} lighting assemblies they provide. The consumer has one choice only - a <b>lighting</b> <b>assembly</b> that provides irradiance levels usually only a fraction of sunlight, and a control system that is limited to regulating the timing of the on-off switch. The reasons for these limitations are partly technological, but in the main they result from ignorance on the part of both the consumer and the manufacturer. A specific and powerful example of this ignorance relates to the importance of the so-called far-red wavelengths (FR = 700 - 800 nm). Because the human eye can hardly detect wavelengths above 700 nm, and photosynthesis also cuts off at about 700 nm, the majority of plant and crop physiologists are still almost completely unaware that FR radiation can have massive effects on growth rate and development. In consequence, most growth cabinets have light sources based on fluorescent tubes, and provide very little FR apart from that emitted by a token number of small incandescent bulbs. Larger growth facilities often use broader spectrum light sources, but growth facilities that provide the capability to vary the FR incident upon the plants are about as abundant as seals in the Sahara. This article sets the background of the significance of FR radiation in the natural environment and its importance for plant growth and development in the hope that it might inform intelligently those concerned with improving the design of plant growth facilities...|$|E

40|$|In our {{day to day}} lives, the {{availability}} of light, with which to see our environment, is often taken for granted. The designers of land based lighting systems use sunlight and artificial light as their toolset. The availability of power, quantity of light sources, and variety of design options are often unlimited. The accessibility of most land based lighting systems {{makes it easy for}} the architect and engineer to verify and validate their design ideas. Failures with an implementation, while sometimes costly, can easily be addressed by renovation. Consider now, an architectural facility orbiting in space, 260 miles above the surface of the earth. This human rated architectural facility, the International Space Station (ISS) must maintain operations every day, including life support and appropriate human comforts without fail. The facility must also handle logistics of regular shipments of cargo, including new passengers. The ISS requires accommodations necessary for human control of machine systems. Additionally, the ISS is a research facility and supports investigations performed inside and outside its livable volume. Finally, the facility must support remote operations and observations by ground controllers. All of these architectural needs require a functional, safe, and even an aesthetic lighting environment. At Johnson Space Center, our Habitability and Human Factors team assists our diverse customers with their lighting environment challenges, via physical test and computer based analysis. Because of the complexity of ISS operational environment, our team has learned and developed processes that help ISS operate safely. Because of the dynamic exterior lighting environment, uses computational modeling to predict the lighting environment. The ISS' orbit exposes it to a sunrise every 90 minutes, causing work surfaces to quickly change from direct sunlight to earthshine to total darkness. Proper planning of vehicle approaches, robotics operations, and crewed Extra Vehicular Activities are mandatory to ensure safety to the crew and all others involved. Innovation in testing techniques is important as well. The advent of Solid State Lighting technology and the lack of stable national and international standards for its implementation pose new challenges on how to design, test and verify individual light fixtures and the environment that uses them. The ISS will soon be replacing its internal fluorescent lighting system to a solid state LED system. The Solid State <b>Lighting</b> <b>Assembly</b> will be used not only for general lighting, but also as a medical countermeasure to control the circadian rhythm of the crew. The new light source has performance criteria very specific to its spectral fingerprint, creating new challenges that were originally not as significant during the original design of the ISS. This presentation will showcase findings and toolsets our team is using to assist in the planning of tasks, and design of operational lighting environments on the International Space Station...|$|E

The Solid State <b>Lighting</b> <b>Assembly</b> (SSLA) system is designed to positively influence astronaut health by providing a daily change to light spectrum to improve circadian entrainment. Unfortunately, existing NASA standards and requirements define ambient light level requirements for crew sleep and other tasks, yet the number of light-emitting diode (LED) indicators and displays within a habitable volume is currently uncontrolled. Because each of these light sources has its own unique spectral properties, the additive lighting environment ends up becoming something different from what was planned or researched. Restricting the use of displays and indicators is not a solution because these systems provide beneficial feedback to the crew. The research team for this grant used computer-based computational modeling and real-world lighting mockups to document the impact that light sources other than the ambient lighting system contribute to the ambient spectral lighting environment. In particular, the team was focused on understanding the impacts of long-term tasks located in front of avionics or computer displays. The team also wanted to understand options for mitigating the changes to the ambient light spectrum {{in the interest of}} maintaining the performance of a lighting countermeasure. The project utilized a variety of physical and computer-based simulations to determine direct relationships between system implementation and light spectrum. Using real-world data, computer models were built in the commercially available optics analysis software Zemax Optics Studio(c). The team also built a mockup test facility that had the same volume and configuration as one of the Zemax models. The team collected over 1200 spectral irradiance measurements, each representing a different configuration of the mockup. Analysis of the data showed a measurable impact on ambient light spectrum. This data showed that obvious design techniques exist {{that can be used to}} bind the ambient light spectrum closer to the planned spectral operating environment for the observer's eye point. The following observations should be considered when designing an operational environment that is dominated by computer displays. When more light is directed into the field of view of the observer, the greater the impact it will make on various human factors issues that depend on spectral shape and intensity. Because viewing angle has a large part to play in the amount of light flux on the crewmember's retina, beam shape, combined with light source location is an important factor for determining percent probable incident flux on the observer from any combination of light sources. Computer graphics design and display lumen output are major factors influencing the amount of spectrally intense light projected into the environment and in the viewer's direction. Use of adjustable white point display software was useful only if the predominant background color was white and if it matched the ambient light system's color. Display graphics that used a predominantly black background had the least influence on unplanned spectral energy projected into the environment. Percent reflectance makes a difference in total energy reflected back into an environment, and within certain architectural geometries, reflectance can be used to control the amount of a light spectrum that is allowed to perpetuate in the environment. Data showed that room volume and distance from significant light sources influence the total spectrum in a room. Smaller environments had a homogenizing effect on total light spectrum, whereas light from multiple sources in larger environments was less mixed. The findings indicated above should be considered when making recommendations for practice or standards for architectural systems. The ambient lighting system, surface reflectance, and display and indicator implementation all factor into the users' spectral environment. A variety of low-cost solutions exist to mitigate the impact of light from non-architectural lighting systems, and much potential for system automation and integration of display systems with the ambient environment. This team believes that proper planning can be used to avoid integration problems and also believes that human-in-the-loop evaluations, real-world test and measurement, and computer modeling can be used to determine how changes to a process, display graphics, and architecture will help maintain the planned spectral operating lighting environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Repetitive {{tasks are}} {{known as one of}} the {{prevalent}} root causes of muscle fatigue. <b>Light</b> <b>assembly</b> tasks, which are common in electronic and electrical industries, are a class of repetitive tasks with involving light weight (< 1 kg). The upper limb region was reported as most complained of strain by the workers doing this type of job. This study aims to investigate the time to fatigue for upper limb muscles in a <b>light</b> <b>assembly</b> task. Twenty subjects (10 males and 10 females) with mean (SD) age of 24. 05 (1. 76) years performed a <b>light</b> <b>assembly</b> task continuously for two hours. The time to fatigue was defined by significant changes in RMS of electromyography as well as grip strength. Results from RMS EMG show that upper trapezius muscle (right and left) was the muscle fastest being fatigued the fasted (90 minute), followed the right and the left anterior deltoid (95 minutes), the right and the left brachioradialis (100 minutes) and right and the left bicep brachii muscle (110 minutes). On the other hand, a significant change in grip and pinch strength occurred after 100 minutes and 120 minutes work, respectively.

40|$|As the {{automotive}} industry becomes increasingly competitive, parts manufacturers are under extreme pressure {{to improve the quality}} of their parts, while at the same time reducing costs. The method currently used to detect failures in automotive <b>light</b> <b>assemblies</b> after vibration endurance testing involves manual inspection only after the test is completed. An adaptable, reliable and low cost real time monitoring and diagnostic system that would interrupt the testing operation at the first onset of a failure is desired. This thesis describes accelerometer based, microphone (single and dual-microphone) based and acoustic emission sensor based monitoring systems for automotive <b>light</b> <b>assembly</b> failure detection during endurance testing. Preliminary results from accelerometer based and dual-microphone based diagnostic systems show that significant differences between healthy and faulty fog <b>light</b> <b>assemblies</b> can be detected. Based on these initial testing results, subsequent testing and data analysis were conducted for accelerometer based and dual microphone based systems. Four data analysis methods have been used: (1) Averaging signals in the time domain, (2) FFT of time domain waveforms over a specified time, (3) Averaging frequency spectra, and (4) Statistical methods for time domain signals. Individual frequency spectra (from FFT) and the average of multiple frequency spectra have shown potential to distinguish between signals from faulty and healthy <b>light</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Statistical measures, such as, Arithmetic mean (µ) and Kurtosis (K) can also be used to differentiate healthy and faulty <b>light</b> <b>assemblies.</b> In general, this work has shown the good potential to develop methods for adaptable, reliable and low cost real time monitoring and diagnostic systems that would interrupt the testing operation at the first onset of a failure. i...|$|R

The task was conducted at two levels of load (Low and high). Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to measure upper limb muscle activities of six subjects. The results found that the Mean Power Frequency (MPF) of the brachioradialis and upper trapezius activities were higher on the low-load task compared to high-load task. The EMG MPF also tended to decrease as time increases, that reflects muscle fatigue. Electroencephalography (EEG) was simultaneously recorded with EMG to record brain activities from Fz, Pz, O 1 and O 2 channels. Mean power of the EEG alpha bands from the channels were found to be higher on the low-load task compared to high-load task. The results indicated that high-load task require more brain activitie than the low-load task. It is also found that there was relation between upper limb muscles and brain activities while performing <b>light</b> <b>assembly</b> task.
