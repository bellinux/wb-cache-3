30|$|In the past, {{researchers}} have focused towards development of time-based maintenance models (Crocker and Kumar 2000). Preventive maintenance (PM) is the scheduled maintenance that includes actions such as; adjustments, inspection, lubrication and replacement of components (Sim and Endrenyi 1988). Ahmad et al. (2011) proposed a maintenance decision model for PM application. Charles-Owaba et al. (2008) suggested scheduling of the PM based on opportunistic cost. Though PM does help in avoiding the equipment breakdowns, but it no way fulfills maintenance objectives by not utilizing optimum use of maintenance resources. The replacement interval of components and <b>lube</b> <b>oils</b> under PM is conservative, and this result in their replacement, with sufficient residual life still left. To {{take care of}} this concern, CBM policy came up. Under this; a planned maintenance action, is undertaken, i.e., not timely based but condition based.

Based upon data obtained from infrared spectra and using a curve fitting technique, mathematical equations predicting the theoretical rates of chemical change due to the aforementioned processes were examined. Additive depletions were found to obey exponential regression rather than polynomial.
