40|$|Effective change {{leadership}} {{is important to}} any organisation undergoing fundamental transformation. In particular, the ability of senior public sector leaders to successfully drive strategic change is crucial to meeting the developmental and service delivery challenges faced by the Province of the Eastern Cape in ensuring the effective, efficient and innovative government demanded by all its various stakeholders. The creation on 3 October of a Shared Legal Service situated in the Office of the Premier provided {{a unique opportunity to}} examine the leadership of this change initiative {{in the context of the}} organisational culture that existed in the provincial public service. This thesis consequently probes the phenomenon of effective change leadership by means of an examination of the understandings of the three change agents involved in driving the transformation of the provision of <b>legal</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> to the provincial administration and its constituent departments. The picture which emerges from the insights of the participants is one that casts a shadow over the validity of the contemporary theory of transformational leadership. Furthermore, the research conducted has identified the need to view the nature of effective change leadership through a more nuanced, situation-specific lens: one that appreciates the role of relationships and emotions, and that recognises the importance of culture and its impact on the success of organisational transformation. The case study of the Shared Legal Service change initiative provides useful insights into the many and varied challenges faced by public sector leaders in driving strategic transformation in the provincial administration. It offers an example of successful change leadership and demonstrates the need for change agents within the public service to harness more emotionally resonant and relational forms of leadership if they are to soar to new heights in meeting the service delivery expectations of all who look to provincial government to deliver the fruits of democracy...|$|E

40|$|We {{live in a}} {{world where}} we are subject to {{environmental}} and economic effects that transcend national boundaries. Increasing globalization has led to a greater recognition of the need to address many of these issues through a global or a regional approach. Hence, International Environment Laws and their implementation are necessary to establish a consensus among the states and to realize the goal of sustainability. The broad category of "environmental law" may be broken down into a number of more specific regulatory subjects. While there is no single agreed-upon taxonomy, the core environmental law regimes address environmental pollution. A related but distinct set of regulatory regimes, now strongly influenced by environmental legal principles, focus on the management of specific natural resources, such as forests, minerals, or fisheries. Other areas, such as environmental impact assessment, may not fit neatly into either category, but are nonetheless important components of environmental law. Various international bodies organize conferences that assist decision makers with information, <b>legal</b> analysis, <b>advisory</b> <b>services,</b> legislative drafting, mentoring and capacity building at national, regional and global levels. They also provides the opportunity and the forum for governments, non-government organizations and others to network and to share information and discuss ideas...|$|R

Results showed that the direct IPO costs on the Czech capital market range between 5. 6 % and 9. 0 % of the value of issue. The biggest cost element are underwriting fees, generating usually {{more than half of all}} direct IPO costs.

The survey {{revealed}} that market <b>advisory</b> <b>service</b> users tend to be significantly more risk seeking than non-users. Survey results indicated a large range in patterns of use of <b>advisory</b> <b>services.</b> Most farmers use <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> to the greatest extent for marketing information, market analysis, and to keep up with markets. General guidelines (market strategies and price information) are utilized more than specific advice (e. g., specific pricing decisions, price forecasts).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to address two basic {{performance}} questions for market <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> in wheat: 1) Do market <b>advisory</b> <b>services,</b> on average, outperform an appropriate market benchmark? and 2) Do market <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> exhibit persistence in their performance from year-to-year? Data on wheat net price received for <b>advisory</b> <b>services,</b> {{as reported by the}} AgMAS Project, are available for the 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998 crop years. Not only do market advisory programs in wheat consistently fail to "beat the market," their performance is significantly worse than the market. On average, market <b>advisory</b> <b>service</b> performance is about $ 14 per acre below benchmark revenue, an economically non-trivial amount by any reasonable standard.
