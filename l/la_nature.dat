5|$|Responding to Baron d'Holbach's Système de <b>la</b> <b>Nature</b> (1770) and David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779) {{as well as}} {{the works}} of the French philosophers, Priestley {{maintained}} that materialism and determinism could be reconciled with a belief in God. He criticised those whose faith was shaped by books and fashion, drawing an analogy between the scepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the common thresher, as Squalus vulpinus, was written by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de <b>la</b> <b>nature.</b> In 1810, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque described Alopias macrourus from a thresher shark caught off Sicily. Later authors recognized the genus Alopias as valid while synonymizing A. macrourus with S. vulpinus, and thus the common thresher's scientific name became Alopias vulpinus.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark was originally described as Squalus ocellatus by the French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de <b>la</b> <b>nature.</b> The name was later changed to the currently valid Hemiscyllium ocellatum. The type specimen was a 35cm (14in) long immature male caught near Cooktown, Queensland, Australia. Other common names for this species are the itar shark and the blind shark (also used for Brachaelurus waddi). Goto's 2002 morphological {{analysis of the}} carpet sharks showed the genus Hemiscyllium as a polytomy, meaning that the phylogenetic relationships between the {{epaulette shark}} and its sister species could not be resolved.|$|E

Van Tienhoven of The Netherlands created the International Office for the Protection of Nature (Centre international de documentation et de correlation pour la protection de <b>la</b> <b>nature)</b> to implement wildlife conservation plans in Europe. Van Tienhoven was the first president, while Jean-Marie Derscheid was named secretary and managed the office until he resigned in 1933. Derscheid wrote a book about their experiences introducing laws for bird conservation that same year.|$|E
