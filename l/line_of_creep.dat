30|$|Knowledge of {{the channel}} model for UWB {{transmission}} is critical for any robust transceiver system. Moreover, body area networks exhibit unique radio propagation characteristics combining <b>line</b> <b>of</b> sight, <b>creeping</b> wave, multiple reflections from surrounding environments, and diffraction around the human body. Ever since the FCC released unlicensed spectrum for UWB, several previous works on UWB channel modeling have been published. Molisch et al. [9] developed an IEEE 802.15. 4 a channel model for various low-rate UWB applications, where the body area network channel model is analyzed using a finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulator with antennas moving around the human body. Wang et al. [10] also used FDTD method to simulate various body postures based on a realistic human body model. Unfortunately, these numerical approaches neglect considerations of the surrounding environments, which are the main sources of multipath.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the third}} fuse sparkled, and Brooke sprang down, grasped Jimmy's shoulder, and drove him before him.

60|$|She {{looked at}} him and hesitated. More than ever he was aware of some subtle change in her. It was as though her mental {{attitude}} towards him had adapted itself in some way to this new seriousness of demeanour. It was written in her features--his eyes read it eagerly. A certain aloofness, almost hauteur, about the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> her mouth, <b>creeping</b> out even in her most careless tones, and plainly manifest in the carriage of her head, was absent. She seemed immeasurably nearer to him. She was softer and more womanly. Even her voice in its new and more delicate notes betrayed the change. Perhaps it was only a mood, yet he would take advantage of it.|$|R
60|$|A leveled gun twinkled in the moonlight, and for {{a moment}} Foster hesitated. He hardly thought the man would shoot, and it would be awkward if he was arrested with the {{partridges}} in his hand. Springing suddenly forward, he struck, from below upwards, with his stick. There was a flash and a report, but he felt himself unharmed and brought the stick down upon the gamekeeper's head. He heard the gun drop, and then turned and, keeping {{in the shadow of the}} wall, ran across the field. When he was near the opposite end, he saw another man waiting to cut him off, and seizing the top of the dyke swung himself over. He came down among withered fern and ran back behind the wall towards the spot where he had left his first antagonist, until he struck a small, winding hollow through which water flowed. This seemed to offer a good hiding-place, but Foster knew better, although he followed it for a short distance. One can often hide best in the open and it was prudent to avoid the obvious <b>line</b> <b>of</b> search. <b>Creeping</b> out <b>of</b> the hollow, he made for a clump of rushes and felt satisfied when he lay down behind it. His waterproof and cap were gray, and his pursuers would have to search all the field before they found him, unless they were lucky.|$|R
40|$|An {{incremental}} format <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> {{model was}} presented {{to take account of}} the development <b>of</b> concrete <b>creep</b> due to loading at different ages. The formulation was attained by introducing a horizontal parallel assumption <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> curves and combining it with the vertical parallel <b>creep</b> curve <b>of</b> the rate <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> method to remedy the disadvantage of the rate <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> method that significantly underestimates the amount <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> strain, regardless <b>of</b> its simple format. Two creep curves were combined by introducing an ageing parameter whose value was obtained from two sets of time-dependent laboratory experiments on cylindrical specimens. The presented creep description takes the advantage that a single creep curve due to the initial loading describes the entire development <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> under the persistent change of creep-causing stress. Further, the creep formulation takes advantage of being consistent with the incremental format of age-dependent constitutive formulation.
