50|$|As noted above, in Roman law the {{contract}} of lease (locatio conductio) had three forms: the <b>locatio</b> conductio <b>rei,</b> the <b>locatio</b> conductio operis and the locatio conductio operarum. Roman-Dutch law adopted this position, {{and it is still}} in force in South Africa. The modern {{contract of lease}} is therefore the Roman <b>locatio</b> conductio <b>rei,</b> the rental or hire of a thing.|$|R
50|$|The {{principles}} {{relating to}} the rule huur gaar voor koop were discussed. Under Roman law, a lease of property (<b>locatio</b> conductio <b>rei)</b> conferred only jura in personam. More particularly, the lessee held no real right in the leased property; he merely enjoyed contractual jura in personam against the lessor {{by virtue of the}} agreement of lease. Consequently, if during the currency of the lease the lessor alienated the leased property in terms of, say, a contract of sale, the purchaser (and new owner) was not bound to recognise the lessees rights of occupation under the lease, unless he had undertaken to do so.|$|R
50|$|Trajan resettled Dacia with Romans and annexed it as a {{province}} of the Roman Empire. Aside from their enormous booty (over half a million slaves, according to John Lydus), Trajan's Dacian campaigns benefited the Empire's finances through the acquisition of Dacia's gold mines, managed by an imperial procurator of equestrian rank (procurator aurariarum). On the other hand, commercial agricultural exploitation on the villa model, based on the centralized management of a huge landed estate by a single owner (fundus) was poorly developed. Therefore, use of slave labor in the province itself {{seems to have been}} relatively undeveloped, and epigraphic evidence points to work in the gold mines being conducted by means of labor contracts (<b>locatio</b> conductio <b>rei)</b> and seasonal wage-earning.|$|R
