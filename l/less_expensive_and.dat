5|$|Upon Sophia's birth, King George ensured {{his daughters}} and younger sons would have allowances; through a {{provision}} of Parliament, Sophia and her elder sisters were each {{to receive an}} annual income of £6,000 either upon their marriages or the king's death. The royal household was very rigid and formal, even when only the royal family were together in private. For instance, when the King entered a room, his daughters were expected to stand up, remain silent until addressed, and not leave until given permission. Queen Charlotte made attempts to be economical where possible; the younger princesses wore country-made dresses, which were <b>less</b> <b>expensive,</b> <b>and</b> ate plain food.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Willoughby Smith {{found that}} the {{electrical}} resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light. This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell {{was used in the}} photophone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of selenium rectifiers began during the early 1930s, and these replaced copper oxide rectifiers because they were more efficient. These lasted in commercial applications until the 1970s, following which they were replaced with <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> even more efficient silicon rectifiers.|$|E

50|$|The {{steam engine}} was {{gradually}} phased {{out by the}} mid-1920s as the <b>less</b> <b>expensive,</b> lighter, <b>and</b> faster-starting internal combustion (kerosene, petrol or distillate) tractors fully emerged after World War I.|$|R
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in xenon gas (169m/s) is less than that in air because the average {{velocity}} of the heavy xenon atoms is {{less than that of}} nitrogen and oxygen molecules in air. Hence, xenon vibrates more slowly in the vocal cords when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones, an effect opposite to the high-toned voice produced in helium. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen, and it is both a simple asphyxiant and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide; consequently, and because xenon is expensive, many universities have prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. The gas sulfur hexafluoride is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), <b>less</b> <b>expensive,</b> <b>and</b> though an asphyxiant, not toxic or anesthetic; it is often substituted in these demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|Access to Scottish {{universities}} {{was probably}} more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> {{the student body}} more representative of society as a whole. In the eighteenth century Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution the European Enlightenment. Key figures in the Scottish Enlightenment who had made their mark before the mid-eighteenth century included Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746), who was professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. He was an important link between the ideas of Shaftesbury and the later school of Scottish Common Sense Realism, developing Utilitarianism and Consequentialist thinking. Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746), appointed to a chair of mathematics {{by the age of}} 19 at Marischal College, was the leading British mathematician of his era. Perhaps the most significant intellectual figure of early modern Scotland was David Hume (1711–76) whose Treatise on Human Nature (1738) and Essays, Moral and Political (1741) helped outline the parameters of philosophical Empiricism and Scepticism. He would be a major influence of later Enlightenment figures including Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{measures}} of lipid concentration {{have long been}} the most-used clinical measurement, not {{because they have the}} best correlation with individual outcome, but because these lab methods are <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> more widely available.|$|E
50|$|Both Canon and Nikon, the {{two biggest}} camera manufacturers, have been {{struggling}} financially as consumers shifted to buying simpler <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> cameras <b>and</b> some even abandoning buying cameras in favor of mobile phones.|$|R

50|$|Development {{and testing}} continued. Eventually, the bitumen of the {{original}} formulation was replaced by <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> pitch <b>and</b> the Penlee granite was replaced by flint gravel. Elsewhere in the world, people used whatever stone was available.|$|R
25|$|Glass beads were {{supplanted by}} <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> more durable plastic beads, first from Hong Kong, then from Taiwan, and more {{recently}} from China. Lower-cost beads and toys allow float-riders to purchase greater quantities, and throws have become more numerous and common.|$|E
25|$|Advances in {{technology}} {{over the last}} decade have made probes smaller and lighter. As a result, robotic probes and communications satellites can now use expendable launch vehicles, such as the Delta and Atlas V, which are <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> perceived to be more reliable than the Shuttle.|$|E
25|$|The {{principles}} of suspension {{used on the}} large scale may also appear in contexts less dramatic than road or rail bridges. Light cable suspension may prove <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> seem more elegant for a cycle or footbridge than strong girder supports. An {{example of this is}} the Nescio Bridge in the Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} make sports car racing <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> than elsewhere, new rules were {{introduced}} in 2002. The dedicated Daytona Prototypes (DP) use <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> materials <b>and</b> technologies and the car's simple aerodynamics reduce the development and testing costs. The DPs began racing in 2003 with six cars in the race.|$|R
50|$|Paul Haggis was {{developing}} {{a film about}} Martin Luther King but could not get the financing. He began looking for <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> projects <b>and</b> came across the French film Pour Elle (Anything for Her) by Fred Cavayé.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the demise}} of Western Electric, {{telephone}} equipment design and manufacturing is an open market place in which numerous manufacturers compete. As a result, modern telephones are now manufactured in Asia, generally using <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> components <b>and</b> labor.|$|R
25|$|Playing on a non-established {{field is}} {{sometimes}} referred to as renegade or gonzo play or outlaw ball (with the players nicknamed renegade ballers or outlaws). Though <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> less structured than play at a commercial facility, the lack of safety protocols, instruction, and oversight can lead to higher incidence of injuries.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been argued that China is the world leader in making small, {{innovative}} improvements to existing designs. One example is continual improvements {{to the design of}} power supplies making them gradually smaller, <b>less</b> <b>expensive,</b> <b>and</b> more energy efficient. This may not create completely new products or create headlines but may be more important for creating employment.|$|E
25|$|Per capita butter {{consumption}} {{declined in}} most western nations during the 20th century, {{in large part}} because of the rising popularity of margarine, which is <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and,</b> until recent years, was perceived as being healthier. In the United States, margarine consumption overtook butter during the 1950s, and it is still the case today that more margarine than butter is eaten in the U.S. and the EU.|$|E
50|$|SES-2 over I²C {{is still}} used for storage {{backplanes}} enclosure management, although a competing method for enclosure management communication is now becoming prominent.

50|$|RS-M95 Tape Deck: This deck {{replaced}} the 9600 {{in the same}} way as the 9000 Professional Series components {{replaced the}} 9600. It was much smaller, <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> ($1400) <b>and</b> had better specs than the RS-9900US it replaced, resulting in better sound.|$|R
25|$|Unordered topographies are {{generally}} created by processes that occur spontaneously during other processing; the patterns are random in orientation and organization with imprecise or {{no control over}} feature geometry. The advantage to creating unordered topographies over ordered is that the processes are often less time consuming, <b>less</b> <b>expensive,</b> <b>and</b> do not require great skill and experience. Unordered topographies can be created by polymer demixing, colloidal lithography and chemical etching.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of these}} disadvantages, some moldings {{that would be}} made via this process are instead made by {{injection}} molding two or more parts in a traditional injection molding machine and then welding them together. This process is <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> requires much less capital, however it imparts more design constraints. Because of the design constraints, sometimes parts are made with both processes to gain the advantages of both.|$|E
25|$|Transportation between Serbia and Greece is well {{developed}} due to Greece's attractiveness {{as a tourist}} destination to Serbian tourists who often find it <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> more comfortable {{to travel to the}} Greek coast rather than to western European or north African destinations. From Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport in Serbia, Air Serbia operates year-round flights to Athens International Airport and Thessaloniki International Airport. Aegean Airlines operates a year-round line from Athens to Belgrade as well.|$|E

40|$|Approximately 48 {{percent of}} U. S. {{households}} and 54 percent of Canadian households {{plan to buy}} some form of upholstered furniture in the near future. According to a recent survey, spending plans differ somewhat between U. S. and Canadian consumers, however. American consumers, for example, favor <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> sofas, loveseats, <b>and</b> recliners, while Canadians prefer <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> upholstered rockers <b>and</b> stationary chairs. Overall, Canadian households plan to spend more for each individual item than U. S. households...|$|R

25|$|Experimental {{visualization}} techniques use broad-band light (e.g., direct visualization, speculoscopy, cervicography, {{visual inspection}} with acetic acid or with Lugol's, and colposcopy) and electronic detection methods (e.g., Polarprobe and in-vivo Spectroscopy). These techniques are <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> {{can be performed}} with significantly less training. They do not perform as well as Pap smear screening and colposcopy. At this point, these techniques have not been validated by large-scale trials and are not in general use.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{degradation}} of the dye, failure of a CD-R can {{be due to the}} reflective surface. While silver is <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> more widely used, it is more prone to oxidation resulting in a non-reflecting surface. Gold on the other hand, although more expensive and no longer widely used, is an inert material, so gold-based CD-Rs do not suffer from this problem. Manufacturers have estimated the longevity of gold-based CD-Rs to be as high as 100 years.|$|E
25|$|Both {{anatomic}} and physiologic methods allow {{early detection}} before symptoms show up, disease staging and tracking of disease progression. Anatomic methods {{are more expensive}} {{and some of them}} are invasive in nature, such as IVUS. On the other hand, physiologic methods are often <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>and</b> safer. But they do not quantify the current state of the disease or directly track progression. In recent years, developments in nuclear imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT have provided ways of estimating the severity of atherosclerotic plaques.|$|E
