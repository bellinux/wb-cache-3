In our earlier work, we have proposed a learner-centric, selfadaptive, modular approach, named <b>LQ</b> <b>model,</b> in which the modules are dynamically selected from a pool. In this paper, this <b>LQ</b> <b>model</b> has been extended and a UML-based analysis and design has been manifested. The UML representation of the proposed algorithm helps us to extract the implementation methodology in a more convenient manner. The modular and incremental architecture of the LQ based algorithm makes it an ideal candidate for UML based analysis, design and development.

Results: Accurate dosimetry for in-vitro exposures of cell cultures to radioactivity was established. LQ parameters of cell survival were established for cancer cell lines reported to be prone to apoptosis, low dose hypersensitivity (LDH) or the bystander effect. For apoptotic cells and cells exhibiting a bystander effect in response to EBRT, LQ parameters were found to be predictive of cell response to TRT. Apoptosis was not found to be a mode of cell death more specific to TRT than to EBRT. Bystander effects could not be demonstrated in cells exposed to TRT.

First, the α/β ratio of the cells was determined from single-dose experiments, and a biologically effective dose (BED) for 20 Gy in 10 fractions (fr) was calculated. Fractional doses yielding the same BED were calculated for 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4 -, 5 -, 7 -, 15 - and 20 -fraction irradiation using LQ formalism, and then irradiation with these schedules was actually given. Cell survival was determined by a standard colony assay. Differences in cell survival between pairs of groups were compared by t-test. The α/β ratio of the cells was 3. 18 Gy, and 20 Gy in 10 fr corresponded to a BED 3. 18 of 32. 6 Gy. The effects of 7 -, 15 - and 20 -fraction irradiation with a BED 3. 18 of 32. 6 Gy were similar to those of the 10 -fraction irradiation, while the effects of 1 - to 5 -fraction irradiation were lower.

40|$|Purpose: Recent {{analyses}} of clinical results {{have suggested that}} the fractionation sensitivity of prostate tumors is remarkably high; corresponding point estimates of the / ratio for prostate cancer are around 1. 5 Gy, much lower than the typical value of 10 Gy for many other tumors. This low / value is comparable to, and possibly even lower than, that of the surrounding late-responding normal tissue in rectal mucosa (/ nominally 3 Gy, but also likely to be in the 4 – 5 Gy range). This lower / ratio for prostate cancer than for the surrounding late-responding normal tissue creates the potential for therapeutic gain. We analyze here possible high-gain/ low-risk hypofractionated protocols for prostate cancer to test this suggestion. Methods and Materials: Using standard linear-quadratic (<b>LQ)</b> <b>modeling,</b> a set of hypofractionated protocols can be designed in which a series of dose steps is given, each step of which keeps the late complications constant in rectal tissues.

The resulting estimates are theoretical, although based on the best current modeling with / parameters, which are discussed thoroughly. Results: If the / value for prostate is less than that for the surrounding late-responding normal tissue, the clinical gains can be rather large.

The influence of sensitizing agents on these parameters during fractionated radiotherapy is assessed. Suggestions for scheduling of radiation combined of with sensitizing agents are derived. The parameters alpha and beta of the linear-quadratic model for dose {{dependence of}} cell reproductive inactivation, derived from experimental and clinical data, are evaluated to assess their dependence on cell proliferative state, on PLD repair and on the action of various sensitizing agents. PLD contributes to the linear {{as well as to}} the quadratic component of the <b>LQ</b> <b>model.</b> PLD is less effectively repaired in proliferating (P) cells than in clonogenic (G 0) cells of the quiescent (Q) cell compartment.

The relative fractions of P cells and Q cells can change during fractionated treatments. If recruitment is effective, the fraction of G 0 cells decreases in the latter part of a treatment schedule. PLD from subsequent radiation doses is then repaired less and the effectiveness of radiation combined with sensitizing agents may be enhanced. The analyses using the <b>LQ</b> <b>model</b> show differences in PLD and its repair between P cells and G 0 cells in tumors. If due to recruitment the compartment of clonogenic G 0 cells diminishes during treatment, the combination of radiation with sensitizing agents and the application of high-LET radiation should be scheduled to take this factor into account. For poorly differentiated tumors with high labeling indices (LI), benefit from combined treatments is expected from early in the course of fractionated radiotherapy. Well differentiated tumors with low LI are suggested to benefit most from irradiation combined with sensitizing agents in the latter part of a treatment schedule. New methods are required to assess the clonogenic G 0 cells in the Q cell compartment and to monitor recruitment of these cells into the P cell compartmen...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} Linear-Quadratic (LQ) survival {{model for}} {{external beam radiotherapy}} is reviewed with particular emphasis on studying how different schedules of radiation treatment planning may be affected by different tumour repopulation kinetics. The <b>LQ</b> <b>model</b> is further examined {{in the context of}} tumour control probability (TCP) models. The application of the Zaider and Minerbo non-Poissonian TCP model incorporating the effect of cellular repopulation is reviewed. In particular the recent development of a cell cycle model within the original Zaider and Minerbo TCP formalism is highlighted. Application of this TCP cell-cycle model in clinical treatment plans is explored and analyzed...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the experimental study of vibration control in a suspension equipped with independently controlled magnetorheolo-gical shock absorbers (MRAs) in front and rear sections. For research purposes, the pitch-plane suspension model with bounce and pitch mo-tions was considered. This suspension model was tested in open-loop and feedback system congurations under harmonic and square excita-tions. The experiments were conducted on a specially designed experi-mental setup with a data acquisition and control system congured in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The obtained results reveal eective-ness of MRAs for vibration suppression in the investigated suspension model.

We show as the initial symmetries are transformed in the transition from L to first order action, {{and then to the}} Hamiltonian action SH = ∫ dτ(pA ˙q A − H 0 − v α Φα), where Φα are the all (first and second class) primary constraints. An exact formulae for local symmetries of SH in terms of the initial generators Ra A and all primary constraints Φα are obtained...|$|R

Methods of data collection in this study through the method of data collection is done through direct observation and documentation method store cord, document, or some literature related to there search. This study uses secondary datain the form of time series of annual data eleven years from 2001 - 2011, using three analysis namely Location Quotien (<b>LQ),</b> Growth Ratio <b>Model</b> (MRP), and overlay analysis. Of this study showed that the dominant sector in the Badung regency is electricity, gas and water, construction, trade, hotels, and restaurants, and transport and communications sectors...|$|R
