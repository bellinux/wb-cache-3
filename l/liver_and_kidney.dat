When people with diminishing liver or kidney function are treated with oral opioids they must be monitored for the possible need to reduce dose, extend dosing intervals, or switch to other opioids or other modes of delivery. The benefit of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be weighed against their gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{fluorine}} {{is highly}} toxic to living organisms.

Eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm, and inhalation of 1,000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals {{essential}} for {{life can be}} toxic if taken in excess; some have notably toxic forms. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is carcinogenic in animals and, when inhaled, causes DNA damage. The purple permanganate ion MnO is a <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> poison. Ingesting more than 0.5 grams of iron can induce cardiac collapse; such overdoses most commonly occur in children and may result in death within 24 hours. Nickel carbonyl (Ni2(CO)4), at 30 parts per million, can cause respiratory failure, brain damage and death. Imbibing a gram or more of copper sulfate (Cu(SO4)2) can be fatal; survivors may be left with major organ damage. More than five milligrams of selenium is highly toxic; this is roughly ten times the 0.45 milligram recommended maximum daily intake; long-term poisoning can have paralytic effects.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} acute {{exposure}} of intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA) on {{the activity of}} superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), amount of reduced glutathione (GSH) and content of ascorbic acid (ASC) has been studied in brain, <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> of male mice. Animals (n = 144) were treated KA with one dose, i. e. 12 mg/kg body weight or saline solution. The influence of KA on the tested parameters after 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours was estimated. After the injection of KA {{it has been found}} that the activity of SOD, GSHPx and CAT is very clearly reduced in the brain {{and to a lesser extent}} in <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys.</b> Simultaneously a decrease in the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the brain, <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> was accompanied by a decrease of the amount of GSH and ASC. A decrease in the activity of SOD, CAT, GSHPx (after 2 and 4 h) and amount of GSH and ASC in the brain, <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> suggests that oxidative stress plays important role in the pathogenesis of KA in mice. The obtained results suggest that KA not only is toxic to the brain but also for the <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> of mice...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of diazinon <b>and</b> propoxur on <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys,</b> following long term exposure of rabbits. Methods: Ten New Zealand white female rabbits were used. The animals were divided into 5 groups, consisting of 2 animals each. Diazinon (groups 1 and 2) and propoxur (groups 3 and 4) were administered at 2 different doses, and group 5 served as the control group. Histopathological lesions in the <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys,</b> oxidative stress <b>and</b> oxidative DNA damage were evaluated. Results: Both pesticides induced focal inflammation and fibrosis in the <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys.</b> The low dose of propoxur induced a significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC), with no difference in reduced glutathione (GSH), while the high dose of propoxur induced an increase in GSH with no change in TAC. For diazinon-exposed animals, the opposite findings were observed. Both diazinon and propoxur induced a statistically significant oxidative DNA damage in the <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> <b>and</b> a subsequent increase in telomerase activity in these tissues, possibly as a counteracting mechanism. Furthermore, systemic inflammation, as depicted by the dose-dependent increase in telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), was observed in propoxur treated animals. Conclusions: Histopathological lesions, oxidative stress and genotoxic effects were induced in <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> following long term exposure of rabbits to diazinon and propoxur.

5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought {{within a few hours}} of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.|$|E
5|$|Amanita bisporigera was {{described}} as a new species in 1906. It is classified in the section Phalloideae of the genus Amanita together with other amatoxin-containing species. Amatoxins are cyclic peptides which inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase II and interfere with various cellular functions. The first symptoms of poisoning appear 6 to 24 hours after consumption, followed by a period of apparent improvement, then by symptoms of <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> failure, and death after four days or more. Amanita bisporigera closely resembles a few other white amanitas, including the equally deadly A.virosa and A.verna. These species, difficult to distinguish from A.bisporigera based on visible field characteristics, do not have two-spored basidia, and do not stain yellow when a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide is applied. The DNA of A.bisporigera has been partially sequenced, and the genes responsible for the production of amatoxins have been determined.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} H.nidulans are {{neurotoxic}} if ingested. The toxin {{was identified as}} polyporic acid, a terphenyl compound first identified from a mycelial culture of the fungus in 1877. This chemical, present at 20–40% of the dry weight of the fruit bodies, inhibits the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. It is found in other mushrooms, but in much lower amounts. In a poisoning case reported in 1992, one German family who consumed H.nidulans experienced nausea, impaired movement, visual impairment, <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> failure; symptoms began about 12 hours after consuming the mushroom. Additionally, the urine of all three poisoning victims temporarily turned violet. They recovered fully a week later. Similar symptoms and recovery were reported in a 2013 poisoning case, in which the fungus was confused with the edible Fistulina hepatica. The set of symptoms arising from consumption of H.nidulans {{has been called the}} neurotoxic delayed syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Hematological, {{biochemical}} and histopathological examinations {{were conducted}} on rats administered orally 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg of Methomyl. Furthermore, mechanism of the toxic action of the drug was investigated. 1. Serum cholinesterase activity was inhibited and the clinical signs that could be associated with anticolinesterase activity appeared on animals after administration of each dose of the drug. 2. No hematological changes were observed. 3. Biochemical studies revealed the disorders in functions of <b>livers</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> of rats receiving 5 mg/kg of Methomyl. Histopathological alterations were seen in lungs of rats administered 5 mg/kg and over of Methomyl, <b>and</b> also in <b>livers</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> of animals which received 15 mg/kg of the drug. 4. Rats administered 5 mg/kg and over of methomyl had a decrease in superoxide dismutase activity, an increase in serum lipoperoxide level {{and a decrease in}} serum α-tocopheraol level. The results abtained suggest that superoxide free radical may be concerned in the lesions of lungs, <b>livers</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> of animals which received the drug. 5.

Feed intake on daily basis and body weight gain of the chicks was recorded on weekly basis. A subjective scoring of clinical signs and gross pathological lesions on visceral organs was performed. Relative weights of <b>liver,</b> <b>kidneys</b> <b>and</b> gizzard were recorded at the end of experiment. Serum biochemical profile and histological alteration in <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> of chicks was determined to assess the OTA mediated damage.
