40|$|Abstract — The effort {{dedicated}} to {{the ultimate goal of}} designing an architectural framework for tactical mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) has long been hindered by the excessive control overhead of routing protocols to maintain a full view of the network topology. This paper explores the viability of adopting network coding as a means of improving reliable data delivery while <b>lowering</b> <b>control</b> overhead in large scale MANETs. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol, Network Coded STORM, achieves in excess of 95 % packet delivery ratio and reduces the overall overhead by more than 50 % in scalability experiments.

40|$|International audienceDeglaciation in high {{mountain}} areas triggers {{a series of}} adjustments affecting the various geomorphic components of formerly glaciated catchments. Active processes, part of the ‘paraglacial' open system, release and transport sediments from formerly glacierized sources to catchment sinks. Such cascade sedimentary systems may be disrupted by temporary sediments traps. To evaluate the consequences of such traps on sediment export, several test areas were selected, where former glacial geometries and glacial retreat chronology were reconstructed from field data. Special attention {{is given to the}} link between the glacial margins and the glacio-fluvial systems. During glacial retreat, the presence of morainic ridges may temporarily interrupt the sedimentary cascade system, thus forcing local aggradation and change in the glacio-fluvial pattern. The volume of trapped sediments is controlled by the volume and the position of morainic ridges, while the storage residence time is strongly dependent upon the rate of moraine erosion. The ice surface elevation and its <b>lowering</b> <b>control</b> ice-contact storages, as well as sedimentary and water fluxes.

40|$|The ω- 3 {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (ω- 3 PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), {{have been shown}} to have cardioprotective and antiatherosclerotic actions. While it has been proposed that ω- 3 PUFAs may structurally stabilise atherosclerotic lesions, the underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated. There is evidence that increased dietary intake of ω- 3 PUFAs alters the concentration of endocannabinoids (ECs) in central and peripheral tissues and, since synthetic cannabinoid agonists {{have been shown to}} exert anti-atherosclerotic effects, this thesis explored whether a link exists between the endocannabinoid system and the beneficial effects of ω- 3 PUFAs in the setting of experimental atherosclerosis. Therefore, the present studies were performed to (1) determine the impact of long-term intervention with ω- 3 PUFAs on several physiological parameters, including the function of the endocannabinoid system, in an in vivo model of hypercholesterolaemia and (2) to examine the role, if any, of the activated endocannabinoid system in the activity of an in vitro model of macrophage lipid accumulation. At the cellular level, the present study demonstrated the interference of cannabinoid receptor signalling with intracellular uptake and accumulation of DHA, an effect which was demonstrated to be mediated, at least in part, via CB 2 receptor signalling. Moreover, the study provided the novel observation that DHA treatment of activated macrophages significantly inhibited 2 - arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) synthesis. This finding is strongly suggestive of an association between the effects of ω- 3 PUFAs and regulation of the endocannabinoid system and its function. In the ApoE-/- mouse model of experimental atherosclerosis, maintenance on an atherogenic diet induced significant hyperlipidaemia, an effect which was associated with endothelial dysfunction, cardiac remodelling, and significantly elevated anandamide (AEA) and 2 -AG levels in brain, heart and aortic tissues. Supplementation of the atherogenic diet with the EPA, while having a negligible impact on endothelial dysfunction or cardiac remodelling, improved the hypercholesterolaemic profile and normalised the overproduction of ECs in both central (brain) and peripheral (heart and vascular) tissues. Fenofibrate, a lipid <b>lowering</b> <b>control</b> administered as a supplement to the atherogenic diet, was observed to significantly attenuate hypercholesterolaemia, endothelial dysfunction and elevated EC levels although no effect on cardiac remodelling was observed. In light of the observation that hypercholesterolaemia was associated with elevated tissue EC levels, together with the demonstration that EPA improved hypercholeseterolaemia and attenuated EC levels suggests (1) a detrimental role of the endocannabinoid system in hypercholesterolaemia in the ApoE-/- model and (2) regulation of this interaction by ω- 3 PUFAs. Given the mounting evidence implicating the endocannabinoid system in various disease pathologies, the capacity of ω- 3 PUFAs to influence the activation and function of this system may prove key to their beneficial effects.

40|$|The {{renin-angiotensin system}} (RAS) is {{important}} in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume and systemic blood pressure. In a previous study we accidentally found that pharmacological blockade of the RAS in neonatal rats with immature kidneys produced persistent renal morphological abnormalities. This observation suggested that the RAS, in addition to exerting its traditional functions in the control of circulatory homeostasis, {{may play a role in}} normal renal development. The aims of the present studies were to perform a detailed investigation of the consequences of neonatal inhibition of the RAS on long-term renal morphology and function in the rat. Moreover, we wanted to elucidate the specific postnatal time interval during which the rat kidney is vulnerable to an inhibition of the RAS, and whether our observations could be reproduced in a non-rodent kidney. Neonatal rats and piglets received daily intraperitoneal injections of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril during the first 3 weeks after birth. Renal function was analyzed in adult rats using a combination of metabolic balance studies in conscious animals, and renal clearance experiments under anesthesia. Kidney histology was assessed with light microscopy using semiquantitative and stereological methods. ACE inhibition attenuated somatic growth in the neonate and produced persistent renal histopathological alterations characterized by papillary atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammation, tubular atrophy and dilatation, and wall thickening of interlobular arteries, in both rats and pigs. Functionally, adult rats subjected to neonatal ACE inhibition showed: an approximate 15 % reduction in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow; an impaired urinary concentrating ability of renal origin; sodium retention during dietary sodium loading; and a modest and transient potassium wastage during dietary potassium restriction. In spite of the renal histological lesions, neonatally enalapril-treated rats displayed an intact sodium conservation during dietary sodium restriction and a preserved urinary acidification and net acid excretion. The renal lesions induced by enalapril did not seem to be the result of renal ischemia secondary to an arterial pressure reduction, as a blood pressure <b>lowering</b> <b>control</b> drug (nifedipine) did not produce any renal abnormalities. Postnatally, the rat kidney was vulnerable to ACE inhibition during the first 16 days specifically. The only renal abnormality associated with enalapril treatment after 14 days of age, i. e. after nephrogenesis had ceased, was a reduction in the volume fraction of tubular epithelium in the inner stripe of the outer medulla, which is the kidney zone last to mature, suggesting that angiotensin II may promote tubulogenesis at a stage in renal development when nephrogenesis has been completed. Taken together, the present studies demonstrate an essential role for the RAS in normal renal development. These findings underline that drugs which interrupt the RAS should be strictly avoided by pregnant women, and possibly also in newborns with immature kidneys. Moreover, results in the present studies may add to our understanding and care of renal diseases associated with a suppressed RAS during development...|$|E
