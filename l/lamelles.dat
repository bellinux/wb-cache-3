Carol Bentley, Scott Fowler, Caitlin Carter, Edger Godineaux, Geralyn Del Corso, and Keith <b>Lamelle</b> Thomas were also featured in various swing-related dance pieces in the Tony-nominated show during its run at the St. James Theatre.

40|$|The palaeomagnetic {{parameters}} {{of more than}} 5, 000 samples of cores taken from 33 drilling holes through innumerable basalt units of the Vogelsberg Paleovolcano in Hessen were measured. Measurements of specimens of thin and thick layers without any gap proved that inclination, natural remanence, susceptibility and Konigsberger factor were dependent on their distance {{from the surface of}} units, layers, <b>lamelles,</b> etc. Therefore, representative data for the evaluation of palaeomagnetic measurements can be expected only in the interior part of lava flows and intrusions. The statistic method which enclosed all values of measurements gave significant data which was not appropriate for the interpretation of palaeomagnetic and geological events...|$|E
40|$|Dolomite {{aggregates}} from quarries Čelina, Podsusedsko Dolje and Jarče polje {{were subjected}} to tests of abrasive impact strain and freezing. The tests were performed mainly according to standard HRN and ASTM methods and only partly were unstan-dardized methods used. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} determination of the Los Angeles coefficient (KLA), the crushing coefficient (KD), and the re-crushing indexes (lp), before and after 25 and 50 freezing cycles. The obtained data (presented both in tabular and graphic form) are a result of structural and textural petrograp-hic features, genesis and various postgenetic processes, markedly tectonics (microfracturing and cataclasis) and recrystallisation. The influence of size, shape and alignance of dolomite crystals to abrasion and impact strain was investigated together with curving defects, stress twining <b>lamelle</b> and cleavage (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R
5000|$|Currently, hip-hop is {{not only}} a music of the elite, but is an {{important}} voice for the lower classes and those who are poor and underprivileged. Hip Hop is also the voice of the lower class because it allow them to express what their feelings are about any given situation on the country. Also because {{this is a way to}} upper ward mobility and a way to move from poverty to a better economical position. But in particular as Lemelle says [...] "woven together into this scene and the lyrics are a sense of anger and alienation as well as clear desire to seek a better life-weather inside the country or without". (Hip Hip culture and the children of Arusha, Sydney J. <b>Lamelle).</b> In any case what the lower class in Tanzania use the hip hop as way to show the way in which poor people live in their country and at the same time try to gain some economical position. For example, artist Balozi recently worked on a project with poor Tanzanian boys affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, writing a song expressing their plight. The song, “Hali Duni” proceeded to move to the top of the musical charts in Dar es Salaam, and was featured in several movies.|$|R
40|$|Novel and soluble coordinated lithium {{aggregates}} {{have been}} synthesized and structurally well characterized. They are often electron deficient {{and are usually}} multinuclear-multiligand entities hold together by mu-type of bonds. Factors affecting their aggregation {{will be discussed in}} details. The reaction of [(EDBP) Li 2] 2 [(nBu) Li(0. 5 Et 2 O) ] 2 (1) (EDBP-H 2 : 2, 2 '-ethylidene-bis(4, 6 -di-tert-butylphenol)) with one equivalent of ROH in toluene gives [(EDBP) Li 2] 2 [(OR) Li] 2 (2 : R = Bn; 3 : R = CH 2 CH 2 OEt; 4 : R = nBu). In the presence of three equiv THF, the hexa-nuclear compound 1 slowly decomposes to an unusual penta-nuclear lithium complex, [(EDBP) 2 Li 4 (THF) 2][(nBu) Li] (5). Further reaction of 5 with ROH gives [(EDBP) 2 Li 4 (THF) 3][(OR) Li] {R = Bn (6), nBu (7), CH 2 CH 2 OEt (8) } without a drastic change in its skeleton. Compounds [(EDBP) Li 2 (HMPA) 2][(OBn) Li(HMPA) ] (9), [(EDBP) 2 Li 4 (THF) ][(OCH 2 CH 2 OEt) Li] 2 (10) and [(EDBP) 2 Li 4 (OCH 2 CH 2 OEt) (HMPA) ]-[Li(HMPA) 4]+ (11) (HMPA: hexamethylphosphoramide) can be obtained by the reaction of lithium alkoxide 2, 3 and 4 with “oxygen-donor solvent,” such as THF and HMPA respectively, to gives rearranged and solvated products. Among them, compound 8 has shown great reactivity toward ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide yielding polymers with very low polydispersity indexes {{in a wide range of}} monomer-to-initiator ratios. The reaction of 1 with 2 equiv of 2, 4, 6 -trimethylacetophenone in toluene can also obtain a lithium enolate 12 without any drastic change in skeleton. In the presence of excess THF furnishes a lithium enolate, 13, without EDBP backbone. Compound 12 represents the first example of a well-defined lithium enolate initiator for highly isoselective polymerization of MMA under relatively mild reaction conditions. Besides, four novel lithium and magnesium complexes, [(EDBPBS) 2 Li 2 (THF) ] (16); [(EDBPBS) Li(THF) 2] (17); [(BHPMP-TS) Mg(THF) ] 2 (18); [(BHPMP-TS) 2 Mg 2 (THF) 3] 2 (19), stabilized by two new ancillary ligands (EDBP-BS: 2, 4 -di-tert-butyl- 6 -(1 -(3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 2 -hydroxyphenyl) ethyl) phenyl benzenesulfonate; BHPMP-TS: 4 -tert-butyl- 2, 6 -bis(3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 2 -hydroxybenzyl) phenyl- 4 -methyl- benzenesulfonate. In the presence of THF, 17 and 18 can also be prepared directly by 16 and 19 respectively, followed by rearrangement and solvation. More importantly, a combination of free radical polymerization and ring-opening polymerization of lithium alkoxide macroinitiator enables us to synthesize block copolymer, PS-b-PLLA. According to the results of TEM, SAXS and FESEM, these block copolymers show a well-defined material system with self-assembling nanostructures, including sphere, hexagonal cylinder, <b>lamelle</b> and hexagonally packed nanohelix.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{describe}} the histopathological effects of chronic cadmium intoxication on liver, gill, kidney, intestine and striated muscle in silver crucian carp Carassius auratus gibelio. 25 immature 1 +-year-old crucian carp were obtained from a private fishfarm and acclimated to laboratory conditions. After a 21 days exposure to a sublethal cadmium concentration (1. 625 ppm from a Cd (CH 3 COO) 2 x 2 H 2 O stock solution), liver, gill, kidney, small intestine and striated muscle were sampled and processed for histological examination. Histopathological alterations induced by studied heavy metal in the tissues of silver crucian carp specimenes were: nephrocite hypertrophic processes, distruction of intercellular jonctions, stratification of epitelium and congestions both in renal glomerulis and in interstitium; hyalinizations, congestions of blood vassels and vacuolations associated with lipid accumulation at the hepatic level; into intestinal mucosa revealed rich leucocyte infiltrates, with numerous leucocytes situated intraepithelial; branchial <b>lamelles</b> with disordered aspect and multilayered epithelium, vascular ectasias and leucocyte infiltrates into subepithelial connective tissue at the gill level; miolisis processes in peripheral muscular fibers manifested by contractile apparatus alteration on large areas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Eshelby’s energy-momentum tensor is used {{to provide}} an {{analytical}} expression for the driving force for rafting in the elastic regime in a superalloy with a high volume fraction of 7 ’. The structure is modelled as a simple cubic array of y ’ cubes separated by thin sheets of;‘. During rafting, the y ’ particles are constrained to remain tetragonal prisms. For tension along a cube axis, the driving force {{is proportional to the}} product of the tension 6, the fractional difference 6 of lattice parameters of 7 ’ and y and the fractional difference n 2 of their elastic constants c,, ~ c,?. As in the calculation of Pineau for an isolated spheroid, needles are formed when this product a 6 m is positive. Two- and three-dimensional systems behave similarly. The initial plastic strain in 7 is anelastic and in principle reversible. When the plastic strain exceeds m 6, platelets perpendicular to the stress axis are formed if the product rr 6 is negative.
