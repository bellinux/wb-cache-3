5000|$|The earthed {{consumer}} plug {{has several}} claimants to its invention. A 1911 book {{dealing with the}} electrical products of A. P. Lundberg & Sons of London describes the [...] "Tripin" [...] earthed plug available in 2.5 amp and 5 amp models. The pin configuration of the [...] "Tripin" [...] appears virtually identical to modern BS 546 plugs. In her 1914 book Electric cooking, heating, cleaning, etc. Maud Lucas Lancaster mentions an earthed iron-clad plug and socket by the English firm of Reyrolle and Co. The earliest American patent application for an earthed plug appears to be 11 January 1915 by George P. Knapp, {{on behalf of the}} Harvey Hubbell company. This patent covers the use of an earthing pin which extends further than the other two contacts to ensure that it is engaged first. Knapps design was obsoleted in the US before the modern NEMA designations, but is still used in some other countries including China, Argentina and Australia. The configuration of the socket was not operable with existing two-contact unearthed plugs. Other earthed sockets that are widely used in the US today are operable with unearthed plugs. It is sometimes claimed (e.g., in Illumin) that the modern American version of the earthed plug, was invented by Philip F. Labre who was issued a US patent for an earthed socket and plug in 1928. However, <b>Labres</b> design is no more similar to the modern version than Knapps earlier design. The German Schuko-system plug is believed to date from 1925 and is attributed to Albert Büttner. [...] As the need for safer installations became apparent, earthed three-contact systems were made mandatory in most industrial countries.|$|E

50|$|Yvon Jules <b>Labre</b> (born November 29, 1949 in Sudbury, Ontario) is {{a former}} Canadian {{professional}} ice hockey player. <b>Labre</b> was originally drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins, for whom he played 37 games before being selected by the Washington Capitals in the 1974 NHL Expansion Draft. <b>Labre</b> scored the first-ever home goal for Washington, beating the Los Angeles Kings' goaltender Rogie Vachon. Although he was never one to put up big offensive numbers, <b>Labre's</b> value was noted in being a hard-nosed defensive defenceman {{on the ice and}} an active member of community programs and youth hockey programs off it. Such dedication to a team in a location not known for rich hockey history {{made him one of the}} Capitals' most popular players during his time there. <b>Labre</b> served as team captain from 1976 to 1978. He remained in the Capitals organization after his playing career ended. At various times since his retirement, he has served as an assistant coach, colour commentator, scout and the director of community relations for the Capitals. <b>Labre's</b> jersey number (#7) was retired by the Capitals on November 22, 1981.|$|R
40|$|In 1952 Benedict <b>Labre</b> House opened as a {{house of}} {{hospitality}} {{for the poor and}} as a center for the lay apostolate. Situated at 418 La Gauchetière Street in St. Patrick's parish, Benedict <b>Labre</b> House served Montreal's marginalized residents. In 1954, a parallel mission, Patricia House, was established in Griffintown to assist marginalized women and their children. In 1955, Benedict <b>Labre</b> House moved into Griffintown, a small community in St. Ann's Ward, which was once the historical home of the city's Irish Catholic community. Benedict <b>Labre</b> House evolved out of a confluence of the theology and praxis of several American and Canadian lay movements. One of many lay organizations operating within Quebec during this period, this Catholic lay organization was not mandated by the church hierarchy. Despite its unofficial status, Benedict <b>Labre</b> House became known as a vital Catholic lay organization. Through an informal approach to formation, this lay apostolate provided theological, spiritual and practical education to Montreal English lay Catholics from 1952 - 1966. Key to Benedict <b>Labre</b> House in this period was the founding group, including Tony Walsh, and other lay people from Montreal's English Catholic community. This thesis seeks to demythologize Tony Walsh and Benedict <b>Labre</b> House through a critical analysis of the sources. Using many primary documents, such as newspapers, correspondence and interviews, this historical account seeks to examine the evolution of Benedict <b>Labre</b> House's lay theology, its theory and praxis during its founding, 1952 - 1955, its development, 1955 - 1959, and its peak and decline in the Vatican II years, 1960 - 1966...|$|R

50|$|The {{founding}} of St. <b>Labre</b> Indian School in 1884 {{was one of}} the first efforts to care for Native Americans who had been displaced as a result of homesteading. George Yoakum, a former soldier who had been stationed near Miles City, Montana, recognized the hard times experienced by the Northern Cheyenne. He contacted John Brondel, Bishop of Helena and told him of Indian people who were roaming the Tongue River Valley without homes or land - a reservation had not yet been set aside as their land.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the problem of translation, {{providing}} some thoughts on how the books of the poet become the books of the translator, through the analysis of the French translation of Ovid’s Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto by Chantal <b>Labre</b> (Ovide: L’ exile et the salut, 1991). Ovid’s reflections on his own poetry become, in Labre’ translation, reflections on translating; <b>Labre</b> emphasizes the autobiographical character of Ovid’s exile poems. One cannot define L’ exile et le salut a literal translation, in the light of translator’s various interventions. <b>Labre,</b> however, provided a translation that is also faithful exactly because it reveals his status of translation: passages where it leaves literalism to introduce the word “libre”,“fidèle” or “traduire” are nods to remind us that we are not reading the original, but another book...|$|R
