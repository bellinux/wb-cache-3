5|$|Andrew's sketch {{leads to}} the {{identification}} of the kidnapper as Joanne Ostler (Gillian Jacobs), a MIT neurologist who was previously believed deceased. Joanne tricks Ben into helping her complete an unfinished equation by using the image of his mother, who died in the car accident. Meanwhile, Walter suddenly remembers that he heard about the <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> former mathematician Dashiell Kim (Randall Duk Kim), an old bunkmate at St. Claire's Hospital who disappeared under similar circumstances. To discover the child's whereabouts, Olivia encourages Walter to return to St. Claire's. The visit does not go well, and Walter is held by hospital administrator Dr. Bruce Sumner (William Sadler), who remains unconvinced of Walter's sanity.|$|E
5|$|Ford Australia's {{performance}} vehicle partner Ford Performance Vehicles {{produced a}} range of models based on the Falcon BA and marketed under the FPV name. The 2003 BA range included the GT, GT-P, and the Pursuit. The GT was the entry-level vehicle that started with a suggested retail price of A$59,810. The GT-P was the upmarket version of the GT, with a price tag of A$69,850. The Pursuit was a ute (utility) version of the GT, featuring the same seats, basic dash/interior package and wheels. FPV specific body-kits were applied to all cars, using the <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> the XR-range. The kit had a strong resemblance to the BA Falcon V8 Supercar, highlighting the connection to FPR.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} a woman exiting the taxi {{and going to the}} Los Angeles Union Station. A man exits a car and follows her. Wade then plays the first verse and first chorus in the waiting area of the L. A. Union Station. As the band plays the second verse, they are shown playing at the rooftop with Iron Mountain clearly visible. When the chorus plays again, they are shown at the roof with <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> the {{buildings}} of Downtown Los Angeles at night. When Wade sings the bridge, he is {{on the roof of the}} Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood Boulevard. The man and the woman are also seen running in the boarding area of the Los Angeles Union Station. They later meet up and kiss in one of the boarding platforms of the station in front of a train which later starts to move. The video ends with the band sitting down in the waiting hall.|$|E

5|$|At 20:00, Troude ordered Hautpoult {{to steer}} to the {{northwest}} while he took Courageux and Polonais southwest {{in an effort to}} divide the pursuit. Pompee and Recruit kept with Hautpoult, while Neptune, accompanied by the brig HMS Hawk continued to follow Troude's main force. During the night however Troude outdistanced Neptune, and on the morning of 16 April Cochrane ordered all available ships to converge on Hautpoult. The lone French ship of the line had finally forced the damaged Recruit to retire, but could see Pompee and Neptune to the southeast and the newly arrived frigates HMS Latona under Captain Hugh Pigot and HMS Castor under Captain William Roberts to the northeast, with the Spanish coast of Puerto Rico directly north. During the day the chase continued, Neptune falling behind but Pompee remaining in sight and the frigates gaining on Hautpoult. At 17:00, Puerto Rico appeared on the horizon, the French forced to follow the coastline westwards. During the night, the British pursuers were confused by the overcast sky, which helped Hautpoult to partially obscure herself among the <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> shore.|$|E
5|$|The first glider {{casualties}} {{had occurred}} on take off, when two aircraft towing Waco gliders crashed. While on route, {{one of the}} gliders was released early by its towing aircraft, and crashed into the sea. When they did arrive over Sicily, {{the element of surprise}} was gone, and four gliders were shot down by the coastal anti-aircraft batteries. By the time the gliders arrived at their landing zones, two hours had lapsed since the parachute landings had started. One glider pilot later commented that they did not need the pathfinders, as the tracer and <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> explosions were brighter than any of the landing markers. Of the surviving glider force, only four gliders managed to land relatively unscathed, all the others being caught by the Fallschirmjäger machine gun fire and destroyed on their approach. The four intact gliders had been carrying three of the anti-tank guns, which were now included in the bridge's defences. Including the men from the gliders, the 1st Parachute Brigade had 295men at the bridge. Shortage of manpower was not their only problem; their only support weapons were the anti-tank guns, two 3-inch mortars and a Vickers machine gun.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from some}} parts of the {{original}} IRT system, the entire subway uses this signalling system. On the only line that still has the IRT-type signals, the IRT Dyre Avenue Line, the <b>lights,</b> <b>from</b> bottom to top, are yellow, red, and green. On the rest of the system, the <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> top to bottom, are green, yellow, and red.|$|E

25|$|After {{the release}} of the video on November 24, 2015, a few hundred people blocked the {{intersection}} of Roosevelt and Michigan Avenue in protest. On November 25, 2015, more protests were held. On the second night of protest, marchers tore off <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> a public Christmas Tree in Daley Plaza and multiple marchers were arrested.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to observe aurora borealis (northern <b>lights)</b> <b>from</b> Tromsø, as northern Norway {{is located in the}} auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Tromsø is often subject to cloudy conditions which prevents aurora being seen, even if they are present.|$|E
40|$|Holographic LIDAR {{telescope}} includes holographic disk, {{rotation of}} which sweeps collimated, monochromatic beam of <b>light</b> <b>from</b> laser through conical scan. Holographic disk diffracts <b>light</b> scattered back <b>from</b> target volume or area to focal point located at stationary photomultiplier detector. Two conical baffles prevent stray <b>light</b> <b>from</b> reaching detector...|$|R
5|$|The cosmic {{abundance}} of vanadium {{in the universe}} is 0.0001%, making the element nearly as common as copper or zinc. Vanadium is detected spectroscopically in <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the Sun and sometimes in the <b>light</b> <b>from</b> other stars.|$|R
50|$|In optical astronomy, stray <b>light</b> <b>from</b> {{sky glow}} can limit {{the ability to}} detect faint objects. In this sense stray <b>light</b> is <b>light</b> <b>from</b> other sources that is focused {{to the same place}} as the faint object.|$|R
25|$|The CHMSL is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right stop lamps is blocked by interceding vehicles. It also provides a redundant stop light signal {{in the event of}} a stop lamp malfunction. In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light, the CHMSL also helps to disambiguate brake <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> rear position lights and turn signal lights.|$|E
25|$|The Chapel {{includes}} a fascinating play on light, {{as there is}} no artificial light inside the main section of building during the daytime. There is sufficient sunlight to fully light the worship space, as a combination of smooth textures and reflective surfaces maximize all light shone in the building. At night, the <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> outside combined with candles inside the Chapel are more than enough to illuminate the worship area.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September the Germans {{attempted}} a mass Zeppelin attack on London, {{but only two}} airships reached the capital and one of these, SL 11, {{was held in the}} searchlight beams of 22 (Tyne) Company while it was shot down by Lt W. Leefe Robinson of 39 Squadron. On 23 September another mass raid bombed Nottingham, but L32, endeavouring to avoid the London defences, was shot down by 2/Lt F. Sowrey of 39 Squadron cooperating with <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> Nos 9 and 22 Companies.|$|E

25|$|On Deep Core {{the crew}} is waiting for rescue {{when they see a}} message from Bud that he met some friends and warning them to hold on. The base shakes and <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> the trench bring the arrival of the alien ship. It rises to the ocean's surface, with Deep Core and several of the surface ships run aground on its hull. The crew of Deep Core leave the platform, {{surprised}} they are not suffering from decompression sickness, when they see Bud walking out of the alien ship, and Lindsey races to hug Bud.|$|E
25|$|Lanyon {{designed}} Sinclair Seaman's Presbyterian Church in 1856. Thomas Sinclair {{commissioned the}} church in memory of his father John Sinclair, who was a merchant from Belfast. Located on Corporation Square in Belfast's docks area, locally known as Sailortown, the church has a distinctive maritime theme. The lectern {{is made in the}} shape of a ship's prow. It also features a brass wheel and capstan from a World War I wreck, navigation <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> a Guinness barge, and the ship's bell from the pre-World War I battleship HMS Hood.|$|E
25|$|Residential Street {{was visited}} using the Studio Backlot Tour's tram vehicles. When the light display was in place, however, the tram tours would stop before sunset, {{allowing}} guests to walk among the displays. Initially the display was purely the original <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> the Osborne estate, but {{in subsequent years}} the display was augmented to its current size of over five million lights. The display's Disney caretakers have also added a number of hidden Mickeys into the lights. The 2007 edition of the display featured over 40 of the icons.|$|E

50|$|A Fizeau {{interferometer}} is an interferometric arrangement whereby two reflecting {{surfaces are}} placed facing each other. As seen in Fig 1, the rear-surface reflected <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the transparent first reflector {{is combined with}} front-surface reflected <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the second reflector to form interference fringes.|$|R
25|$|The fast lines {{north of}} Harrow and all lines north of Rickmansworth are signalled with LUL signalling, but using four-aspect Network Rail signal heads. The upper two lights are a two-aspect stop signal {{displaying}} either a green or red aspect, the lower two lights a repeater signal {{for the next}} stop signal ahead showing a green or yellow aspect, or no aspect when the stop signal shows a red aspect. Thus they are effectively four-light three-aspect signals with green/red/green/yellow <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> the top, danger being a single red light, caution the top green light over a yellow light, and clear two green lights.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the new {{propeller}} steamer Ogdensburg was heading the other way, from Cleveland to Ogdensburg, New York, carrying {{a load of}} wheat. At 2 am on 20 August, the paths of the two ships crossed near Long Point. On board Ogdensburg, the first mate, Degrass McNeil, was on duty. He spotted <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> Atlantic but was sure that Ogdensburg would pass {{at least a half}} mile ahead of the other ship. But then Atlantic changed course, turning north as though trying to pass in front of Ogdensburg. McNeil ordered Ogdensburg engines reversed and the ship turned to port, and since Ogdensburg steam whistle was broken, McNeil ran out onto the ship's deck and yelled to try and get the other ship to turn to starboard.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} a 2000s {{consumer}} 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote. While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the <b>lights</b> <b>from</b> the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation). The obvious drawback to {{this approach is that}} it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar. More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system. All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{membrane}} {{is close to}} the glass, the reflected <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the glass is shifted half of a wavelength, so that <b>light</b> reflected <b>from</b> {{the membrane}} will have a phase shift compared to the reflected <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the glass phases and therefore cancel each other out (interference). This interference results in a dark pixel in the final image (the left case in the figure).|$|R
5|$|Different studies {{generally}} find varying {{values for}} elemental abundances. This is often because spectrographs attached to telescopes do not collect all the <b>light</b> <b>from</b> objects being observed, instead gathering <b>light</b> <b>from</b> a slit or small aperture. Therefore, different observations may sample {{different parts of}} the nebula.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Light</b> <b>from</b> {{the lower}} edge of the Sun's disk is refracted more than <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the upper edge. This reduces the {{apparent}} height of the Sun when it appears just above the horizon. The width is not affected, so the Sun appears wider than it is high.|$|R
