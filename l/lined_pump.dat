50|$|The second main type of {{concrete}} pump is either {{mounted on a}} truck or placed on a trailer, and it is {{commonly referred to as}} a <b>line</b> <b>pump</b> or trailer-mounted concrete pump. This pump requires steel or flexible concrete placing hoses to be manually attached to the outlet of the machine. Those hoses are linked together and lead to wherever the concrete needs to be placed. <b>Line</b> <b>pumps</b> normally pump concrete at lower volumes than boom pumps and are used for smaller volume concrete placing applications such as swimming pools, sidewalks, and single family home concrete slabs and most ground slabs.|$|R
40|$|A mean <b>line</b> <b>pump</b> flow {{modeling}} method {{has been developed}} to provide a fast capability for modeling turbopumps of rocket engines. Based on this method, a mean <b>line</b> <b>pump</b> flow code PUMPA has been written that can predict the performance of pumps at off-design operating conditions, given {{the loss of the}} diffusion system at the design point. The pump code can model axial flow inducers, mixed-flow and centrifugal pumps. The code can model multistage pumps in series. The code features rapid input setup and computer run time, and is an effective analysis and conceptual design tool. The map generation capability of the code provides the map information needed for interfacing with a rocket engine system modeling code. The off-design and multistage modeling capabilities of the code permit parametric design space exploration of candidate pump configurations and provide pump performance data for engine system evaluation. The PUMPA code has been integrated with the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) code and an expander rocket engine system has been simulated. The mean <b>line</b> <b>pump</b> flow code runs {{as an integral part of}} the NPSS rocket engine system simulation and provides key pump performance information directly to the system model at all operating conditions...|$|R

We describe where and why Fe II fluorescence arises in symbiotic stars and whether the Fe II lambda 1548. 41 channel can only be activated {{when there is a}} white-dwarf wind present in the system. Further, we aim to show how an analysis of the PAR-pumped lines helps to understand the phyisical conditions that they manifest. Methods. We calculate intensities of the C IV-pumped Fe II fluorescence lines in symbiotic stars, corresponding to the y(4) H(11 /) 2 and w(2) D(3 / 2) levels, based on a simple geometrical model of the emitting regions. We apply the model to seven symbiotic stars, known to have Fe II fluorescence <b>lines</b> <b>pumped</b> by C IV in their spectra. We compare the predicted intensities to the observed intensities of the selected symbiotic stars. Results. We find that we can reproduce the observed fluorescence intensities of the seven symbiotic stars in our sample, using parameters that are consistent with their known properties.

We suggest that the detection of Fe II lines corresponding to the w 2 D 3 / 2 level in certain symbiotic stars provide evidence of hot shells expanding with velocities of at least hundreds km s(- 1) in those systems...|$|R
