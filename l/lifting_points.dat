2500|$|With {{the entry}} of Japan into the war the concept was revived in early 1942. A Spitfire V W3760 was fitted {{with a pair of}} floats 25ft 7 in (7.8 m) long, mounted on {{cantilever}} legs.

A Vokes filter was fitted to the carburettor air intake and under the tail an extra fin extension was added. Other changes included external <b>lifting</b> <b>points</b> forward of and behind the cockpit and a spin-recovery parachute with a rudder balance-horn guard. The Spitfire floatplane was first flown on 12 October 1942 by Jeffrey Quill. Soon afterwards the Vokes filter was replaced by an Aero-Vee filter, similar to that on later Merlin 61 series aircraft, which was extended to prevent water entry, and full Mk VB armament was installed. Two more VBs EP751 and EP754 were converted by Folland and all three floatplanes were transported to Egypt, arriving in October 1943. At the time it was thought that the floatplanes could operate from concealed bases in the Dodecanese Islands, disrupting supply lines to German outposts in the area which relied on resupply by transport aircraft. This scheme came to naught when a large number of German troops, backed by the Luftwaffe, took over the British held islands of Kos and Leros. No other role could be found for the floatplane Spitfires, which languished in Egypt, operating from the Great Bitter Lake. Specifications for the VB based floatplane included a maximum speed of [...] at 19,500ft (521km/h at 5,943 m), a maximum rate of climb of 2,450ft/min at 15,500ft (12.45m/s at 4,724 m) and an estimated service ceiling of 33,400ft (10,180 m)..|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringStructures made {{of glass}} {{reinforced}} plastic (GRP), often abbreviated GRP cover, are used to protect subsea equipment in {{the oil and gas}} industry. These structures need to be lifted during fabrication, transportation and during the installation. The present work investigates the lifting capacity of the GRP covers. The aim is to achieve a more accurate analytical estimate of the lifting capacity, with a desire to replace the simplified hand calculations used today. In order to investigate the lifting capacity, a <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> (reinforced <b>lifting</b> holes made of GRP) is studied with both finite element analysis and experimental tests in a hydraulic tensile bench. Three different test setups, Case 1, Case 2 and Case 3 are investigated. Case 1 is a representation of a lift through the splash zone during installation, where the GRP cover is in an upright vertical position. Case 2 is an approximation of a horizontal lift with the <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> located on top of the cover, causing the <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> to encounter out-of-plane loads. Case 3 is a representation of a horizontal four-point lift, with the <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> placed on the side walls. The experimental tests were performed in collaboration with Highcomp AS at Westcon Løfteteknikk in Haugesund. The finite element analysis represents the test setup in the hydraulic tensile bench in order to achieve comparable data. Finite element analysis can reduce cost and time compared with physical experiments. For Case 1, with in-plane loads representing the lifting through the splash zone, the results achieved were within a 2 % error margin. For the out-of-plane situation (Case 2) with solid elements, the results were within a 20 % error margin. The results from the in-plane and out-of-plane scenarios were used in a capacity evaluation to create a graph which represents all results and takes into account the out-of-plane angle from the lifting slings. This graph is easy to use in design and provides good results. Based on the comparison of the results, it was concluded that the Puck criterion with gradual degradation provides the most accurate estimate for the capacity and that use of this criterion can replace simplified hand calculation and reduce the number of physical experiments in the future. Based on these findings, an improvement study was conducted for a 30 mm laminate with Puck criterion and gradual degradation with a new lay-up consisting of fibers at [0, 90, + 45, - 45] degrees, compared to the one used today [0, 90]. The results of the new study showed an increase of over 28 % for the capacity in Case 1 and an increase of over 16 % compared with Case 2. These are interesting results, leading to the conclusion that by introducing the fiber directions + 45 degrees, one can enhance the capacity of the material by about 20 %, and it is easy and efficient to implement in a new design of the <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> used in GRP covers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{horizontal}} boom of {{the tower}} crane in the rotary plane is a cantilever structure with large flexibility. Its stability analysis belongs to critical load problems under double non-conservative forces. In this paper, the second-order theory is used to establish the deflection differential equation in the rotary plane of the horizontal boom. According to the deformation compatibility conditions and the boundary conditions, the exact expression of the deflection equation and the instability characteristic equation in the rotary plane are obtained. The premise of the stability analysis {{is to determine the}} force relationship of the two pulling rods in the horizontal boom with double <b>lifting</b> <b>points,</b> which is a statically indeterminate structure. This paper is aimed at the structural characteristics and the load forms of the general boom. For the calculation of the pulling rod forces in the boom, the general expression is deduced considering the variety of the cross-section, the load and the position of <b>lifting</b> <b>points.</b> A highly efficient method for the stability analysis of the horizontal boom with double pulling rods is provided by the analytic expression of the instability characteristic equation and the internal forces in the statically indeterminate pulling rods.
