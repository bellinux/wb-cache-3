25|$|No mining could legally be {{done without}} being overseen by an overman or deputy. Their union, the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) with 17,000 members in 1984, was less willing to take {{industrial}} action. Its constitution required a two-thirds majority for a national strike. During the 1972 strike, violent confrontations between striking NUM and non-striking NACODS members led to an agreement that NACODS members could stay off work without <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> if they were faced with aggressive picketing.|$|E
25|$|Agitation {{was also}} {{occurring}} in Melbourne where the craft unions were more militant. Stonemasons working on Melbourne University organised to down tools on 21 April 1856 and march to Parliament House {{with other members}} of the building trade. The movement in Melbourne was led by veteran chartists and mason James Stephens, T.W. Vine and James Galloway. The government agreed that workers employed on public works should enjoy an eight-hour day with no <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> and Stonemasons celebrated with a holiday and procession on Monday 12 May 1856, when about 700 people marched with 19 trades involved. By 1858 the eight-hour day was firmly established in the building industry and by 1860 the eight-hour day was fairly widely worked in Victoria. From 1879 the eight-hour day was a public holiday in Victoria. The initial success in Melbourne led to the decision to organise a movement, to actively spread the eight-hour idea, and secure the condition generally.|$|E
2500|$|To {{encourage}} {{the adoption of}} collective bargaining agreements, the Act (as amended) provides for the declaration of an impasse, mandatory and binding 30-day mediation and conciliation, review of the mediator's report, and court review of binding mediation. The Act contains a [...] "make-whole" [...] remedy for bad-faith bargaining intended to encourage employers to bargain in good faith.

2500|$|BALPA {{was also}} in an {{industrial}} dispute with BEA over pay and conditions. The dispute was controversial, those in favour being mainly younger pilots, and those against mostly older. A group of 22 BEA Trident co-pilots known as supervisory first officers (SFOs) were already on strike, citing their low status and high workload. To help train newly qualified co-pilots, SFOs were told to occupy only the third flight deck seat of the Trident as a [...] "P3", operating the aircraft's systems and helping the captain (known as [...] "P1" [...] on the BEA Trident fleet) and the co-pilot ("P2") who handled the aircraft. In other airlines and aircraft, the job of SFO/P3 was usually performed by flight engineers. As {{a result of being}} limited to the P3 role, BEA Trident SFOs/P3s were denied experience of aircraft handling, which led to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay,</b> which they resented. In addition, their status led to a regular anomaly: experienced SFO/P3s could only assist while less-experienced co-pilots actually flew the aircraft.|$|E
60|$|The {{tyranny of}} the employer, which at present robs {{the greater part of}} most men's lives of all liberty and all initiative, is {{unavoidable}} so long as the employer retains the right of dismissal with consequent <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay.</b> This right is supposed to be essential in order that men may have an incentive to work thoroughly. But as men grow more civilized, incentives based on hope become increasingly preferable to those that are based on fear. It would be far better that men should be rewarded for working well than that they should be punished for working badly. This system is already in operation in the civil service, where a man is only dismissed for some exceptional degree of vice or virtue, such as murder or illegal abstention from it. Sufficient pay to ensure a livelihood ought to be given to every person who is willing to work, independently of the question whether the particular work at which he is skilled is wanted at the moment or not. If it is not wanted, some new trade which is wanted ought to be taught at the public expense. Why, for example, should a hansom-cab driver be allowed to suffer on account of the introduction of taxies? He has not committed any crime, and the fact that his work is no longer wanted is due to causes entirely outside his control. Instead of being allowed to starve, he ought to be given instruction in motor driving or in whatever other trade may seem most suitable. At present, owing to the fact that all industrial changes tend to cause hardships to some section of wage-earners, {{there is a tendency to}} technical conservatism on the part of labor, a dislike of innovations, new processes, and new methods. But such changes, if they are in the permanent interest of the community, ought to be carried out without allowing them to bring unmerited loss to those sections of the community whose labor is no longer wanted in the old form. The instinctive conservatism of mankind is sure to make all processes of production change more slowly than they should. It is a pity to add to this by the avoidable conservatism which is forced upon organized labor at present through the unjust workings of a change.|$|E

5000|$|In February 1983, Universal Subscription Television {{abruptly}} {{went out}} of business on WQTV due to a significant <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> subscribers to prevalent infringement of its subscription television signal. It was very easy to duplicate the signal due to its simplistic scrambling method, known as [...] "gated sync suppression," [...] and its [...] "decoding key" [...] hidden in the audio channel subcarrier. This key was easily defeated with a decoder built around an FM stereo demodulator chip known as the LM1800. All of WQTV's subscribers were transitioned to another area subscription television service known as Preview, operated by Time Warner's New England Subscription Television on Worcester's WSMW-TV (channel 27, now WUNI). WQTV flipped to a general entertainment format consisting of off-network drama series, old sitcoms, and movies. The station also continued to run most network shows that were preempted by WBZ-TV, WCVB-TV and WNEV-TV.|$|R

50|$|Despite the scandalous notoriety of the incident, {{supporters}} of the cadets mounted a campaign directly to President Theodore Roosevelt, who had signed the no-hazing law that had resulted in their dismissal.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether overtime {{regulations have}} a significant impact on the hours worked and hourly wages, by focusing on so-called name-only managers in Japan. The term name-only manager refers to an employee who has essentially the same job description as other employees, but who is designated by the company as a manager to exempt them from overtime regulations. As the name implies, the only difference between those managers and other employees is in the applicable regulations on working time. Using longitudinal data, our main results from matching estimation indicate no significant difference in hourly wage or hours worked between the two groups. This implies that name-only managers' base salaries are sufficiently higher to compensate for the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> overtime <b>pay,</b> which supports the fixed-job model. ...|$|R

50|$|Wigand's {{disagreements}} with Sandefur reached a breaking point over a flavor enhancer called coumarin, which he {{believed to be}} a lung-specific carcinogen that the company continued to use in pipe tobacco. Wigand demanded its removal, but a successful substitute had not been found and Sandefur refused on the grounds that sales would drop. This argument led Sandefur to fire Wigand in 1993 and to force him to sign an extended confidentiality agreement forbidding him to speak of anything related to his work or the company. The penalty for violating confidentiality was <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> his severance <b>pay,</b> potential lawsuit, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> medical coverage.

25|$|In Port Royal Captain Herbert brought {{charges against}} Lieutenants Craig and Dennis for 'remissness of duty' {{in the attack}} on the Spanish sloop, and against Lieutenant Scott for 'mutinous behavior.'

Captain Herbert was found guilty of leaving his assigned patrol station, and of not having prepared an anchor to be dropped when the Tyger had entered shallow water, and thus losing his ship. In consideration of Captain Herbert's leadership in saving his crew and bringing them safely to Jamaica, he was sentenced only to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> all <b>pay</b> for his service on the Tyger, and the court recommended that he be continued in service in the Royal Navy.|$|R
