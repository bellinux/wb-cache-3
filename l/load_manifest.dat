Considering the example of command and control environments, we identify shortcomings of previous studies which use either laboratory-based scenarios, lacking realism, or real-world scenarios, lacking repeatability. We identify the hybrid approach of remote-control which allows experimental subjects to remain in a laboratory setting, performing a real-world task in a completely controlled environment. We show that emotional investment is vital for evoking natural responses and that physiological indications of cognitive <b>load</b> <b>manifest</b> themselves more readily in our hybrid experimental setup.

Also, there is no standardization on information, such as commodity classification, <b>load</b> <b>manifests,</b> equipment identification, physical equipment, such as a standard container, etc. is available (1). There is a need for improvements in the transit and delivery times. The VP-Intermodal of Santa Fe R.

A study at Conrail’s intermodal terminal in Morrisville, PA showed that goods were in possession of the company for an average of 2. 3 days from receipt to departure of the shipment. Between 1992 and 1994, annual intermodal loading increased from 3. 1 million to just over 8. 1 million.

40|$|Liquid loading in gas wells is {{generally}} {{described as the}} inability of the well to lift the co-produced liquids up the tubing, which may ultimately kill the well. There is a lack of dedicated models that can mimic the transient features that are typical of liquid loading. Improved characterization of liquid loading in gas wells and enhanced prediction of future well performance can be achieved from the measurements and analyses resulting from this project. An experimental investigation was carried out to study the onset of liquid loading and the subsequent transient phenomena, using a large scale flow loop to visualize two-phase flow regimes, and to measure pressure and liquid holdup along a 42 -m long vertical tube. From this investigation, it is possible to conclude that liquid loading should not be characterized based on onset criteria alone, and that {{it may not be a}} wellbore-only problem, as it would seem that the reservoir also plays a key role in determining if/when/how liquid <b>loading</b> <b>manifests</b> itself. Additionally, the results from the experimental campaign were used to compare the performance of different wellbore flow simulators.

40|$|The large {{aggregating}} proteoglycan, aggrecan, {{better known}} for its physiological role in articular cartilage where it serves to facilitate resistance of compressive forces during joint articulation, is also present within the distinct functional regions of tendon (i. e., compressed/fibrocartilaginous and tensional). Previous studies demonstrate that an increased turnover of aggrecan occurs in tendon, which is mediated principally by the ‘aggrecanases’ and, as such, these proteinases may {{play an important role}} in the normal functioning of the tissue. In the present study, utilising bovine tendon explant culture systems, we demonstrated that aggrecanase-mediated tendon aggrecan turnover may be modulated by generic metalloproteinase inhibitors (i. e., the aggrecanase inhibitor, actinonin and the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, marimistat). As expected, no MMP-generated aggrecan catabolites were detected in the culture system, suggesting that tendon aggrecanases may be inhibited by marimistat. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that aggrecan metabolites are present in the endotenon, surrounding the collagen fibre bundles, suggesting that aggrecan may provide functions of water imbibement and resistance of reversible and repeated compressive <b>loads</b> <b>manifest</b> between the collagen fibres; these functions, in turn, may be associated with increased aggrecan turnover in this tissue. Thus, inhibition of tendon aggrecanases and consequently aggrecan turnover in this tissue, may be related to some of the deleterious effects observed in the tendons of patients undergoing drug therapy with broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors for cancer and arthritis...|$|R

If females are protected, they should require greater etiologic <b>load</b> to <b>manifest</b> the same degree of impairment as males. The objective of this analysis was to examine whether greater familial etiologic load was associated with quantitative autistic impairments in females compared with males. Subjects included 3, 842 dizygotic twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) and 6, 040 dizygotic twin pairs from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study of Sweden (CATSS). In both samples, we compared sibling autistic traits between female and male probands, who were identified as children scoring in the top 90 th and 95 th percentiles of the population autistic trait distributions. In both TEDS and CATSS, siblings of female probands above the 90 th percentile had significantly more autistic impairments than the siblings of male probands above the 90 th percentile. The siblings of female probands above the 90 th percentile also had greater categorical recurrence risk in both TEDS and CATSS. Results were similar in probands above the 95 th percentile. This finding, replicated across two nationally-representative samples, suggests that female sex protects girls from autistic impairments and that girls may require greater familial etiologic <b>load</b> to <b>manifest</b> the phenotype. It provides empirical support for the hypothesis of a female protective effect against autistic behavior and can be used to inform and interpret future gene finding efforts in autism spectrum disorders...|$|R
40|$|Cohesive zone {{models of}} {{fracture}} have seen great success in modeling delamination and debonding of composite materials (Aymerich et al. 2009; Li et al. 2005 b; Yang & Cox 2005). By embedding cohesive zone elements along potential crack planes, arbitrary delamination configurations {{can be represented}} {{without the need for}} a priori knowledge of crack locations or pre-existing cracks. The stress-displacement behavior of elements in cohesive zone modeling is governed by cohesive or traction-separation laws, which dictate the tractions across the interface {{as a function of the}} crack plane separations. For mixed-mode problems, orthogonal sets of cohesive laws can define these relationships for each mode. In fibrous composites, various toughening mechanisms such as matrix cracking and fiber bridging operate at different strengths and length scales forming a complicated amalgamation of processes that are difficult to model directly. With cohesive zone modeling, these processes can be accounted for in the cohesive law via the fracture length scale. Many authors have pointed out that the shape of the traction-separation law and its associated fracture length scales is dictated by the cohesive mechanisms at work (Dávila et al. 2009; Li et al. 2005 a; Yang & Cox 2005) but a general framework for understanding how the evolution of these mechanisms with <b>loading</b> <b>manifest</b> themselves within the cohesive zone structure has not been presented.

40|$|Nowadays most {{industrial}} realities {{undergo a}} strong push to improve cost-effectiveness, productivity {{and quality of}} manufactured products. In particular we focussed our attention {{in the area of}} design of plastic structural components, including both optimization of existing structures and design of new ones. In this case, but the following considerations have a more general value, these needs could be translated into demanding requirements of cost-effectiveness, weight reduction, reduced time-to-market with guarantee reliability. From a material perspective this means demanding mechanical performances, attention to safety margins and need of a better control of key design parameters. To obtain these results, we need to develop a new approach and effective tools in the design of plastic materials and components aimed at tailoring part behaviour to endurance and performance requirements. The target of the project is to find effective tools for predicting life endurance and damage evolution of plastic materials and components under mechanical/thermal service loading, in order to support the development of new material formulations and the design and optimization of structural components. In a particular way, we focussed our work in the characterization and modellization of materials durability and damage mechanisms. One of the main problems related to materials durability is due to fatigue failure. Fatigue process is a progressive weakening of a component with increasing time under load such that loads to be supported satisfactorily for short duration produce failure after long durations [1, 2, 3]. Fatigue failure should not be thought only as the breaking of the specimen into two separated pieces, but as a progressive material damage accumulation [2]. Material damage during fatigue <b>loading</b> <b>manifests</b> as progressive reduction of stiffness and as creep [5]. As standard fatigue testing are expensive in terms of money and time, it is essential to develop new approaches less time consuming and simpler to be implemented. One of the most important goals of the present work is the setting of an investigation method (Accelerated Fatigue Test) very simple to be implemented that is able to differentiate damage accumulation and durability performances of various material formulations in reduced time...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{a series of}} novel Fe-based {{materials}} derived from a bulk metallic glass-forming composition was investigated to improve the ductility of this high-strength glassy alloy. The interplay between the factors chemistry, structure and resulting mechanical properties was analyzed in detail. It has been recognized that subtle modifications of the chemical composition (carbon addition) lead to appreciable changes in the phase formation, which occurs upon solidification (from a single-phase structure to composite materials). As a consequence, {{significant differences in the}} mechanical response of the particular samples have been observed. The materials developed here were fabricated by centrifugal casting. To explore the structure features of the as-cast cylinders, manifold experimental techniques (X-ray diffraction, optical, as well as electron microscopy) were employed. The occurrence of the numerous reflections on the X-ray diffraction patterns has confirmed the crystalline nature of the studied Fe-based alloy systems. The subsequent extensive research on their deformation behavior (Vickers hardness and room temperature compression tests) has revealed that, although the glass-forming ability of the investigated compositions is not high enough to obtain a glassy phase as a product of casting, excellent mechanical characteristics (high strength - comparable to that of the reference bulk metallic glass (BMG) - associated with good ductility) were achieved for the “composite-like” alloys. In contrast, the single phase cylinders, subjected to compressive <b>loading,</b> <b>manifested</b> an amazing capacity for plastic deformation – no failure occurred. The fracture motives developed during deformation of the “composite-structured” samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy. The main emphasis has been put on understanding the mechanisms of crack propagation. Owing to the structural complexity of the deformed samples, it was crucial to elucidate the properties of the individual compounds. Based on the obtained results it was concluded that the coexistence of a soft f. c. c. γ-Fe phase in combination with a hard complex matrix is responsible for the outstanding mechanical response of the tested composites. While the soft particles of an austenite contribute to the ductility (they hinder the crack propagation and hence, cause unequivocal strain-hardening), the hard constituents of the matrix phase yield the strength...|$|R
40|$|The work is {{motivated}} by experimental studies on energy dissipation due to micro-slip in mechanical joints.

This behavior has a repeatable character if contact is re-established and subjected to cycling again. In the present work, a simple multiple-asperity model is developed that suggests a physical hypothesis that when two rough surfaces are brought in contact and subjected to shear loads a certain locking mechanism comes into play at the interface. Such locking occurs due to the tendency of the interface to adapt its contact microstructure to the loading conditions. The adaptation mechanism is described in the present work through the contact inclination angles. The developed model is simple in application and it relates microcharacteristics of the contact to macro-behavior of the system exhibiting itself in energy dissipation. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The research of the gut micro flora and its implications on the host is a very active area of research today. Many important connections between the gut micro flora and obesity and diabetes have been found. These billions of bacteria {{are part of the}} immune system, they produce essential vitamins and they make inaccessible polysaccharides more digestible to the host, just to mention a few of their symbiotic roles for the host. A less explored area is the micro flora in the oral cavity. On the back of the tongue, anaerobic bacteria can reduce dietary nitrate to nitrite which then further can be reduced to nitric oxide, NO. NO is important in several important biological functions, e. g. as a signal substance, vasoregulation, mucus production and antibacterial effects. Vegetables as beetroot and spinach are dietary sources with a high nitrate content. Also drinking water and processed meats can be of relevance. Nitrite is added to processed meat for the prevention of botulism but also adds taste and color.    Experiments on humans indicate that mitochondrial efficiency increases after nitrate <b>load,</b> <b>manifested</b> as a decreased oxygen demand during physical exercise. This can also be relevant under conditions where the mitochondrial function is impaired, such as in diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. First a pilot study was made to evaluate the nitrate reducing effect from the antibacterial mouthwash. The mouthwash proved very effective. The concentrations of nitrate and nitrite in saliva was analyzed by HPLC and saliva from the antibacterial treatment showed greatly reduced concentrations of nitrite and high concentrations of nitrate. Saliva from placebo mouthwash showed high concentrations of nitrite and low concentrations of nitrate as expected. To study the importance of oral bacteria on metabolism, we performed a randomized, cross-over double-blinded study with 19 healthy males between 22 - 43 years. During two separate three-day periods they used an antibacterial and placebo mouthwash, respectively. On the fourth day their basal metabolic rate (BMR) was measured with an indirect calorimetric system. Moreover, samples from saliva, urine and blood were collected but these results are not included in this thesis. An earlier, unpublished study has demonstrated that nitrate administration reduces the basal metabolic rate. Accordingly, our aim was to study potential effects on the basal metabolic rate following reduction of the number of oral bacteria by aid of antibacterial mouthwash. Our hypothesis was that the reduced availability of nitrite would decrease the availability of NO in the body and manifest as an increased basal metabolic rate. The results from indirect calorimetry measurements showed no significant difference between placebo and antibacterial mouthwash, but there may be confounding factors.

Improve the dynamic performance of the system is significant, have the great value for the parameters of the system design and fault diagnosis on this study. 1 UG Three Dimensional Modeling Strategy Electromechanical coupling is the system at the start, brake and <b>load</b> change, <b>manifested</b> in non-stationary process as the basic characteristics of the system, vibration occurred during the non-stationary of electromechanical coupling, has great harm for the safe operation of the system, would cause the device to adverse state of the dynamic, steady state performance, reduce system accuracy, making it difficult to produce high quality products, and even major failure. Therefore,it has important significance to study the precision permanent magnet AC servo drive system to improve the electromechanical coupling vibration of the dynamic performance of the system,in order to reveal the mechanism, master them, and thus to control and use. This chapter from the global coupled electromechanical system point of view, firstly it constructed a three-mass two-axis vibration of the system mathematical model of electromechanical coupling, and then create a three-mass two-axis vibration simulation model of electromechanical coupling, and finally the electromechanical coupling vibration characteristics are analyzed. ...|$|R
40|$|Diffuse {{brain injury}} (DBI) is a {{frequent}} occurrence in motor vehicle collisions, falls, assaults, and sports-related activities. Recent epidemiologic data has estimated that nearly 1. 5 million new cases occur annually in the United States. The prevalence of these injuries identifies a need to design more robust protective measures to prevent and mitigate DBI. The foundation of injury prevention is tolerance thresholds which correlate kinematic and kinetic measures with injury severity. However, the only currently accepted metric dedicated to brain injury tolerance considers only one mechanical parameter, is not injury specific, and is not applicable to the DBI scenario. Prior experimental literature suggested that rotational kinematics including velocity, acceleration, and duration were responsible for gradations of DBI severity. However, {{the relative importance of}} these loading parameters to DBI sequelae remains undefined. To address this issue, this research sought to develop and implement a unique in-vivo experimental model that utilized real-world loading conditions to reliably induce mild DBI. Experimentation included an analysis of functional, behavioral, and pathological outcomes following graded loading conditions to determine primary kinematic correlates to mild DBI severity. In addition, a numerical correlate to tissue-level injury was defined through the analysis of an anatomically accurate finite element model. Results demonstrated that a nonlinear relationship between rotational acceleration magnitude and duration provided the best description of mild DBI severity. In addition, variable <b>loading</b> kinematics <b>manifested</b> as changes in the tissue-level response that were responsible for distinct pathological and behavioral outcomes. These results have important implications regarding new tolerance thresholds that may be used in conjunction with the development of protective measures to minimize the occurrence and severity of DBI...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{behavioral}} {{work has}} shown the existence of both anticipatory and reactive grip force responses to predictable load perturbations, but how the brain implements anticipatory control remains unclear. Here we recorded electroencephalographs while participants were subjected to predictable and unpredictable external load perturbations. Participants used precision grip to maintain the position of an object perturbed by load force pulses. The load perturbations were either distributed randomly over an interval 700 -to 4, 300 -ms (unpredictable condition) or they were periodic with interval 2, 000 ms (predictable condition). Preparation for the predictable <b>load</b> perturbation was <b>manifested</b> in slow preparatory brain potentials and in electromyographic and force signals recorded concurrently. Preparation modulated the long-latency reflex elicited by load perturbations with a higher amplitude reflex response for unpredictable compared with predictable perturbations. Importantly, this modulation was also reflected in the amplitude of sensorimotor cortex potentials just preceding the long-latency reflex. Together, these results support a transcortical pathway for the long-latency reflex and a central modulation of the reflex grip force response...|$|R
