5|$|Now {{a prince}} (pangeran), Amir {{was given the}} title Tengku Pangeran Indra Putera. He lived with Kamiliah in their own home. By all accounts, she was a devout and loving wife, and in 1939 the couple had their only child, a {{daughter}} named Tengku Tahura. According to Dini, Amir professed to Kamiliah that he could never love her as he had Sundari and that he felt obligated to marry her, something which Kamiliah reportedly accepted. The poet retained an album with his Javanese sweetheart's photographs at home and would often isolate himself from his family, <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought.</b> As a prince of Langkat, Amir became a court official, handling administrative and legal matters, and at times judging criminal cases. He once represented the sultanate at the funeral of PakubuwonoX in Java– Amir's last trip to the island.|$|E
5|$|The player {{begins as}} an {{initiate}} {{of a powerful}} sect of magicians, the Shapers. Members of the sect create living beings from the magical essence within themselves. Apprentices are sent to academies to learn the art of shaping and the player's character has been accepted to do so. The player departs on a voyage to the academy aboard a specially modified Drayk, a dragon-like Shaper Creation. During the journey, the Shaper passes a group of islands, {{one of which is}} recognized as the Barred Sucia Island. Locations Barred by the Shapers are closed to both the sect and outsiders alike, meaning a catastrophe has occurred or something very valuable is located there. As the Shaper examines Sucia, <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought,</b> the craft is attacked and mortally wounded by an unidentified sailing ship. After igniting the vessel's sails with a fireball, the craft deposits the Shaper on an abandoned dockside before dying.

5|$|Stengel, hired {{only days}} before spring training, had but a limited {{opportunity}} to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, {{where they would}} end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, Stengel {{went out to the}} mound to take out the angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought,</b> heard the boom, assumed the ball had been hit by a batter, and ran to retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.|$|E
25|$|While <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought,</b> {{he notices}} a parade {{in the street}} and falls in with it. He notices that Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus' disciples, is leading the parade, and many of the temple priests and Roman {{soldiers}} are marching together. They go to the olive grove of Gethsemane, and he sees Jesus walking out to meet the crowd. Understanding the betrayal, Ben-Hur is spotted by a priest who tries to take him into custody; he breaks away and flees. When morning comes, Ben-Hur learns that the Jewish priests have tried Jesus before Pilate. Although originally acquitted, Jesus has been sentenced to crucifixion at the crowd's demand. Ben-Hur is shocked at how his supporters have deserted Christ in his time of need. They head to Calvary, and Ben-Hur resigns himself to watch the crucifixion of Jesus. The sky darkens. Ben-Hur offers Jesus wine vinegar to return Jesus' favor to him, and soon after that Jesus utters his last cry. Judah and his friends commit their lives to Jesus, realizing He was not an earthly king, but a heavenly King and a Savior of mankind.|$|E
500|$|He {{was known}} for his enigmatic and {{introverted}} personality often appearing or disappearing from a room unnoticed, or being completely <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought.</b> He often left philosophical sayings on a chalkboard as a way of provoking thought or as a motivational tool. Prior to game four of the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals, Shero wrote his now famous quote [...] "Win today and we walk together forever" [...] – a statement that continues to be quoted to this day. His son, Ray Shero, also pursued a career in hockey and was the general manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins from 2006–2014 and is the current (as of May 2015) general manager of the New Jersey Devils.|$|E

Scott Morris and Katherine Warren further explain this term by saying, [...] "When women are not presented as withdrawn, they are presented as over engaged, {{to the point of}} losing control: laughing uncontrollably or overcome with extreme emotion." [...] With licensed withdrawal shown in many different types of advertisements, they are seen almost everywhere with many people being exposed to them.|$|E
500|$|As a 17-year-old, Shero {{was signed}} by the New York Rangers to a {{professional}} contract.

On October 16, 1947, he made his NHL debut at the Montreal Forum against the defending Stanley Cup Champion Montreal Canadiens in the 1947–48 season opener. However, he only played 19 games with the Rangers that year while splitting time with the St. Paul Saints in the United States Hockey League. It was during this time that he would first garner the nickname [...] "The Fog". Although more often associated with his loner personality and propensity for being <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought,</b> the nickname actually began during a 1948 game in St. Paul, Minnesota. High humidity on indoor ice surfaces can result in fog. One night in St. Paul the fog was so thick that Shero was the only player who claimed {{to be able to see}} the puck thus earning him the name [...] "Freddy the Fog".|$|E

Sometimes he would meet the young writer Chabanon, who noted some of Rameau's disillusioned confidential remarks: [...] "Day by day, I'm acquiring more good taste, but I no longer have any genius" [...] and [...] "The imagination is worn out in my old head; it's not wise at this age wanting to practise arts that are nothing but imagination." ...|$|E

Two officers — Tsurin and Chekalinsky — enter, the former complaining about his bad luck at gambling. They remark that another officer, Herman, seems obsessed with the gaming table but never bets, being frugal and methodical. Herman appears with Tomsky, who remarks that his friend hardly seems like his old self: is anything bothering him? Herman admits he {{is in love with}} a girl above his station whose name he does not even know. When Prince Yeletsky, an officer, strolls into the park, Chekalinsky congratulates him on his recent engagement. Yeletsky declares his happiness while Herman, aside, curses him enviously. Yeletsky points out his fiancée, Liza, who has just appeared with her grandmother, the old Countess. Catching sight of Herman, the two women note they have seen him before, staring at them with frightening intensity. Herman realizes that Liza is his unknown beloved. When Yeletsky and the women leave, Herman is <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought</b> as the other officers discuss the Countess: known as the Queen of Spades and formerly as the Muskovite Venus, due to her beauty, she succeeded at gambling in her youth by trading amorous favors for the winning formula of Count St. Germain in Paris. Tomsky says only two men, her husband and, later on, her young lover, ever learned her secret, because she was warned by an apparition to beware a [...] "third suitor" [...] who would try to force it from her.
