5|$|The {{first four}} Grizzlies seasons had given average {{attendance}} {{in the middle}} third of the league. However, the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>seasons</b> saw a reduction to among the league's lowest attendances; participating reasons were the team's poor performance and the 1998–99 NBA lockout. Contributing to the conditions for relocation were a weak Canadian dollar, unwillingness of some U.S. players to live in Canada, and lack of local ownership.|$|E
5|$|Game of Thrones has an {{ensemble}} cast {{estimated to be}} the largest on television; during its third season, 257 cast names were recorded. In 2014, several actor contracts were renegotiated to include a seventh-season option, with raises which reportedly made them among the highest-paid performers on cable TV. In 2016, it was reported that several actor contracts were again renegotiated, with five of the main cast members having increased their salary to £2 million per episode for the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>seasons,</b> which would make them the highest paid actors on television. The main cast is listed below.|$|E
5|$|In his <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>seasons</b> with Chicago, Pierce posted {{records of}} just 14–7 and 10–9, but a shaky bullpen {{contributed to his}} {{middling}} record; although he left {{the game with a}} lead in the sixth inning or later 15 times in those seasons, White Sox relievers failed to protect that lead seven times. Indeed, Pierce was seen to be the team's only consistently effective starter in 1960, picking up eight complete-game victories by mid-August. On June 20, 1961, Pierce broke Ed Walsh's White Sox record of 1,732 career strikeouts.|$|E

5|$|In the 1982–83 season, Akram Salman was {{appointed}} as the team's new manager. Al-Talaba started {{the season with}} confidence having won the league in the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>seasons,</b> but finished in second place, only one point behind the league leaders, Salahaddin. Salahaddin were undefeated in the league while Al-Talaba had a single loss, by 2–0 loss to Al-Sinaa {{in the second round}} of matches. The championship was decided in the last match of the season when Al-Talaba met Salahaddin with only one point between them, so Salahaddin needed a win or a draw to secure the title. Al-Talaba scored first and dominated the match until, in the last thirty minutes, Salahaddin managed to equalise. The score remained 1–1, which won Salahaddin the championship for the first time in their history. Hussein Saeed was the top goalscorer with 17 goals, eight goals ahead of another Al-Talaba player, Rahim Hameed.|$|E
