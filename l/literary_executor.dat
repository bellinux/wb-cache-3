5|$|Carson bequeathed her {{manuscripts and}} papers to Yale University, to take {{advantage}} of the new state-of-the-art preservations facilities of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Her longtime agent and <b>literary</b> <b>executor</b> Marie Rodell spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson's papers and correspondence, distributing all the letters to their senders so that only what each correspondent approved would be submitted to the archive.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth David, the British cookery writer, {{published}} eight {{books in}} the 34 years between 1950 and 1984; the last was issued eight years before her death. After David's death, her <b>literary</b> <b>executor,</b> Jill Norman, supervised the publication of eight more books, drawing on David's unpublished manuscripts and research and on her published writings for books and magazines.|$|E

5|$|Robert Hastings {{was one of}} the few SPR {{researchers}} to defend Price. Price's <b>literary</b> <b>executor</b> Paul Tabori and Peter Underwood have also defended Price against accusations of fraud. A similar approach was made by Ivan Banks in 1996. Michael Coleman in an SPR report in 1997 wrote Price's defenders are unable to rebut the criticisms convincingly.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien had {{appointed}} his son Christopher {{to be his}} <b>literary</b> <b>executor,</b> and he (with {{assistance from}} Guy Gavriel Kay, later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume, published as The Silmarillion in 1977. It received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{also gave}} credit to Elizabeth Sanders, Phipps' granddaughter and <b>literary</b> <b>executor,</b> for her {{skillful}} {{handling of the}} last two volumes. The purpose of the work becomes even more apparent and direct under her management and editing of the material. The role of the future marshals becomes more clear in the campaigns of 1797, and especially in the Italian campaign; her handling of the material kept it fully focused on the future marshals Massena, Augereau, Berthier, and Brune.|$|E
50|$|After Davies' {{death in}} 1995, she {{and one of}} their daughters, Jennifer Surridge, became <b>literary</b> <b>executors</b> for his estate, and formed the company Pendragon Ink for this purpose. Together they edited one volume of Davies' criticism.|$|R
5000|$|Bucke later {{testified that}} he was [...] "lifted to and set upon a higher plane of existence" [...] because of his {{friendship}} with Whitman. He published a biography of Whitman in 1883 {{and was one of}} Whitman's <b>literary</b> <b>executors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Examples of <b>literary</b> <b>executors</b> include Sir Edward Marsh for Rupert Brooke, Robert Baldwin Ross for Oscar Wilde, Robert Hayward Barlow for H. P. Lovecraft, Rush Rhees for Ludwig Wittgenstein, Otto Nathan for Albert Einstein, and Regine Olsen for SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard.|$|R
5|$|Edgar Allan Poe, whose poetry {{had been}} {{included}} in Griswold's anthology, published a critical response that questioned which poets were included. This began a rivalry which grew when Griswold succeeded Poe as editor of Graham's Magazine at a higher salary than Poe's. Later, the two competed {{for the attention of}} poet Frances Sargent Osgood. They never reconciled their differences and, after Poe's mysterious death in 1849, Griswold wrote an unsympathetic obituary. Claiming to be Poe's chosen <b>literary</b> <b>executor,</b> he began a campaign to harm Poe's reputation that lasted until his own death eight years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} few months of his life, Lowell {{struggled}} with gout, sciatica in his left leg, and chronic nausea; by the summer of 1891, doctors believed that Lowell had cancer in his kidneys, liver, and lungs. His last few months, he was administered opium for the pain and was rarely fully conscious. He died on August 12, 1891, at Elmwood. After services in the Appleton Chapel, he was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery. After his death, Norton served as his <b>literary</b> <b>executor</b> and published several collections of Lowell's works and his letters.|$|E
5|$|Robertson, now Baker's <b>literary</b> <b>executor,</b> was {{successful}} in having two additional novels published after Baker's death. One of those, Testosterone, was filmed in 2003. Directed by David Moreton and starring Antonio Sabato Jr., the plot was significantly altered and the film was a critical and financial failure. Both Boy Wonder and Fuel-Injected Dreams have been optioned for the movies several times, most recently in 2004, though they were never produced. Baker's work has also been published in Germany, Sweden, Italy, Great Britain, Australia, Japan and Russia.|$|E
5000|$|The PEN/Malamud Award and Memorial Reading honors [...] "excellence {{in the art}} of {{the short}} story", and is awarded {{annually}} by the PEN/Faulkner Foundation. The selection committee is composed of PEN/Faulkner directors and representatives of Bernard Malamud's <b>literary</b> <b>executors.</b> The award was first given in 1988.|$|R
60|$|Two {{or three}} volumes {{collected}} {{out of the}} magazine by himself would be very delightful. But he must not leave it for others to do; for some recasting and much condensation would be required; and <b>literary</b> <b>executors</b> make sad work in general with their testators' brains.|$|R
5000|$|As an {{old friend}} of Gissing, H.G. Wells was asked to write an {{introduction}} to Veranilda. Displeased with the piece Wells wrote, Gissing's relatives and <b>literary</b> <b>executors</b> then asked Frederic Harrison to write a substitute. Well's rejected preface was later published under the title [...] "George Gissing: An Impression".|$|R
5|$|Some of the {{research}} David undertook for English Bread and Yeast Cookery was done with Jill Norman, her friend and publisher. The pair decided that they should produce two further books: Ice and Ices {{and a collection of}} David's early journalism. Like her book on bread, the scope for Ice and Ices grew the more David researched the subject. The compilation of existing essays and press articles took less time, and in 1984 An Omelette and a Glass of Wine was published, edited by Norman who became David's <b>literary</b> <b>executor</b> and edited further David works after the author's death.|$|E
5|$|According {{to one of}} her biographers, Giles St Aubyn, Victoria {{wrote an}} average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life. From July 1832 until just before her death, she kept a {{detailed}} journal, which eventually encompassed 122 volumes. After Victoria's death, her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was appointed her <b>literary</b> <b>executor.</b> Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process. Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them. Part of Victoria's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C. Benson, Hector Bolitho, George Earle Buckle, Lord Esher, Roger Fulford, and Richard Hough among others.|$|E
5|$|From 1950 onwards David {{was well}} known for her {{magazine}} articles and, in the 1960s and '70s, for her kitchen shop, but her reputation rested and still rests principally on her books. The first five, published between 1950 and 1960, cover the cuisine of continental Europe and beyond. In the 1970s David wrote two books about English cooking. The last of her books published in her lifetime was a collection of previously-printed essays and articles. From the extensive notes and archives left by the author, her <b>literary</b> <b>executor,</b> Jill Norman, edited and completed four more books that David had planned. Six other books published since the author's death in various formats in hardback and paperback have been compilations drawn from her existing works.|$|E
5000|$|Memoirs of Lord Byron - {{destroyed}} by his <b>literary</b> <b>executors</b> led by John Murray on 17 May 1824. The decision to destroy Byron's manuscript journals, which was opposed only by Thomas Moore, {{was made in}} order to protect his reputation. The two volumes of memoirs were dismembered and burnt in the fireplace at Murray's office.|$|R

50|$|He {{taught at}} Tokyo University from 1955 and 1957, {{and for a}} year in 1985. He has worked for BBC Radio, the New Statesman as {{literary}} editor, and from 1973 to 1985 as editor of Encounter with Melvin J. Lasky. Thwaite {{is one of the}} <b>literary</b> <b>executors</b> of Philip Larkin, and the major editor of Larkin's work.|$|R
5|$|Beatrice fell in {{love with}} Prince Henry of Battenberg, the son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine and Julia von Hauke and {{brother-in-law}} of her niece Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. After a year of persuasion, Queen Victoria, whose consent was required pursuant to the Royal Marriages Act, finally agreed to the marriage, which took place at Whippingham on the Isle of Wight on 23 July 1885. Queen Victoria consented on condition that Beatrice and Henry make their home with her and that Beatrice continue her duties as the Queen's unofficial secretary. The Prince and Princess had four children, but 10 years into their marriage, on 20 January 1896, Prince Henry died of malaria while fighting in the Anglo-Asante War. Beatrice remained at her mother's side until Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901. Beatrice devoted the next 30 years to editing Queen Victoria's journals as her designated <b>literary</b> <b>executor</b> and continued to make public appearances. She died at 87, outliving all her siblings, two of her children, and several nieces and nephews including George V and Wilhelm II.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 David {{returned}} to England, where food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained in force. Dismayed by {{the contrast between}} the bad food served in Britain and the simple, excellent food to which she had become used in France, Greece and Egypt, she began to write magazine articles about Mediterranean cooking. They attracted favourable attention, and in 1950, at the age of 36, she published A Book of Mediterranean Food. Her recipes called for ingredients such as aubergines, basil, figs, garlic, olive oil and saffron, which at the time were scarcely available in Britain. Books on French, Italian and, later, English cuisine followed. By the 1960s David was a major influence on British cooking. She was deeply hostile to anything second-rate, and to over-elaborate cooking and bogus substitutes for classic dishes and ingredients. In 1965 she opened a shop selling kitchen equipment, which continued to trade under her name after she left it in 1973. Her reputation rests on her articles and her books, which have been continually reprinted. Between 1950 and 1984 she published eight books; after her death her <b>literary</b> <b>executor</b> completed a further four that she had planned and worked on.|$|E

5|$|The Philip Larkin Society is a Charitable {{organization}} dedicated to preserving the memory and works of Philip Larkin. It was formed in 1995 on the tenth anniversary of Larkin's death in 1985, and achieved charity status in the United Kingdom in 2000. Anthony Thwaite, one of Larkin's <b>literary</b> <b>executors,</b> became the society's first president. The current Society Chairman is Edwin Dawes.|$|R

25|$|Verna Jean (later Verna Smith Trestrail), born August 25, 1920, in Michigan, was his <b>literary</b> <b>executor</b> {{until her}} death in 1994. (Her son Kim Trestrail is now the executor.) Robert A. Heinlein in part {{dedicated}} his 1982 novel Friday to Verna.|$|E
25|$|An early {{version of}} the Fellowship's {{encounter}} with the Watcher is found in The Return of the Shadow, part of The History of Middle-earth series, wherein the textual development of Tolkien's Middle-earth-related fantasy is discussed and analyzed by his son and <b>literary</b> <b>executor,</b> Christopher Tolkien. This particular volume focuses upon The Lord of the Rings.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of his friend and co-thinker Karl Marx in 1883, Friedrich Engels served as his <b>literary</b> <b>executor,</b> {{actively}} organizing and preparing for publication various writings of his scholarly friend. This activity, while time consuming, did not fully occupy Engels' available hours, however, and he managed to persevere reading and writing on topics of his own.|$|E
50|$|This {{work was}} {{published}} posthumously, in 1795, using material which Adam Smith {{had intended to}} publish eventually but had not prepared {{at the time of}} his death in 1790. This was done by his <b>literary</b> <b>executors,</b> two old friends from the Scottish academic world; physicist/chemist Joseph Black and pioneering geologist James Hutton. A brief account of their work appears in a section entitled 'Advertisement by the Editors'.|$|R
25|$|Smith's <b>literary</b> <b>executors</b> {{were two}} {{friends from the}} Scottish {{academic}} world: the physicist and chemist Joseph Black, and the pioneering geologist James Hutton. Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication. He mentioned an early unpublished History of Astronomy as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as Essays on Philosophical Subjects.|$|R
