40|$|Abstract [...] - The {{inspiration}} {{for the use of}} the resonant inverter shoots from an aspiration to minimise the switching <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> the inverter devices. This paper portrays an exhaustive study on <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> the resonant DC link inverter. Equations for accessing the diverse <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> the resonant DC link inverter and a corresponding hard switching inverter are developed. Based on these equations, a design optimization is executed for the DC link inverter to attain the optimum standards of the link components. Finally, an evaluation of the <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> the resonant inverter and the hard switching inverter is presented...|$|R
