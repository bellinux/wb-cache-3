50|$|The {{court was}} {{established}} by Congress in 1863 as the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, replacing the abolished circuit and district courts of the District of Columbia {{that had been in}} place since 1801. The court consisted of four justices, including a chief justice, and was granted the same powers and jurisdiction as the earlier circuit court. Any of the justices could convene a United States circuit court or a <b>local</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>court.</b> In 1936, Congress renamed the court the District Court for the District of Columbia. Its current name was adopted in 1948, and from then on justices were known as judges.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on <b>local</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>court</b> {{records in}} western and central South Carolina, this {{dissertation}} follows the legal experiences of black girls in South Carolina courts between 1885 and 1920, a time span {{that includes the}} aftermath of Reconstruction and the foundational years of Jim Crow. While scholars continue to debate {{the degree to which}} black children were included in evolving conversations about childhood and child protection, this dissertation argues that black girls were critical to turn-of-the century debates about all children's roles in society. Far from invisible in the courts and jails of their time, black girls found themselves in the crosshairs of varying forms of power [...] including intraracial community surveillance, burgeoning local government, Progressive reform initiatives and military policy [...] particularly when it came to matters of sexuality and reproduction. Their presence in South Carolina courts established boundaries between early childhood, adolescence and womanhood and pushed legal stakeholders to consider the legal implication of age, race, and gender in criminal proceedings. Age had a complicated effect on black girls' legal encounters; very young black girls were often able to claim youth and escape harsher punishments, while courts often used judicial discretion to levy heavier sentences to adolescents and violent girl offenders. While courts helped to separate early childhood from the middle years, they also provided a space for African-American children and family to engage a legal system that was moving rapidly toward disenfranchising blacks.

40|$|The Fourth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s {{exclusionary rule}} {{requires}} that <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> suppress evidence obtained {{as a result}} of an unconstitutional search or seizure. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that suppression is purely regulatory, not remedial. Its only purpose is to deter future police misconduct, not to remedy past privacy or liberty harm suffered by the defendant. Exclusion is for the benefit of those in the community who might, sometime in the future, be subject to police misconduct like that suffered by a defendant. This regulatory purpose would be most effectively realized if <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> had tools for identifying those instances of unconstitutional searches and seizures that are most representative of widespread police misconduct. Currently, state and <b>local</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> - where the vast majority of Fourth Amendment suppression motions are litigated - decide Fourth Amendment suppression motions without the benefit of well-developed contextual information regarding local police practices. Informational bottlenecks and other design defects prevent <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> from systematically recording and analyzing all of the information that is available to them regarding systemic police misconduct. This Article suggests procedural and other reforms to correct these defects and allow <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> to achieve their full regulatory potential. For example, <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> might, under appropriate circumstances, aggregate different defendants 2 ̆ 7 Fourth Amendment claims and grant group-based suppression.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Many State and <b>local</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> {{began to}} be {{inundated}} with felony drug defendants {{in the latter half}} of the 1980 's. Concern over growing street drug dealing and drug-related crime led to greatly increased enforcement efforts against drug sellers and users, resulting in substantial increases in felony drug caseloads. Between 1980 and 1989, drug arrests in the United States increased 134 percent, while the number of total arrests increased only 37 percent. Moreover, data from the National Institute of Justice's Drug Use Forecasting Program suggest that drug use is common among arrestees for nondrug crimes as well. Suburban and rural courts, as well as those in urban areas, have been affected. The emphasis on apprehension of low-level street dealers (often through undercover "buy-bust" or sting operations) and the escalation of legislated penalties against drug sale and possession have tended to yield large numbers of serious felony arrests. The strength of thes...|$|R

40|$|Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070 {{has focused}} {{attention}} on whether federal law preempts the prosecution of state immigration crime in <b>local</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts.</b> Absent from the current discussion, however, is an appreciation of how Arizona’s existing body of criminal immigration law—passed well before SB 1070 and currently in force in the state—functions {{on the ground to}} regulate migration. Drawing on statistical data, prosecution policies, trial-level court records, and interviews with stakeholders, this Article is the first to investigate the practice of local immigration prosecution. It does so in the hotbed of immigration enforcement—Maricopa County, Arizona—through a detailed case study of the implementation of a 2005 Arizona alien smuggling law. Specifically, this Article reveals four key aspects of the national immigration system that have shifted in the face of state criminalization: the functional definition of immigration crime, the breadth of state immigration enforcement authority, the allocation of federal resources for criminal prosecution, and the exercise of executive control over immigration policy. Through this analysis, this Article shows how Arizona, despite the formal prohibition on state and local immigration regulation, has redefined and restructured the federal system for punishing immigration crime. In so doing, this Article fosters a richer and more accurate understanding {{of the role of the}} local prosecutor in immigration federalism...|$|R
