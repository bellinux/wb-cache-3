5|$|After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took {{on their}} larger scale, which was {{particularly}} suited for public art commissions. As {{a matter of}} practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By {{the end of the}} 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before casting the final work in bronze using the <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> technique. These maquettes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands—a process which gives his work an organic feeling. They are from the body.|$|E

Statement - ‘Souvenirs’ Roberta Bernabei Craftsense September 2012 - 2013. Souvenirs respond to the collections of Bilston enamel at the museum by reinterpreting the forms and techniques of patch boxes, nutmeg containers and souvenir boxes. The intention is to combine traditional techniques such as piercing, <b>wax</b> modelling, <b>lost</b> cast <b>waxing</b> and enamelling with 21 st century techniques such as rapid prototyping and enamel transfer. The contrast of traditional and contemporary lies in the combination of a 3 D printed nylon bezel with traditionally enamelled copper oval, on which imagery has been applied through enamel transfer. The colours of the nylon bezels, such as Royal blue, have been selected in accordance with the predominant colours of English enamel boxes during the late 18 th century. The images used to decorate the ovals are compositions related {{to the use of the}} boxes and a Smart Code; a contemporary equivalent from our digital messaging system. Each piece of work has images that convey a message visually through drawing; along with a Smart Code that explicitly reveals the hidden idiom or saying that the drawing represents. Thus, our modern way of revealing information is comparable to the unspoken rules of the late 18 th century, such as those concerning the use of beauty spots and where they were placed on the face...|$|R
25|$|Semi-filigree, {{which was}} not woven with gold thread but cast using the <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> method, was the {{characteristic}} feature of the decoration of Zenú goldwork. Next to casting, gold was also hammered into plates and reliefs. Gold ornaments typically were made of an alloy {{with a high degree}} of gold. Waterfowl, alligators, fish, cat, and deer figures were sources of food as well as elements of their culture. The animal world was depicted in gold pendants and in gold ornaments to be placed on the head of a staff.|$|E
25|$|Metalworking in Mesoamerica, {{especially}} of silver, gold and copper, was highly advanced when the Spanish arrived. Gold was inlaid into copper and metals were hammered to paper thinness and cast using the <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> method. Some copper and iron tools where produced, but pre-Hispanic metal craft {{was dominated by}} jewelry and ornaments. The Spanish introduced new techniques such as filigree work, where tiny threads of metal are strung together to make jewelry. During the colonial period, indigenous peoples were forbidden to work with precious metals. Today, ancient designs have been revived with Taxco being the center of silversmithing. Silverwork {{is now one of}} Mexico's major exports. Copper work is particularly abundant in Michoacán. A traditional hammered copper object is a large vessel in which pork fat is rendered or sugar caramelized for making candies. Every year during the month of August Santa Clara del Cobre holds a copper festival.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the method of}} manufacturing casts made of the IN- 713 C nickel superalloy using the <b>wax</b> <b>lost</b> investment castingprocess and silicon carbide chills. The authors designed experimental casts, the gating system and selected the chills material. Wax pattern,ceramic shell mould and experimental casts were prepared {{for the purposes of}} research. On the basis of the temperature distributionmeasurements, the kinetics of the solidification process was determined in the thickened part of the plate cast. This allowed to establish thequantity of phase transitions which occurred during cast cooling process and the approximate values of liquidus, eutectic, solidus andsolvus temperatures as well as the solidification time and the average value of cast cooling rate. Non-destructive testing and macroscopicanalysis were applied to determine the location and size of shrinkage defects. The authors present the mechanism of solidification andformation of shrinkage defects in casts with and without chills. It was found that the applied chills influence significantly the hot spots andthe remaining part of the cast. Their presence allows to create conditions for solidification of IN- 713 C nickel superalloy cast withoutshrinkage defects...|$|R
40|$|Mamey sapote (Pouteria sapote (Jacq.) H. E. Moore and Stearn) {{fruit is}} highly {{appreciated}} in the Caribbean region; however, marketable life is significantly limited by abrupt softening during postharvest handling. Postharvest wax and 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) treatments were evaluated for potential of extending mamey sapote postharvest life. Fruit of the cv. Magaña were harvested at mature green (G), light orange (LO) and orange (O) {{stages of the}} pulp color, and brushed to remove excess epidermal fiber. Waxed (carnauba emulsion) and unwaxed fruit (G and LO stages) were held at 13 °C for 7 days, then transferred to 20 °C for ripening; those at O stage were held constantly at 20 °C. In a subsequent test, ‘Magaña’ fruit were harvested at a preclimacteric stage (LO), brushed, and treated with ±carnauba wax and ± 1 -MCP (1 μl l− 1 at 20 °C for 24 h). Fruit from all treatments were subsequently stored at 20 °C and 85 – 90 % relative humidity. Unwaxed ‘Magaña’ fruit reached climacteric maxima in 10 – 11 days, irrespective of harvest maturity or storage regime (Exp. 1). At 20 °C, peak CO 2 production ranged from 90 to 137 ml kg− 1 h− 1 and peak ethylene production from 116 to 209 μl kg− 1 h− 1, respectively. Waxed fruit generally had higher CO 2 and C 2 H 4 production rates than unwaxed fruit. When LO fruit was stored continuously at 20 °C (Exp. 2), wax treatment alone hastened the onset of respiration and ethylene climacteric peaks by 5 days over unwaxed fruit. 1 -MCP treatment alone delayed the onset of respiration and ethylene climacteric maxima by 6 and 5 days, respectively. Marketable life for wax-only fruit stored continuously at 20 °C was 10 days, while that for control, wax + 1 -MCP and 1 -MCP-only fruit was 13, 14, and 14 days, respectively. Mamey sapote fruit treated with <b>wax</b> <b>lost</b> less weight during continuous storage at 20 °C. At the full-ripe stage, no treatment effects were noted for pulp soluble solids content (23. 4 %) or pH (5. 7). Mamey sapote fruit treated with wax + 1 -MCP, however, retained total titratable acidity (0. 25 %) and lost less acid during storage than wax-only fruit (0. 14 %) ...|$|R

2500|$|Figurines made of metal, {{primarily}} bronze, are {{an extremely}} common find at early Greek sanctuaries like Olympia, {{where thousands of}} such objects, mostly depicting animals, have been found. They are usually produced in the <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> technique and can be considered the initials stage {{in the development of}} Greek bronze sculpture. The most common motifs during the Geometric period were horses and deer, but dogs, cattle and other animals are also depicted. Human figures occur occasionally. The production of small metal votives continued throughout Greek antiquity. In the Classical and Hellenistic periods, more elaborate bronze statuettes, closely connected with monumental sculpture, also became common. [...] High quality examples were keenly collected by wealthy Greeks, and later Romans, but relatively few have survived.|$|E
2500|$|Lugs {{used today}} on higher {{performance}} bicycles are investment cast (aka <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> process). [...] Copies of the lugs {{are made in}} wax, and they are attached together into a [...] "tree". [...] The tree is surrounded by ceramic and fired in a kiln, thereby melting the wax and setting the ceramic. [...] Finally, molten steel is poured in to produce the lug. [...] Cast lugs have many advantages over stamped lugs: they allow much finer detail, tighter tolerances (and correspondingly less manipulation and file work), and more accurate angles, {{and they can be}} made from superior materials (chromoly or stainless steel). [...] The disadvantages of cast lugs are few: casting doesn't allow for long points or cutouts (done for aesthetic appeal), it is difficult to bend the lug to change the angle (requiring framebuilders to order lug sets that precisely match the desired frame geometry), and they are more expensive.|$|E
2500|$|Bronze statues were {{of higher}} status, but have survived in far smaller numbers, {{due to the}} {{reusability}} of metals. They were usually made in the <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> technique. Chryselephantine, or gold-and-ivory, statues were the cult-images in temples and were regarded as the highest form of sculpture, but only some fragmentary pieces have survived. [...] They were normally over-lifesize, built around a wooden frame, with thin carved slabs of ivory representing the flesh, and sheets of gold leaf, probably over wood, representing the garments, armour, hair, and other details. In some cases, glass paste, glass, and precious and semi-precious stones were used for detail such as eyes, jewellery, and weaponry. Other large acrolithic statues used stone for the flesh parts, and wood for the rest, and marble statues sometimes had stucco hairstyles. Most sculpture was painted (see below), and much wore real jewellery and had inlaid eyes and other elements in different materials.|$|E

[...] The physical details of all the engines, such as bore and stroke etc. are known from both contemporary records and surviving examples. [...] There were also variations within types, as development proceeded. Nonetheless, all the V-8s had much in common. [...] They all had their cylinder banks separated by 90°, leaving space within the V for inlet manifolds and valvegear. [...] All were water-cooled; each cylinder was enclosed with an electrolytically formed copper jacket. Initially these were produced with {{a variant of the}} <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> process. [...] The cylinders were coated with wax, which was then coated with black lead to make it electrically conductive and copper plated. [...] Afterwards the wax was removed by heating. [...] Later, the insulating wax was replaced with electrically conducting, low melting point white metal, simplifying the process. [...] Pistons were made of steel, with cast iron rings, and the crankcases were cast aluminium. [...] There was one plug per cylinder, supplied by a gear-driven magneto alone or with an additional battery-driven ignition coil and distributor for dual ignition.|$|E
