[...] Vasey replied that what he meant was that he, Vasey, was <b>lucky.</b> <b>He</b> confided to Herring that he felt that he had made a potentially disastrous mistake: [...] "it is quite wrong to send out a small unit like the 2/6th Independent Company so far that they cannot be supported." ...|$|E
500|$|Lady Gaga x Terry Richardson {{consists}} of photos (in black-and-white and in color) that Richardson took of Gaga during a ten-month period, {{ranging from the}} singer's performance at Lollapalooza in 2010 to the final shows of her 2009–11 Monster Ball Tour. More than 100,000 pictures were taken during the time period with over 350 appearing in the book. The book also includes a Gaga-written foreword about her relationship with Richardson that doubles as an examination of self. [...] "With Terry, the relationship extends beyond the photograph, and if you're <b>lucky,</b> <b>he</b> will teach you something truly profound about yourself." ...|$|E

Doctors diagnosed his injury as a ruptured disc and urged him to retire. [...] He was told following the injury that he was <b>lucky</b> <b>he</b> could still walk without a cane and not to risk further damage on the ice. [...] Instead, Stewart had the disc removed and after completing what Black Hawks' team doctors described as a [...] "most remarkable" [...] recovery, he opted to continue his career and signed with Chicago for the 1951–52 season.|$|E

500|$|On 4 October 2006, it was {{announced}} that actress Nadine Lewington had been cast in the role of Maddy. Lewington had made a previous appearance in series 20, episode 22 of Holby City sister show Casualty. Lewington recalls of her role: [...] "I was a young married mum of one with another on the way. I loved my little bump. My reckless hubbie had had a motorbike accident, in which a baby was injured, after promising to give the bikes up. I threatened to leave him, Charlie Fairhead gave him what for and told him how <b>lucky</b> <b>he</b> was to have me and he promised to be model father after all. Happily ever after. It was a really sweet little story actually. Very touching".|$|E
500|$|Though Reitman {{has claimed}} in countless {{interviews}} {{that he wrote}} the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting with other actors all along including his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk {{a fine line between}} aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, [...] "If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and you still want to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney. I was very <b>lucky</b> <b>he</b> said yes." [...] Reitman said, on the B.S. Report with Bill Simmons, that he considered Steve Martin for the part if Clooney declined the role. Reitman said that he would have changed the movie with Martin and given Martin [...] "his Lost in Translation." ...|$|E
500|$|As a {{professional}} gambler he was undoubtedly a skilled player, once rated amongst the world's top ten backgammon competitors. He won the StJames's Club tournament and was Champion of the West Coast of America. He gained the moniker [...] "Lucky" [...] Lucan, but his losses easily outweighed his winnings, and in reality he {{was anything but}} <b>lucky.</b> <b>He</b> had interests in thoroughbred horses; in 1968 he paid more in race entry fees than he received in winnings. Despite some arguments over money, his wife remained largely ignorant of his losses, retaining the use of accounts at Savile Row tailors and various Knightsbridge shops. Following the births of George (1967) and Camilla (1970), she suffered post-natal depression. Lucan became increasingly involved in her mental well-being, and in 1971 took her for treatment at a psychiatric clinic in Hampstead, where she refused to be admitted. Instead, she agreed to home visits from a psychiatrist and a course of anti-depressants. In July 1972 the family holidayed in Monte Carlo, but Veronica quickly returned to England, leaving Lucan with their two elder children. The combined pressures of maintaining their finances, paying for Lucan's gambling addiction and Veronica's weakened mental condition took their toll on the marriage; two weeks after a strained family Christmas in 1972, Lucan moved into a small property in Eaton Row.|$|E

His pipe is made by Kapp and Peterson, Dublin's best-known tobacconists (their slogan was 'The thinking man's pipe') which he refers to as a [...] "briar" [...] but which Estragon calls a [...] "dudeen" [...] emphasising the differences in their social standing. He confesses to a poor memory but it is more a result of an abiding self-absorption. [...] "Pozzo is a character who has to overcompensate. That's why he overdoes things ... and his overcompensation has to do with a deep insecurity in him. These were things Beckett said, psychological terms he used." ...|$|E

However, Shelley [...] "flipped off" [...] Foley and proceeded to beat him up. In the aftermath, Mick mentioned that Shelley is <b>lucky</b> <b>he</b> still has his job. The Main Event Mafia's Kevin Nash, Booker T, and Scott Steiner were going to take on Brother Devon, A.J. Styles, and Mick Foley in his debut matchup at Genesis. Nash, however, suffered a legitimate staph infection and missed Genesis. He was replaced by Cute Kip. Foley got the pin when he hit Scott Steiner with a double arm DDT onto a chair.|$|E

(He already controlled 70% of German match production before the loan agreement.) When he signed the contract he had no idea where he would obtain the huge amount, however he was lucky. [...] Prime Minister Aristide Briand of France decided to repay before it was due a previous $75 million-dollar loan from Ivar. Incredibly, the French agreed to pay this sum by April 1930, just before Ivar's first payment to Germany was due. That payment gave Ivar enough cash to make his first installment. Either he had negotiated a sweetheart rescue deal with Prime Minister Briand, or he was incredibly <b>lucky.</b> <b>He</b> also made $5M (c. $75 million in today's currency) due to the way the loan to France was structured. (It had been discounted and although France received only $70 million it was obligated to pay back $75 million.) ...|$|E
2500|$|During Vaughan's tenure, Lucky {{also made}} a drastic {{character}} change away from his previously known quick thinking and street smarts, seen both in his police work and personal life. By 2009, Abby West of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Lucky was [...] "a character who's been written as earnest (he's Johnny Law to his father's rebel) if not the brightest bulb", while Leslie Gray Streeter of The Palm Beach Post called him [...] "everybody's favorite cute punching bag." [...] The character's misfortune escalates in 2006, when Lucky becomes addicted to painkillers following the stress of a back injury, his medical bills and his guilt {{over the death of}} his partner. Adding to his stress, his pride is often hurt when Elizabeth is saved from peril by Jason Morgan (Burton) rather than him, adding stress to their marriage. His addiction leads to an affair with Maxie Jones (Storms), who supplies him pills and fakes a pregnancy in an attempt to make him stay with her. Elizabeth finds out about the affair and sleeps with Jason, becoming pregnant and telling <b>Lucky</b> <b>he</b> is the father. The series of unfortunate storylines led Steeler to state that the writers [...] "made [...] a dull stooge whose woman would rather be with anyone else but him", while TVSource Magazine called Lucky [...] "Port Charles' bumbling police detective who just can't catch a break".|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of Lucky, paired with Luke and Laura's reintroduction, {{was met with}} some cynicism; Georgia Dullea of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel did not approve of the show's decision {{to let go of}} other popular characters in order to introduce the family. Dullea also accused the series of using Lucky, an attractive child character, as an effort to get fans to care for Luke and Laura as much as they did {{during the height of the}} couple's popularity. However, ratings rose after the family appeared, and fans responded positively. Jackson's portrayal of Lucky was also welcomed and received praise from critics. Allison Waldman of The Huffington Post reflected in 2008: [...] "Jonathan came onto the show with huge expectations thrust upon him. He was Luke and Laura's son, Lucas Lorenzo Spencer, Jr. – <b>Lucky.</b> <b>He</b> had to be up to speed in scenes with Genie Francis and Anthony Geary. (...) Jonathan was perfect right out of the gate; he looked, sounded and acted like he'd be Luke's kid. He was sensitive like Laura, too, not just a smart ass kid." [...] In 1995, Jackson won his first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series and his first Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Child Actor. He was nominated for Young Artist Awards in 1996, 1997 and 1999. He won The Hollywood Reporters YoungStar Award in 1995, 1997, 1998 and 1999, and was nominated in 2000. He again won Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Younger Actor in 1998 and 1999, making him the record holder for the Younger Actor category, both with three wins and with six nominations. Jackson won the Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Younger Lead Actor in 1999. During his teenage years as Lucky, Jackson became a popular [...] "teen heartthrob" [...] among fans, featured on fan magazines such as Tiger Beat and garnering many fan clubs and internet fansites.|$|E
