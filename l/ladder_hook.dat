50|$|Crest: A scaling <b>ladder</b> or, <b>hooked</b> {{and pointed}} sable.|$|R
5000|$|A fire-sport {{tower and}} a <b>ladder</b> with <b>hooks</b> are needed. The {{goal is to}} reach the fourth floor by hooking the window frames of the tower. The most {{challenging}} event.|$|R
5000|$|The ladder was {{developed}} to access buildings via enclosed alleys, lightwells and yards to which other types of ladder could not be taken. A pair of men and two ladders {{could be used to}} scale a building to considerable heights, by climbing from floor to floor and taking the ladders up behind and pitching to the next floor.The original French design was a single beam ladder with pairs of rungs projected outward {{on both sides of the}} beam. The British version was a conventional 2 string ash ladder around 13 foot (4m) long and around 10 inches (250mm wide). <b>Hook</b> <b>ladders</b> can be used to scale from floor to floor on multi-storey buildings by way of exterior windows. The <b>ladders</b> <b>hook</b> onto the window ledge by a [...] "gooseneck" [...] projecting from the top. Lengths vary from 10 to 16 feet.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hook</b> <b>ladder,</b> {{also known}} as a pompier ladder (from the French pompier meaning firefighter) is a type of ladder that can be {{attached}} to a window sill or similar ledge by the use of a hooked extending bill with serrations on the underside. The <b>hooked</b> <b>ladder</b> then hangs suspended vertically down the face of the building.|$|R
50|$|At the Port of Haifa, teams {{needed to}} {{retrieve}} their next clue {{from the top}} of a large shipping container, which included crossing a rope ladder from one container to another and then crossing a large gap. They would be provided with an assortment of items which they could use however they wanted to get to the top. These items included <b>ladders,</b> <b>hooks,</b> a yoga ball, and a key which, unbeknownst to teams, would unlock a door halfway up that contained an extra ladder. Teams could take as many items that they needed, although {{it may be difficult to}} transport certain items up with them.|$|R
25|$|<b>Hooks,</b> <b>ladders</b> and buckets were financed {{through the}} {{collection}} of fines for dirty chimneys, and a fire watch was established, consisting of eight wardens which were drawn from the male population. An organization known as the prowlers but given the nickname the rattle watch patrolled the streets with buckets, <b>ladders</b> and <b>hooks</b> from nine in the evening until dawn looking for fires. Leather shoe buckets, 250 in all, were manufactured by local Dutch shoemakers in 1658, and these bucket brigades are regarded {{as the beginning of}} the New York Fire Department.|$|R
50|$|A {{volunteer}} fire department {{was established in}} Jabłonna in April 1912. The first unit of firefighters was equipped with a manual pump, hoses, <b>ladders,</b> boat <b>hooks,</b> buckets, axes and hatchets. Equipment was stored in a wooden shed next to the building which is now the Municipal Office. The first fire truck was an Opel Blitz.|$|R
50|$|On 28 May 2009, INS Talwar, while escorting three {{merchant}} vessels - Maud, Southern Independence and Aramis. At around 10.20 GMT, {{while about}} 225 nmi km east of Aden, Talwar received a distress signal from Maud about a skiff with eight armed {{persons on board}} approaching it at very high speed. The frigate immediately dispatched its Chetak helicopter armed with 7.62mm light machine guns which spotted pirates scrambling up a <b>ladder</b> <b>hooked</b> to MV Maud. The helicopter fired on the two pirates on the ladder and they fell into the sea. Simultaneously, the frigate sent its naval commandos on Prahar high-speed inflatables to intercept the skiff. Six pirates were disarmed and their cache of Kalashnikov assault rifles, Katyushka rockets, a rocket launcher, flares and mobile phones were seized. Since the freighters were still in dangerous waters and needed escort, the frigate left the disarmed pirates to drift {{on the high seas}} after emptying their skiff's fuel tank and disabling it. The pirates were later arrested by warships from the global task force in a follow-up action.|$|R
5000|$|The first American {{attempt at}} fire {{insurance}} failed after a large fire in Charlestown, Massachusetts in 1736. Later in 1740, Benjamin Franklin organized the Philadelphia Contributionship to provide fire insurance, {{which was more}} successful. The Contributionship adopted [...] "fire marks" [...] to easily identify insured buildings. Firefighting started to become formalized with rules for providing buckets, <b>ladders,</b> and <b>hooks,</b> and {{with the formation of}} volunteer companies. A chain of command was also established.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} is the APS, {{which stands for}} [...] "autopompa serbatoio" [...] (pump tank), used for fires, traffic accidents, etc. These means have {{specific}} equipment (hoses, <b>hook</b> <b>ladder,</b> retractor, saw, cutter, etc..) and a fair flow of water.|$|R
50|$|Townsend H. Ackley- Member Lynbrook Rescue <b>Hook</b> <b>Ladder</b> and Bucket company 1885-1911 {{then joined}} {{the newly formed}} Noorwood Hook,Ladder and Hose, 1911-1922, Elected Forman 1917, became the First Fire Chief of the Malverne Fire Dept in 1922 and served till 1928.|$|R
5000|$|In 1752, the Union Fire Company went in {{with the}} Hand-in-Hand Fire Company to {{purchase}} a fire bell which was placed on Fourth Street where it could be heard throughout the city. By 1791, the Company was in possession of an 80 ft fire hose, considerably shorter than the 120 ft hose owned by the Fellowship Fire Company. In addition, in that year, according to Franklin autobiography editor John Bigelow, the Company possessed 250 buckets, 13 <b>ladders,</b> two <b>hooks</b> and [...] "no bags." ...|$|R
60|$|But at {{the last}} stroke of the bell the horse set off at full gallop {{through the streets of}} Rome, and by {{daylight}} men counted over two hundred corpses that it had trodden down. The rest of the thieves--and there were still many remaining--instead of being frightened into honesty, as Virgilius had hoped, prepared rope <b>ladders</b> with <b>hooks</b> to them, and when they heard the sound of the horse's hoofs they stuck their ladders into the walls, and climbed up above the reach of the horse and its rider.|$|R
5000|$|Malverne {{considered}} a [...] "full service" [...] municipality with nearly all government {{services provided by}} the village itself. The Village hosts its own Police Department, Volunteer Fire Department (Norwood <b>Hook,</b> <b>Ladder</b> & Hose Company), Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Police Reserve, Department of Public Works, Emergency Management Commission, Public Library, Youth Board, and village television station - MalverneTV.|$|R
50|$|The Green Goddess {{carried a}} range of {{equipment}} from standard hose and branches, through a selection of nozzles to provide different flows and jet patterns, to Light Portable Pumps and Ceiling Arresters. They all carried a 33.5 ft extension ladder, together {{with at least one}} scaling ladder. Some carried additional equipment, such as <b>hook</b> <b>ladders,</b> radios, large bolt cutters, etc.|$|R
25|$|Tools {{used for}} {{infiltration}} and espionage {{are some of}} the most abundant artifacts related to the ninja. Ropes and grappling hooks were common, and were tied to the belt. A collapsible ladder is illustrated in the Bansenshukai, featuring spikes at both ends to anchor the <b>ladder.</b> Spiked or <b>hooked</b> climbing gear worn on the hands and feet also doubled as weapons. Other implements include chisels, hammers, drills, picks and so forth.|$|R
50|$|Midnight, 14 May 2011, while transiting {{westbound}} in {{the international}} recognized corridor, Maersk Alabama was approached by a skiff of five pirates on the starboard stern. After turning to follow the ship's wake, the skiff quickly closed in to 30 m, preparing to board via a <b>hook</b> <b>ladder,</b> whereupon the embarked security team fired two shots into the skiff. The skiff quickly broke off and radar contact was lost after 10 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flag of the}} Fire Department of the City of New York {{has five}} red and white stripes, {{representing}} the five boroughs. The canton features a Maltese cross with the city seal in the center, surrounded by a <b>hook,</b> <b>ladder,</b> fire hydrant and the letters [...] "F.D.N.Y.".The Fire Department uses a variant flag, in a vertical orientation with the Maltese Cross turned on its side and gold fringe, draped over the caskets of fallen department members.|$|R
5000|$|The {{department}} was created on 25 August 1885 as the Calgary <b>Hook,</b> <b>Ladder</b> and Bucket Corps and a chemical engine was ordered soon after. The first Captain was George Constantine. Prior {{to the formation}} of the Corps, wells had been dug throughout the town in 1884 at the recommendation of George Murdoch, Mayor of the Town of Calgary. Prior to 1909, it was a volunteer fire department. In 1909, 40 full-time firefighters were hired. [...] In 1910, it purchased its first motorized fire truck.|$|R
50|$|When {{the rain}} {{stopped and the}} floodwater got drained away, Sima Yi hastened to {{complete}} the encirclement of Xiangping. The siege of Xiangping carried on night and day, which utilized mining, <b>hooked</b> <b>ladders,</b> battering rams, and artificial mounds for siege towers and catapults to get higher vantage points. The speed at which the siege was tightened caught the defenders off guard: since they had been obtaining supplies with such ease during the flood there apparently was not any real attempt to stockpile the goods inside Xiangping, {{and as a result}} famine and cannibalism broke out in the city. Many Liaodong generals, such as Yang Zuo, surrendered to Sima Yi during the siege.|$|R
25|$|Interior {{space is}} limited, and divers {{generally}} travel and kit up while {{sitting on the}} tubes opposite a central cylinder rack where the fully rigged scuba sets are stowed. Water entry is commonly by simultaneous rolling backwards over the side, {{and return to the}} boat by climbing back in over the tubes one at a time after removing the heavy parts of the diving equipment and handing it up to the crew. Some boats have <b>ladders</b> which <b>hook</b> over the tubes to make boarding easier for the less athletic diver, others rely on assistance from the crew. An advantage of this type of boat compared with similar-sized rigid boats is that the inflated tubes make the boat very stable during the entry and exit of the divers and if the boat is filled with water during surf transit maneuvers. These boats are usually fairly fast, maneuverable, seaworthy in surf and rough conditions, and relatively uncomfortable. They seldom provide any shelter from the elements, and their advantages are that they get the diver to the site and back fairly quickly, are generally good for operation through surf, are usually trailerable and can be launched at slipways and beaches.|$|R
50|$|La Santé {{was seen}} as escape proof. In his escapes from his Canadian prisons, Mesrine had {{required}} little more than wire cutters and a very high degree of audacity, now he faced security far better than any he had defeated before. A report noted that Mesrine had been seen doing exercises in his cell and was behaving {{like a man who}} had received good news. On May 8, 1978, he produced a gun, stole keys, and, with François Besse (a highly accomplished escaper in his own right), and another man, Mesrine got out of a cellblock and into a fenced-off yard walkway. They had a grappling iron with them and Mesrine forced some workmen with an extending ladder to bring the ladder along. The trio unlocked a yard gate in an inner wall; an armed guard was taken by surprise at his post. The men then reached an isolated part of the 14 metre (46 ft) high exterior wall (which would have presented a considerable challenge without the <b>ladder).</b> They <b>hooked</b> the grappling iron onto the top of the ladder and slid down the rope. The third man over the wall was shot dead by police in the street outside. Mesrine and Besse hijacked a car and evaded the police cordon; they had become the first men to escape from La Santé.|$|R
60|$|It {{occurred}} to him that he might, by so attaching the rope as to bring the ladder across the window frame, lower himself hand over hand {{to the floor of the}} attic. But in so doing he must have left the ladder there to show their pursuers in the morning, not merely the way they had gone, but for all he knew at this stage, the place where they might then be still in hiding. Having come so far, at so much risk and labour, he was determined to leave nothing to chance. To accomplish his object then, he made his way down to the very edge of the roof, sliding carefully on his stomach until his feet found support against the marble gutter, the <b>ladder</b> meanwhile remaining <b>hooked</b> by one of its rungs to the sill of the dormer.|$|R
6000|$| {{it down to}} us, for neither William Anderson nor me {{could go}} up a rope hand over hand without knots or {{something}} to hold on to. As it was, {{we had a lot}} of bother getting up, but we did it at last; and then we walked up the stairs, treading on the front part of each step instead of the top of it, as we would have done if the stairs had been in their proper position. When we got to the floor of the cabin, which was now perpendicular like a wall, we had to clamber down by means of the furniture, which was screwed fast, until we reached the bulkhead, which was now the floor of the cabin. Close to this bulkhead was a small room which was the steward's pantry, and here we found lots of things to eat, but all jumbled up in a way that made us laugh. The boxes of biscuits and the tin cans and a lot of bottles in wicker covers were piled up on one end of the room, and everything in the lockers and drawers was jumbled together. William Anderson and me set to work to get out what we thought we'd want, and we told Sam to climb up into some of the state-rooms--of which there were four on each side of the cabin--and get some blankets to keep us warm, as well as a few sheets, which we thought we could rig up for an awning to the boat; for the days were just as hot as the nights were cool. When we'd collected what we wanted, William Anderson and me climbed into our own rooms, thinking we'd each pack a valise with what we most wanted to save of our clothes and things; and while we were doing this Sam called out to us that it was raining. He was sitting at the cabin door looking out. I first thought to tell him to shut the door so's to keep the rain from coming in; but when I thought how things really were, I laughed at the idea. There was a sort of little house built over the entrance to the cabin, and in one end of it was the door; and in the way the ship now was the open doorway was underneath the little house, and of course no rain could come in. Pretty soon we heard the rain pouring down, beating on the stern of the vessel like hail. We got to the stairs and looked out. The rain was falling in perfect sheets, in a way you never see except round about the tropics. 'It's a good thing we're inside,' said William Anderson, 'for if we'd been out in this rain we'd been drowned in the boat.' I agreed with him, and we made up our minds to stay where we were until the rain was over. Well, it rained about four hours; and when it stopped, and we looked out, we saw our little boat nearly full of water, and sunk so deep that if one of us had stepped on her she'd have gone down, sure. 'Here's a pretty kittle of fish,' said William Anderson; 'there's nothing for us to do now but to stay where we are.' I believe in his heart he was glad of that, for if ever a man was tired of a little boat, William Anderson was tired of that one we'd been in for two days and two nights. At any rate, there was no use talking about it, and we set to work to make ourselves comfortable. We got some mattresses and pillows out of the state-rooms, and when it began to get dark we lighted the lamp--which we had filled with sweet-oil from a flask in the pantry, not finding any other kind--and we hung it from the railing of the stairs. We had a good night's rest, and the only thing that disturbed me was William Anderson lifting up his head every time he turned over and saying how much better this was than that blasted little boat. The next morning we had a good breakfast, even making some tea with a spirit-lamp we found, using brandy instead of alcohol. William Anderson and I wanted to get into the captain's room--which was near the stern and pretty high up--so as to see if there was anything there that we ought to get ready to save when a vessel should come along and pick us up; but we were not good at climbing, like Sam, and we didn't see how we could get up there. Sam said he was sure he had once seen a ladder in the compartment just forward of the bulkhead, and as William was very anxious to get up to the captain's room, we let the boy go and look for it. There was a sliding door in the bulkhead under our feet, and we opened this far enough to let Sam get through; and he scrambled down like a monkey into the next compartment, which was light enough, although the lower half of it, which was next to the engine-room, was under the water-line. Sam actually found a <b>ladder</b> with <b>hooks</b> at one end of it, and while he was handing it up to us--which was very hard to do, for he had to climb up on all sorts of things--he let it topple over, and the end with the iron hooks fell against the round glass of one of the port-holes. The glass was very thick and strong, but the ladder came down very heavy and shivered it. As bad luck would have it, this window was below the water-line, and the water came rushing in in a big spout. We chucked blankets down to Sam for him to stop up the hole, but 'twas of no use; for it was hard for him to get at the window, and when he did the water came in with such force that he couldn't get a blanket into the hole. We were afraid he'd be drowned down there, and told him to come out as quick as he could. He put up the <b>ladder</b> again, and <b>hooked</b> it on to the door in the bulkhead, and we held it while he climbed up. Looking down through the doorway, we saw, by the way the water was pouring in at the opening, that it wouldn't be long before that compartment was filled up; so we shoved the door to and made it all tight, and then said William Anderson, 'The ship'll sink deeper and deeper as that fills up, and the water may get up to the cabin door, and we must go and make that as tight as we can.' Sam had pulled the ladder up after him, and this we found of great use in getting to the foot of the cabin stairs. We shut the cabin door, and locked and bolted it; and as it fitted pretty tight, we didn't think it would let in much water if the ship sunk that far. But over the top of the cabin stairs were a couple of folding doors, which shut down horizontally when the ship was in its proper position, and which were only used in very bad, cold weather. These we pulled to and fastened tight, thus having a double protection against the water. Well, we didn't get this done any too soon, for the water did come up to the cabin door, and a little trickled in from the outside door and through the cracks in the inner one. But we went to work and stopped these up with strips from the sheets, which we crammed well in with our pocket-knives. Then we sat down on the steps and waited to see what would happen next. The doors of all the state-rooms were open, and we could see through the thick plate-glass windows in them, which were all shut tight, that the ship was sinking more and more as the water came in. Sam climbed up into one of the after state-rooms, and said the outside water was nearly up to the stern; and pretty soon we looked up to the two portholes in the stern, and saw that they were covered with water; and as more and more water could be seen there, and as the light came through less easily, we knew that we were sinking under the surface of the ocean. 'It's a mighty good thing,' said William Anderson, 'that no water can get in here.' William had a hopeful kind of mind, and always looked on the bright side of things; but I must say that I was dreadfully scared when I looked through those stern windows and saw water instead of sky. It began to get duskier and duskier as we sank lower and lower; but still we could see pretty well, for it's astonishing how much light comes down through water. After a little while we noticed that the light remained about the same; and then William Anderson he sings out, 'Hooray, we've stopped sinking!' 'What difference does that make?' says I. 'We must be thirty or forty feet under water, and more yet, for aught I know.' 'Yes, that may be,' said he; 'but it is clear that all the water has got into that compartment that can get in, and we have sunk just as far down as we are going.' 'But that don't help matters,' said I; 'thirty or forty feet under water is just as bad as a thousand as to drowning a man.' 'Drowning!' said William; 'how are you going to be drowned? No water can get in here.' 'Nor no air, either,' said I; 'and people are drowned for want of air, as I take it.' 'It would be a queer sort of thing,' said William, 'to be drowned in the ocean and yet stay as dry as a chip. But it's no use being worried about air. We've got air enough here to last us for ever so long. This stern compartment is the biggest in the ship, and it's got lots of air in it. Just think of that hold! It must be nearly full of air. The stern compartment of the hold has got nothing in it but sewing-machines. I saw 'em loading her. The pig-iron was mostly amidships, or at least forward of this compartment. Now, there's no kind of a cargo that'll accommodate as much air as sewing-machines. They're packed in wooden frames, not boxes, and don't fill up half the room they take. There's air all through and around 'em. It's a very comforting thing to think the hold isn't filled up solid with bales of cotton or wheat in bulk.' It might be comforting, but I couldn't get much good out of it. And now Sam, who'd been scrambling all over the cabin to see how things were going on, sung out that the water was leaking in a little again at the cabin door and around some of the iron frames of the windows. 'It's a lucky thing,' said William Anderson, 'that we didn't sink any deeper, or the pressure of the water would have burst in those heavy glasses. And what we've got to do now is to stop up all the cracks. The more we work the livelier we'll feel.' We tore off more strips of sheets and went all round, stopping up cracks wherever we found them. 'It's fortunate,' said William Anderson, 'that Sam found that ladder, for we would have had hard work getting to the windows of the stern state-rooms without it; but by resting it on the bottom step of the stairs, which now happens to be the top one, we can get to any part of the cabin.' I couldn't help thinking that if Sam hadn't found the ladder it would have been a good deal better for us; but I didn't want to damp William's spirits, and I said nothing.|$|R
