Conventional breeding approaches aimed at improvement of yield per se have not been successful so far in breaking the yield barrier. Manipulation of physiological processes such as photosynthesis is expected to yield positive results. A <b>land</b> <b>race</b> ‘Goa local ’ with a very high photosynthetic rate was used to improve this trait in selected cultivars, C- 152, KM- 1 and V- 118 with different growth habits.

We evaluated tuft shape, length of plant, length and width of flag leaf, length and density of spike and awnedness. The modern varieties of soft wheat are characterised by a high level of uniformity. Their tuft shape is erect or semi-erect and length of plant is 60 - 70 cm, it does not rise the weed competitiveness.

Intermediate wheat <b>land</b> <b>races</b> are characterised by looselly spreading tuft shape which puts the weeds down, but on the other hand, it favours the mildew because of the microclimate of soil.
