30|$|Focusing here on {{the issue}} of pay concessions, it is clear that {{decentralized}} wage bargaining proper may involve counterparts to opening clauses. Visser identifies arrangements in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and the Netherlands as cases in point. In countries such as Sweden and Denmark, opening clauses are described as “generalized,” in the sense that local bargaining controls much more of total earnings, more of which is tied to performance. In Norway, on the other hand, the use of opening clauses has been sporadic. The same is true of the Netherlands and Switzerland, where the clearest examples of formal opening clauses are from the past rather than contemporary in nature. While noting that this is also true of Austria, Visser cites the more recent case of the <b>location</b> <b>clause</b> contained in the 2011 metalworkers’ collective agreement that permits poorly performing companies to divide the collectively negotiated wage increase into a general part and a contingent, individual performance-related component.|$|E

40|$|The REQUEST System is an {{experimental}} natural language query {{system based on}} r. large transfo~ational grammar of English. In the original implementation of the system the process of computing the underlying sLructures of input queries involved a sequence of three steps: (1) preprocessing (including dictionary lookup), (2) surface phrase structure parsing, and (3) transformational parsing.

The amendment aimed at moving the <b>location</b> of the <b>clause</b> mandating {{the production of the}} covenant report in the AFA 2006 from after section 359, to being in a new part (Part 16A). The reasoning behind the amendment was that the 2011 Bill, as it had been drafted up to that point, would have placed the covenant requirement into what was described as 'the tail end of ad hoc and miscellaneous provisions of the Armed Forces Act 2006'. The amendment would place the covenant requirement into a place that, Lord Craig argued, 'far more adequately reflected the importance of this... initiative of the Government.'

40|$|How do {{beginning}} and skilled writers compose a {{text in the}} course of time? To gain insight into the temporal aspects of planning and translating activities during writing, this article examined writing in real time and analyzed pause time patterns in writing in relation to linguistic characteristics of the written product. Fourth-grade children and adults wrote a narrative text (a personal experience) and an expository text on a socially relevant issue. They wrote their texts by hand, and a computer-controlled digitizer tablet recorded handwriting movements. Developmental patterns in pause duration as a function of genre and linguistic features of pause <b>locations</b> (word, <b>clause,</b> sentence) were studied. In a more detailed analysis, pause time patterns related to the syntactic linking of clauses were examined, and whether pause time patterning varies with different types of clauses was also examined (i. e., main clauses, coordinate clauses, finite and nonfinite subordinate clauses, and restrictive and nonrestrictive relative clauses). Analyses showed that pause time duration is different in narrative and expository texts, and varies with syntactic location in that both 4 th-grade children and adults take more time to plan and decide at higher syntactic levels. Pause duration also varies with the syntactic linking of clauses: Children and adults pause longer before writing main clauses than before coordinate clauses, and pause longer before writing coordinate clauses than before subordinate clauses—a pattern found in narrative and expository texts. This suggests that the time {{beginning and}} adult writers take to decide on how to express their ideas in syntactically linked clauses depends on grammatical and functional aspects of clauses...|$|R
40|$|The Occurrence of {{filled and}} {{unfilled}} pauses was examined {{with respect to}} their <b>location</b> in phonemic <b>clauses.</b> Both types of hesitation were most frequent after the first word in the clause, regardless of length. These data are regarded as directly challenging the transitional probability theory of hesitations. The phonemic clause is proposed as the encoding unit of speech at the grammatical level. This study is concernecf with two varieties of hesitations in spontaneous English speech: silent pause and “filled pause ” (uh /a/, ah /a/, urn /am/, and similar variants). The data to be presented concern the location of these hesitations in extended utterances, but the basic theoretical issue involved {{is the nature of the}} grammatical encoding process in speech. The data and the theoretical issue are inferentially related. The linking hypothesis is that hesitations in spontaneous speech occur at points where decisions and choices are being made. On this basis, the patterning of hesitations should provide clues as to the size and nature of the encoding units which are operative. If the encoding units are single words then hesitations should occur more frequentl...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{two related}} hypotheses about Lakhota narrative discourse structure in a corpus {{consisting of the}} sixty-three Lakhota texts included in Ella Deloria 2 ̆ 7 s 1931 Dakota Texts, obtained in magnetic medium from the Siouan Languages Archive. The first hypothesis is that noncoreference of grammatical subject or spaciotemporal <b>location</b> between sequential <b>clauses</b> is regularly marked in the discourse by a grammatical switch-reference marking system involving conjunctions and modal enclitics. The second hypothesis is that the coreferent strings of text, termed 2 ̆ 2 verses, 2 ̆ 2 that result from this switch-reference marking system are the basic constituent elements which are organized into larger structures by the ethnopoetics of the discourse. ^ An initial hypothesis about the types of noncoreference and the identities of marker forms is refined using concepts from situation semantics. The corpus is then marked for both variables, and their correlation is tested. A high degree of correlation is evident. Most exceptions are of three recurrent types, which are explained by further analysis. ^ Two example texts, representing different narrative genres, are analyzed to examine the second hypothesis. An approach to ethnopoetics based on that of Dell Hymes is developed. The texts are marked for boundaries of complete arcs of arousal and satisfaction of expectation of event consequence. Then, {{the relationship of the}} verses to the blocks of text, termed 2 ̆ 2 scenes, 2 ̆ 2 expressing these arcs is analyzed. Scene boundaries do not interrupt verses; they occur at verse boundaries. Verse constituency in scenes is based upon a recurrent numerical principle of two, four, and seven, which is deeply rooted in Lakhota culture. Differences between the organization of the two texts reflect their different genres. ...|$|R
40|$|Makary Kotoko, a Central Chadic B language, {{is spoken}} {{in the north}} of Cameroon just south of Lake Chad. It is one of nine Kotoko languages. Published works on Makary Kotoko to date include about a dozen {{articles}} on different aspects of the grammar of the language. The present work, which is based primarily on a substantial corpus of recorded texts, is a systematic description of many aspects of the phonology, morphology, and syntax of the language. Makary Kotoko has six vowels and twenty seven consonants, including a series of implosives, a series of ejectives, and a series of prenasalized stops. The tone system (including a high, low, mid, and falling tone) functions both lexically and grammatically, though the functional load of tone is not heavy. Nominal morphology is limited, coding plurality, a diminutive, and three nominalization processes. The language has lexicalized a basic ontological distinction between concrete things and abstract things. Verbal morphology is also limited, coding plurality, an applicative, and a causative. The language codes aspectual/modal distinctions on the subject marker which precedes the verb. Tense is not coded in the language, but spatial orientation is coded through a small number of locative particles. The relative order of the direct object and the expression of <b>location</b> within the <b>clause</b> is affected by the nominal/pronominal realization of the arguments. There are four primary non-verbal predication constructions used to express notions of identity, attribution, possession, location, and existence. Makary Kotoko places noun phrases in pre-subject position, followed by a small number of markers, to code pragmatic information for the clause (i. e., topic, contrastive focus, switch reference). The presence or absence of a resumptive pronoun for noun phrases placed in pre-subject position (and for head nouns of relative clauses) is conditioned by a complex of factors, including verb argument structure, the grammatical function of the noun phrase, the human/non-human nature of the referent of the noun phrase, and the ongoing saliency of the referent of the noun phrase within the discourse. Combining clauses is done through various means, including the use of two sequential markers which code (in different domains) the succession of events in the discourse...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} {{qualitative and quantitative}} analysis {{of the interaction between}} grammatical structure and prosodic structure in two Australian languages, Dalabon and Kayardild. The typological profiles of these languages contrast dramatically: Dalabon is an extreme head-marking polysynthetic language, in which a single verb can carry all of the information typically associated with a clause in a language like English (e. g. M. Baker, 1996; Evans & Sasse, 2002). Kayardild is an extreme dependent-marking language, with syntactic relationships encoded on nominal dependents through sequences of case morphology (Dench & Evans, 1988; Evans, 1995 a; Nordlinger, 1998). One of the main motivations for studying the interaction between grammatical structure and prosodic constituency in two grammatically distinct languages is that a comparison will potentially test the effects that grammatical structure may have on prosody. By examining two structurally different languages it then becomes possible to test certain hypotheses regarding the grammatical influence on prosodic structure. Whether an extreme dependent-marking language and an extreme head-marking language show similar or different prosodic structural patterns may either support or disprove statements regarding the universality of the interaction between prosodic and grammatical structure. This dissertation presents both quantitative and qualitative findings, based on approximately 75 minutes of recorded Dalabon and Kayardild narratives. The hypotheses examined in this dissertation concern whether factors such as grammatical complexity, the <b>location</b> of <b>clause</b> boundaries, discourse effects such as the introduction of new information, as well as prosodic length, affect prosodic constituency boundary location and strength, irrespective of the language type in question. Although the two languages differ dramatically in their grammatical structures, the overall interaction between prosody and the various grammatical factors may be expected to show similar patterns. In order to test these hypotheses, the relationships between grammatical complexity and prosodic constituency, between the clause and prosodic constituency, and between prosodic length and prosodic constituency are examined. The results presented here show that there is a large amount of consistency across both languages in terms of the prosodic phrasing of clauses overall, supporting the view that prosodic structure is independent of grammatical structure. However, the results also show there is interesting variation in the prosodic phrasing of constituents within the clause as well as overall pausing patterns, suggesting that typological structure does {{have a role to play}} in prosodic structure. The chapters are structured as follows: Chapter 1 provides the introduction and context for the research, with definitions of prosody and intonation, a review of the literature on the interaction between prosody and grammar, and the aims and hypotheses. Chapter 2 provides language overviews of Dalabon and Kayardild. Chapter 3 provides a description of the methods and materials, including an overview of the corpus, and the statistical methods and annotation conventions used. Chapter 4 provides descriptions of the intonation phrases found in Dalabon and Kayardild, including a description of the contour types found, the makeup and boundary tones of these phrases. Chapter 5 provides an examination of the relationship between the clause and prosodic phrasing including analyses of pause, IP boundaries, clause types, constituents and word order. In Chapter 6 some of the interesting findings to emerge from the preceding analyses are investigated. This includes the prosodic behaviour of nominals and examples of IPs which comprise multiple verbs. Chapter 7 concludes the dissertation, providing an overview of the main findings and their implications, as well as a discussion of directions for future research...|$|R
40|$|In forming wh-questions, Egyptian Arabic (EA) {{exhibits}} apparent optional wh-movement whereby both {{options of}} fronting the wh-phrase or leaving it in situ are possible. I argue in this dissertation that optionality in EA wh-question formation does not contradict minimalist assumptions {{since the two}} options of fronting or leaving the wh-phrase in situ correspond to two different derivations that have two different syntactic structures and two different semantic interpretations. As a consequence, I do not adopt the idea that wh-movement is triggered by a [+wh] feature and I also reject the covert LF movement of wh-in-situ. I claim that wh-question formation in EA is driven by focus and propose that focus is embodied {{in the form of}} an intonational morpheme. There are two distinct options to form wh-questions in EA, so I claim that there are two distinct focus morphemes that enter the computational system: an information focus morpheme and a contrastive focus morpheme. When the information focus morpheme enters the derivation, it is a variable that is bound to the focused constituent in-situ. When the contrastive focus morpheme enters the derivation with the operator illi which has scopal properties and EPP features that accounts for its leftward <b>location</b> in the <b>clause,</b> it is bound to the particle illi. Being bound to the operator illi, the contrastive focus morpheme is located at the left-periphery of the clause. When a wh-phrase enters the derivation with the contrastive focus morpheme and the particle illi, it moves to the leftward position triggered by features of the focused morpheme. Fronting of the wh-phrase is therefore triggered by features of the particle illi. However, the particle illi is not always present when the wh-phrase is fronted. This occurs with subject wh-phrases where the presence of the particle is optional and with adjunct wh-phrases where fronted adjunct wh-phrase cannot occur with illi. In case of the subject wh-phrase, wh-in-situ form is not possible because subject wh-phrase must always be fronted for two reasons: EPP features which trigger movement of the wh-phrase to [Spec, TP] and contrastive focus features which trigger movement of the subject wh-phrase from [Spec, TP] to [Spec, FP], the latter, which is interpreted as information focus, contains an overt illi particle but not the former, which denotes contrastive focus. In case of the object wh-phrase, fronted wh-phrase is always associated with an overt illi particle. In the case of adjunct wh-phrase, the fronted wh-phrase can never take an overt illi particle. I postulate that the presence of the particle illi in the derivation is triggered by an overt movement of the wh-phrase (this happens with subject wh-phrase denoting contrastive focus and fronted object wh-phrases). The absence of the particle illi with adjuncts suggests that adjuncts wh-phrases do not undergo movement but are adjoined to the derivation postcyclically...|$|R
40|$|In 1996, Eric Letalien {{pleaded guilty}} to the gross sexual assault of a {{thirteen}} year-old girl, an offense he committed when he was nineteen years old. At {{the time of his}} sentencing in August of 1996, Letalien was subject to Maine’s Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 1995 (SORNA of 1995). Pursuant to SORNA of 1995, Letalien was required to register his address with the State Bureau of Identification (SBI) and update his address in the event he moved. This registration requirement was to be in effect for fifteen years {{from the time he was}} released from incarceration. After five years, however, Letalien would be eligible to petition for a waiver from the Superior Court if he could show that the registration requirement was no longer necessary. In 1999, the Maine Legislature passed a more stringent version of the SORNA law (SORNA of 1999). In 2001, the Legislature once again amended SORNA of 1999 so that it applied retroactively to offenses committed on or after June 30, 1992. As a result of the 2001 amendment, Letalien was subject to the reporting requirements of SORNA of 1999. Under the amended law, instead of being required to register as a sex offender for fifteen years, with the possibility of obtaining a waiver after five years, Letalien was required to register for the rest of his life without the possibility of ever obtaining a waiver. In addition, SORNA of 1999 required him to report in person to his local law enforcement agency every ninety days in order to verify his address and place of employment, to be fingerprinted, and to have his photograph taken. In 2003, the Legislature once again amended SORNA of 1999 to require the SBI to maintain an Internet website posting this information. When Letalien was arrested in 2007 for failure to comply with the SORNA of 1999 registration requirements, he challenged SORNA of 1999, asserting that its retroactive application against him violated the Ex Post Facto Clauses of both the Maine Constitution and the United States Constitution. Letalien argued that the Maine Constitution’s ban on ex post facto laws afforded a greater level of protection than the minimum standard secured by the Federal Constitution, and that the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, sitting as the Law Court, should utilize an analysis independent of federal courts’ analyses of ex post facto challenges. The Law Court held that the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Maine and Federal Constitutions are coextensive, and evaluated the law consistent with the United States Supreme Court’s analysis of ex post facto laws, ultimately concluding that the retroactive application of SORNA of 1999 was a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clauses of both constitutions. Justice Silver concurred in the judgment, and argued that Maine’s Constitution provides a higher level of protection against ex post facto laws than the United States Constitution. His concurrence focused on the location of the Ex Post Facto Clause in the Declaration of Rights article in the Maine Constitution, as compared with the <b>location</b> of the <b>clause</b> in the legislative powers article of the Federal Constitution. Justice Silver argued that the respective placement of the clauses indicated that the Maine Constitution “declares that the right to be free of ex post facto laws as a personal right, and not simply a limitation of legislative power, as it is in the United States Constitution. ” This Note will explore the Law Court’s conclusion that the Ex Post Facto provisions of the Maine Constitution and the United States Constitution are coextensive, and thus require the same analysis when determining whether a law violates the respective clauses. Part II will discuss the Law Court’s analysis of the retroactive application of SORNA of 1999 in Letalien, and explore the legal context surrounding ex post facto jurisprudence in general. Part III will examine the Law Court’s history of conducting state constitutional analyses independent of federal courts’ analyses under the United States Constitution. Finally, in Part IV, this Note will discuss whether Letalien required the Law Court to address the question of co-extensiveness with regard to ex post facto challenges, and also whether public policy in Maine demands an independent analysis of laws under the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Maine Constitution. This Note will argue that Maine’s public policy objectives are better served by using a balancing approach to the retroactive application of SORNA, where the court weighs the interests of the individual affected by the law against the State’s interests in promoting public safety...|$|R
