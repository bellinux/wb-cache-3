5|$|With the {{increase}} of tea's use in Chinese herbology, production methods changed, where the processed green tea <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> not immediately dried after steaming. Rather the steamed tea <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> first pulverized into a paste form, with the paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into brick tea, a technique well described by Lu Yu in his work The Classic of Tea. Tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used, as older mature tea <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> preferred for tea production. Some tea bricks were also produced from mature whole leaves, which typically required {{the use of a}} cooked rice slurry (米湯) to bind the tea brick together. The preference of producing tea in brick form possibly {{stems from the fact that}} it can be more easily transported and stored.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fire}} of St. Germain-des-Prés in 1793 only 12 <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> found, the other two have been {{transferred}} to Saint Petersburg. From 1795 until the present it has been held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Fragmenta Mosquensia were brought to Moscow in 1665. They were examined by Matthaei. The last was Porphyrius Uspensky, who took one leaf from the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Coprolites {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Lameta Formation, {{and the presence of}} fungi in coprolites indicates that <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> eaten by the dinosaurs which lived in a tropical or subtropical climate. Another scientific study of similarities in egg taxa suggested close phyletic relationships that supports the existence of a terrestrial connection between dinosaurian fauna in India and Europe during the Cretaceous, and between two Gondwanan areas, Patagonia and India.|$|E
50|$|The lower <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> lyre shaped, pinnate shaped. The lobes are {{triangular}} in shape. The upper <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> stalkless, {{smaller and}} less lobed. All <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> red tinged.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> often fascicled. [...] They are {{attached}} by very short petioles. The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> opposite from each other. The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> 7 - 12 mm long.|$|R
50|$|Juvenile plants look {{markedly}} different to adults. Young plants <b>are</b> distichous (<b>leaves</b> only in two opposite rows); while adults are often rosettes. Juvenile <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> tongue-shaped and recurved; while adults <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> more upright and triangular. Juvenile <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> rough with tubercles; while adult <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> smooth and shiny.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century Vladimir Beneshevich (1874–1938) {{discovered}} parts of three more {{leaves of the}} codex in the bindings of other manuscripts {{in the library of}} Mount Sinai. Beneshevich went on three occasions to the monastery (1907, 1908, 1911) but does not tell when or from which book he recovered. These <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> also acquired for St. Petersburg, where they remain to the present day.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} is dated palaeographically to the 6th {{century or}} 7th century. According to Tischendorf {{it was written}} in the 6th century. Probably {{it was written in}} Italy. Nothing is known about its early history. In the 12th or 13th century four of its <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> used as material for another book and they were overwritten by Latin text. Its later story is linked with the codices Guelferbytanus A and B.|$|E
5|$|The {{recipients}} of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross are initially ordered alphabetically whereas the {{recipients of}} the higher grades are initially ordered chronologically. The rank listed is the recipient's rank {{at the time the}} Knight's Cross or the Oak <b>Leaves</b> <b>were</b> awarded.|$|E
50|$|The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> {{dark green}} on both sides. The basal and middle <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> petiolate, obovate to spoon-shaped, and serrate to dentate. The upper <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> shorter, sessile, and borne along the stem.|$|R
50|$|In brassicas, <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> blue-green {{in color}} and may have a low degree of intervenal chlorosis. Scorching along the outside edges of <b>leaves</b> <b>is</b> common, and <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> often tough in texture due to slow growth.|$|R
50|$|Eucalyptus dives or {{broad-leaved}} peppermint is a {{small tree}} native to temperate dry sclerophyll woodlands and forests of south-eastern Australia. The juvenile <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> ovate and glaucus, and adult <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> lanceolate to broad-lanceolate. <b>Leaves</b> <b>are</b> aromatic.|$|R
5|$|The {{tree was}} well known to Māori before its {{scientific}} discovery. The generic Māori language term for plants in the Cordyline genus is tī, and names recorded as specific to C.australis include tī kōuka, tī kāuka, tī rākau, tī awe, tī pua, and tī whanake. Each tribe had names for the tree depending on its local uses and characteristics. Simpson reports that the names highlight {{the characteristics of the}} tree that were important to Māori. These include what the plant looked like—whether it was a large tree (tī rākau, tī pua), the whiteness of its flowers (tī puatea), whether its <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> broad (tī wharanui), twisted along the edges (tī tahanui), or spiky (tī tarariki). Other names refer to its uses—whether its fruit attracted birds (tī manu), or the <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> particularly suitable for making ropes (tī whanake) and nets (tī kupenga). The most widely used name, tī kōuka, refers {{to the use of the}} leaf hearts as food.|$|E
5|$|Initially, as {{in some of}} the {{continental}} cathedrals, the interior was decorated with designs emphasizing the arch ribs and portal components. Even the brick was painted with red and white stripes. In the 15th century, frescos of figures in the Late Gothic style with decorative vine <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> painted {{in various parts of the}} church. Traces of these have been found in the chancel and in the chapel which was originally dedicated to St Eric and St Olaf. Unfortunately, they have now been heavily restored. The frescos in the chancel were probably painted by Albertus Pictor's workshop.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} form of opposition, however, was passive resistance. Small patriotic badges, {{depicting the}} royal family or national colours, were extremely popular. When these symbols were banned, new ones, such as ivy <b>leaves,</b> <b>were</b> worn with similar meaning. Workers in strategic industries deliberately underperformed in their jobs {{as a form of}} resistance. The celebration of nationalist public holidays, like 21 July (National Day), which were officially banned by the Germans, were also often accompanied by protests and demonstrations. One of the most notable acts of passive resistance was the Judges' Strike of 1918, which managed to gain concessions from the German occupiers under considerable public pressure.|$|E
50|$|The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> of {{variable}} sizes. The upper <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> simplified to oblong, with lanceolate and dentate incised blades. The leaf lobes are about 2-9 cm long and 1-3 cm wide. Most <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> sessile, {{but sometimes they}} bear short stalks. The tips of the mature <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> acuminate to acute and the bases of them are cuneate to truncate.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Leaves</b> <b>are</b> {{lanceolate}} {{with large}} stipules with crimson veins. Petiole are deeply and broadly grooved throughout the length. <b>Leaves</b> <b>are</b> distinctly striated and nearly always smooth. Width of the <b>leaves</b> <b>is</b> usually 3" [...] to 4", sometimes 5" [...]|$|R
5000|$|<b>Leaves</b> <b>are</b> crowded at the root, stalked, [...] and blunt; stem <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> , {{lance-shaped}} and linear.|$|R
5|$|Two {{conflicting}} {{factors are}} involved in host preferences, the species {{and the age of}} the leaf. Offered spindle and beet leaves on growing plants throughout the year, winged aphids moved {{from one to the other}} depending on the active growth state of each and the senescence of each host plant. Thus in late summer and autumn, the beet <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> old and unattractive to the aphids in comparison with the leaves of the spindle, whereas in spring, the young unfolding leaves of the beet were more attractive than those of the spindle.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Alberto damaged a {{total of}} 8,745houses in the country. In Pinar del Río Province, 71homes were destroyed, and across the nation {{hundreds}} of people were left homeless. 83buildings were collapsed {{in the capital city}} of Havana, while sixfactories in Havana Province received damage. The passage of Alberto left several districts in Havana without electricity, telegraph, telephone, and mail service. The Cuban military was deployed to rescue those trapped in flooded homes and also to remove fallen trees. Agricultural damage included about 250,000downed banana trees and 400drowned cattle. Heavy rainfall continued for weeks after the passage of Alberto, resulting in severe damage to the tobacco crop. Subsequent winds and rains destroyed storage sheds which ruined 1.8millionlb. (900,000kg) of the recently finished harvest; 2.6millionlb. (1.3millionkg) of tobacco <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> also damaged. Two days after its closest approach, the death toll in Cuba reached 11, and a day later it was raised to 23fatalities. The final death toll was reported as either 23 or 24, with one report indicating 17people missing; Pinar del Río Province reported at least 20deaths and Havana reported three casualties. Damage was estimated at $85million (1982USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Leaves</b> <b>are</b> 1/2 to 8 in long. <b>Leaves</b> <b>are</b> ovate overall, but finely pinnately {{dissected}} into segments like parsley <b>leaves.</b> <b>Leaves</b> <b>are</b> strongly aromatic when crushed. [...] "Terebinthus" [...] means [...] "like-turpentine", {{referring to}} the scented oils in the plant.|$|R
50|$|The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> smooth {{above and}} below, with finely {{serrated}} edges. Occasionally the <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> serrated transversely.|$|R
50|$|Its <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> alternate, long-petioled, deciduous, oval {{to nearly}} circular, cordate at the base, and 7.5-12.5 cm long. Young <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> coated with red hairs; mature <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> dark-green and hairless {{on the upper}} surface, and downy-white with prominent, light-colored veins beneath.|$|R
5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The cooling {{properties}} of the <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> used in Britain {{as a treatment for}} trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses. Accumulated scientific evidence corroborates that cabbage leaf treatment can reduce the pain and hardness of engorged breasts, and increase the duration of breast feeding. Other medicinal uses recorded in European folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism, sore throat, hoarseness, colic, and melancholy. In the United States, cabbage {{has been used as a}} hangover cure, to treat abscesses, to prevent sunstroke, or to cool body parts affected by fevers. The leaves have also been used to soothe sore feet and, when tied around a child's neck, to relieve croup. Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts, pneumonia, appendicitis, and ulcers.|$|E
5|$|Both the Puranas and the Ramayana {{feature the}} half-blood {{siblings}} of Kubera. Vishrava, Kubera's father, also married the Rakshasa (demon) princess Kaikesi, who mothered four Rakshasa children: Ravana, the chief antagonist of the Ramayana, Kumbhakarna, Vibhishana and Soorpanaka. The Mahabharata regards Vishrava as {{the brother of}} Kubera, so Kubera is described as the uncle of Ravana and his siblings. It records that when Kubera approached Brahma for the favour of superseding his father Pulastya, Pulastya created Vishrava. To seek the favour of Vishrava, Kubera sent three women to him, by whom Vishrava begot his demon children. Ravana, after acquiring a boon of Brahma, drove Kubera away from Lanka and seized his Pushpaka Vimana, which was returned to Kubera after Ravana's death. Kubera then settled on Gandhamandana mountain, near Mount Kailash — the cosmological abode of the god Shiva—in the Himalayas. Sometimes, Kailash itself is called Kubera's residence. His city is usually called Alaka or Alaka-puri ("curl-city"), but also Prabha ("splendour"), Vasudhara ("bejeweled") and Vasu-sthali ("abode of treasures"). There, Kubera had a grove called Caitraratha, where the <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> jewels and the fruits were girls of heaven. There is also a charming lake called Nalini in the grove. Kubera {{is often described as}} a friend of Shiva in the epics. The Padma Purana says that Kubera prayed to Shiva for many years, and Shiva granted him the kingship of Yakshas.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> [...] and {{vary from}} 4 to 7 per plant. The lower <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> oblong-obovate with obtuse apex, while the upper <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> {{lanceolate}} with acute apex. Size of leaves: width 1 to 2.5 cm, length 6 - 12 cm.|$|R
50|$|The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> alternate, {{hard and}} {{leathery}} with rounded or blunt tips. Older <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> blue-green above and paler on the underside.

30|$|Lyonia ovalifolia (Wall.) Drude. (Ericaceae); ‘Angeri’ (N). Crushed <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> used in Scabies. Young <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> {{poisonous}} to cattle.|$|R
5|$|Nine quarterings on {{a shield}} was {{considered}} too complex {{for a national}} symbol and by 1915 a push had begun to design a new coat of arms for Canada. A committee was formed in 1919 to pursue the issue, eventually agreeing that {{the elements of the}} new arms would reference the Royal Arms of England, Ireland, Scotland, and France, with maple leaves representing Canada, though there was at the time no consensus on how the <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> to be used. The decision was settled by 1920, and the committee conferred with the College of Arms in London, only to face resistance {{to the use of the}} Royal Arms from the Garter King of Arms. After some manoeuvring, including the personal intervention of Winston Churchill, the new arms of Canada were eventually formally requested by an Order in Council on 30 April 1921 and adopted on 21 November of the same year by proclamation of King George V as the Arms or Ensigns Armorial of the Dominion of Canada. The new layout closely reflected the arms of the United Kingdom with the addition of maple leaves in the base and the reference to the French royal arms in the fourth quarter. The proclamation also established white and red as the national colours of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Scott Street bridge had {{gradually}} deteriorated, and {{a public}} consultation was held in 1986, to determine its future. By that time a 10-ton weight limit had been imposed on traffic using the bridge, because of its poor structural state. Three suggestions were made as to its future. These were to close and demolish it, to refurbish it at an estimated cost of £1.6million, and {{to build a new}} bridge on the same site but a different alignment, to eliminate the awkward turn at the west end, which was costed at £2million. None of these actions have been taken, as the bridge <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> raised in 1994, and have remained raised ever since. Consideration was given in 2007 to preserving two of the hydraulic rams which operated the bridge, during planning to demolish the structure. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company was set up in 1872, and by 1876 was operating a pumping station on Machell Street. This supplied water to a high pressure main which ran from Wellington Street to Sculcoates Bridge, and was used by local industries to power machinery, including the bridge when it was constructed. Although the power company closed in the 1940s, it made Hull the first city in the world to have a public system of power distribution.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} {{populated}} in the Stone Age by Inari Sami people {{shortly after the}} last glacial period ended about 8000BC. The first documents from the area are tax records from the 16th century. The Inari Sami originally subsisted on hunting, gathering and especially fishing; later they began to complement this by reindeer husbandry, and later still by farming and herding cattle and sheep. The area belonged to the Inari Siida beginning in the Middle Ages. Until the border was closed in 1852, the Sami from Norway came during winter to herd their reindeer. The closing of the border caused some Norwegian Sami to settle {{in the area and}} continue with reindeer husbandry. This caught on among the Inari Sami, and the amount of husbandry increased during the 20th century. People in the area traveled up Lake Inari and onwards to the coast of Finnmark, Norway, to fish during summer. Records of markets in Finnmark date back to the 16th century, and in the 1880s about 150 people traveled to the coast each year. Logging in the southern part boomed during the 1920s, when logs were driven down the Pasvik River to Elvenes and Jakobsnes in Norway. Previously there were birch forests in the fells, but in the 1960s their <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> eaten by the caterpillar of the autumnal moth, leaving the fells barren. The construction of the Paatsjoki River Hydroelectric Plants starting in the 1940s had a strong negative effect on the fish population; in 1976 the authorities therefore enforced the obligatory introduction of fish in Lake Inari.|$|E
50|$|Mostly, {{the plants}} present a {{distinct}} odor.
