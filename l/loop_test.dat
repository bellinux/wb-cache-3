5000|$|The loops in steps 4, 5 and 6 are trickier to evaluate. The outer <b>loop</b> <b>test</b> in step 4 will execute ( [...] n + 1 [...] )times (note that {{an extra}} step is {{required}} to terminate the for loop, hence n + 1 and not n executions), which will consume T4( [...] n + 1 [...] ) time. The inner loop, on the other hand, is governed by the value of j, which iterates from 1 to i. On the first pass through the outer loop, j iterates from 1 to 1: The inner loop makes one pass, so running the inner loop body (step 6) consumes T6 time, and the inner <b>loop</b> <b>test</b> (step 5) consumes 2T5 time. During the next pass through the outer loop, j iterates from 1 to 2: the inner loop makes two passes, so running the inner loop body (step 6) consumes 2T6 time, and the inner <b>loop</b> <b>test</b> (step 5) consumes 3T5 time.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic idea}} of loop {{unrolling}} {{is that the}} number of instructions executed in a loop can be reduced by reducing the number of loop tests, sometimes reducing {{the amount of time spent}} in the loop. For example, in the case of a loop with only a single instruction in the block code, the <b>loop</b> <b>test</b> will typically be performed for every iteration of the loop, that is every time the instruction is executed. If, instead, eight copies of the same instruction are placed in the loop, then the test will be performed only every eight iterations, and this may gain time by avoiding seven tests. However, this only handles a multiple of eight iterations, requiring something else to handle any remainder of iterations.|$|E
50|$|A 4-poster or four poster {{automotive}} {{test system}} is {{specifically designed for}} the testing of vehicles (cars, trucks). These test systems consist of 4 hydraulic actuators on top of which {{the wheels of the}} vehicle are placed. Movements of the actuators simulate the road surface and forces exerted by the road on the wheels. The movements of the system are tightly controlled by a digital test controller. During the research phase of a vehicle a 4-poster system is used to test newly designed suspension systems and their durability. In production 4-poster systems are usually used to test every vehicle {{at the end of the}} production line on squeak and rattle, which is a check to make sure the vehicle doesn't have any loose parts. Different kinds of testing are possible: sine test (sweep in frequency); simple wave form on each actuator; open <b>loop</b> <b>test</b> (driven by an external tension signal); a particular testing method called ICS control, which allows to reproduce on a car an actual service environment, starting from those data coming from the outdoor acquisition sessions.|$|E

30|$|The {{emission}} {{stability of}} a field emission electron source {{is one of the}} key factors that affect its potential application in vacuum electronic devices. The J-E curves can only show transitory field emission phenomenon in a short time and cannot reflect the field emission behavior sufficiently. Figure  5 d showed the <b>looping</b> <b>testing</b> of the CNTs. The anode voltage was increased or decreased by 30  V/step. Seen from <b>loop</b> <b>testing</b> with increased and decreased voltage between 1.5 and 3.5  V μm− 1 for 25 loops, there is no obvious deterioration of the maximum current density. Before the <b>looping</b> <b>testing</b> with maximum current of about 20  mA/cm 2, the current density of 10  mA/cm 2 was also tested with no deterioration. Figure  5 e displayed the typical J-E curves for different loops of the <b>loop</b> <b>testing.</b> The current density was relatively stable both in the increased and decreased voltage processes. During the increased or decreased voltage process of the field emission testing, desorption and adsorption of the gas molecules will change the work function of CNT and probably lead to a phenomenon of hysteresis [9, 44]. The hysteresis was unnoticeable in this work indicated that desorption and adsorption may reach an equilibrium state. Furthermore, the long-term test of the sample exhibited good stability for 50  h (Fig.  5 f). When ionization vacuum gauge was opened, the emission current increased abruptly during the stability test as shown in the arrow pointed position of Fig.  5 f. The conditions in vacuum chamber and the surface state of CNT emitters may change in testing process which resulted in the rising of emission current. All these achievements underlined the potential of CNT emitters in applications.|$|R

40|$|The {{correspondence}} between theoretical concept and the experimental fracture behaviors of ceramic fibers such as Pitch based and PAN based carbon fibers, alumina and glass fibers were discussed using twisting {{test and the}} <b>loop</b> <b>test.</b> In twisting test under the combined stress, the theoretical value of tensile strength was approximately consistent with the measurement value of that in Pitch based carbon fibers. Thus correspondence was not confirmed in PAN based carbon fibers by the effect of structural anisotropic. In the <b>loop</b> <b>test,</b> the fracture surfaces of alumina, carbon and glass fibers in- dicated a typical pattern containing a line shape, which appeared on the compression side of alumina fibers and on the tension side of carbon and glass fibers.

Eleven strains in O-groups 101, 138, 147, and 149 were positive {{in all four}} assay systems and were designated ST + LT.

Three strains of O-groups 8, 9, and 140 were positive only in the infant mouse assay and were designated ST mouse. Two strains of O-group 149 were positive in all tests except the infant mouse test and were designated LT. A total of 42 strains were negative in all four tests (Ent-), and 3 strains could not be categorized by the enterotoxigenicity criteria used. All K 88 -positive isolates, 17 strains of O-groups 8, 32, 147, and 149, were positive {{in at least one}} enterotoxigenicity test. ST pig and ST mouse strains gave positive intestinal loop tests as bacterial suspensions in 4 - to 10 -day-old piglets.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{assumption}} of equal tensile and compressive modulus {{necessary to determine}} single fiber axial compressive strength from the elastica <b>loop</b> <b>test</b> is relaxed by deriving a compressive strength equation based on {{the analysis of the}} flexural response of a fiber with different modulus in tension and compression. Previously determined tensile (E 1 t) and compressive (E 1 c) modulus values for different high performance organic fibers with varying degrees of lateral molecular interactions are used to determine fiber compressive strength. The importance of using the bi-moduli equation becomes evident in the case of fibers that lack strong intermolecular interactions, since calculations done with the original <b>loop</b> <b>test</b> equation can result in an overestimation of the compressive strength on the order of 80 %, as seen for the poly-(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) fiber PBO.
