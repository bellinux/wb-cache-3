This was performed with application to flapping-wing micro-air vehicles (FMAVs) in mind. Experiments were accom-plished with a first-of-its-kind mechanical flapping-wing apparatus capable of reproducing a wide range of insect-like wing motions in air on the FMAV scale (150 mm wingspan). This apparatus gives an insect-like wing the three controllable degrees of freedom required to produce the three separate motions necessary for mimicking an insect-like flapping-wing trajectory: sweeping (side to side), plunging (up and down), and pitching (angle of attack variation). Lift was measured via a force balance while the following kinematic parameters were varied: flap-ping frequency (f), angle of attack at mid-stroke (mid), timing of pitch reversal with stroke reversal (rotation phase), stroke amplitude (), and plunge amplitude (). Results revealed that <b>mean</b> <b>lift</b> scaled with f 1. 5 and varied proportionally with. A pitch reversal advanced by up to 5 per cent of the flapping period relative to stroke reversal was found to maximize <b>mean</b> <b>lift,</b> and delayed pitch reversals were detrimental to <b>mean</b> <b>lift.</b> Of the parameters tested, <b>mean</b> <b>lift</b> was also maximized for mid 45 and 8. 6...|$|R

This study was performed to analyze the relationship between kinesiophobia and performance in an FCE. Kinesiophobia and FCE performance of 54 male and 10 female patients (mean age 38. 0) suffering chronic low back pain (mean length of episode 9. 9 months, 93 % off work) were assessed. Kinesiophobia was assessed using the Dutch Version of the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (scale 17 - 68). A lifting task and an FCE were operationalizations of avoidance. FCE results were transformed into a single measure using the classification of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (FCE-DOT, scale 1 - 5). Correlations between the variables were calculated. The results are: kinesiophobia mean 41. 6 (SD 7. 3), <b>lifting</b> <b>mean</b> 29. 5 kg (SD 11. 6), FCE-DOT mean 3. 6 (SD 0. 6). Correlations between kinesiophobia and lifting was r = 0. 01 (p = 0. 93) and between kinesiophobia and FCE-DOT was ? = - 0. 04 (p = 0. 75).

Six experienced male strongman athletes performed log lifts and clean and jerks at 70 % of their 1 RM clean and jerk.

The log lift demonstrated significantly greater trunk (↑ 24 %) and hip (↑ 9 %) range of motion than the clean and jerk. Significantly greater peak bar velocities were achieved in the clean and jerk in the second pull (16 %) and the jerk (↑ 14 %).

40|$|Introduction: Participatory {{ergonomic}} {{approaches have}} been shown to be an effective method for identifying work place hazards. Since in many workplaces, expertise in ergonomics is not available, simple educational messages to identify low back injury (LBI) hazards were developed. This thesis examined lifting risk perceptions of workers and the efficacy of a simple educational message on improving their ability to recognize key LBI hazards, in particular, lifting objects on or close to the ground. Methods: 178 participants from differing sectors were shown 44 different lifting videos (representing 36 lifting scenarios). These scenarios differed in terms of factors such as lifting height origin/destination, weight, and the amount of horizontal reach. Participants were asked to rate each video, from 0 - 10, on how likely they believed the lifting task they just saw could eventually lead to a low back injury. One of two educational messages was then shown to the participants. These messages were crafted with the help of academic experts and knowledge translation professionals in health and safety associations. One message was used as the intervention and spoke of the risk of lifting objects from close to the floor and the other as the control and spoke of the use of back belts in industry. After reading the message, participants were shown and asked to rate the same 44 lifting videos again, but in a different order. Participant’s ratings of risk were correlated to a biomechanically-based tool (3 DMatch) that estimates low back loading. Results: As lifts deviated from a waist-to-waist height, light object <b>lift</b> (<b>mean</b> Likert score = 0. 421 units), ratings of risk perception increased. The highest rated tasks were the floor-to-waist stoop lift, heavy floor-to-floor lift, and the heavy floor-to-waist <b>lift</b> (<b>mean</b> Likert scores = 7. 73, 7. 382, and 7. 107 respectively). Pre-post score differences were used to assess message efficacy. Of the 36 types of tasks, 19 significantly changed in the Lifting Height Message receiving group compared to 3 in the Back Belt Message group. The 19 changes were mainly seen in the videos that had lift origins at floor height. Participant’ risk ratings correlated positively, albeit only moderately with 3 DMatch (R-value = 0. 495, p< 0. 05). Demographically stratified correlations were also positive but were weak to moderate in strength (R-value range = 0. 357 to 0. 674, p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The results support the use of a simple message to increase conceptual awareness of the important lifting hazard of lifting objects from near the ground. This increase in recognition is the first step in the injury prevention cycle of identifying hazards, assessing risks, and controlling hazards...|$|R

In this crane, beam is <b>lifted</b> by <b>means</b> of wire rope, link or chain to the distal end of boom and material can be <b>lift</b> by <b>means</b> of wire rope with lifting point. Beam is directly suspended using wire ropes and its move by boom crane. Wire ropes are fitted with lugs which are directly welded to the horizontally suspended beam for lifting material or objects. Generally, Beams are used to move slender materials specifically say slender plate as one industry application. Slender plate type objects are flexible in nature so, it may be sag or bend {{during a time of}} lifting because of only two lifting lug are generally used. Moreover, fixed size of beam is used for a single application of lifting plate so; this is a limitation of a beam, and in major cases it requires changing as application changes.

40|$|Abstract: Of {{the various}} types of {{technical}} fishways, fish lifts {{are one of the most}} operationally flexible yet most complicated upstream passage methods. Fish lifts are being installed with greater frequency and have enjoyed successes in passing many different species in the same facility. Fish lifts have been particularly successful in passing alosine species, and are a typical upstream passage solution for medium to high head dams. This presentation will discuss some of the advantages and challenges of constructing fish lifts and will highlight examples of fish lifts in operation. Well designed fish lifts have the ability to distribute attraction flows in multiple locations to achieve different velocities in different zones of the fishway such as the entrance, crowder pool, holding pool, or transport flumes. This operational flexibility allows different flow fields to be established for optimal attraction and movement of different target species during different times of the upstream passage season. This flexibility requires complex hydraulic adjustments and automation of mechanical systems. The inherent mechanical complexity of fish <b>lifts</b> <b>means</b> that it is important to engage a competent engineering consultant whose team understands the nuances of fish behavior as well as the technical challenges of such an important facility. This presentation will highlight some of the important design considerations for developing or evaluating a successful fish lift project...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of current {{computational fluid dynamics}} capabilities in predicting <b>mean</b> <b>lift</b> forces for two dimensional foils is conducted. It is shown that both integral boundary layer theory and Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes algorithms provide the same over-prediction of lift forces when properly converged. It is also shown that the over-prediction is insensitive to turbulence model details. Experimentation and computational fluid dynamics modeling show that discrete vortices are shed with significant sizes and distinct frequencies. These vortices are shown to result in significant cfd prediction errors when they are asymmetric in size or shape. Inaccuracies in flow predictions in the near wake appear to result in an effective change in the Kutta Condition due to pressure biasing associated with vortex asymmetry. The net result is a consistent overprediction of <b>mean</b> <b>lift.</b> Based on an {{analysis of}} over 1000 historical experiments an empirical model is developed to allow the error in predicted lift coefficient to be anticipated based on the local flow conditions at {{the trailing edge of}} the foil.
