40|$|This study {{examines}} whether the racial disparity in functional health grows unabated over the adult life course - the cumulative disadvantage hypothesis - or shrinks among the oldest old - the age-as-leveler hypothesis. Special {{emphasis is placed}} on the role of socioeconomic status (SES), which is highly associated with race. The analysis uses latent growth-curve modeling to examine differences in age trajectories of functional health between Black and White Americans and is based on nationally representative panel data of 3497 adults. Results cautiously support the age-as-leveler hypothesis. Net of functional health at baseline, Black adults experience a growing disadvantage in functional health over time until the oldest ages, when the gap in functional health begins to shrink. Results indicate that the potential <b>leveling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of age may be specific to women. SES including financial assets explains the divergence in functional health across young and middle-aged Black and White adults, but not the later-life convergence. This study reveals the life-course pattern of racial disparity in functional health and suggests that more theoretical development is needed in this field to explain why the age-as-leveler and cumulative disadvantage processes are different for functional health than for other outcomes.

They had electronically controlled stopping and <b>leveling</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which meant elevator operators {{no longer had to}} use finesse and guesswork to stop the car at the correct spot. Original tenants of the Tower included commercial and medical offices, stores, and a restaurant. For much of the past, medical and law offices occupied most of the space. In 1971, Mariner Realty sold the building to Towne Realty. By the early 1990s, with the downturn of the Westown neighborhood, only a third of The Wisconsin Tower’s space was leased. From 1994 until 2002, Milwaukee Business Training Institute relocated to this site and leased four floors of the building. For a time, the penthouse on the 21st floor was occupied by the popular Milwaukee rock and roll radio station FM 93 WQFM, which went off the air in 1996. The Tower also housed a Milwaukee Police Station and later, the Public Service Ambassadors from their inception in 1999 until 2003.

50|$|Taussig applies this {{approach}} to two beliefs, one based on both his own field research and that of anthropologist June Nash, the second based on his own research. The first is the belief held by semi-proletarianized peasants in Colombia (with an analogous case among Bolivian tin miners) that proletarianized sugar-cane cutters can make {{a contract with the}} devil that will cause them to make a good deal of money, but that this money can be spent only on frivolous consumer goods, and that the cutter will die an early miserable death. Taussig suggests that earlier anthropologists might have argued that this belief is a hold-over from pre-capitalist culture, or serves as a <b>leveling</b> <b>mechanism</b> (ensuring that no individual become significantly wealthier than any of his or her fellows). Taussig, however, argues that through the devil, peasants express their recognition that capitalism is based on the magic belief that capital is productive, when in fact capitalism breeds poverty, disease, and death. The second belief provides another example of peasants representing their own understanding of capitalism's claim that capital is productive: the belief that some people engineer a switch that results in a peso, rather than a baby, being baptized. The consequence is that the money, alive, will return to its original owner no matter how it is spent, and bring more money back with it.|$|E

40|$|Conventional human-machine systems use task {{allocation}} {{policies which}} are based on the premise of a flexible human operator. This individual is most often required to compensate for and augment the capabilities of the machine. The development of artificial intelligence and improved technologies have allowed for a wider range of task allocation strategies. In response to these issues a Knowledge Based Adaptive Mechanism (KBAM) is proposed for assigning tasks to human and machine in real time, using a load <b>leveling</b> policy. This <b>mechanism</b> employs an online workload assessment and compensation system which is responsive to variations in load through an intelligent interface. This interface consists of a loading strategy reasoner which has access to information about the current status of the human-machine system as well as a database of admissible human/machine loading strategies.

40|$|Evolutionary {{anthropology}} is {{a scholarly}} endeavor {{informed by the}} history of human evolution, drawing on the fields of evolutionary biology, behavioral ecology, behavioral economics, and evolutionary psychology, {{in addition to the}} substantial contributions of conventional anthropology itself. This frame of reference allows for a functional perspective on human behavior without ignoring or neglecting important sources of individual and cultural variation. In a general way, this work investigates how natural and sexual selection pressures shape human psychology and behavior, generating evolved proclivities and propensities, including the propensity for humans to be cultural animals. Hence, this perspective situates humans as active agents navigating a complex terrain of selective regimes and interacting with multiple local social systems in the interest of achieving both cultural competency and fitness. More specifically, within this framework, the work of this dissertation examines both differing forms of social status and cooperation and conflict in mating and mate selection. Much of the work presented here explores how, as autonomous agents operating within the affordances and constraints of their social ecology, women negotiate heterosexual mateship choices across varying environments. Positing that dominant men may also be domineering mates in the household, my research previous to this dissertation focused on critiquing the simplistic perspective that heterosexual women prefer dominant men. This research established that it is more likely that, on average, women interested in upward mobility actually prefer prestige in their prospective partners rather than dominance. Furthermore, these women pay attention to the context of men's domineering behaviors, ensuring that men adhere to culturally-prescribed norms of behavior. Presumably, this suite of preferences functions to increase the probability of coordination and cooperation in long-term pair bonds - cooperation directed toward the raising of extremely altricial human offspring. While the majority of heterosexual women surveyed in my prior work prefer male partners who pursue social status through prestige rather than through dominance, nonetheless, observation suggests that some women select domineering partners in spite of available alternatives. Clinicians and scholars alike tend to approach this phenomenon from a perspective that pathologizes these women and deprecates their choices. Chapter 1 of the dissertation argues that such women can, in part, be understood as confronting a trade-off wherein they shift their preferences toward men who are likely to offer them necessary protection in spite of the strong possibility that these same men will be domineering in the household. This work reveals that women who perceive themselves to be more vulnerable to crime indeed have preferences for such aggressive and physically formidable men. Hence, women who select domineering men as long-term partners may be responding in a functional manner to their unfortunate circumstances. Rather than suffering pathology or dysfunction, these women are making the best of a bad situation, a fact that has likely eluded middle- and upper-class investigators who are less familiar with the experiences and dangerous environments that such women face. Importantly, this work also offers an explanation for why preferences for long-term partners who can offer protection were long posited but went previously undetected. Again focusing on cooperation and conflict in mateships and mate selection, Chapters 2 and 3 of the dissertation call to task evolutionary psychology researchers who have, I argue, incorrectly characterized women's psychological responses to rape and their defensive coping strategies. My data-driven investigations challenge widely-held views on the subject. It is important for any phenomenological investigation to be held to high standards of scientific rigor. In addition, as sexual coercion and rape are deeply disturbing social ills and a profound tragedy for the victims, it is especially important that the scholarship of this topic be held to the highest levels of rigor. Chapter 2 of the dissertation systematically re-evaluates the logic and methods used to investigate women's rape-avoidance behaviors. Here, I contend that a significant body of the investigation of this phenomenon relies heavily on self-report measures that are only applicable to women in university or college settings, failing to accurately capture important variation in women's behaviors according to age and relationship status. I suggest in this work that women's fear of rape should be the primary motivator of rape-avoidance behaviors; thus, fear of sexual assault should be a useful index in measuring rape defensive strategies. Employing this approach, I obtain results that significantly deviate from the findings of previous researchers. Chapter 3 is an extension of the notion that fear of rape is an important index. Here I examine partnered women's fear of rape, simultaneously calling for higher levels of rigor in the study of partnered women's risk for emotional sequalae following sexual assault. A reified but under-investigated hypothesis contends that partnered women face a higher cost of sexual assault because the victim's mate may misperceive the assault as a cuckoldry threat. A thorough review of the existing evidence suggesting that partnered women face higher costs of rape indicates that existing findings are equivocal at best. I then present novel results indicating that the effects of relationship status on fear of sexual assault do not correspond with the notion that partnered women face higher costs due to rape than unpartnered women. Turning from issues of dominance to issues of prestige, in Chapter 4 I present an ethnographic description of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) as a mutual-aid group and a quasi-egalitarian cooperative institution characterized by complex prestige dynamics. I argue that, within this egalitarian organization, there is a clear dependence on experience-based transmission of cultural norms through a process of apprenticeship and imitation that necessarily generates a prestige hierarchy. Whenever status becomes a commodity, there is a risk that individuals will leverage their status into positions of dominance and control over subordinates. The codified orthodoxy of this institution has specific proscriptions condemning such behaviors and, accordingly, proscribing the pursuit of status. Mirroring small-scale societies, individuals in NA strategically employ <b>leveling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> designed to limit the power and personally sanction self-aggrandizing behaviors. Thus, what emerges is a relatively stable organization, across regions and time, with more-experienced members teaching the norms of the institution to less-experienced members and gently leading at local levels while treading carefully as regards self-aggrandizement. In sum, adopting an evolutionary perspective concerned with questions of ultimate function, this work examines the psychology and social dynamics of cooperation and conflict in a variety of domains. Simultaneously, this work stands as a cautionary tale against ethnocentrism and disciplinary in-group favoritism, warning of the dual dangers of sweeping important cultural contexts under the rug and settling for low standards of scientific rigor...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{examines}} the social processes and mechanisms of agrarian changes based on a 23 -year (1983 – 2006) case study of Bemba villages in northern Zambia. The Bemba have engaged in a unique shifting cultivation system called the “citemene ” system in miombo woodlands. Villagers have sustained a citemene system that does not greatly exceed the amount required for subsistence. They have also maintained a <b>leveling</b> <b>mechanism</b> of distribution and consumption that promotes equity among the people, which could at times deter innovative changes. Beginning in the mid- 1980 s, semi-permanent maize cultivation {{with the use of}} chemical fertilizers quickly spread and expanded in the villages due to agricultural policies. However, in the mid- 1990 s, market liberalization led by the Structural Adjustment Program brought about a decline in maize production, and villagers returned to depend more on the citemene system. Around 2000, the Resettlement Project implemented by the government expelled villagers and citemene cultivation from parts of the miombo woodland. The villagers are currently searching for a new livelihood strategy. We classify these rapid changes in the villages into five periods and argue that the <b>leveling</b> <b>mechanism</b> could in fact promot...|$|E

40|$|In the Western Polynesian {{society of}} Samoa, {{cultural}} {{learning and the}} acquisition of competency in many domains is substantially influenced by the hierarchical structure of social relations and interactions. From a population-level perspective, this pattern of intergenerational transmission of culture can generate differential distribution of competencies based on children’s relative household rank for many domains of cultural knowledge. As the local primary school provides children with opportunities to learn without regard to household rank, the possibility exists that it may act as a countervailing force {{in the distribution of}} cultural competency. This report examines this possibility through the analysis of children’s developing competency with the Samoan honorific lexicon, a basic yet important element of the larger category of respectful behavior that all adults are expected to acquire. A multiple-choice test of the Samoan honorific lexicon was administered to a sample of early adolescent school children aged 10 - 14 years (n = 64) at a single, rural primary school. Analysis of this data set supports the interpretation that the primary school functions to reduce the levels of variation in competencies across the population of children, and thus operates as a <b>leveling</b> <b>mechanism</b> in this domain of cultural knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Food {{restriction}} on elephants among the Baka, a hunter-gatherer group in northwestern Congo, was described, and its social function was also discussed. The Baka hunt and snare various forest animals ranging from rats to elephants, mainly aiming at duikers and primates. Elephants are rarely hunted. Once killed, however, an elephant could bring {{enormous amount of}} meat to many people. Nevertheless, the Baka elephant hunter and his senior close relatives don't eat any portion of the huge game, because if they eat the meat of an elephant killed by the hunter, he {{is believed to be}} incapable of catching any elephant as game thereafter. Besides elephants, there are many kinds of game which certain people should avoid eating. The game includes "anomalous", "unusual", or valueless game for food, which the previous studies on food taboos have so far considered to be susceptible to avoidance. On the other hand, an elephant is not "anomalous", "unusual", or valueless. Unlike the elephant hunter and his senior relatives, most of those who are required to avoid the game are the people at momentous stages of life such as pregnant women, new-born babies, etc. These differences suggest that the above custom of food {{restriction on}} elephants has different meanings from the ones interpreted in the previous studies concerning food taboos. I think that this custom is part of the <b>leveling</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the Baka society. Although experienced Baka elephant hunters are held in esteem, they don't have social or political power. It is possible that sharing such an enormous amount of meat as an elephant has makes receivers feel a psychological burden and helps centralize prestige on givers. But, there is not such centralization of prestige in the Baka society. I consider that it is partly because elephant hunters control themselves and partly because they can have no right to the meat under the above custom and therefore meat receivers do not need to feel obliged to the hunters. The egalitarian society of the Baka could be maintained by the leveling mechanisim including thorough sharing, the restrained attitude of elephant hunters, food restriction on elephants and so on...|$|E
