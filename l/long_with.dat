5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the reticulate whipray is diamond-shaped and wider than <b>long,</b> <b>with</b> the leading margins almost straight and the snout and outer corners angular. In juveniles, the disc {{is about as}} wide as <b>long,</b> <b>with</b> a more obtuse snout and rounded corners. The eyes are small and immediately followed by the spiracles (paired respiratory openings). A short and wide curtain of skin with a minutely fringed rear margin is present between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is relatively small, with a deep concavity {{at the center of}} the lower jaw and shallow furrows at the corners extending onto the lower jaw. A row of 4–5 papillae (nipple-like structures) is found across the floor of the mouth. There are 26–40 upper tooth rows and 27–44 lower tooth rows. The pelvic fins are small and triangular. The tail is whip-like and extremely thin, measuring 3–3.5 times as long as the disc when intact, and lacks fin folds. Usually one serrated stinging spine is located on the upper surface on the tail, some distance from the base.|$|E

5|$|Another feud {{was over}} the WWE Intercontinental Championship between the {{defending}} champion Drew McIntyre and Kofi Kingston. SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long stripped McIntyre of the championship and fired him for repeatedly attacking Matt Hardy. Long set up a tournament to determine the new champion, in which Christian and Kingston qualified for the final by defeating Cody Rhodes and Dolph Ziggler. The following week, on the May 14 episode of SmackDown, Kingston defeated Christian to win the tournament and the championship. Immediately following the match, however, McIntyre presented <b>Long</b> <b>with</b> {{a letter from the}} WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, which stated that McIntyre had been reinstated to the roster and was still recognized as the Intercontinental Champion. As a result, WWE's official website announced that McIntyre would defend the championship against tournament winner Kingston.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} December 1883, a {{humpback}} whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off Dundee, attracting much local interest. It was harpooned, but after an all-night struggle escaped.

Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet <b>long</b> <b>with</b> a tail 11 feet 4 inches wide.
