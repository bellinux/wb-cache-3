The results demonstrated that the lesions of the lepromatous and borderline <b>lepromatous</b> <b>forms</b> presented intense cytoplasm staining for TGF-beta 1 in {{the cells of the}} dermal infiltrate.

Considering that in the <b>lepromatous</b> leprosy <b>form</b> Mycobacterium leprae multiplies in the cytoplasm of macrophages and the lesions are diffuse and consist of poorly differentiated young macrophages, we believe that these alternations may be explained at least in part by the presence of TGF-beta 1 in the dermal infiltrate. Production of the cytokine may be induced by the presence of the bacillus itself and of its constituents, causing a mechanism of parasite evasion. Similarly, the absence of TGF-beta 1 in tuberculoid leprosy, which progresses with a specific immune response to M. leprae, may explain the intense differentiation of macrophage cells with the formation of well defined epithelioid granulomas capable of eliminating most of the bacilli...|$|R

In order to prevent these episodes, an extra dose of 100 mg/day thalidomide was used during six months, followed by a follow-up period of six more months after thalidomide discontinuation. METHODS: We included 42 patients with multibacillary (MB) leprosy who had episodes of ENL. They were male and female patients aged between 18 and 84 years. RESULTS: Of the 42 patients, 39 (92. 85 %) had the <b>lepromatous</b> <b>form</b> and three (7. 15 %) had the borderline form.

Here, we investigate the molecular processes underlying tissue damages in intestinal mucosa of 14 sheep showing either tuberculoid or <b>lepromatous</b> <b>form</b> of MAP enteritis. We found that E-cadherins, alpha-catenin and beta 1 -integrins were present at significant low levels in tissues of sheep affected by <b>lepromatous</b> <b>form</b> and that this pattern was associated with high expression of TGF-beta, IL- 10, IL- 1 beta, and TNF-alpha and with a modest increase of CD 4 + and CD 25 + T cells.

40|$|Immunoenzymatic assays were {{developed}} for the measurement of antibodies against mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a cell-free proteic extract (CFX) of Mycobacterium leprae, and the 38 -kD protein antigen of M. tuberculosis. Sera from 108 leprosy patients, belonging to all clinical–immunological forms of the spectrum, and 81 patients with localized or disseminated tuberculosis (TB) were tested for antibodies of the four IgG subclasses. Standard calibration curves were used to allow comparisons between results of different isotypes and specificities. Mean concentrations of total IgG antibodies {{were higher in the}} overall leprosy population than in TB patients. In leprosy, levels of anti-CFX increased from tuberculoid toward <b>lepromatous</b> <b>forms,</b> with a clear switch from IgG 1 to IgG 2 subclass predominance. A similar IgG 1 to IgG 2 conversion was observed in anti-LAM antibodies, although total levels of anti-LAM were similar in patients with tuberculoid and <b>lepromatous</b> <b>forms.</b> In TB, antibodies against polysaccharide and protein antigens were both predominantly of IgG 1 subclass, whatever the patient's clinical status, although lower in disseminated forms, probably due to concomitant HIV infection. A hypergammaglobulinaemia was also found in most leprosy and TB patients. In TB this was due to increased IgG 1 and IgG 3, especially in HIV co-infected patients. Based on the current knowledge of the influence of T cell-secreted cytokines on human immunoglobulin isotype expression, these results do not fit with a putative role of Th 1 (such as found in TB and tuberculoid leprosy (TT)) and Th 2 (such as found in leprosy lepromatous (LL) leprosy) environment in the isotypy of antibody responses in mycobacterial infections. Nor do variations of isotypy according to pathological conditions seem {{to be related to the}} biochemical nature of antigens, since antibodies to LAM and protein antigens had comparable evolutions of their subclass distribution.

40|$|Background: Infectious disease {{incidence}} {{is often}} male-biased. Two main hypotheses {{have been proposed}} to explain this observation. The physiological hypothesis (PH) emphasizes differences in sex hormones and genetic architecture, while the behavioral hypothesis (BH) stresses gender-related differences in exposure. Surprisingly, the population-level predictions of these hypotheses are yet to be thoroughly tested in humans. Methods and Findings: For ten major pathogens, we tested PH and BH predictions about incidence and exposure-prevalence patterns. Compulsory-notification records (Brazil, 2006 – 2009) were used to estimate age-stratified =:R incidence rate ratios for the general population and across selected sociological contrasts. Exposure-prevalence odds ratios were derived from 82 published surveys. We estimated summary effect-size measures using random-effects models; our analyses encompass, 0. 5 million cases of disease or exposure. We found that, after puberty, disease incidence is male-biased in cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, pulmonary tuberculosis, leptospirosis, meningococcal meningitis, and hepatitis A. Severe dengue is female-biased, and no clear pattern is evident for typhoid fever. In leprosy, milder tuberculoid forms are female-biased, whereas more severe <b>lepromatous</b> <b>forms</b> are male-biased. For most diseases, male bias emerges also during infancy, when behavior is unbiased but sex steroid levels transiently rise. Behavioral factors likely modulate male–female differences in some diseases (the leishmaniases, tuberculosis, leptospirosis, or schistosomiasis) and age classes...|$|R

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of host responses to Mycobacterium leprae provides {{a model for}} investigating the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of mycobacterial disease. Of particular interest is tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine which may have both antimycobacterial and immunopathologic effects. To evaluate the potential role of TNF in leprosy, we measured TNF production in response to M. leprae and its defined constituents by {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from patients across the {{spectrum of}} disease. The levels of TNF induced through the stimulation of cells with M. leprae or its dominant "lipopolysaccharide," lipoarabinomannan, were higher in patients with the tuberculoid form of the disease than in those with the <b>lepromatous</b> <b>form.</b> In patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a reactional state of lepromatous leprosy, the levels of TNF release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells were higher than in any other form of the disease. Treatment of ENL patients with thalidomide reduced TNF secretion by more than 90 %. The mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex of Mycobacterium species, the protein-peptidoglycan complex, and muramyl dipeptide all elicited significant TNF release. Therefore, TNF release appears to be triggered by at least two major cell wall structural constituents of M. leprae, lipoarabinomannan and segments of the cell wall skeleton. The prominent TNF release in patients with the paucibacillary tuberculoid form of the disease compared with that in patients with the multibacillary <b>lepromatous</b> <b>form</b> suggests that this cytokine contributes to a resistant immune response to mycobacterial infection. However, the marked TNF release in patients with ENL indicates that TNF may also mediate immunopathologic effects, such as fever and tissue damage...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{diversity}} of clinical manifestations of leprosy {{has given rise}} to different classification systems. However, there are important differences in the sensitivity and specificity of these classifications. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the agreement between clinical and histopathological data for classifying leprosy. MethodsA total of 1265 patient reports containing clinical and histopathological data relating to the diagnosis and classification of leprosy were included in this study. The diagnostic concordance between the clinical form (Madrid classification) and the histopathological type, as well as the initial and final classifications, was calculated by dividing the number of concordant cases by the total number of patients. ResultsThe overall agreement between the World Health Organization operational classification and the results of direct smear examination of the lesion for acid-fast bacilli was 84. 8 % (1073 / 1265). The clinical–histopathological agreement was 58. 1 % (735 / 1265). The indeterminate and <b>lepromatous</b> <b>forms</b> were those that showed the highest percentages of agreement: 72. 1 % (186 / 258) and 71. 0 % (142 / 200), respectively.

40|$|International audienceLeprosy is an infectious, {{neurodegenerative}} disease of humans caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Despite effective control programs, {{the incidence of}} leprosy remains stubbornly high, suggesting that transmission may be more common than expected. The rationale of this work was to use bioinformatics and comparative genomics to identify potentially antigenic proteins for diagnostic purposes. This approach defined three classes of proteins: those restricted to M. leprae (class I), those present in M. leprae with orthologues in other organisms besides mycobacteria (class II), and exported or surface-exposed proteins (class III). Twelve genes (two class I, four class II, and six class III proteins) were cloned in Escherichia coli, and their protein products were purified. Six of these proteins were detected in cell extracts of M. leprae by immunoblotting. The immunogenicity of each recombinant protein was then investigated in leprosy patients by measuring the reactivity of circulating antibody and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) responses in T-cell restimulation assays. Several class II and class III proteins were recognized by circulating antibodies. Importantly, most class II proteins elicited IFN-gamma responses that were significantly stronger than those produced by previously identified antigens. Among them, two class II proteins, ML 0308 and ML 2498, showed marked humoral and cellular immunogenicity, therefore providing promising candidates for the diagnosis of both tuberculoid and <b>lepromatous</b> <b>forms</b> of leprosy...|$|R

We employed reverse transcription PCR using M. paratuberculosis subspecies-specific primers (IS 900) on total RNA from 12 ileal mucosal specimens (CD, n = 8; controls, n = 4, 2 with ulcerative colitis and 2 with colonic cancer). As a negative control, we used Myobacterium avium DNA, originally cultured from the drinking water of a major city in the United States. cDNA sequence analysis shows that all eight cases of Crohn's disease and both samples from the patients with ulcerative colitis contained M. paratuberculosis RNA. Additionally, the M. avium control has the DNA sequence of M. paratuberculosis. We demonstrate the DNA sequence of M. paratuberculosis from mucosal specimens from humans with CD. The potable water supply may be a reservoir of infection. Although M. paratuberculosis signal in CD has been previously reported, a cause and effect relationship has not been established. In part, this is due to conflicting data from studies with empirical antimycobacterial therapy. We conclude that clinical trials with anti-M. paratuberculosis therapy are indicated in patients with CD who have been stratified into the aggressive (perforating) and contained (nonperforating) forms...|$|R

40|$|Background: Leprosy is {{a chronic}} granulomatous disease and affects many {{internal}} organs {{in addition to the}} skin and peripheral nerves. Endocrine dysfunction is often silent and is often missed in patients of leprosy leading to significant morbidity. We studied the presence of occult endocrine disorders in leprosy patients and compared the same with disease parameters. Materials and Methods: We evaluated 40 patients of leprosy (aged 18 - 70 years, any duration) in this cross-sectional, observational study. All subjects were assessed for pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, gonadal function, and dynamic testing was done when deemed necessary. The participants were divided into two groups: Group 1 (Leprosy, n = 40) and Group 2 (Controls, n = 20) and the data were analyzed with appropriate statistical tests. Results: The study participants (35 males, 5 females) had a mean age of 36. 4 ± 11. 3 years, and duration of the disease was 2. 5 ± 5. 5 years. Eleven out of 40 patients showed results consistent with an endocrine disorder, including subclinical hypothyroidism (n = 4), sick euthyroid syndrome (n = 3), growth hormone (GH) deficiency (n = 2), primary hypogonadism (n = 2) and secondary hypogonadism in one patient. One patient had partial hypopituitarism (GH deficiency and secondary hypogonadism) and none of the controls showed any hormonal dysfunction. Testosterone levels showed inverse correlation with the number of skin patches (P = 0. 0006). Conclusion: Occult endocrine dysfunction is seen in a quarter of patients with leprosy.

40|$|Recombinant granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF), {{prepared}} from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) {{cells and}} Escherichia coli, {{was administered to}} 35 patients with the borderline and polar <b>lepromatous</b> <b>forms</b> of leprosy by the intradermal and subcutaneous routes at doses of 7. 5 - 45. 0 micrograms/d for 10 d. With each of these doses and routes, increases {{in the number of}} circulating eosinophils were noted. After the intradermal injection, the local skin sites demonstrated zones of roughening and micronodularity that appeared within 24 - 48 h and persisted for more than 6 d. Reinjection of sites led to enhanced areas of epidermal reaction. GM-CSF prepared from CHO cells was a more potent inducer of this effect. GM-CSF given by the subcutaneous route, at higher doses, failed to initiate these changes. At the microscopic level, the epidermis became thickened (+ 75 %) with increased numbers and layers of enlarged keratinocytes. These contained increased numbers of ribosomes and prominent nucleoli, and were imbedded in a looser meshwork of the zona Pellucida. The modified keratinocytes remained MHC class II antigen negative throughout the course of the response. A major change in the dermis was the progressive accumulation of CD 1 +, Birbeck granule-positive cells. These Langerhans were recognizable at 48 h after intradermal injection and reached maximum numbers by 4 d. During this period the number of epidermal Langerhans cells remained relatively constant. No increment in dermal Langerhans cells occurred when GLM-CSF was injected by the subcutaneous route. No appreciable increase in the numbers of T cells and monocytes was noted, and granulocytes and eosinophils were largely present within the dermal microvasculature. 4 -mm punch biopsies taken from injected sites and adjacent controls were compared in terms of the rapidity of wound healing. 22 of 26 sites demonstrated more rapid filling and hemostasis, whereas four were equivalent to controls. We conclude that rGM-CSF, when introduced into the skin, leads to enhanced keratinocyte growth, the selective recruitment of Langerhans cells into the dermis, and enhanced wound healing of the prepared site. There was no evidence of an enhanced cell-mediated response to Mycobacterium leprae, and bacillary numbers remained unchanged...|$|R

In vitro studies have revealed the existence of T-suppressor cells of the phenotype CD 8 +, CD 3 +, HLA-DR+, FcR+, 9. 3 -, which are restricted by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens. Several new candidate vaccines against leprosy have been effective in breaking immunological unresponsiveness and engendering cell-mediated immunity in lepromatous leprosy patients, including the combination of BCG + killed M. leprae. Because BCG has unique adjuvant properties, we have begun to use molecular genetic approaches to develop BCG into a multivaccine vehicle capable of immunizing simultaneously against several pathogens. Both phage-based and plasmid-based strategies have been successfully developed for introducing selectable markers into BCG for the first time...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>lepromatous</b> <b>form</b> {{of human}} leprosy the nasal {{passages}} are commonly involved, and {{large numbers of}} acid-fast bacilli can be recovered in the nasal washings by methods that have been described (1). That the acid-fast bacilli obtained in this fashion are in fact Mycobacterium leprae is evidenced {{by a number of}} considerations (1), which include the close correlation of the number of acid-fast bacilli recovered with the typical clinical manifestations of the disease, the characteristic microscopic arrangement of the bacilli in globi and packets, and their inability to grow on bacteriological media. When these organisms were inoculated into the foot-pads of mice, small infiltrates containing acid-fast bacilli developed. The present communication describes our continued experience with the experimental disease in mice. Microscopic lesions have been regularly produced when the nasal washings contained acid-fast bacilli, and the incubation period has depended upon the numbers of organisms inoculated. The maximum number of mycobacteria produced in the foot-pad was usually limited to'abou...|$|E
40|$|Intradermal {{administration}} ofrecombinant interferon y (rIFN-y) to lepromatous leprosy patients has {{converted the}} local histology toward a tuberculoid pattern. However, such {{changes have been}} confined {{to the site of}} injection. In contrast, in the present study, marked, intradermal accumulation of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CDla+ T cells and Leu-M 5 + mononuclear phagocytes was induced at a distance from the sites of administration, in a dose-dependent manner, by 10 daily intramuscular injections of 10 - 30 hg rIFN-y/m 2. Mononuclear cell infiltration began within 3 d of onset of rIFN-y therapy and persisted at least 8 wk. Intramuscular administration of rIFN-y to lepromatous patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy can safely induce widespread histologic features of an upgrading reaction. prosy, the first disease associated with a specific bacterium (1) {{and one of the first}} to be treated with chemotherapy (2), remains one of the most prevalent life-threatening infections. The <b>lepromatous</b> <b>form</b> of the disease is marked by anergy to the causative organism Mycobacterium leprae, a paucity of infiltrating lymphocytes, and widespread proliferatio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Leprosy is {{a chronic}} {{bacterial}} disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It {{is the oldest}} known disease to human beings. Incubation period ranges from weeks to years. The prevalence of leprosy varies markedly from country to country. However, {{the overwhelming majority of}} cases are found in developing countries and 92 percent of the cases are detected in just 11 countries led by India and Brazil. Grossly leprosy is divided into <b>lepromatous</b> and tubercular <b>form,</b> based on immunological pattern of disease. Though leprosy is common condition, isolated leprosy of pinna has not been reported so far in the literature. We report a male of 15 years with clinical feature of perichondritis of left pinna due to leprosy...|$|R
40|$|Seventy-seven {{lymph nodes}} were {{examined}} histologically from sixty-two leprosy patients representing {{the whole range}} of the disease spectrum from the high resistance form (tuberculoid) to the specific immunity deficiency <b>form</b> (<b>lepromatous).</b> At the lepromatous end of the spectrum paracortical areas were infiltrated with undifferentiated cells of the histiocyte–macrophage series which failed to eliminate mycobacteria. As resistance to infection increased across the leprosy spectrum, histiocytes became more differentiated eventually appearing epithelioid. This was paralleled by increasing numbers of small lymphocytes in the paracortical areas. In the borderline tuberculoid form of the disease an appearance was seen similar to that found in sarcoidosis. In polar tuberculoid leprosy where there is a high degree of cellular immunity, paracortical areas were well developed and populated with lymphocytes and immunoblasts. The immunological significance of these findings are discussed, especially the relation of the changes in morphological appearance of cells of the histiocyte series to the ability of the patient to develop cell-mediated immune reactions...|$|R
40|$|Leprosy is an {{infectious}} disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) {{has been applied to}} detect M. leprae in different clinical samples and urine seems to be attractive for this purpose. PCR was used to improve the sensitivity for diagnosing leprosy by amplifying a 151 -bp PCR fragment of the M. leprae pra gene (PCR-Pra) in urine samples. Seventy-three leprosy patients (39 males and 34 females, 14 to 78 years old) were selected for leprosy diagnosis at a reference laboratory in Maringa, PR, Brazil. Of these, 36 were under anti-leprosy multidrug therapy with dapsone and rifampicin for tuberculoid (TT) and dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine for borderline (BB) and <b>lepromatous</b> (LL) <b>forms.</b> The control group contained 50 healthy individuals without any clinical history of leprosy. DNA isolated from leprosy patients' urine samples was successfully amplified by PCR-Pra in 46. 6 % (34 / 73) of the cases. The positivity of PCR-Pra for patients with the TT form was 75 % for both patients under treatment and non-treated patients (P = 0. 1306). In patients with the LL form, PCR-Pra positivity was 52 and 30 % for patients under treatment and non-treated patients, respectively (P = 0. 2386). PCR-Pra showed a statistically significant difference in detecting M. leprae between the TT and LL forms of leprosy in patients under treatment (P = 0. 0033). Although the current study showed that the proposed PCR-Pra has some limitations in the detection of M. leprae, this method {{has the potential to be}} a useful tool for leprosy diagnosis mainly in TT leprosy where the AFB slit-skin smear is always negative.
