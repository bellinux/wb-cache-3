5|$|Grasshoppers undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis: they repeatedly moult (undergo ecdysis), each instar becoming {{larger and}} more <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult,</b> with the wing-buds increasing in size at each stage. The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional. The migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes, spends about 25 to 30 days as a nymph, depending on sex and temperature, and lives for about 51 days as an adult.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose {{lifecycle}} {{consists of}} an egg stage, a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph {{about the size of}} a fruit fly. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E

[...] Liu's parents never used baby talk when Liu was a child, and they allowed her to argue with them but required her to present reasoned arguments <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> [...] According to education scholar Ben Mardell, the book's focus on independent thinking and intellectual development was a [...] "break with the past" [...] in China, where both early and higher education often emphasize rote learning.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the jokes}} {{used in the}} storyline of this episode were {{originally}} pitched for a subplot of this episode, which saw Stewie building a robot suit {{to make him look}} <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> to woo Jillian's best friend Ana, but this particular subplot was never used. The scene showing a mayor advertising a 1980s-related CD was included in the original draft for the episode, and, as MacFarlane states, is one of the rare occasions that an act break that is unrelated entirely to the storyline can be included in an episode. Originally, the gag of Stewie using some of Brian's fur to pass it off as his pubic hair {{was going to be the}} only area of his body where he would tell Jillian about his hair, but MacFarlane states that the show was not allowed to mention only pubic hair, and had to steer to a different area on the body that would have hair too, if they wanted to include it. Broadcasting standards allowed the sketch where Peter says [...] "before, women only made me cry through my penis," [...] as he states they [...] "gave in." [...] Additionally, while on the version broadcast Lois dies of an angry hymen, on the DVD version she dies of a rotten vagina.|$|E
