5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lights</b> <b>On</b> Afterschool is a {{nationwide}} rally {{to draw attention}} to the importance of afterschool programs and to highlight their importance to children, families and communities. Each year, more than one million people attend over 7,500 events. <b>Lights</b> <b>On</b> Afterschool is covered in every major media market in the country and in thousands of news clips. <b>Lights</b> <b>On</b> Afterschool events give student participants in afterschool programs a chance to show off the skills that they have learned in their respective programs and to demonstrate the need for further support of such programming.In 2001, Arnold Schwarzenegger became Honorary Chair of the event.The Empire State Building in New York City regularly features yellow <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> the evening of <b>Lights</b> <b>on</b> Afterschool in honor of the cause.In 2008, Afterschool Alliance replaced its former <b>Lights</b> <b>on</b> Afterschool incandescent lightbulb symbol with a CFL (compact fluorescent lamp) to support energy efficiency.|$|R

5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds new <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E
5|$|A {{solar power}} tower uses {{an array of}} {{tracking}} reflectors (heliostats) to concentrate <b>light</b> <b>on</b> a central receiver atop a tower. Power towers are more cost effective, offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability among CSP technologies. The PS10 Solar Power Plant and PS20 solar power plant are examples of this technology.|$|E
30|$|Negative {{effects of}} number of traffic <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> drivers’ {{diversion}} {{are reflected in}} the negative coefficient of “number of traffic <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> the alternate route.” This result is reasonable since more traffic <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> the alternate route means more frequent stops and a lower comfort level of driving and will naturally decrease the probability of diverting to the a driver to on the alternate route under VMS. This finding coincides with some previous studies (e.g., [5]).|$|R

5|$|Analysts {{see in the}} {{character}} of Lady Macbeth the conflict between femininity and masculinity as they are impressed in cultural norms. Lady Macbeth suppresses her instincts toward compassion, motherhood, and fragility — associated with femininity — in favour of ambition, ruthlessness, and the singleminded pursuit of power. This conflict colours the entire drama and sheds <b>light</b> <b>on</b> gender-based preconceptions from Shakespearean England to the present.|$|E

5|$|Currently, no {{reliable}} pre-human fossil occurrences of Amphidromus have been recorded.

Neither record predates human occupancy, and therefore these shed no <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the pre-human history of Amphidromus.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} in the native community, White was portrayed negatively in the English-language press in his lifetime and in the published histories after his death.
