5|$|Heywood {{served as}} an {{intermediary}} linking western companies to powerful Chinese politicians. He was a long-time associate of the Bo family: he reportedly shared a close personal relationship with Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, and had helped the couple's son Bo Guagua earn admission to Harrow School in England. Heywood also allegedly served as a middleman for the family, helping them clandestinely move <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money overseas.|$|E
5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was drawn}} to a {{diversity}} of interests throughout his life, from business to politics. After studying the law for three years, he wrote a number of potboiler novels under various pseudonyms. He also lost <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> borrowed money in the publishing trade, attempting to capitalize on cheap editions of classical works. By 1828 he owed his mother 50,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|The Abwehr {{was right}} {{to worry about the}} {{presence}} of British double agents within their secret service. They were at that time already running 'Garbo' (Juan Pujol), 'Zig-Zag' (Eddie Chapman) and 'Tricycle' (Dušan Popov), supposedly German agents to whom they were paying <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money, but who were in reality working for the British and were supplying the Germans with false information.|$|E
50|$|Some sisters inherit a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> money.|$|R
60|$|Miss Mackenzie was {{not called}} upon to make any answer to this; for {{although}} she had lost a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> money by lending it to her brother, nevertheless she was still possessed <b>of</b> a <b>larger</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> money than that which her brother Walter had received from Jonathan Ball.|$|R

5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to dispose of <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money, they frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives. Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely {{to have in the}} household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1730s public taste for Italian opera was {{beginning}} to fade. The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch's The Beggar's Opera (first performed in 1728) had heralded a spate of English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel's productions were increasingly reliant on private subsidies from the nobility. Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the Opera of the Nobility, a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> his own money in doing so.|$|E
5|$|His horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he {{invested}} <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> {{money in}} the hobby. Murphy had a gambling habit that left his finances in a poor state. In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes. In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he {{would have on the}} youth market.|$|E
60|$|He was guarded in his letter. He {{mentioned}} no definite figures. He {{wrote that}} Ira Nutcombe of {{whom they had}} spoken so often had most surprisingly left him in his will a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> money, and eased his conscience by telling himself that half of a million pounds undeniably was a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> money.|$|R

5|$|Members of {{the band}} had been offered <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money to reunite for concerts and tours, and had turned the offers down. Rumors of tension between de la Rocha and the other former band members {{subsequently}} circulated, but Commerford {{said that he and}} de la Rocha saw each other often and went surfing together, while Morello said he and de la Rocha communicated by phone, and had met up at a September 15, 2005 protest in support of the South Central Farm.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{was not a}} {{religious}} man; he viewed the papacy {{as a means to}} consolidate his family's position. He appointed Alessandro as cardinal against accusations of nepotism, fathered a number of illegitimate children, and spent <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> church money collecting art and antiquities. Around 1545 Charles took the political and military advantage, weakening Paul's hold on the papacy. Aware of the changing tides of influence, Titian abandoned the commission before completion, and for the next 100 years the painting languished unframed in a Farnese cellar.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller {{would support}} Baptist missionary activity, fund universities, and heavily engage in {{religious}} activities at his Cleveland, Ohio church. While traveling the South, he would donate <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money to churches {{belonging to the}} Southern Baptist Convention, various Black churches, {{as well as other}} Christian denominations. One time, he paid for a slave's freedom and donated to a Roman Catholic orphanage. As he grew rich, his donations became more generous, especially to his church in Cleveland; nevertheless, it was demolished in 1925, and replaced with another building.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} tactic used by Palestinians during the Intifada was {{throwing}} stones, molotov cocktails, and burning tires. The local leadership in some West Bank towns commenced non-violent protests against Israeli occupation {{by engaging in}} tax resistance and other boycotts. Israel responded by confiscating <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money in house-to-house raids. As the Intifada came to a close, new armed Palestinian groups—in particular Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)—began targeting Israeli civilians with the new tactic of suicide bombings, and internal fighting amongst the Palestinians increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|The {{value to}} the sinecurist of an office like that of Paymaster of Marines lay {{not so much in}} the {{official}} salary attached to it, but in the lax accounting procedures associated with disbursement of funds, which allowed the official to retain <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> public money in his own hands for many years until accounts were made up. The office of Paymaster General had been reformed in 1783 to avoid these abuses, but these changes had not yet been extended to the Marines during Villiers' tenure.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} brands ran {{commercials}} {{tied to the}} 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company General Motors aired an advertisement during the annual Super Bowl football game in which {{a group of friends}} drove Chevrolet Silverados through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, Jell-O ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at Boston University, questioned the utility of tying <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money to such a unique and short-term event.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving his}} first wife, Elizabeth, he married {{for the second}} time, on 20 September 1858, to Adeline de Horsey, {{achieving}} still greater notoriety {{as he had been}} conducting an affair with her as his wife was dying. This, however, was a happy union, notwithstanding the disparity in their ages and Cardigan's disappointment that there were, again, no children. Adeline, excluded from fashionable society {{for the rest of her}} days, accustomed herself to life in the country, happily forsaking her previous interests of books, painting and music, while Brudenell spent <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money making their home together comfortable. Adeline even remained on good terms with Brudenell's principal mistress, Maria Marchioness of Ailesbury, and tolerated his other affairs.|$|E
5|$|As her {{relationship}} with Mike progresses, Susan becomes suspicious of his past, especially when she finds a gun and <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money in his kitchen cabinets. Additionally, evidence connecting Mike {{to the murder of}} Wisteria Lane resident, Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook), surfaces. Susan ends the relationship when police inform her that Mike was convicted of manslaughter and drug trafficking. However, Susan learns the murder was accidental and the two renew their relationship and agree that Mike will move into Susan's house. While Mike is away on business, Susan finds Zach, armed with a handgun, in Mike's house. He vows to kill Mike when he comes home as he believes Mike killed Paul.|$|E
5|$|As his sixtieth {{birthday}} {{approached in}} 1939, Beecham was advised by his doctors {{to take a}} year's break from conducting, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate, leaving the orchestra in other hands. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, while he strove to secure {{the future of the}} orchestra, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. The original LPO company was liquidated and Beecham raised <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money for the orchestra, helping its members to form themselves into a self-governing body.|$|E

5|$|As his sixtieth {{birthday}} approached, Beecham {{was advised}} by his doctors {{to take a}} year's complete break from music, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate. The Australian Broadcasting Commission had been seeking for several years {{to get him to}} conduct in Australia. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, striving instead to secure the future of the London Philharmonic, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. Before leaving, Beecham raised <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money for the orchestra and helped its members to form themselves into a self-governing company.|$|E
5|$|Delacroix, who was of French origin, met {{the king}} in Paris {{as a young}} girl, {{when she was only}} 16 and he was 65. At that time, she earned her living as a prostitute. They soon {{embarked}} upon a relationship that was to last until his death in 1909. Leopold lavished upon her <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, Baroness Vaughan. Because of these presents, Caroline was deeply unpopular both among the Belgian people and internationally, as Leopold became increasingly criticized for his greed-induced actions in the Congo Free State, his own personal colony. As Caroline largely profited off the income from the colony, she became known as La reine du Congo (“the Queen of Congo”).|$|E
5|$|Ramírez Treviño was {{an active}} {{participant}} and coordinator of cocaine and marijuana shipments heading to the United States from Mexico. He is also involved in moving <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> money from drug sales heading back to Mexico from the U.S. through the Reynosa corridor. He was also the leader of Los Metros, a Gulf Cartel subgroup. In 2008, {{he was charged with}} a federal indictment in the District of Columbia for violations of Title 21 USC Sections 959, 960, 963, and Title 18 USC Section 2. The United States Department of State was offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction. Mexico, however, did not have him on its most-wanted list and was not offering any financial reward for information leading to his arrest.|$|E

50|$|Alexander had {{entrusted}} him {{to build}} the new city of Alexandria. Cleomenes informed the people of Canopus, then the chief emporium of Egypt, that he must move them to the new city. To avert such an evil they provided him with a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> money. But, as the building of Alexandria advanced, he again demanded {{that the people of}} Canopus pay him a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> money, which they could not pay. So this provided him with the excuse for removing them.|$|R
