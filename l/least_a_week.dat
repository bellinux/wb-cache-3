5|$|In some {{countries}} {{a highlight of}} the year for Scouts is spending at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> in the summer engaging in an outdoor activity. This can be a camping, hiking, sailing, or other trip with the unit, or a summer camp with broader participation (at the council, state, or provincial level). Scouts attending a summer camp work on Scout badges, advancement, and perfecting Scoutcraft skills. Summer camps can operate specialty programs for older Scouts, such as sailing, backpacking, canoeing and whitewater, caving, and fishing.|$|E
5|$|Most of Acapulco {{remained}} {{closed for}} at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> after the hurricane. Initially, authorities around Acapulco gave preference {{to clean up}} tourist areas, {{which resulted in the}} scenic highway from the hotels to the airport being quickly fixed. Tourism greatly decreased following the hurricane, causing some hotels to charge 40percent less than normal in an attempt to bring people back. One airline offered two plane tickets for the price of one from Mexico City to Acapulco. Most hotels were almost completely back to normal around a month after the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|On Athas, {{the planet}} of the Dark Sun {{campaign}} setting, dwarves stand less than 5' tall and weigh nearly 200lbs. Each dwarf pursues a singular obsession, called a focus, that requires at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> to complete. Athasian dwarves do not live underground, but some communities focus on unearthing long-lost dwarven strongholds. Physically, the dwarves of Athas are unique among their kind, having no hair at all. Athasian dwarves can breed with humans to produce muls, who are sterile offsprings that share the strength and resiliency of dwarves {{with the size of}} humans.|$|E

50|$|The first On Stage Sunday strip was {{launched}} February 10, 1957.

5|$|Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always underground. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa {{the song}} {{is based on an}} almost pure tone at 3.5 kiloHertz, loud enough to make the ground vibrate 20cm all round the burrow; in fact {{the song is}} unique in each species. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the burrow is {{somewhat}} roughly sculpted; in Gryllotalpa vineae, the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. In both species the burrow {{takes the form of a}} double exponential horn with twin openings at the soil surface; at the other end there is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, and then an escape tunnel. A burrow is used for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> The male positions himself head down with his head in the bulb, his tail near the fork in the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Clock shifts {{were found}} to {{increase}} the risk of heart attack by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks. A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise in the weeks after the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season. A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition. A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> afterward. In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of the winter storm was anticipated by forecasters for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> It originated in a shortwave trough—a weather disturbance in the upper atmosphere—that came ashore at the Pacific Northwest on January 19. The trough strengthened as it moved southeastward through the Great Plains, and on January 21 it spawned a weak low-pressure area over central Texas. The incipient storm system began to intensify as it tracked eastward through the Gulf Coast states, triggering a line of strong to severe thunderstorms and multiple tornado warnings.|$|E
25|$|If a bowler {{is injured}} during an over and cannot {{complete}} it, another bowler must bowl the remaining deliveries in that over. The bowler chosen {{to finish the}} over must not be the bowler who bowled the previous over, and must not bowl the over immediately following either. A substitute bowler will take over the fielding spot vacated by the deputising bowler. If the bowler is hit on the head, he will be immediately removed {{from the field and}} be stood down from playing for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> An injured or sick bowler may also choose to bowl only, meaning the batting lineup is effectively one player short.|$|E
25|$|Other {{treatments}} include lindane, benzyl benzoate, crotamiton, malathion, and sulfur preparations. Lindane is effective, but {{concerns over}} potential neurotoxicity have limited its availability in many countries. It is banned in California, {{but may be}} used in other states as a second-line treatment. Sulfur ointments or benzyl benzoate are often used in the developing world due to their low cost; Some 10% sulfur solutions {{have been shown to be}} effective, and sulfur ointments are typically used for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> though many people find the odor of sulfur products unpleasant. Crotamiton has been found to be less effective than permethrin in limited studies. Crotamiton or sulfur preparations are sometimes recommended instead of permethrin for children, due to concerns over dermal absorption of permethrin.|$|E

25|$|Deepavali in Fiji {{is often}} remarked by people from India as being {{observed}} {{on a larger}} scale than in India, as fireworks and Deepavali related events begin at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> before the actual day. Another unique feature is the cultural celebration of Deepavali (aside from its traditionally religious celebration) where Fijians of Indian origin or Indo-Fijians, whether Hindu, Christian, Sikh or even Muslim along with the other cultural groups in Fiji celebrate Deepavali as a time for sharing with friends and family as well as signalling the beginning of the Holiday season in Fiji. On the commercial side, Deepavali is a time for many retail sales and giveaways. Deepavali celebrations in Fiji have taken on a flair of its own, markedly different from celebrations on the Subcontinent.|$|E

In Labasa, two people were arrested for breaking curfew and others were reprimanded. The main airport serving the country, Nadi International Airport, was closed {{as a result of the}} cyclone. It was re-opened two days after the storm to allow the humanitarian supplies to be received and tourists to leave. The nation's government deployed two ships to Koro Island carrying assessment teams and emergency supplies. Rakiraki Town was shut down to travel at 7:30a.m. local time on 23February to allow crews to clear debris from roads.|$|E

25|$|With Jake Delhomme {{out for the}} 2007 season due to {{an elbow}} injury he {{suffered}} in a Week 3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, and David Carr out with a sore back, the Panthers signed Testaverde on October 10, 2007. Testaverde, wearing #16, started his first game with the team on October 14, 2007 against the Arizona Cardinals. In that game he threw a 65-yard touchdown pass to Steve Smith, extending his NFL record to 21 consecutive seasons with a touchdown pass. After leading the Panthers to a 25-10 victory, the 43-year-old became the oldest starting quarterback to win a game in NFL history, and the third-oldest to start one. He has also thrown touchdown passes to 71 different players, also a record. On Sunday October 28, coach John Fox named Testaverde the starting quarterback against the Indianapolis Colts. In that game, Testaverde led the Panthers in the longest opening drive for a touchdown in franchise history, consisting of 18 plays and lasting for 11 minutes and one second. Despite winning time of possession {{in the first half}} of the game, the Panthers entered the locker room under a 3-point deficit. In the second half, Testaverde left the field with a strained Achilles tendon, and was replaced by former Houston Texans quarterback David Carr. Ultimately, the Panthers lost 31-7. Reports said that Testaverde would be out for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
