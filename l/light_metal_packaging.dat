5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characterisations of heavy metals {{need to be}} treated with caution, as the metals involved are not always consistently defined. As well as being relatively dense, heavy metals tend to be less reactive than <b>lighter</b> <b>metals</b> and have much less soluble sulfides and hydroxides. While it is relatively easy to distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a <b>lighter</b> <b>metal</b> such as sodium, a few heavy metals, such as zinc, mercury, and lead, have some of the characteristics of <b>lighter</b> <b>metals,</b> and, <b>lighter</b> <b>metals</b> such as beryllium, scandium, and titanium, have some of the characteristics of heavier metals.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Studies show that, for viable product {{realisation}} and maintenance, {{a spectrum}} of novel processing technologies and materials to improve performance and reduce costs and environmental impact must constantly be addressed. One of these technologies, namely the cold spray process has enabled {{a broad range of}} coatings and applications, including many that have not been previously possible or commercially practical, hence its potential for new <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> applications. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to highlight some advantages of this technology and explore how the cold spray process could be used to repair <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> unserviceable components and develop new <b>light</b> <b>metals</b> including <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> porous structures...|$|R

50|$|Some general {{physical}} and chemical properties of <b>light</b> and heavy <b>metals</b> are summarised in the table. The comparison should be treated with caution since the terms <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> and heavy metal are not always consistently defined. Also the physical properties of hardness and tensile strength can vary widely depending on purity, grain size and pre-treatment.These properties make it relatively easy to distinguish a <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> like sodium from a heavy metal like tungsten, but the differences become less clear at the boundaries. <b>Light</b> structural <b>metals</b> like beryllium, scandium, and titanium have some of the characteristics of heavy metals, such as higher melting points; post-transition heavy metals like zinc, cadmium, and lead have some of the characteristics of <b>light</b> <b>metals,</b> such as being relatively soft, having lower melting points, and forming mainly colourless complexes.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe have {{constructed}} a 2 dimensional probabilistic model {{to estimate the}} short-term dietary exposure of UK consumers to any generalised migrant from coated <b>light</b> <b>metal</b> food <b>packaging.</b> Using 3 UK National Dietary and Nutrition Surveys (NDNS) comprising 4 - 7 day dietary surveys for different age and gender groups, actual body weights and survey years, a sample representative of the dietary consumption of the UK population was obtained, comprising around 4200 food items. Interrogation of the raw data showed that the per capita consumption of food and beverage for an adult was 2. 9 kg/person/day, being comparable with the USFDA value of 3 kg. The packaging type of each food item was assigned from the survey descriptions or, by sampling from distributions based upon market share information and expert judgement. Each food item {{was assigned to the}} relevant food simulant, A (aqueous), B (acidic) or D (fatty) so that simulant migration data could be used. The exposure model was used to evaluate exposure for a given level of migration and, conversely, the level of migration that could be tolerated whilst keeping within a target threshold exposure level. As examples, migration at 10 mg/dm² into fatty foods only resulted in an exposure ranging from 0. 06 to 0. 22 ug/kg body (actual) weight/day depending on the scenario. The model revealed that if migration from metal coatings was into fatty foods only, migration in the range 1. 83 to 4. 95 µg/dm 2 (97. 5 th percentile, depending on the scenario) would give an exposure of less than 1. 5 µg per person per day. This is a toxicological threshold limit used in the USA. If migration into simulants A and B is also considered to be at the same level as that for simulant D, then the level of migration for the threshold to be reached is, not surprisingly, lower at (0. 64 – 0. 87 ug/dm²) than that if migration were into fatty foods only. In this case, clearly, the main contributors to the exposure were foodstuffs represented by simulants A and B because of their importance in the diet. These estimates are based on 4 - or 7 -days food diaries and chronic exposure over the long term would be expected to be lower...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The CAST Cooperative Research Centre was {{established}} in 1993 as {{a joint venture between}} industry, research and government partners to carry out research and development in the area of <b>light</b> <b>metals.</b> Over the thirteen years since its formation CAST has developed a world class research program and, in addition to the significant application of outcomes by our industry partners, much of our research is being commercialised. In addition, CAST has developed a significant education and training program, a best practice technology transfer program for small and medium enterprises, consulting and design activities and established an alliance with Advanced Magnesium Technologies as a provider of their research and development needs. The development of CAST has been achieved by cooperation between all our partners who represent most of the <b>light</b> <b>metals</b> research groups and a significant proportion of <b>light</b> <b>metals</b> industries in Australia. The close involvement of the industry partners in all aspects of the operation of CAST has ensured we have a program of activities focused on delivering benefits to Australia’s <b>light</b> <b>metals</b> industry. This paper presents an overview of the magnesium research undertaken by CAST and other research groups such as the Centre of Excellence in Design of <b>Light</b> <b>Metals</b> and the CSIRO including their <b>Light</b> <b>Metals</b> Flagship program. Some highlights are new magnesium powertrain alloys, an alloy suitable for decorative and domestic applications called AM-lite, and new CSIRO casting technologies T-Mag and a twin roll strip casting process...|$|R
