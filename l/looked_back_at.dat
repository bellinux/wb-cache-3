5|$|Waterloo was {{a decisive}} battle {{in more than}} one sense. Every {{generation}} in Europe up to the outbreak of the First World War <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Waterloo as the turning point that dictated the course of subsequent world history. In retrospect, it was seen as the event that ushered in the Concert of Europe, an era characterised by relative peace, material prosperity and technological progress. The battle definitively ended the series of wars that had convulsed Europe, and involved many other regions of the world, since the French Revolution of the early 1790s. It also ended the First French Empire and the political and military career of Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the greatest commanders and statesmen in history.|$|E

25|$|Tom Ridge: I’m {{familiar}} with his claims. I’m not {{familiar with}} how accurate they are. This is a global scourge. It’s really a case of first impression for everybody. As {{secretary of homeland security}} after 9/11, I dare say America was confronted with a set of challenges it had never seen before and we acted with what we thought was in the best interest for securing America. We also <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll just leave it at that. We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take too many people to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, WWE {{produced}} a DVD called The Monday Night Wars. Two hours in length, the DVD left {{out a large}} portion of the wars, breaking off around 1997 before jumping straight to the post-WCW era of WWE. The objectivity of the DVD's content was questioned, as some believed the documentary was simply telling the WWE side of the story. On August 25, 2009, WWE released The Rise and Fall of WCW on DVD. The DVD <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the roots of WCW during the days of GCW and Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, to the glory days of Monday Nitro and the nWo, and to its demise and sale to WWE. This DVD included several new interviews from Vince McMahon, Jim Crockett, Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Bill Goldberg, as well as many of those responsible for running the NWA and WCW. Archive interviews were included from former WCW talent such as Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff, due to their respective contracts with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling not allowing them to provide fresh interviews for WWE. In 2014, WWE Network released a new documentary series, The Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW, covering a much broader scope of the wars than the previous Monday Night Wars DVD, as well as providing more equal viewpoints for both WWE and WCW.|$|E

Now he was charged with emotion.” When the convoy reached a train crossing, Nghĩa said that Nhung “lunged at Nhu with a bayonet and stabbed him again and again, maybe fifteen or twenty times. Still in a rage, he turned to Diệm, took out his revolver and shot him in the head. Then he <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Nhu, who was lying on the floor, twitching.

500|$|Other critics found {{a variety}} of Judeo-Christian analogies. Devils Tower {{parallels}} Mount Sinai, the aliens as God and Roy Neary as Moses. Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments is seen on television at the Neary household. Some found close relations between Elijah and Roy; Elijah was taken into a [...] "chariot of fire", akin to Roy going in the UFO. Climbing Devils Tower behind the faltering Jillian, Neary exhorts Jillian to keep moving and not to look back, similar to Lot's wife who <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Sodom {{and turned into a}} pillar of salt. Spielberg explained, [...] "I wanted to make Close Encounters a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life, and throws it into complete upheaval as he starts to become more and more obsessed with this experience." ...|$|E
500|$|After losing out on {{the role}} of Lois Lane in two {{previous}} films about Superman, Adams secured the part in Zack Snyder's 2013 reboot, Man of Steel, starring Henry Cavill as the titular superhero. She played Lane with a mixture of toughness and vulnerability, but Peter Bradshaw thought that the character was [...] "sketchily conceived" [...] and criticized her lack of chemistry with Cavill. Even so, the film earned over $660 million to become one of her biggest box-office hits. Adams next featured in Her, a drama from the writer-director Spike Jonze about a lonely man (Joaquin Phoenix) who falls in love with an operating system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson); Adams played his close friend. She had unsuccessfully auditioned for Jonze's 2009 film Where the Wild Things Are and was hired for Her after Jonze <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> those tapes. Adams was drawn to the idea of portraying a platonic male-female friendship, which she believed was rare in film.|$|E
500|$|The {{first officer}} {{described}} the snowfall as [...] "not heavy, no large flakes." [...] He told authorities that snow was sliding off the jet and {{the nose of}} the airplane was coated in a watery layer. He used a light positioned on the wing of his jet to check for signs of ice several times before they attempted to take off. Neither he or the pilot saw any evidence of contamination on the wing or on the black strip and therefore decided against a third deicing. He told investigators that he checked the wings [...] "maybe 10 times, but at least 3." [...] He said that he did not consider the snowfall heavy, and he did not recall any wind blowing the snow. The first officer stated that as they taxied, they <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the wings several times. Near the time of the takeoff, he said [...] "looks good to me, black strip is clear." ...|$|E

500|$|References to Shaun of the Dead {{are also}} present in the film. In one scene, Nicholas wants to chase a {{shoplifter}} by jumping over garden fences; however, Danny is reluctant. Nicholas says, [...] "What's the matter, Danny? You never taken a shortcut before?" [...] He smiles assuredly before jumping over {{three in a row}} (according to the DVD commentary, Pegg vaulted over three fences, and a stunt man did a back flip over the fourth). When Danny attempts it, he trips and falls through the fence. This is almost identical to a scene in Shaun of the Dead, including the fall-through-fence gag, albeit with the pratfalling role reverse: in Shaun of the Dead it happens to Pegg's character rather than Frost's, and he falls over the fence rather than through it. The DVD commentary says that Frost purposely <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the camera after crashing through the fence, to show that he had done the stunt rather than someone else.|$|E
500|$|Following the Art for Freedom initiative, Madonna {{began work}} on her {{thirteen}}th studio album, collaborating with Avicii, Diplo and Kanye West, among others. In December 2014, thirteen demos recorded for the album leaked onto the Internet. She posted in response {{that half of the}} tracks would not be used on the final release, while the other half had [...] "changed and evolved". Titled Rebel Heart, the album was released in March 2015. Introspection was also listed as one of the foundational themes prevalent on the record, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. Music critics responded positively towards the album, calling it her best effort in a decade. Rebel Heart became Madonna's first album to miss the top position of the Billboard 200 since Ray of Light, but it reached number one in other major music markets, including Australia, Canada, Germany and Italy.|$|E
500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
