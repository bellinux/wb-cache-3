40|$|Background: A human ribosomal protein L 9 (RPL 9) encodes {{a protein}} {{that is a}} {{component}} of the 60 S subunit. RPL 9 is located on chromosome 4 p 14 and is approximately 5. 5 kb in length and contains 8 exons. The message for human RPL 9 is 712 nucleotides long. Some of the functions of RPL 9 documented so far include the crucial involvement of the gene product in cell proliferation and protein biosynthesis. Lipoic acid synthetase (<b>LIAS)</b> is a 1. 73 kb gene also located at chromosome 4 p 14. Alternative splicing occurs at these locus and two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified but in this study the results represents both isoforms together. The protein encoded by <b>LIAS</b> gene belongs to the biotin and lipoic acid synthetases family and localizes in the mitochondrion. Function of lipoic acid synthetase is not yet well documented. Some studies have attempted to characterise its function by looking at the biological pathways at which <b>LIAS</b> gene product plays a crucial role, for example the biosynthesis of alpha-lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is a natural antioxidant and it is also naturally-occurring enzyme co-factor found in a number of multi-enzyme complexes regulating oxidative metabolism. Motivation for study: RPL 9 and <b>LIAS</b> were previously found to be mutated in CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cell lines and these mutant lines had gained resistance to apoptosis. Aim: The main objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the expression pattern of RPL 9 and <b>LIAS</b> in lung cancer and to characterise their role in apoptosis and also to determine if the expression pattern of this genes varies between normal and diseased state of the tissue. Methods: In Situ hybridization, quantitative Real Time PCR, TUNEL and Bio-informatics have been employed in order to attain the objectives of this study. Results: In Situ hybridization showed that RPL 9 localises in the cytoplasm and it is up-regulated in lung cancer relative to normal lung. <b>LIAS</b> localises in the cytoplasm and it is also up-regulated in lung cancer. The expression of RPL 9 was relatively higher than that of <b>LIAS</b> determined by the intensity of localisation. Quantitative real time PCR confirmed the up-regulation of RPL 9 and <b>LIAS</b> in lung cancer. RPL 9 and <b>LIAS</b> were found to be up-regulated 8 and 4 fold respectively in lung A 549 lung adenocarcinoma relative to MRC 5 normal lung fibroblast cell lines. TUNEL showed the highest DNA fragmentation in adenocarcinoma, followed by squamous cell lung carcinoma then large cell lung carcinoma which is the same pattern observed in RPL 9 and <b>LIAS</b> mRNA localisation by In Situ hybridization. To further characterise the role of RPL 9 and <b>LIAS</b> in human, Bio-informatics tools were used and the results revealed that RPL 9 is highly conserved through evolution, up-to 100...|$|R

40|$|For the {{interpretation}} of the line radiation observed from laser induced ablation spectroscopy (<b>LIAS)</b> such parameters as the density and temperature of electrons within very compact clouds of atoms and singly charged ions of ablated material have to be known. Compared to the local plasma conditions prior to the laser pulse, these can be strongly changed during <b>LIAS</b> since new electrons are generated by the ionisation of particles ejected from the irradiated target. Because of their transience and spatial inhomogeneity it is technically difficult to measure disturbances induced in the plasma by <b>LIAS.</b> To overcome this uncertainty a numerical model has been elaborated, providing a self-consistent description for the spreading of ablated particles and accompanying modifications in the plasma. The results of calculations for <b>LIAS</b> performed on carbon-containing targets in Ohmic and additionally heated discharges in the tokamak TEXTOR are presented. Due to the increase in the electron density the 'ionisation per photon' ratio, S/XB factor, is significantly enhanced compared to unperturbed plasma conditions. The impact of the amount of material ablated and of the plasma conditions before <b>LIAS</b> on the level of the S/XB-enhancement is investigated...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus mutans, a major oral {{pathogen}} {{responsible for}} dental caries formation, possesses {{a variety of}} mechanisms for survival in the human oral cavity, where {{the conditions of the}} external environment are diverse and {{in a constant state of}} flux. The formation of biofilms, survival under conditions of acidic pH, and production of mutacins are considered to be important virulence determinants displayed by this organism. Biofilm formation is facilitated by the production of GbpC, an important cell surface-associated protein that binds to glucan, an adhesive polysaccharide produced by the organism itself. To better understand the nature of the environmental cues that induce GbpC production, we examined the roles of 14 sensor kinases in the expression of gbpC in S. mutans strain UA 159. We found that only the <b>LiaS</b> sensor kinase regulates gbpC expression, while the other sensor kinases had little or no effect on gbpC expression. We also found that while <b>LiaS</b> negatively regulates gbpC expression, the inactivation of its cognate response regulator, LiaR, does not appear to affect the expression of gbpC. Since both gbpC expression and mutacin IV production are regulated by a common regulatory network, we also tested the effect of the <b>liaS</b> mutation on mutacin production and found that <b>LiaS</b> positively regulates mutacin IV production. Furthermore, reverse transcription-PCR analysis suggests that <b>LiaS</b> does so by regulating the expression of nlmA, which encodes a peptide component of mutacin IV, and nlmT, which encodes an ABC transporter. As with the expression of gbpC, LiaR did not have any apparent effect on mutacin IV production. Based on the results of our study, we speculate that <b>LiaS</b> is engaged in cross talk with one or more response regulators belonging to the same family as LiaR, enabling <b>LiaS</b> to regulate the expression of several genes coding for virulence factors...|$|R

40|$|Australia {{has more}} than 70, 000 {{kilometres}} of coastline, 7000 km of those in Queensland. The beach has long occupied {{a special place in}} the Australian identity. The beaches are not only important to the Australian people but they are also a highly valuable tourist resource and with the number of tourists visiting the Gold Coast steadily increasing each year, determining their carrying capacity is an essential factor for their effective use and management. This study explored the concept of social carrying capacity, as well as the way Gold Coast beaches are used by locals and visitors. For the social carrying capacity concepts, several user counts using beach web camera images and more than 160 personal interviews were conducted at four different Gold Coast beaches, exploring coastal perception and beach usage. Preliminary results have revealed details including that while the majority of people surveyed thought beach crowds were perfect in their current state, 79 % of the remaining respondents indicated carrying capacity had already been exceeded; that is that with Gold Coast beaches were perceived as either over-crowded or that they could do with fewer people.

Aims To describe {{the performance and}} methodological approach in a retrospective data collection effort (19972001), through an international network of surveillance systems, aiming to collect publicly available, comparable and reliable data on antibiotic use in Europe. Methods A central multidisciplinary management team co-ordinated a network of national representatives, <b>liasing</b> with national data providers and bodies responsible for antibiotic policy. The data collected were screened for bias, using a checklist. We focused on detection bias in sample and census data; errors in assigning medicinal product packages to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC); errors in calculations of defined daily doses (DDD) per package; bias by over-the-counter sales and parallel trade; and bias in ambulatory care (AC) /hospital care (HC) mix. Datasets were corrected after national feedback, and classified as valid; valid but with minor bias; not valid. Results Of the 31 participating countries, 21 countries delivered AC data suitable for cross-national comparison (14 for all 5 years). Of these, 17 countries provided data on a quarterly basis for at least 1 year. For HC, 14 countries were able to deliver valid data (nine for all 5 years). A valid estimate of the total exposure of national populations to human antibiotic consumption could be made in 17 countries. Conclusion In cross-national comparisons of antibiotic consumption in Europe, methodological rigour in correcting for various sources of bias and checking the validity of ATC/DDD assignment is needed...|$|E

This year, a total of 217 high-quality papers were submitted by researchers and practitioners from about 20 countries. All the submissions were rigorously reviewed by the Program Committee members. To ensure fairness {{and the quality of the}} papers, we put a number of measures in place. For example, each paper was assigned at least one reviewer from Australia, one reviewer from America, and one reviewer from Europe. Based on the originality, significance, correctness, relevance, and clarity of presentation, 56 submissions were selected as regular papers and 12 were selected as short papers. The acceptation rate is 32 %. Also, the authors of accepted papers were required to submit a read-me file along with the camera-ready version of their paper explaining how the reviewers comments were taken into account in the final version of their paper. The publication Co-chairs, Lucian Finta (Paris XIII, France) and Jemal H. Abawajy (Deakin University, Australia), painstakingly went through each read-me file and reviewers' comments to ensure that the comments were indeed incorporated into the final version of the papers. Only those papers that included reviewers' comments were finally accepted for inclusion in the proceedings. Undoubtedly, Lucian and Jemal had to work long hours to meet the tight deadline, which is greatly appreciated. The overall outcome of the revision process is a selection of papers that showcase the very best of grid and pervasive computing technology today. After the conference, the proceedings editors selected and recommended some highquality papers from the GPC 2007 conference to be published in special issues of international journals. Special thanks go to Jemal H. Abawajy for <b>liasing</b> with the chief editors of the journals.

40|$|Can a {{corporate}} Wiki support knowledge work? Do organisational culture and leadership styles affect {{the suitability of}} corporate Wikis for all organisations? What factors contribute to Wiki failure and what steps {{can be taken to}} reduce the rejection of Wikis? The success or failure of any corporate Wiki project is dependent on having these difficult questions answered. This thesis describes a comparative study of six Australian and British organisations to discover the potential for corporate Wikis to support knowledge work in organisations. Since Information Systems (IS) is dynamic and subject to continuing changes, conventional empirical methods, such as surveys and questionnaires are inappropriate for many of the issues IS researchers need to address in the study of IS in organisations. Hence, a multi-method approach using case study research, participative action research (PAR) and Activity Theory is more effective. The research focus in this thesis relies on a mix of data gathering approaches including selfadministered questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and observation. The title and the research questions of the thesis evolved as a result of two years of research, paper publications, valuable critique from colleagues and ongoing reflection on the number of issues posed by Enterprise 2. 0 technologies such as Wikis, blogs, podcasts, social bookmarking to support knowledge work in the work environment. The research study was conducted in two phases. Phase One of the research study aimed to study the introduction and testing of corporate Wikis in two primary cases, a knowledge intensive organisation and a non-governmental organisation in Australia. Seizing the opportunity to implement the corporate Wikis in these two organisations, it was decided to set up these two primary cases as PAR projects because the researcher will be actively <b>liasing</b> {{with other members of the}} corporate Wiki project building and testing the corporate Wiki. Case studies will be built up throughout the research process from the initial design to the final presentation of results and discussion of the project members’ action implications. Phase Two comprised of four supporting cases of corporate Wiki usage in successful learning organisations. They consisted of a public utilities company, a global research and development company and a marketing and technology consulting company from the U. K. The fourth supporting case was a government organisation from Australia. The aim of Phase Two research study was to explore how and why do enterprises adopt and use corporate Wikis, so as to investigate the causal issues that contribute to corporate Wiki adoption/implementation success. Data was gathered through email questionnaires and semi-structured interviews and formulated into case studies and findings interpreted. The novelty of this work lies in applying Activity Theory to uncover the hidden activities of knowledge work so that organisations can determine what knowledge is of value and how to acquire, access and disseminate organisational knowledge. This work contributes to the body of work in Knowledge Management that sees technology as a social technical system. It argues that the corporate Wiki is capable of developing improved knowledge capabilities to answer to the basic challenge facing many organisations today, which is how to acquire, access and disseminate organisational knowledge capture, in particular tacit knowledge, to fulfil requirements of their clients and staff, while improving the quality of its products and services within the constraints of a fixed resource base. Research findings have uncovered the salient features of successful Wiki adoption methods so that it can provide guidance to organisations which are embarking on corporate Wiki implementation projects. Based on the Activity Theory analysis and empirical research, it is observed that learning organisations are successful in Wiki adoption and implementation because they have an open culture, supportive leadership style, and allow technology to be user-driven. The corporate Wiki is proposed to be the next generation Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) to meet the urgency and demand for a more rigorous approach to the exploitation of knowledge as an organisational resource...|$|E
40|$|Thank you Chairman I {{would like}} to extend a warm welcome to our keynote speakers, David Byrne of the European Commission, Derek Yach from the World Health Organisation, and Paul Quinn {{representing}} Congressman Marty Meehan who sends his apologies. When we include the speakers who will address later sessions, this is, undoubtedly, {{one of the strongest}} teams that have been assembled on tobacco control in Europe. The very strength of the team underlines what I see as a shift – a very necessary shift – in the way we perceive the tobacco issue. For the last twenty years, we have lived out a paradox. It isnÃ‚Â´t a social side issue. I make no apology for the bluntness of what IÃ‚Â´m saying, and will come back, a little later, to the radicalism I believe we need to bring – nationally – to this issue. For starters, though, I want to lay it on the line that what weÃ‚Â´re talking about is an epidemic as deadly as any suffered by human kind throughout the centuries. Slower than some of those epidemics in its lethal action, perhaps. But an epidemic, nonetheless. According to the World Health Organisation tobacco accounted for just over 3 million annual deaths in 1990, rising to 4. 023 million annual deaths in 1998. The numbers of deaths due to tobacco will rise to 8. 4 million in 2020 and reach roughly 10 million annually by 2030. This is quite simply ghastly. Tobacco kills. It kills in many different ways. It kills increasing numbers of women. It does its damage directly and indirectly. For children, much of the damage comes from smoking by adults where children live, study, play and work. The very least {{we should be able to}} offer every child is breathable air. Air that doesnÃ‚Â´t do them damage. WeÃ‚Â´re now seeing a global public health response to the tobacco epidemic. The Tobacco Free Initiative launched by the World Health Organisation was matched by significant tobacco control initiatives throughout the world. During this conference we will hear about the experiences our speakers had in driving these initiatives. This Tobacco Free Initiative poses unique challenges to our legal frameworks at both national and international levels; in particular it raises challenges about the legal context in which tobacco products are traded and asks questions about the impact of commercial speech especially on children, and the extent of the limitations that should be imposed on it. Politicians, supported by economists and lawyers as well as the medical profession, must continue to explore and develop this context to find innovative ways to wrap public health considerations around the trade in tobacco products – very tightly. We also have the right to demand a totally new paradigm from the tobacco industry. Bluntly, the tobacco industry plays the PR game at its cynical worst. The industry sells its products without regard to the harm these products cause. At the same time, to gain social acceptance, it gives donations, endowments and patronage to high profile events and people. Not good enough. This model of behaviour is no longer acceptable in a modern society. We need one where the industry integrates social responsibility and accountability into its day-to-day activities. We have waited for this change in behaviour from the tobacco industry for many decades. Unfortunately the documents disclosed during litigation in the USA and from other sources make very depressing reading; it is clear from them that any trust society placed in the tobacco industry in the past to address the health problems associated with its products was misplaced. This industry appears to lack the necessary leadership to guide it towards just and responsible action. Instead, it chooses evasion, deception and at times illegal activity to protect its profits at any price and to avoid its responsibilities to society and its customers. It has engaged in elaborate Ã‚Â´spinÃ‚Â´ to generate political tolerance, scientific uncertainty and public acceptance of its products. Legislators must act now. I see no reason why the global community should continue to wait. Effective legal controls must be laid on this errant industry. We should also keep these controls under review at regular intervals and if they are failing to achieve the desired outcomes we should be prepared to amend them. In Ireland, as Minister for Health and Children, I launched a comprehensive tobacco control policy entitled “Towards a Tobacco Free Society“. OTT?Excessive?Unrealistic? On the contrary – I believe it to be imperative and inevitable. I honestly hold that, given the range of fatal diseases caused by tobacco use we have little alternative but to pursue the clear objective of creating a tobacco free society. Aiming at a tobacco free society means ensuring public and political opinion are properly informed. It requires help to be given to smokers to break the addiction. It demands that people are protected against environmental tobacco smoke and children are protected from any inducement to experiment with this product. Over the past year we have implemented a number of measures which will support these objectives; we have established an independent Office of Tobacco Control, we have introduced free nicotine replacement therapy for low-income earners, we have extended our existing prohibitions on tobacco advertising to the print media with some minor derogations for international publications. We have raised the legal age at which a person can be sold tobacco products to eighteen years. We have invested substantially more funds in health promotion activities and we have mounted sustained information campaigns. We have engaged in sponsorship arrangements, which are new and innovative for public bodies. I have provided health boards with additional resources to let them mount a sustained inspection and enforcement service. Health boards will engage new Directors of Tobacco Control responsible for coordinating each health boardÃ‚Â´s response and for <b>liasing</b> with the Tobacco Control Agency I set up earlier this year. Most recently, I have published a comprehensive Bill – The Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001. This Bill will, among other things, end all forms of product display and in-store advertising and will require all retailers to register with the new Tobacco Control Agency. Ten packs of cigarettes will be banned and transparent and independent testing procedures of tobacco products will be introduced. Enforcement officers will be given all the necessary powers to ensure there is full compliance with the law. On smoking in public places we will extend the existing areas covered and it is proposed that I, as Minister for Health and Children, will have the powers to introduce further prohibitions in public places such as pubs and the work place. I will also provide for the establishment of a Tobacco Free Council to advise and assist on an ongoing basis. I believe the measures already introduced and those additional ones proposed in the Bill have widespread community support. In fact, youÃ‚Â´re going to hear a detailed presentation from the MRBI which will amply illustrate the extent of this support. The great thing is that the support comes from smokers and non-smokers alike. Bottom line, Ladies and Gentlemen, is that we are at a watershed. As a society (if youÃ‚Â´ll allow me to play with a popular phrase) weÃ‚Â´ve realised itÃ‚Â´s time to Ã‚Â´wake up and smell the cigarettes. Ã‚Â´ Smell them. See them for what they are. And get real about destroying their hold on our people. The MRBI survey makes it clear that the single strongest weapon we have when it comes to preventing the habit among young people is price. Simple as that. Price. Up to now, the fear of inflation has been a real impediment to increasing taxes on tobacco. It sounds a serious, logical argument. Until you take it out and look at it a little more closely. Weigh it, as it were, in two hands. I believe – and I believe this with a great passion – that we must take cigarettes out of the equation we use when awarding wage increases. I am calling on IBEC and ICTU, on employers and trade unions alike, to move away from any kind of tolerance of a trade that is killing our citizens. At one point in industrial history, cigarettes were a staple of the workingmanÃ‚Â´s life. So it was legitimate to include them in the Ã‚Â´basketÃ‚Â´ of goods that goes to make up the Consumer Price Index. It isnÃ‚Â´t legitimate to include them any more. Today, IÃ‚Â´m saying that society collectively must take the step to remove cigarettes from the basket of normality, from the list of elements which constitute necessary consumer spending. IÃ‚Â´m saying: “We can no longer delude ourselves. We must exclude cigarettes from the considerations we address in central wage bargaining. We must price cigarettes out of the reach of the children those cigarettes will kill. ” Right now, in the monthly Central Statistics Office reports on consumer spending, the figures include cigarettes. But – right down at the bottom of the page – thereÃ‚Â´s another figure. Calculated without including cigarettes. I believe that if we continue to use the first figure as our constant measure, it will be an indictment of us as legislators, as advocates for working people, as public health professionals. If, on the other hand, we move to the use of the second figure, we will be sending out a message of startling clarity to the nation. We will be saying “We donÃ‚Â´t count an addictive, killer drug as part of normal consumer spending. ” Taking cigarettes out of the basket used to determine the Consumer Price Index will take away the inflation argument. It will not be easy, in its implications for the social partners. But it is morally inescapable. We must do it. Because it will help us stop the killer that is tobacco. If we can do it, we will give so much extra strength to health educators and the new Tobacco Control Association. This new organisation of young people who already have branches in over fifteen counties, is represented here today. The young adults who make up its membership are well placed to advise children of the dangers of tobacco addiction in a way that older generations cannot. It would strengthen their hand if cigarettes move – in price terms – out of the easy reach of our children Finally, I {{would like to}} commend so many public health advocates who have shown professional and indeed personal courage in their commitment to this critical public health issue down through the years. We need you to continue to challenge and confront this grave public health problem and to repudiate the questionable science of the tobacco industry. The Research Institute for a Tobacco Free Society represents a new and dynamic form of partnership between government and civil society. It will provide an effective platform to engage and mobilise the many different professional and academic skills necessary to guide and challenge us. I wish the conference every success...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc) is a {{connective tissue}} disease characterized by fibrosis {{of the skin}} and organs. Increase in oxidative stress and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) activation promote type I collagen (Col I) production, leading to fibrosis in SSc. Lipoic acid (LA) and its active metabolite dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) are naturally occurring thiols that act as cofactors and antioxidants and are produced by lipoic acid synthetase (<b>LIAS).</b> Our goals {{in this study were}} to examine whether LA and <b>LIAS</b> were deficient in SSc patients and to determine the effect of DHLA on the phenotype of SSc dermal fibroblasts. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a commonly used thiol antioxidant, was included as a comparison. Methods Dermal fibroblasts were isolated from healthy subjects and patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1) and <b>LIAS</b> were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of Col I was measured by immunofluorescence, hydroxyproline assay and quantitative PCR. PDGFR phosphorylation and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) were measured by Western blotting. Student’s t-tests were performed for statistical analysis, and P-values less than 0. 05 with two-tailed analysis were considered statistically significant. Results The expression of LA and <b>LIAS</b> in SSc dermal fibroblasts was lower than normal fibroblasts; however, <b>LIAS</b> was significantly higher in SSc plasma and appeared to be released from monocytes. DHLA lowered cellular oxidative stress and decreased PDGFR phosphorylation, Col I, PAI- 1 and αSMA expression in SSc dermal fibroblasts. It also restored the activities of phosphatases that inactivated the PDGFR. SSc fibroblasts produced lower levels of MMP- 1 and MMP- 3, and DHLA increased them. In contrast, TIMP- 1 levels were higher in SSc, but DHLA had a minimal effect. Both DHLA and NAC increased MMP- 1 activity when SSc cells were stimulated with PDGF. In general, DHLA showed better efficacy than NAC in most cases. Conclusions DHLA acts not only as an antioxidant but also as an antifibrotic because it has the ability to reverse the profibrotic phenotype of SSc dermal fibroblasts. Our study suggests that thiol antioxidants, including NAC, LA, or DHLA, could be beneficial for patients with SSc...|$|R

Three laser-based diagnostics, laser-induced desorption spectroscopy (LIDS), laser-induced ablation spectroscopy (<b>LIAS)</b> and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) are under investigation in Forschungszentrum julich (FZJ) to determine the stored amount of tritium ("tritium retention") and to characterize the layer deposition on the wall components in fusion devices (thickness, composition, growth rate). Demonstration experiments for LIDS, <b>LIAS</b> and LIBS were performed on TEXTOR and in the laboratory. An advanced ITER prototype version of these diagnostics is currently under preparation on TEXTOR based on coaxial laser beam injection and light detection with the possibility to scan certain wall areas in TEXTOR.

40|$|Soil {{bacteria}} {{are exposed to}} constant changes in temperature, moisture, and oxygen content. Additionally, they have to encounter different antimicrobial substances, which are produced by competing bacteria. Those agents often target the bacterial cell envelope, which is an essential structure composed of the cell wall and cell membrane. In order to counteract such life-threatening conditions, bacteria developed signal transducing systems to monitor their environment and to respond signal-specifically to any stress conditions, mostly by differential gene expression. Different principles of signal transducing systems have been evolved: one-component systems (1 CSs), two-component systems (2 CSs), and extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors. Bacillus subtilis is a soil bacterium, which counteracts cell envelope stress by four different 2 CSs (LiaSR, BceRS, PsdRS, and YxdJK) and at least three different ECF sigma factors (σX, σM, and σW). In {{the course of the}} present thesis, the LiaSR 2 CS was investigated in detail. The LiaSR 2 CS of B. subtilis is a cell envelope stress-sensing system that shows a high dynamic range of induction in response to cell wall antibiotics like bacitracin. It provides no resistance against its inducer molecules. Rather, it is a damage-sensing system that maintains the cell envelope integrity under stress conditions. The membrane-anchored histidine kinase (HK) <b>LiaS</b> and its cognate response regulator (RR) LiaR work together with a third protein, LiaF, which was identified as the inhibitor of the 2 CS. Upon induction, the target promoter PliaI is induced by phosphorylated LiaR, leading to the expression of the liaIH-liaGFSR locus, with liaIH as being the most induced genes. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the mechanisms of stimulus perception and signal transduction of the LiaFSR system were analyzed. Therefore, the native stoichiometry of the proteins LiaF, <b>LiaS,</b> and LiaR were determined genetically and biochemically with a resulting ratio of 18 to 4 to 1. We found out that maintaining this specific stoichiometry is crucial for the functionality of the LiaFSR system and thus a proper response to cell envelope stress. Changing the relative protein ratios by the overproduction of either <b>LiaS</b> or LiaR leads to a constitutive activation of the promoter PliaI. These data suggest a non-robust behavior of the LiaFSR system regarding perturbations of its stoichiometry, which stands in contrast to quantitative analyses of other well-known 2 CSs. Furthermore, a HK-independent phosphorylation of the RR LiaR was observed. This happened in each case if the amount of LiaR exceeded those of <b>LiaS,</b> irrespective of the presence or absence of a stimulus. By using growth media supplied with different carbon sources, acetyl phosphate was identified as being the phosphoryl group-donor for LiaR under these conditions. Moreover, by performing a mutagenesis experiment, we obtained genetic evidence that <b>LiaS</b> is a bifunctional HK offering both a kinase and a phosphatase activity. In the second part of this thesis, the liaI promoter was used to generate a protein expression toolbox for the use in B. subtilis, referred to as the LIKE (from the German “Lia-kontrollierte Expression”) system. PliaI is a perfect candidate for driving recombinant protein expression. It is tightly regulated under non-inducing conditions showing no significant basal expression levels. Depending on the inducer molecule concentration, it is induced up to 1000 -fold reaching a maximum already 30 minutes after addition of the inducer. Two expression vectors, an integrative and a replicative one, were constructed consisting of an alternative liaI promoter, which was optimized to enhance promoter strength. Additionally, different B. subtilis expression hosts were generated that possess liaIH deletions to prevent undesired protein production. The feasibility of the LIKE system was evaluated by using gfp and ydfG as reporter genes and bacitracin as inducer molecule. As a result, both proteins were successfully overproduced...|$|R
