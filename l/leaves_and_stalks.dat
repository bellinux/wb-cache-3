60|$|There is a plant, {{called by}} botanists the Fraxinella, {{which has the}} {{peculiar}} property of giving out, from its <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> <b>stalks,</b> a gas which is inflammable. Sometimes, on a very still day, {{when there is no}} wind to blow it away as fast as it is produced, this gas may be ignited by a match, when the plant is growing in the open air. But this is very seldom the case, for the air must be very quiet, and the plant very productive, for enough gas to be found around it to ignite when a flame is applied.|$|E

Baskets, troughs, and tubs of grapes stood in the dim village doorways, stopped the steep and narrow village streets, and had been carrying all day along the roads and lanes. Grapes, split and crushed under foot, lay about everywhere. The child carried in a sling by the laden peasant woman toiling home, was quieted with picked-up grapes; the idiot sunning his big goitre under the leaves of the wooden chalet by the way to the Waterfall, sat Munching grapes; the breath of the cows and goats was redolent of <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> <b>stalks</b> of grapes; the company in every little cabaret were eating, drinking, talking grapes. A pity that no ripe touch of this generous abundance could be given to the thin, hard, stony wine, which after all was made from the grapes! ...|$|E

Instantly our hearts stopped beating and our eyes were turned toward the jungle. There, against the matted <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> <b>stalks,</b> was a mass of yellow and black--half a tiger. In the bright {{sunlight}} we could see it plainly. It had been roused by the noise of the pounding, and was gazing out to see what was the matter. With one united scream, the natives shot away. They scattered; they disappeared utterly and at once. Where they went I know not. We never saw them again. We did not even think of them. Our eyes were set fast upon the black and yellow stripes and the great head. Without volition I grasped my rifle. Irene put her hand upon her weapon, but I whispered to her not to move.|$|E

Parts of wild banana plant (pseudostem, <b>leaves,</b> fronds <b>and</b> banana <b>stalks)</b> were collected from two districts in Jambi Province. Wild banana leaves have similar nutritive value to Napier grass but their dry matter percentage was less than 10 % resulted less benefit for ruminant feed. The mean values for the in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility of pseudostem, fronds, <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> banana <b>stalks</b> were 35 %, 33 %, 26 % and 40 % respectively, while the mean values for the in vitro organic matter (OM) digestibility of pseudostem, fronds, <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> banana <b>stalks</b> were 40 %, 42 %, 34 % and 48 % respectively.

60|$|Grasses contain {{far less}} {{nitrogenous}} matter than do peas or cabbages. The <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> <b>stalks</b> of three common kinds were chopped and boiled {{for some time}} in distilled water. Drops of this decoction (after having stood for 24 hrs.) were placed on six leaves, and acted in a rather peculiar manner, of which other instances will be given in the seventh chapter on the salts of ammonia. After 2 hrs. 30 m. four of the leaves had their blades greatly inflected, but not their exterior tentacles; {{and so it was}} with all six leaves after 24 hrs. Two days afterwards the blades, as well as the few submarginal tentacles which had been inflected, all re-expanded; and much of the fluid on their discs was by this time absorbed. It appears that the decoction strongly excites the glands on the disc, causing the blade to be quickly and greatly inflected; but that the stimulus, differently from what occurs in ordinary cases, does not spread, or only in a feeble degree, to the exterior tentacles.|$|E

60|$|The {{stems of}} the Downy {{branches}} INOE, being rang'd {{in the order}} visible enough to the naked eye, at the distance of IF, or somewhat more, the collateral stalks and leaves (if I may so call those bodies I newly described) are so rang'd, that the leaves or hairy stalks of the one side lie at top, or are incumbent on the stalks of the other, and cross each other, much after the manner express'd in the second Figure of the 22. Scheme, by which means every of those little hooked fibres of the leaved stalk get between the naked stalks, and the stalks being full of knots, and a prety way dis-join'd, so as that the fibres can easily get between them, the two parts are so closely and admirably woven together, that {{it is able to}} impede, for the greatest part, the transcursion of the Air; and though they are so exceeding small, as that the thickness of one of these stalks amounts not to a 500. part of an Inch, yet do they compose so strong a texture, as, notwithstanding the exceeding quick and violent beating of them against the Air, by the strength of the Birds wing, they firmly hold together. And it argues an admirable providence of Nature in the contrivance and fabrick of them; for their texture is such, that though by any external injury the parts of them are violently dis-joyn'd, so as that the <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> <b>stalks</b> touch not one another, and consequently several of these rents would impede the Bird's flying; yet, for the most part, of themselves they readily re-join and re-contex themselves, and are easily by the Birds stroking the Feather, or drawing it through its Bill, all of them settled and woven into their former and natural posture; for there are such an infinite company of those small fibres in the under side of the leaves, and most of them have such little crooks at their ends, that they readily catch and hold the stalks they touch.|$|E
60|$|The Italian spring {{comes on}} slowly everywhere, with {{successive}} snubs {{in its early}} ardor from the snows on the mountains, which regulate the climate from north to south. We could not see that it made more speed behind the sheltering walls of the Capuchin convent garden than in other places. The old gardener whom we saw pottering about in it seemed to potter no more actively {{at the end of}} March than at the beginning of February; on the first days of April a heap of old <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> <b>stalks</b> was sending up the ruddy flame and pleasant smell that the like burning heaps do with us at the like hour of spring--in fact, vegetation had much more reason to be cheerful throughout February {{than at any time in}} March. Those February days were really incomparable. They had not the melting heat of the warm spells that sometimes come in our Februaries; but their suns were golden, and their skies unutterably blue, and their airs mild, yet fresh. You always wanted a heavy coat for driving or for the shade in walking; otherwise the temperature was that of a New England April which was resolved to begin as it could carry out. But March came with cold rains of whole days, and with suns that might overheat but could not be trusted to warm you. The last Sunday of January I found ice in the Colosseum; but that was the only time I saw ice anywhere in Rome. In March, however, in a moment of great exasperation from the mountains, it almost snowed. Yet that month would in our climate have been remembered for its beauty and for a prevailing kindness of temperature. The worst you could say of it was that it left the spring in the Capuchin garden where it found it. But possibly, since the temporal power was overthrown, the seasons are neglected and indifferent. Certainly man seems so in the case of the Capuchin convent. Great stretches of the poor old plain edifice look vacant, and the high wall which encloses it is plastered and painted with huge advertisements of clothiers and hotels and druggists, and announcements of races and other events out of keeping with its character and tradition.|$|E
60|$|After three days' {{travelling}} {{we arrived}} at Socêgo, the estate of Senhôr Manuel Figuireda, a relation {{of one of our}} party. The house was simple, and, though like a barn in form, was well suited to the climate. In the sitting-room gilded chairs and sofas were oddly contrasted with the whitewashed walls, thatched roof, and windows without glass. The house, together with the granaries, the stables, and workshops for the blacks, who had been taught various trades, formed a rude kind of quadrangle; in the centre of which a large pile of coffee was drying. These buildings stand on a little hill, overlooking the cultivated ground, and surrounded on every side by a wall of dark green luxuriant forest. The chief produce of {{this part of the country}} is coffee. Each tree is supposed to yield annually, on an average, two pounds; but some give as much as eight. Mandioca or cassava is likewise cultivated in great quantity. Every part of this plant is useful: the <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> <b>stalks</b> are eaten by the horses, and the roots are ground into a pulp, which, when pressed dry and baked, forms the farinha, the principal article of sustenance in the Brazils. It is a curious, though well-known fact, that the juice of this most nutritious plant is highly poisonous. A few years ago a cow died at this Fazênda, in consequence of having drunk some of it. Senhôr Figuireda told me that he had planted, the year before, one bag of feijaô or beans, and three of rice; the former of which produced eighty, and the latter three hundred and twenty fold. The pasturage supports a fine stock of cattle, and the woods are so full of game that a deer had been killed on each of the three previous days. This profusion of food showed itself at dinner, where, if the tables did not groan, the guests surely did; for each person is expected to eat of every dish. One day, having, as I thought, nicely calculated so that nothing should go away untasted, to my utter dismay a roast turkey and a pig appeared in all their substantial reality. During the meals, it was the employment of a man to drive out of the room sundry old hounds, and dozens of little black children, which crawled in together, at every opportunity. As long as the idea of slavery could be banished, there was something exceedingly fascinating in this simple and patriarchal style of living: it was such a perfect retirement and independence from the rest of the world. As soon as any stranger is seen arriving, a large bell is set tolling, and generally some small cannon are fired. The event is thus announced to the rocks and woods, but to nothing else. One morning I walked out an hour before daylight to admire the solemn stillness of the scene; at last, the silence was broken by the morning hymn, raised on high by the whole body of the blacks; and in this manner their daily work is generally begun. On such fazêndas as these, I have no doubt the slaves pass happy and contented lives. On Saturday and Sunday they work for themselves, and in this fertile climate the labour of two days is sufficient to support a man and his family for the whole week.|$|E

50|$|C. graminicola is a fungal {{pathogen}} that colonizes and infects many turfgrass e.g., Bluegrass, Ryegrass, fescue. In {{addition to}} the grasses, C. graminicola also infects many grain crops such as barley, wheat, sorghum and corn. The fungus can infect many {{different parts of the}} corn plant, typically the kernels, tassels, roots, <b>leaves,</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>and</b> husks. The most common area of infection is the stalk. C. graminicola produces three major symptom types: leaf blight, <b>stalk</b> rot <b>and</b> top die-back. The leaf blight is characterized by round yellowing water soaked lesions on the leaves. These lesions usually occur early in the season and are how this pathogen is distinguished from other diseases. Top die-back is the necrosis of the top <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> <b>stalk</b> of the corn. This occurs around the same time as grain formation. The stalk rot phase becomes prominent during the late reproductive stages of the corn life cycle. It is characterized by blackening of the pith tissue in the <b>stalk</b> <b>and</b> also of the rind, beginning at the nodes closest to the soil. Along with these symptoms, seedling blight and post emergence damping off are also found.|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{chilling}} of Muscari bulbs {{is necessary for the}} growth of the inflorescence <b>stalk</b> <b>and</b> flowering, but not for the growth of leaves. Gibberellic acid (GA) accelerated stem growth and flowering in chilled Muscari bulbs. In the present experiment it was shown that in unchilled derooted Muscari bulbs the growth of leaves, but not the growth of the inflorescence stalk, was observed when bulbs were stored in water, GA at a concentration of 50 and 100 mg/L, benzyladenine (BA) at a concentration of 25 and 50 mg/L, or a mixture of GA+BA (50 + 25 mg/L), but abscisic acid (ABA) at a concentration of 10 mg/L greatly inhibited the growth of leaves. In chilled derooted Muscari bulbs the growth of <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> inflorescence <b>stalk</b> was observed when bulbs were stored in water or GA, but BA and GA+BA treatments totally inhibited the growth of the inflorescence stalk without an effect on the growth of leaves.

IAA applied under the inflorescence bud inhibited the development of flowers (flower-bud blasting) and induced the growth of the inflorescence stalk below the treatment site.
