40|$|BACKGROUND ALPPS induces rapid liver {{hypertrophy}} after stage- 1 operation, enabling safe, extended resections (stage- 2) {{after a short}} period. Recent {{studies have}} suggested that partial transection at stage- 1 might be associated with a better safety profile. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the amount of liver parenchyma that needs to be divided to achieve sufficient <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>in</b> <b>ALPPS.</b> METHODS In a bi-institutional, prospective cohort study, nonfibrotic patients who underwent ALPPS with complete (n = 22) or partial (n = 23) transection for colorectal liver metastases were analyzed and compared with an external ALPPS cohort (n = 23). A radiologic tool was developed to quantify the amount of parenchymal transection. Liver hypertrophy and clinical outcome were compared between both techniques. The relationship of partial transection and hypertrophy was investigated further in an experimental murine model of partial ALPPS. RESULT The median amount of parenchymal transection in partial ALPPS was 61 % (range, 34 - 86 %). The radiologic method correlated poorly with the intraoperative surgeon's estimation (rS = 0. 258). Liver hypertrophy was equivalent for the partial ALPPS, ALPPS, and external ALPPS cohort (64 % vs 60 % vs. 64 %). Experimental data demonstrated that partial transection of at least 50 % induced comparable hypertrophy (137 % vs 156 %) and hepatocyte proliferation compared to complete transection. CONCLUSION The study provides clinical and experimental evidence that partial liver partition of at least 50 % seems to be equally effective in triggering volume hypertrophy as observed with complete transection and can be re recommended as less invasive alternative to ALPPS...|$|E

40|$|Uncovering {{pathways}} underlying drug-induced toxicity is {{a fundamental}} objective {{in the field of}} toxicogenomics. Developing mechanism-based toxicity biomarkers requires the identification of such novel pathways and the order of their sufficiency in causing a phenotypic response. Genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) phenotypic screening has emerged as an effective tool in unveiling the genes essential for specific cellular functions and biological activities. However, eliciting the relative contribution of and sufficiency relationships among the genes identified remains challenging. In the rodent, the most widely used animal model in preclinical studies, it is unrealistic to exhaustively examine all potential interactions by RNAi screening. Application of existing computational approaches to infer regulatory networks with biological outcomes in the rodent is limited by the requirements for a large number of targeted permutations. Therefore, we developed a two-step relay method that requires only one targeted perturbation for genome-wide de novo pathway discovery. Using expression profiles in response to small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against the gene for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (Ppara), our method unveiled the potential causal sufficiency order network for <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>in</b> the rodent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Portal vein {{ligation}} (PVL) or embolization (PVE) {{are standard}} approaches to induce <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> {{of the future}} liver remnant (FLR) prior to hepatectomy in primarily non-resectable liver tumors. However, this approach fails in about one third of patients. Recently, the new "ALPPS" approach has been described that combines PVL with parenchymal transection to induce rapid <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy.</b> This series explores whether isolated parenchymal transection boosts <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>in</b> scenarios of failed PVL/PVE. METHODS: A multicenter database with 170 patients undergoing portal vein manipulation to {{increase the size of}} the FLR was screened for patients undergoing isolated parenchymal transection as a salvage procedure. Three patients who underwent PVL/PVE with subsequent insufficient volume gain and subsequently underwent parenchymal liver transection as a salvage procedure were identified. Patient characteristics, volume increase, postoperative complications and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The first patient underwent liver transection 16 weeks after failed PVL with a standardized FLR (sFLR) of 30 %, which increased to 47 % in 7 days. The second patient showed a sFLR of 25 % 28 weeks after PVL and subsequent PVE of segment IV, which increased to 41 % in 7 days after transection. The third patient underwent liver partition 8 weeks after PVE with a sFLR of 19 %, which increased to 37 % in six days. All patients underwent a R 0 resection.

The {{duration of the}} experiment was 4 weeks. MethodsThe blood glucose level of the rats was measured with a glucometer, the protein and glucose and specific gravity in the urine samples of the rats were measured using urine assay strips and urinometer respectively. The liver and kidney function parameters in the serum of the rats were determined using Biosystem Kits. ResultsThe diabetic rats given livingstonepotato incorporated feeds, had 129. 7 % decrease in their hyperglycemia with corresponding amelioration of their elevated urinary protein, sugars, specific gravity, renal growth, liver growth as well as 15. 64 % decrease in body weights compared with the nondiabetic rats that had 5. 54 % decrease in blood glucose and 20. 39 % increase in body weight unlike the diabetic control rats that had 18. 34 % decrease in blood glucose and 52. 68 % decrease in body weight. There were significant differences (P 0. 05) in the relative heart weights of all the rats in the three different groups.

This study assessed the effect of hepatic vein embolization (HVE) in addition to PVE on <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> response <b>in</b> a standardized rabbit model. Materials and Methods: Thirty rabbits were allocated to groups according to intervention: PVE alone, HVE alone, and a combination of HVE and PVE. The liver regeneration response of the nonembolized, caudal liver was assessed by computed tomographic volumetry, liver to body weight index, {{and the amount of}} proliferating hepatocytes. Results: The caudal liver volume (CLV) increased significantly more in the PVE and combined PVE/HVE group than in the HVE group at 3 and 7 days after the procedure (P <. 01).

2500|$|Owing to {{a limited}} {{literature}} on the subject, birds {{are believed to have}} very limited regenerative abilities as adults. Some studies on roosters have suggested that birds can adequately regenerate some parts of the limbs and depending on the conditions in which regeneration takes place, such as age of the animal, the inter-relationship of the injured tissue with other muscles, and the type of operation, can involve complete regeneration of some musculoskeletal structure. Werber and Goldschmidt (1909) found that the goose and duck were capable of regenerating their beaks after partial amputation [...] and Sidorova (1962) observed <b>liver</b> regeneration via <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>in</b> roosters. Birds are also capable of regenerating the hair cells in their cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage. Despite this evidence, contemporary studies suggest reparative regeneration in avian species is limited to periods during embryonic development. An array of molecular biology techniques have been successful in manipulating cellular pathways known to contribute to spontaneous regeneration in chick embryos. For instance, removing a portion of the elbow joint in a chick embryo via window excision or slice excision and comparing joint tissue specific markers and cartilage markers showed that window excision allowed 10 out of 20 limbs to regenerate and expressed joint genes similarly to a developing embryo. In contrast, slice excision did not allow the joint to regenerate due to the fusion of the skeletal elements seen by an expression of cartilage markers.|$|R

The mechanisms of this phenomenon are unknown, may be multiple and include: splanchnic sequestration caused by a reduction in the hepatic mass; hepatic growth factors that may indirectly act on the spleen, and the redistribution of the total reticuloendothelial system. MethodsSeventy-five patients (40 males; median age: 60 years) who underwent minor (16 %) or major (84 %) hepatectomy between September 2004 and October 2009 were included. Prospective measurements of liver and spleen volumes were obtained preoperatively and postoperatively 1 month after hepatectomy using computed tomography (CT). The future remnant liver volume (RLV) was calculated on preoperative CT and the extent of resection was expressed as the RLV divided by total liver volume (TLV). <b>Liver</b> and spleen <b>hypertrophy</b> were expressed according to the absolute gain or relative increase in the initial volumes (%). The presence of fibrosis >F 1, associated extrahepatic resection (except minor resections), and previous hepatectomy (major or minor) within 3 months represented exclusion criteria. ResultsMean ± standard deviation (SD) liver volume at 1 month was higher than RLV (1187 ± 286 cm 3 versus 764 ± 421 cm 3; P < 0. 001). Mean ± SD splenic volume increased from 252 ± 100 cm 3 preoperatively to 300 ± 111 cm 3 at 1 month (P < 0. 001). <b>Liver</b> and splenic <b>hypertrophy</b> were significant after major hepatectomies (+ 100 % and + 26 %, respectively; P < 0. 001), but not after minor hepatectomies. <b>Liver</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> was inversely correlated to RLV/TLV (r = − 0. 687, P < 0. 001). Splenic hypertrophy was not correlated to RLV/TLV. <b>Liver</b> and splenic <b>hypertrophy</b> were linearly correlated (r = 0. 495, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction Portal vein {{embolization}} (PVE) is {{a treatment}} {{in patients with}} an expected future liver remnant volume (FLRV) with insufficient functional capacity. Its goal is to induce <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>in</b> the FLRV before hemihepatectomy. Still, there is no standard procedure predictive for early PVE failure to optimize therapy notably in non-responders. Aim {{of this study was}} to evaluate early changes in portal vein flow, liver volume and liver function after PVE and to evaluate Doppler ultrasound as a tool predictive for early PVE failure and further to investigate, if portal hyperperfusion triggers the growth of the FLRV. Methods Patients undergoing PVE before hemihepatectomy were included in this prospective study. Measurement points were the 1 st, 7 th, 14 th, 21 st, 28 th post embolization day (PED) and at the 1 st, 10 th, 90 th post operation day (POD). Ultrasonographic Doppler, direct MRI volumetry and LiMAx were performed. Results Thirty-nine patients (24 male, 15 female, age: 63 ± 11) were included. LiMAx remained constant after PVE (419. 08 ± 115. 10 vs. 396. 58 ± 126. 33 μg/kg/min; p = 0. 287). The <b>hypertrophy</b> was highest <b>in</b> the first two weeks. Portal vein diameter on the 7 th PED showed a significant negative correlation (p < 0. 01) with <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> till the 21 st and 28 th PED in the whole population. In a sub-population regardless the impact of the initial size of FLRV portal hyperperfusion on the 1 st PED correlated positively with the hypertrophy till the 21 st PED (R = 0. 679, p = 0. 004). A portal hyperperfusion ≤ 0, 645 ml/min*cm 3 or ≤ 171 % is associated with low hypertrophy. After hemihepatectomy there was no portal vein hyperperfusion despite hypertrophy. Conclusion Our data suggests performing hemihepatectomy sooner than four weeks after PVE may be possible. Doppler ultrasonography may contribute to an individualized therapeutical approach by assessing portal vein hyperperfusion on the 1 st PED and portal vein diameter on the 7 th PED which is predictive for liver regeneration and thus optimizing therapy. It remains unclear whether portal hyperperfusion triggers FLRV growth. There is evidence that portal hyperperfusion may influence <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> after PVE besides the size of the initial FLRV. Post hemihepatectomy data suggests that other factors, such as arterial blood flow, may also play an important role. Future research is required...|$|R

Known hepatotoxic compounds, such as piperonyl butoxide (PBO), decabromodiphenyl ether (DBDE), beta-naphthoflavone (BNF), indole- 3 -carbinol (I 3 C) and acetaminophen (AA), were orally administered to male and female F 344 rats at doses sufficient to cause <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy.</b> Rats received diets containing each test compound for 3 days, 4 weeks or 13 weeks, and were then kept for 4 weeks without the test chemical.

The mutagenicity of MeIQx, BaP and NDMA increased with the use of S 9 derived from rats treated with non-genotoxic compounds other than AA. DBDE administration had a marked effect on the mutagenicity of BaP (over a 30 -fold increase in females) and NDMA (about a 20 -fold increase in males). To estimate the involvement of metabolic enzymes in the alteration of mutagenicity, we measured the activity of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase (MROD) (phase I enzymes), and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) (phase II enzymes) in each S 9 sample. The activity of phase I enzymes increased, even at the 3 rd day following administration, and then decreased gradually, except in the case of AA, while the activity of phase II enzymes increased slightly. These results suggest that non-genotoxic hepato-hypertrophic compounds may be partly involved in carcinogenesis by modulating the metabolism of pre-carcinogens incorporated from the environment, {{in a manner that is}} dependent on sex and pre-incorporated chemicals...|$|R

ResultsSeven studies, reporting on 312 patients, were included. Two hundred and eighty four patients (91. 0 %) received treatment to the right lobe. Two hundred and fifteen patients had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 12 had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 85 had liver metastases from mixed primaries. Y 90 SIRT resulted <b>in</b> contralateral <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> which ranged from 26 to 47 % at 44 days– 9 months.

40|$|In {{order to}} induce <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> to enable <b>liver</b> {{resection}} {{in patients with}} a small future liver remnant, various methods have been proposed in addition to portal vein embolisation. Most recently, the ALPPS technique has gained significant international interest. This technique {{is limited by the}} high morbidity associated with an in-situ liver splitting and the patient undergoing two open operations. We present the case of a variant ALPPS technique performed entirely laparoscopically with no major morbidity or mortality. An increased liver volume of 57. 9 % was seen after 14 days. This technique is feasible to perform and compares favourably to other ALPPS methods whilst gaining the advantages of laparoscopic surgery...|$|R

40|$|Background Preoperative {{portal vein}} {{occlusion}} with either percutaneous portal vein embolization (PVE) or portal vein ligation (PVL) is routinely used to induce <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> prior to major liver resection {{in patients with}} hepatic malignancy. While this increases the future liver remnant (FLR) and hence {{the number of patients}} suitable for resection, recent evidence suggests that induction of <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> pre-operatively may promote tumour growth and increase recurrence rates. Aim of the current study is to evaluate the impact of PVE on hepatic recurrence rate and survival in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Methods Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies assessing the oncological outcomes of patients undergoing major liver resection for CRLM following PVE. Studies comparing patients undergoing one stage liver resection with or without pre-operative PVE were included. The primary outcome was hepatic recurrence (HR). Secondary outcomes were 3 - and 5 -year overall survival (OS). Results Of the 2131 studies identified, six nonrandomized studies (n= 668) met the eligibility criteria comparing outcomes of patients undergoing major liver resection with or without PVE (n= 182 vs. n= 486 respectively). The median follow-up time ranged from 23. 5 to 46 months. There {{was no significant difference in}} HR (OR, 0. 78; 95 % CI, 0. 42 to 1. 44, p= 0. 41), 3 -year OS (OR, 0. 80; 95 % CI, 0. 56 to 1. 14, p= 0. 22) or 5 -year OS (OR, 1. 12; 95 % CI, 0. 40 to 3. 11, p= 0. 82). Conclusion PVE in patients with CRLM has no adverse effect on hepatic recurrence or overall survival following major liver resection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{sensitivity}} and specificity of the electrocardiogram in detecting left ventricular <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>in</b> 75 hypertensive patients. Each patient underwent a 12 lead electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. Left ventricular mass index, using echocardiogram, was calculated according to the Penn convention and left ventricular hypertrophy was assessed by standard electrocardiographic criteria. The electrocardiogram {{was found to be}} very specific but insensitive in the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy as compared with the echocardiogram. Other non-voltage dependent markers appeared to have similar reliability. We conclude that the electrocardiogram may be unreliable in the detection of left ventricular <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>in</b> hypertensive patients. Accurate assessment of left ventricular <b>hypertrophy,</b> <b>in</b> these patients should be by echocardiography...|$|R

40|$|Digestion by {{lysozyme}} of delipidated {{cells of}} Mycobacterium smegmatis liberates a water-soluble immunoadjuvant fraction which is chemically {{very similar to}} the water-soluble adjuvant (WSA) obtained previously from purified cell walls, but which contains somewhat more non-peptidoglycan amino acids. The yield of peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan complex is about 10 times greater starting from whole cells than from cell walls. The main biological properties of this “neo-WSA” are described: it increases circulating antibodies to ovalbumin in guinea pigs, it does not produce polyarthritis in rats or induce hypersensitivity to tuberculin, it does not increase susceptibility to histamine or hyperreactivity to endotoxin, and does not produce spleen and <b>liver</b> <b>hypertrophy.</b> Analogous immunostimulant fractions have also been obtained from delipidated cells of Nocardia opaca by lysozyme treatment...|$|R
40|$|The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein {{phosphatase}} calcineurin stimulates cardiac <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>in</b> {{response to}} numerous stimuli. Calcineurin activity is suppressed by association with modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein (MCIP) 1 /DSCR 1, which is up-regulated by calcineurin signaling {{and has been}} proposed to function in a negative feedback loop to modulate calcineurin activity. To investigate the involvement of MCIP 1 <b>in</b> cardiac <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>in</b> vivo, we generated MCIP 1 null mice and subjected them {{to a variety of}} stress stimuli that induce cardiac <b>hypertrophy.</b> <b>In</b> the absence of stress, MCIP 1 −/− animals exhibited no overt phenotype. However, the lack of MCIP 1 exacerbated the hypertrophic response to activated calcineurin expressed from a muscle-specific transgene, consistent with a role of MCIP 1 as a negative regulator of calcineurin signaling. Paradoxically, however, cardiac <b>hypertrophy</b> <b>in</b> response to pressure overload or chronic adrenergic stimulation was blunted in MCIP 1 −/− mice. These findings suggest that MCIP 1 can facilitate or suppress cardiac calcineurin signaling depending {{on the nature of the}} hypertrophic stimulus. These opposing roles of MCIP have important implications for therapeutic strategies to regulate cardiac hypertrophy through modulation of calcineurin–MCIP activity...|$|R

Here, we describe an acute re-sponse to CAR and PXR activators that is associated with induction of Insig- 1, a protein with antilipogenic properties. We first observed that activation of CAR and PXR in mouse liver results in activation of Insig- 1 along with reduced protein levels of the active form of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (Srebp- 1). Studies in mice deficient in CAR and PXR revealed that the effect on triglycerides involves these two nuclear re-ceptors. Finally, we identified a functional binding site for CAR and PXR in the Insig- 1 gene by in vivo, in vitro, and in silic...|$|R
