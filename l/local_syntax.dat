Moreover, they clam that when gestural consistency and a passive interlocutor were both present, the SVO word order will appear significantly. Meanwhile, according to Luke Maurits, Amy Perfors and Daniel Navarro, the reason for object-initial languages to be less common than other word orders {{could be explained by}} the effects of Uniform Information Density (UID). They suggest that “object-first word orders lead to the least uniform information density in all three of their estimated event distributions”(Maurits et al., 2010, p. 7), and was therefore least common. On the other hand, a stimulation study on word order bias also demonstrates that <b>local</b> <b>syntax</b> is one of the triggers of bias towards SOV/SVO word orders; furthermore, the global syntax is also constrained by language encoded semantic structures.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of the extant languages have one of three dominant basic word orders: SVO, SOV or VSO. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this word order bias, including {{the existence of a}} universal grammar, the learnability imposed by cognitive constraints, the descent of modern languages from an ancestral protolanguage, and the constraints from functional principles. We run simulations using a multi-agent computational model to study this bias. Following a local order approach, the model simulates individual language processing mechanisms in production and comprehension. The simulation results demonstrate that the semantic structures that a language encodes can constrain the global syntax, and that <b>local</b> <b>syntax</b> can help trigger bias towards the global order SOV/SVO (or VOS/OVS). © John Benjamins Publishing Company. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A growing {{population}} of users want to extract a growing variety {{of information from}} on-line texts. Unfortunately, current information extraction systems typically require experts to hand-build dictionaries of extraction patterns for each new type of information to be extracted. This paper presents a system that can learn dictionaries of extraction patterns directly from user-provided examples of texts and events to be extracted from them. The system, called LIEP, learns patterns that recognize relationships between key constituents based on <b>local</b> <b>syntax.</b> Sets of patterns learned by LIEP for a sample extraction task perform nearly {{at the level of}} a hand-built dictionary of patterns. 1 Introduction Although significant progress has been made on information extraction systems in recent years (for instance through the MUC conferences [MUC, 1992; MUC, 1993]), coding the knowledge these systems need to extract new kinds of information and events is an arduous and time-consuming process [Ril [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{classes of}} {{methods have been}} shown to be useful for resolving lexical ambiguity. The first relies on the {{presence}} of particular words within some distance of the ambiguous target word; the second uses the pattern of words and partof -speech tags around the target word.

The idea is to pool the evidence provided by the component methods, and to then solve a target problem by applying the single strongest piece of evidence, whatever type it happens to be.

40|$|The {{majority}} of extant languages {{have one of}} three basic word orders: SVO, SOV or VSO. Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain aspects of this bias, including {{the existence of a}} universal grammar, learnability imposed by non-linguistic-specific cognitive constraints, and the descent of the extant languages from a common ancestral proto-language. Here, we adopt a multi-agent model for language emergence that simulates the coevolution of a lexicon and syntax from a holistic signaling system. The syntax evolves through a process of categorization; local syntactic rules are constructed that assign a relative order (e. g., S before V) to the elements of the two categories to which each rule applies. We demonstrate that <b>local</b> <b>syntax</b> encoding the relative position of S and O are the most stable, allowing the coexistence of the global word order pairs SOV/SVO and VOS/OVS. The structure of the semantic space that the language encodes further constrains the global syntax that is stable. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—With the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century emerging peer-to-peer networks ushered in a new era of large scale media exchange. Faced with ever increasing volumes of traffic, legal threats by copyright holders, and QoS demands of customers, network service providers are urged to apply traffic classifica-tion and shaping techniques. These systems usually are highly integrated to satisfy the harsh restrictions present in network infrastructure. They require constant maintenance and updates. Additionally, they have legal issues and violate both the net neutrality and end-to-end principles. On the other hand, clients see their freedom and privacy attacked. As a result, users, application programmers, and even commercial service providers laboriously strive to hide their interests and circumvent classification techniques. In this user vs. ISP war, the user side has a clear edge. While changing the network infrastructure is by nature very complex, and only slowly reacts to new conditions, updating and distributing software between users is easy and practically instantaneous. In this paper we discuss how state-of-the-art traffic classifica-tion systems can be circumvented with little effort. We present a new obfuscation extension to the BitTorrent protocol that allows signature free handshaking. The extension requires no changes to the infrastructure and is fully backwards compatible. With only little change to client software, contemporary classification techniques are rendered ineffective. We argue, that future traffic classification must not rely on restricted <b>local</b> <b>syntax</b> information but instead must exploit global communication patterns and protocol semantics {{in order to be able}} to keep pace with rapid application and protocol changes.

Repair-driven movement is shown to underlie cases of wh-scrambling, successive-cyclic wh-movement, multiple wh-movement in sluicing contexts, and quantifier raising in VP ellipsis con-structions.

40|$|NooJ is a {{freeware}} language-engineering {{development environment}} for formalizing and integrating nine levels of linguistic phenomena: orthography and typography, lexical, inflectional and derivational morphology, local, structural and transformational syntax, semantics. NooJ contains tools to help construct, test, debug, maintain and accumulate large sets of linguistic resources, {{as well as}} tools to process large texts and corpora. The system has been developed since 2002 {{and it has been}} used to build over 20 language modules, including language modules developed in the framework of the META-NET CESAR ICT-PSP project. This tutorial intends to help participants to master four basic NooJ functionalities: corpus processing, formalization of linguistic units, syntactic parsing. The tutorial session consists of four labs and one presentation. Participants must come with their laptop with NooJ v 3 (either. NET or MONO) pre-installed. 1. Corpus Processing (Kristina Vuckovic, Univ. of Zagreb) Import a text in any file format. Need to define NooJ text units, which are independent areas inside which linguistic resources are applied. A corpus is a collection of text files that will share the same linguistic resources. Apply simple and complex queries to texts in order to build concordances. Perform statistical analyses on any query. 2. Linguistic Units and annotations (Max Silberztein, Univ. of Besançon) NooJ’s basic objects are Atomic Linguistic Units (ALU). NooJ contains tools to formalize nine levels of linguistic phenomena. NooJ manages annotations (rather than tags) to make its different parsers communicate and keep unresolved ambiguities in a Text Annotation Structure. 3. <b>Local</b> <b>Syntax</b> (Tamas Varadi, Budapest Academy of Sciences) What is a local grammar?

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the syntax and semantics of non-local dependencies. It focuses on wh-displacement and operator scope and addresses the challenge they pose to theoretical linguistics: How are form and meaning related and to which extent do syntax and semantics operate in parallel? A common approach of formal grammar theories is to assume that displacement and scope construal go hand in hand, and consequently to impose a strict correspondence between syntax and semantics. This approach is challenged, however, by {{a considerable amount of}} cases where the syntactic position of an operator expression does not coincide with its semantic scope position. This dissertation therefore pursues the opposite approach. It argues that syntactic displacement and semantic scope-taking do not interact at all. The overall picture that is developed is that grammar consists of two parts: a core system for establishing <b>local</b> dependencies, with <b>syntax</b> and semantics operating in parallel, and extensions to this core system for establishing non-local dependencies, with syntax and semantics operating independently. In developing this picture, it is shown that a substantial amount of data (such as pronunciation in wh-clusters, order preservation with multiple displacement, remnant movement and freezing, as well as different scopal behavior) can indeed be accounted for with a syntax and semantics that are largely independent from one anothe...|$|R
40|$|Long Split Focus Constructions in Hungarian with a View on Speaker Variation Long focus {{movement}} in Hungarian (henceforth LUF, cf. (1)) has received much {{attention in the}} generative literature over the past decades (e. g. É. Kiss 1987, Lipták 1998). (1) ÚJ AUTÓTFocus mondott hogy vett. new car. ACC said. 3 SG that bought. 3 SG (S) he said that (s) he had bought a NEW CAR.  Recent research (Gervain 2009, Den Dikken 2010) has argued {{that in addition to}} the movement derivation of the structure, long focus constructions may be derived by base-generating the focused NP in the matrix clause. In addition, the existence of speaker variation in the acceptance of long focus constructions has been tied to two speaker groups according to whether they accept the movement derivation or not. My research takes another set of related data, namely long focus constructions involving split bare NPs (henceforth LSF, cf. (2)), and argues for a double derivation of such structures: one in which the focused NP portion undergoes long-distance movement and one in which it does not. (2) AUTÓTFocus mondott hogy újat vett. car. ACC said. 3 SG that new. ACC bought. 3 SG (S) he said that (s) he had bought a new CAR.  The central data come from two questionnaires, each filled out by over 80 native speakers. The results show that while there is speaker variaton concerning the different types of the construction, no consistent speaker groups can be distinguished. I propose to account for this fact by assuming that there are two derivations for these constructions (i. e. long-distance movement and base-generation) both of which are available in all native speakers grammar. This explains why some types of the structure are sensitive to constraints on movement while others are not. Chapter 1 introduces some basic facts about LSF and the primary issues that will be addressed in the context of long focus constructions, each of the subsequent chapters discusses a topic that brings us closer to the analysis of LSF. Chapter 2 first briefly situates Hungarian among the languages of the world and it discusses some properties of word order characteristic of discourse-configurational languages. Then it presents a basic overview {{of the structure of the}} simple clause in Hungarian. Finally, it provides some insight into three issues that return in later chapters, namely the structure of nominal phrases, object definiteness agreement and the structure of expletive-associate constructions (henceforth EA, cf. (3)) in Hungarian. (3) (Azt) mondta Mari, hogy fekete macskát látott. expl. ACC said. 3 SG Mary that black cat. ACC saw. 3 SG Mary said that she had seen a black cat.  Chapter 3 is devoted to the discussion of split nominal phrase constructions, one of which is LSF. This chapter situates LSF in a group of related structures defined by the presence of a split nominal phrase (i. e. short-distance/long-distance split topicalization and short-distance/long-distance split focalization). LSF is singled out as it is the central topic of this thesis and its distinctive characteristics are summarized in the context of other split nominal phrase constructions. Chapter 4 compares LSF to its close relative, LUF and juxtaposes the syntactic characteristics of LSF and LUF in a systematic way. This chapter is based on the informal testing of informants living in North-Eastern Hungary. The chapter ends with the conclusion that LSF and LUF come in the same two types and that these two types share the same syntactic characteristics. Chapter 5 outlines some of the most influential analyses of LUF. These include long-distance movement, base-generation and so-called double (i. e. long-distance movement and base-generation) analyses. This chapter serves as background to my analysis of LSF. The analyses presented in this chapter do not extend to each empirical detail about LUF introduced in Chapter 4 as some of the data presented there has not been described in the existing literature on LUF. Chapter 6 introduces some prerequisites for the analysis and outlines the analysis of LSF based on the data introduced in Chapter 4. I propose that the underlying structure of long focus constructions, i. e. EA comes in two types: in one type the matrix expletive is base-generated in the matrix clause while in the other it is base-generated in the embedded clause. I draw a parallel between the base-generation sites of the clausal expletive in EA and in LSF. Based on this I claim that LSF can be divided into a base-generation type and a movement type. I argue that the base-generation type of LSF is derived by base-generating the two NP portions in their respective clause. The link between the two NP portions is established by concord, a type of A-dependency introduced in the generative theory by Den Dikken (2010) for LUF. On the other hand, I claim that the movement type of LSF is derived via long-distance movement of the long-focused NP (cf. Den Dikken 2010, Ott 2012). Chapter 7 reports the findings of two questionnaires. The primary aim of both questionnaires was to test the preliminary analysis formulated in chapter 6. Questionnaire 1 involved 83 speakers and used the 5 -point scale method while questionnaire 2 was filled out by 88 informants and applied the magnitude estimation method. Both questionnaires are briefly described in the main text and a detailed description of both of them can be found in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2, respectively. The findings support the double (i. e. base-generation and long-distance movement) analysis of LSF outlined in Chapter 6. A section of Chapter 7 is devoted to the discussion of speaker variation as it affects both LSF and LUF (cf. Gervain 2009). Both of my questionnaires show a lack of systematic speaker variation. Chapter 8 provides a detailed analysis of both the base-generation and the movement type of LSF. It considers the results of questionnaire 1 and questionnaire 2 and it incorporates several elements of previous analyses of LUF. It is claimed here that the main syntactic difference between the base-generation and movement type of LSF can be traced back to two possible base-generation sites of the clausal expletive that is always present in the structure. It is shown that this analysis can carry over to LUF, the difference being that unlike in LSF, in LUF a full NP is moved to the matrix focus position from the embedded clause. Chapter 9 summarizes the main claims of this dissertation and discusses some directions for future research. References Den Dikken, Marcel (2010).
