40|$|Research on optimum <b>lay-ups</b> and {{buckling}} {{loads of}} laminated plates is briefly reviewed. A new sequential, iterative procedure, known as layerwise optimization (LO), {{for determining the}} optimum <b>lay-ups</b> and maximum buckling loads of symmetrically laminated rectangular plates is described. The physical basis of the procedure is explained. LO is shown to be highly efficient, with reductions in computational effort of more than 99 per cent being possible in comparison to some simultaneous optimization procedures. Three examples are presented {{of the use of}} the LO procedure to determine the optimum <b>lay-ups</b> and associated maximum buckling loads of 8 - and 24 -layer symmetrically laminated rectangular plates subjected to uniform, uniaxial and biaxial compression. For 18 combinations of free, simply supported and clamped edge conditions, it is shown that the LO procedure generally leads to the optimum solution. In the very few instances where a local rather than a global solution was obtained, the maximum buckling load was only 4 - 6. 5 per cent lower than the optimum value...|$|R
25|$|Knight was an {{innovator}} of {{the motion}} offense, which he perfected and popularized. The system emphasizes post players setting screens and perimeter players passing the ball until a teammate becomes open for an uncontested jump shot or <b>lay-up.</b> This required players to be unselfish, disciplined, and effective in setting and using screens to get open.|$|E

Prior to Game 2, Rasheed Wallace famously {{guaranteed}} a Detroit victory. With Detroit clinging to a 69-67 lead with under 30 seconds to play, after Billups recovered the basketball after a Jermaine O'Neal blocked shot of Rasheed Wallace, Jamaal Tinsley stripped Billups and found Reggie Miller open down the court for {{what appeared to be}} the tying <b>lay-up.</b> As Miller approached the basket, Tayshaun Prince ran in from the left wing and blocked Miller's <b>lay-up</b> as it left his fingertips. Richard Hamilton recovered the loose ball before it went out of bounds and was fouled by Tinsley.

40|$|Fracture and notch {{strength}} tests of graphite-epoxy composites showed that unidirectional <b>lay-ups</b> generally exhibit longitudinal cracking before failure, whereas multidirectional <b>lay-ups</b> fail transversely with little longitudinal cracking. A simple qualitative analysis {{suggested that the}} higher matrix shear stresses in unidirectional materials cause the longitudinal cracking, and that this cracking {{was responsible for the}} high toughness of unidirectional composites. In a series of comparative tests, the interlaminar strength of multi-directional composites was reduced by placing perforated Mylar films between laminae; tests on notched and slotted specimens showed that the interlaminar films promoted delamination and longitudinal cracking near the notches and that, as a result, toughness, notch strength, and impact strength were substantially increased...|$|R

In Liquid Composites Moulding processes, fabric <b>lay-ups</b> undergo significant manufacture-induced deformation, combining compression, shear, and inter-layer nesting. Starting from {{the configuration of}} un-deformed fabric, the deformation is simulated geometrically by accounting for self-imposed kinematic constraints of interweaving yarns. The geometrical modelling approach is implemented in the open-source software TexGen. The permeability tensor is retrieved from flow analysis in ANSYS/CFX, based on TexGen voxel models. Using only measured geometrical data for un-deformed fabrics, deformed plain weave fabric and twill weave fabric <b>lay-ups</b> were modelled and their permeability tensors predicted. Comparison with experimental data demonstrates the generally good accuracy of predictions derived from the proposed numerical method...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{problems}} preventing the industrial application of ceramic-matrix composites {{is the lack of}} an efficient method to detect and discriminate among types of damage occurring during service. With this in mind, the mechanical response, damage development and acoustic emission activity during monotonic tensile testing of a BMAS glass-ceramic matrix reinforced with SiC fibres have been investigated. Damage initiation and propagation were easily detected and evaluated using the acoustic emission technique. Comparing the acoustic emission activity characteristics in simple <b>lay-ups</b> with those of more complex <b>lay-ups</b> allowed discrimination between matrix microcracking, matrix macrocracking accompanied by interface debonding, and delamination cracking. In this way, the paper contributes {{to the development of the}} acoustic emission technique for in situ monitoring of damage development in ceramic-matrix composites.

40|$|Static {{behavior}} of composite beams with arbitrary <b>lay-ups</b> using various refined shear deformation theories is presented. The developed theories, {{which do not}} require shear correction factor, account for parabolical variation of shear strains and consequently shear stresses through {{the depth of the}} beam. In addition, they have strong similarity with Euler–Bernoulli beam theory in some aspects such as governing equations, boundary conditions, and stress resultant expressions. A two-noded C 1 finite element with six degree-of-freedom per node which accounts for shear deformation effects and all coupling coming from the material anisotropy is developed to solve the problem. Numerical results are performed for symmetric and anti-symmetric cross-ply composite beams under the uniformly distributed load and concentrated load. The effects of fiber angle and <b>lay-ups</b> on the shear deformation parameter and extension-bending-shear-torsion response are investigated...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{stacking}} sequence on the tensile strength of notched and unnotched woven fabric (WF) composite laminates has been experimentally investigated. Comparison {{is made with}} unidirectional (UD) tape laminate results that {{are available in the}} literature. The fabric structure is a governing parameter in the failure mechanisms of WF composites. The failure mechanisms of WF composites, therefore, differ from UD tape composites. The notch sensitivities of different <b>lay-ups</b> are compared by using the characteristic dimensions d 0 and a 0 of the Whitney and Nuismer fracture model. The ratio of predicted notched strength to unnotched strength, (sigma(N)) PRE/sigma(0), is used to study the effect of stacking sequence and d/W ratio on the notch sensitivity of the WF composites.

40|$|Abstract. This article {{examines}} the fracture toughness of end notched flexure (ENF) composite specimens of three different <b>lay-ups.</b> Experiments were conducted on these glass/epoxy specimens and the critical fracture energy, IICG, was evaluated based on compliance based beam method (CBBM). Classical methods require crack length measurements, which {{are not easy to}} obtain as propagation occurs rapidly without a clear opening. The CBBM is based on crack equivalent concept, which does not require crack length monitoring during propagation and hence the crack growth resistance curve (R-curve) can be generated in a much easier way. Moreover, the CBBM accounts the non-negligible energy dissipation in the fracture process zone (FPZ) in addition to stress concentrations near crack tip, contact between specimen arms at the pre-crack region and root rotation effects. Hence, the complete R-curves of ENF specimens of different <b>lay-ups</b> were obtained using the CBBM with higher degree of accuracy. It was observed that the unidirectional specimen did show higher propagation toughness value than the angle-ply and cross-ply specimens...|$|R

25|$|Robert LeMeur was {{designed}} to support seasonal exploratory drilling operations in the Beaufort sea. Her typical annual operational profile would begin in May with a warm-up that would gradually bring the vessel systems online after five months of cold <b>lay-up.</b> After commencing break-out, the Canmar icebreakers would first carry out one or more resupply missions to the drilling islands where exploratory activities have continued through the winter. In June, the icebreakers {{would return to the}} winter base to escort the drillships to predetermined drilling locations. Once the spread-mooring system had been deployed and drilling commenced, the icebreakers would remain on site to carry out ice management by breaking up large floes that could threaten the drilling operation. Once all ice had melted, Robert LeMeur would continue with supply missions to different Beaufort Sea drilling operations.|$|E
