40|$|Parents {{and family}} members whose adult child or {{relative}} has a mental illness endure significant losses, to which they respond with grief. Such grief may negatively affect family members 2 ̆ 7 physical and psychological health and also the relationship with their relative. Yet, {{research in this field}} is sparse. Very few studies have examined parents 2 ̆ 7 <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> {{in the context of the}} patient being a child or teen. It is not clear the extent to which parents 2 ̆ 7 <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> in response to their child or adolescent 2 ̆ 7 s mental illness is similar or different to the accounts of older parents {{and family members}} caring for an adult relative with major psychopathology (e. g., Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder). Parental <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> is not often addressed in child and adolescent mental health services 2 ̆ 7 provision of care; alarmingly, little is known about how best to support parents who access these services. The present study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap and identify the therapeutic needs of this younger parent population. Comprehensive interviews were conducted with 14 parents and one custodial grandparent of a youth aged 18 years or younger who was currently attending a child and adolescent mental health service. An inductive thematic analysis identified six themes; parents 2 ̆ 7 narrative of finding out, profound <b>and</b> pervasive <b>loss,</b> complex <b>grief,</b> waning support, the challenges of caregiving and a call for assistance. It can be inferred from these results that youth mental illness can constitute a source of <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> for parents. Participants 2 ̆ 7 <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> was largely consistent with the experience of families caring for an adult relative with major psychopathology. Opportunities for mental health practitioners to support families 2 ̆ 7 <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> were identified. Further studies are needed to enhance understanding of this complex and, to a large extent, ignored familial experience.

BACKGROUND: Re-entry adjustment affects Australian cross cultural workers returning home; <b>and</b> for many, <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> issues arise. General practitioners {{are often the}} first point of contact {{in the health care}} system and are well placed to deal with these issues. OBJECTIVE: This article examines strategies that GPs can use to support the Australian cross cultural worker on re-entry, and focuses on recognition of re-entry adjustment, the role of <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> issues, <b>and</b> the importance of dealing with these issues. DISCUSSION: Australian cross cultural workers are valued members of their communities. However, their <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> issues associated with re-entry adjustment on return are often unrecognised and may lead to significant morbidity. Acknowledgment of their disenfranchised <b>grief</b> <b>and</b> appropriate therapy may be part of the role of their GP.

40|$|A high {{proportion}} of cross cultural aid workers and missionaries who may also be involved in aid work are known to suffer from significant psychological distress on re-entry. In the Australian primary health care system, Australian general practitioners are most often the first point of contact for those with psychological distress. There is, however, little acknowledgement or understanding in the medical literature of the distress of this particular group in Australian society and their management in the general practice setting. This thesis addresses these issues with {{an analysis of the}} experiences of 15 returned adult Australian missionaries. The thesis presents an analysis of evidence and builds theory using predominantly qualitative methods. Firstly, I comprehensively explore the evidence for the nature of the distress suffered by these re-entering missionaries. Through analysis of their accounts of their day-to-day lived experience during the interactive transition of their re-entry, I demonstrate the importance of their <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief,</b> particularly their disenfranchised grief, as part of their psychological distress. I describe a new type of disenfranchised grief: self-absorbed disenfranchised grief. Some missionaries appeared to have less distress than others, which has led me to categorise two groups of re-entrants, the resilient and fragile. Further exploration of these missionaries’ psychological distress led me to focus on the nature of their resilience. I demonstrate the psychological, social and spiritual constructs which increase resilience in this group in the context of multiple <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> as well as the role of their identity disparities. I also demonstrate a link between resilience and identity disparities. Secondly, the results of this thesis together with the existing theoretical models for <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> enable me to build an evidence-based theoretical framework to address psychological distress during re-entry. I show how the Dual Process Model, which addresses <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> after bereavement, may be modified to address <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> during re-entry based on the findings of this study. Within this framework I also demonstrate the facilitators and barriers that affect the missionaries' psychological distress during re-entry. I offer this model as a framework for dealing with missionaries' psychological distress during re-entry in the clinical setting. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Nurses often help {{patients}} cope with loss. Recent research has {{cast doubt on}} the validity of early theories about <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> commonly taught to nurses. We systematically examined the accuracy of information on coping with loss presented in 23 commonly used undergraduate psychiatric nursing books. All 23 books contained at least one unsupported assumption (myth) about <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief.</b> In 78 % of these books, authors described four or more myths and only one evidence-based finding about coping with loss.

40|$|Psychological {{theories}} of <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>grief,</b> which suggest that people {{must go through}} stages such as shock, anger, denial, and despair before finally reaching a recovered stage of acceptance, have often been applied to understanding the experience of disability.
