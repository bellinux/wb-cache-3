25|$|Just <b>like</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> Islamabad again faced Karachi in the eliminator. In what {{proved to}} be a thrilling game, Karachi, batting first, scored a measly 126 getting all out in the process. Islamabad was set to win and qualify for the second play off. However, {{that was not the case}} as the second innings proved. The Karachi bowlers outshone the Islamabad bowlers with Muhammad Amir, Imad Wasim and Usama Mir each picking up three wickets. Islamabad were all out for a mere 82 runs, their lowest in the tournament and the second-lowest in the tournament's history.Hence, the {{defending}} champions were knocked out.|$|E
500|$|Tamworth started 2009–10 in good form, and by late September 2009 were {{occupying a}} {{play-off}} {{spot in the}} Conference Premier. Mills' team eventually finished in 16th place in a season of consolidation; this represented the second highest league placing in the club's history. He made the last appearance of his career aged 48 after starting Tamworth's 4–3 home defeat to Ebbsfleet United on 24 April 2010, before substituting himself for Des Lyttle in the 55th minute. This was his third appearance of the season. In the Conference Premier, Tamworth were playing against a number of clubs with Football League pedigrees, meaning {{they were not able}} to offer contracts as lucrative or long as many clubs. Mills complemented the competitiveness of his team in this division, saying: [...] "For a small club like us, it's great to be mixing with these teams. But, while we may be smaller, <b>like</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> we will make sure that we are capable of getting results." [...] Tamworth had a strong start in 2010–11; they were again in a play-off position by late September 2010, and by the time Mills had left the club they were 12th in the Conference Premier.|$|E
500|$|A solid backfield {{anchored}} by Zach Zwinak, {{a trio of}} established tight ends plus a promising newcomer, and a veteran offensive line highlighted the projected success offensively, while a new coordinator (John Butler), a [...] "borderline All-American" [...] linebacker (Glenn Carson), and lots of potential both on the defensive line and in the secondary, the latter of which was [...] "dramatically improved", highlighted projected progress defensively. Also, a quarterback competition between Christian Hackenberg and Tyler Ferguson brewed, which provided intrigue entering the season. For Penn State to achieve success, they needed to avoid injuries that would hinder their already depleted depth due to NCAA sanctions. SBNation.com asserted, [...] "If either Hackenberg or Ferguson gets hurt, {{and the other one}} stinks ... if either Zach Zwinak or Bill Belton (who missed four games last year) gets hurt ... if basically any linemen get hurt (and linemen often get hurt) ... this house of cards comes tumbling down." [...] ESPN.com reporter Josh Moyer wrote, [...] "In short, <b>like</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> PSU {{is a bit of a}} wild card. If it receives strong efforts from its quarterback and the front seven, it should surpass last year's record. If it doesn't, it might be fortunate to get to seven wins." ...|$|E

25|$|JYP won the tournament, {{defeating}} Färjestad BK in {{the final}} 2–1. <b>Like</b> <b>last</b> <b>year's</b> tournament, the same 32 teams participated in the tournament, marking {{the first time since}} 2007 that the teams remained the same from <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> For the first time in tournament history, Eisbären Berlin hosted the playoffs, the Red Bulls Salute.

2500|$|Vanderbilt {{lost the}} hard fought game 3-0, handing the Commodores their first loss in two years. Much <b>like</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> the game {{featured}} little offense and stalwart defense. [...] Vanderbilt [...] "handcuffed the Wolverines' running and passing game" [...] and [...] "had a defense which became {{nothing less than}} a stone wall whenever her goal was threatened." [...] Both Commodore halfback Gil Reese and Wolverine halfback Harry Kipke were [...] "marked men"; and Vanderbilt's offense never crossed the 35-yard line. Reese and Doc Kuhn were said to raise fans to their feet with the showcase of speed, but the Wolverines kept it confined to sideways runs of little gain. [...] A wire service account of the game noted the defensive play, [...] "Both played crafty football, the fumbling that tended to mar the game being more than offset by swift, dashing interception of passes while the work of the linesmen on both sides was at top form." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{occurred}} strident {{conflicts with}} the Ecumenical Patriarchate, most notably over the Orthodox Church in Estonia in the mid-1990s, which resulted in unilateral suspension of eucharistic relationship between the churches by the ROC. The tension lingered on and could be observed at the meeting in Ravenna in early October 2007 {{of participants in the}} Orthodox–Catholic Dialogue: the representative of the Moscow Patriarchate, Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev, walked out of the meeting due to the presence of representatives from the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church which is in the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. At the meeting, prior to the departure of the Russian delegation, there were also substantive disagreements about the wording of a proposed joint statement among the Orthodox representatives. After the departure of the Russian delegation, the remaining Orthodox delegates approved the form which had been advocated by the representatives of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The Ecumenical See's representative in Ravenna said that Hilarion's position [...] "should be seen as an expression of authoritarianism whose goal is to exhibit the influence of the Moscow Church. But <b>like</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> in Belgrade, all Moscow achieved was to isolate itself once more since no other Orthodox Church followed its lead, remaining instead faithful to Constantinople." ...|$|E

50|$|Four young Algerians {{faced with}} a choice which {{one way or another}} will mark their lives forever: leave for Europe or protest in the streets. One of them will leave for Europe, he knows that he is leaving his country, perhaps for good, and will not see his friends again; the others will join the protests. It looks <b>like</b> <b>last</b> <b>year’s</b> Arab revolutions, but in fact the film refers to the eve of another great popular uprising, the one in Algeria in 1992.|$|R

Henry Hrahuena, of Lifu, I think dying, from what I know not--I think {{inflammation}} of the brain, induced possibly by exposure to the sun, though I have not seen him so exposed, {{and it is a}} thing I am very careful about with them. I do what I can in following the directions of medical books, but it is so hard to get a word from a native to explain symptoms, &c.; besides, my ear is now, <b>like</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> really painful; and for two nights I have had little sleep, and feel stupid, and getting a worn-out feeling. With all this, I am conscious that it is but a temporary depression, a day or two may bring out the bright colours again. Henry may recover by God's mercy, the boys become hearty again; my ear get right. At present I feel that I must rub on as I can, from hour to hour.|$|E

On 20 May, twenty-two {{conservative}} NGOs, including the far right-wing Noua Dreaptă, called on the Romanian Orthodox Church to oppose the pride parade. On 2 June, the Orthodox Church denounced the City Hall for permitting the march to take place, stating that it is [...] "an affront to the morality of public institutions, and a danger ... {{for the formation of}} young people". Additionally, Noua Dreaptă filed a legal complaint in a Bucharest court to get the march banned, arguing that it was [...] "obscene and anti-social".

[...] Likewise, Andy Gill of Uncut Magazine, in a positive review of 8 stars out of 10, also related the album to Shadows in the Night, feeling that [...] "Dylan has continued to restrict his choice to those songs which conform loosely to a mood of weary resignation, extending the engaging crepuscular mood of Shadows in the Night." ...|$|R

That the film is neither a true triumph nor a total disaster makes it somewhat difficult to justify revisiting Brideshead, apart from the hope it will inspire someone somewhere to pick up the book." ...|$|R
