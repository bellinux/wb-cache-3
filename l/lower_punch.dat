50|$|A tablet {{is formed}} by the {{combined}} pressing action of two punches and a die. In {{the first step of}} a typical operation, the bottom punch is lowered in the die creating a cavity into which the granulated feedstock is fed. The exact depth of the <b>lower</b> <b>punch</b> can be precisely controlled to meter the amount of powder that fills the cavity. The excess is scraped {{from the top of the}} die, and the <b>lower</b> <b>punch</b> is drawn down and temporarily covered to prevent spillage. Then, the upper punch is brought down into contact with the powder as the cover is removed. The force of compression is delivered by high pressure compression rolls which fuse the granulated material together into a hard tablet. After compression, the <b>lower</b> <b>punch</b> is raised to eject the tablet.|$|E

50|$|Whatever {{process is}} {{used to make the}} {{tableting}} blend, the process of making a tablet by powder compaction is very similar. First, the powder is filled into the die from above. The mass of powder is determined by the position of the <b>lower</b> <b>punch</b> in the die, the cross-sectional area of the die, and the powder density. At this stage, adjustments to the tablet weight are normally made by repositioning the <b>lower</b> <b>punch.</b> After die filling, the upper punch is lowered into the die and the powder is uniaxially compressed to a porosity of between 5 and 20%. The compression can take place in one or two stages (main compression, and, sometimes, pre-compression or tamping) and for commercial production occurs very fast (500-50 ms per tablet). Finally, the upper punch is pulled {{up and out of the}} die (decompression), and the tablet is ejected from the die by lifting the <b>lower</b> <b>punch</b> until its upper surface is flush with the top face of the die. This process is repeated for each tablet.|$|E

50|$|The {{density of}} the {{compacted}} powder increases {{with the amount of}} pressure applied. Typical pressures range from 80 psi to 1000 psi (0.5 MPa to 7 MPa), pressures from 1000 psi to 1,000,000 psi have been obtained. Pressure of 10 tons/in² to 50 tons/in² (150 MPa to 700 MPa) are commonly used for metal powder compaction. To attain the same compression ratio across a component with more than one level or height, it is necessary to work with multiple <b>lower</b> <b>punches.</b> A cylindrical workpiece is made by single-level tooling.

In order to test this method further, this work compared results from 2 D-SAXS with finite element (FE) simulations using a modified density-dependent Drucker–Prager Cap (DPC) model, for compacts of complex shape, prepared using a cylindrical die, a flat-faced upper <b>punch</b> and shaped <b>lower</b> <b>punches</b> with three different central protrusions. Variations in compaction behaviour were observed, which were due to friction against the die walls and the punch shape. Good agreement was obtained between SAXS measurements and FE simulation, supporting previous indications. Hence, this combination of experimental and computational techniques appeared particularly powerful for investigating powder compaction behaviour, in considerable accuracy and detail.

30|$|In {{the case}} of the study of Ref. [10], the test samples were {{relatively}} simple, namely a training set of pharmaceutical compacts with varying porosity composing of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and air voids. However, there are some interesting features in that study which we wish to revisit before proceeding. One conclusion made was that the measured average surface roughness and the gloss have a linear correlation. Another observation was that although a tablet set consisted of tablets that have varied nominal porosity (volumetric property), the gloss (surface property) value was different for the opposite faces of the flat-faced compacts. In other words, such tablets have different surface roughness/surface porosity due to the compression cycle based on using a dye with upper and <b>lower</b> <b>punches.</b> Differences recorded in the surface roughness for the opposite sides of a given tablet can lead to different dissolution rate of the tablet, and also {{serve as the basis for}} screening of fake tablets as will be shown later in the this study. This is the first time we have applied the 2 D glossmeter for the detection of gloss map and average gloss from both authentic and fake commercially available pharmaceutical tablets.|$|R

50|$|Tablet {{diameter}} and shape {{are determined by}} the machine tooling used to produce them - a die plus an upper and a <b>lower</b> <b>punch</b> are required. This is called a station of tooling. The thickness is determined by the amount of tablet material and the position of the punches in relation to each other during compression. Once this is done, we can measure the corresponding pressure applied during compression. The shorter the distance between the punches, thickness, the greater the pressure applied during compression, and sometimes the harder the tablet.

In the compaction process, the force applied for compaction (upper punch) was greatly influenced by the friction between die wall and powder bed during transmission to the <b>lower</b> <b>punch.</b> Wall friction was found to increase with the increasing load and weight of powder due to an increase in surface contact with the die wall. The coefficients of wall friction decreased from 0. 47 to 0. 36 for increasing weight of powder from 0. 8 – 1. 5 g.

40|$|Finite element {{method was}} {{employed}} to investigate the effect of process parameters of plastic deformation behavior in Forward-Backward-Radial Extrusion (FBRE) process. The result of an axisymmetric model shows that the friction between die components and the sample has a substantial effect on the material flow behavior. Although strain heterogeneity index (SHI) slightly decreases {{with an increase in}} friction, large portion of the sample experiences significant strain heterogeneity. Increasing the friction factor also localizes the strain heterogeneity effect in the backward section, and spread the effect in the forward section. Decreasing the friction in the FBRE process can reduce the amount of the strain heterogeneity in the product while decreases the required punch force substantially. Furthermore, an increase in gap thickness increases the deformation in the area close to the <b>lower</b> <b>punch</b> {{at the expense of the}} area in the vicinity of the upper punch.

40|$|Simple {{but still}} {{realistic}} physical models suitable for structural design of flat concrete plates and column footings {{with respect to}} punching are presented. Punching of a flat plate is assumed to occur when the concrete compression strain at the column edge due to the bending moment in the slab reaches a critical value that is considerably lower than the generally accepted ultimate compression strain 0. 0035 for one-way structures loaded in bending. In compact slabs such as column footings the compression strength of the inclined strut from the load to the column is governing instead. Both the strain limit and the inclined stress limit display a size-effect, i. e. the limit values decrease with increasing depth of the compression zone in the slab. Due respect is also paid to increasing concrete brittleness with increasing compression strength. The influence of the bending moment means that flat plates with rectangular panels display a <b>lower</b> <b>punching</b> capacity than flat plates with square panels – a case that is not recognized by current design codes. As a consequence, punching shall be checked {{for each of the}} two reinforcement directions separately if the bending moments differ. Since the theory can predict the punching load as well as the ultimate deflection of test specimens with good precision, it can also treat the case where a bending moment, so called unbalanced moment, is transferred from the slab to the column. This opens up for a safer design than with the prevailing method. It is proposed that the column rotation in relation to the slab shall be checked instead of the unbalanced moment for both gravity loading and imposed story drift due to lateral loads. However, the risk for punching failure is a great disadvantage with flat plates. The failure is brittle and occurs without warning in the form of extensive concrete cracking and increased deflection. Punching at one column may even initiate punching at adjacent columns as well, which would cause progressive collapse of the total structure. A novel reinforcement concept is therefore presented that gives flat plates a very ductile behaviour, which eliminates the risk for punching failure. The performance is verified by tests with monotonic as well as cyclic loading. QC 2010092...|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of slender flat slabs with minimised column dimensions lead to higher stresses {{in the vicinity of}} the loaded area. Therefore the application of punching shear reinforcement or prestressing is often necessary. Despite different design concepts in international building codes the punching shear resistance without shear reinforcement shows only minor differences. In contrast considerable differences can be observed for the maximum punching shear capacity of stirrups as shear reinforcement. For the experimental verification 21 punching tests on interior and edge column-slab connections with and without prestressing have been performed. Stirrups, double-headed studs, lattice girders, steel plates and shearheads have been used as shear reinforcement. The experimental investigations and the comparison with tests from literature prove that the anchorage behaviour of the shear reinforcement significantly influences the punching shear capacity of thin flat slabs. This applies in particular for the usable design steel stress and therefore the efficiency of the punching shear reinforcement. Furthermore the tests with double-headed studs and steel plates showed higher punching shear capacities with increasing amount of shear reinforcement {{in the vicinity of the}} column due to decreased shear crack widths. The calculation of the maximum punching shear capacity in analogy to the capacity of the concrete compression strut of beams as used in Eurocode 2 leads to inapplicable results for all investigated types of punching shear reinforcement. The evaluation of the test results proves that in dependence of the geometric parameters noticeable higher as well as <b>lower</b> <b>punching</b> shear resistances can be observed. In fact, the maximum punching shear capacity is limited by the resistance of the concrete compression zone at the column face. Therefore, the maximum punching shear capacity should be described by a multiple of the punching shear capacity without shear reinforcement. This will lead to applicable results for slabs with thin to medium slab heights. For thick slabs the influence of the anchorage behaviour will decrease. The numerical investigations on prestressed slabs showed good correlation between the punching shear resistance and the slab rotation at the column face due to prestressing. The consideration of the vertical components of inclined tendons at the control perimeter as often used in building codes is not appropriate. However the evaluation according to DIN 1045 - 1 reveals a sufficient safety level. For shear-reinforced flat slabs with prestressing the experimental investigations showed that the entire addition of the bearing capacities due to prestressing and shear reinforcement is not admissible...|$|R

50|$|Tablet presses, {{also called}} {{tableting}} machines, range from small, inexpensive bench-top models that make one tablet {{at a time}} (single-station presses), with only around a half-ton pressure, to large, computerized, industrial models (multi-station rotary presses) that can make hundreds of thousands to millions of tablets an hour with much greater pressure. The tablet press is an essential piece of machinery for any pharmaceutical and nutraceutical manufacturer. Common manufacturers of tablet presses include Natoli, Stokes, Fette Compacting, Korsch, Kikusui, Manesty, B&D, PTK, IMA and Courtoy. Tablet presses must allow the operator to adjust {{the position of the}} <b>lower</b> and upper <b>punches</b> accurately, so that the tablet weight, thickness and density can each be controlled. This is achieved using a series of cams, rollers, and/or tracks that act on the tablet tooling (punches). Mechanical systems are also incorporated for die filling, and for ejecting and removing the tablets from the press after compression. Pharmaceutical tablet presses are required to be easy to clean and quick to reconfigure with different tooling, because they are usually used to manufacture many different products.There are 2 main standards of tablet tooling used in pharmaceutical industry: American standard ‘TSM’ and European standard ‘EU’. TSM and EU configurations are similar to each other but cannot be interchanged.|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} flat slabs are {{a common}} structural system for cast-in-place concrete slabs. Failures in punching shear near the column regions are typically governing at ultimate. In case no punching shear or integrity reinforcement is placed, failures in punching develop normally in a brittle manner with almost no warning signs. Furthermore, the residual strength after punching is, in general, significantly <b>lower</b> than the <b>punching</b> load. Thus, punching of a single column of a flat slab overloads adjacent columns and can potentially lead to their failure on punching, thus triggering the progressive collapse of the structure. Over the past decades, several collapses have been reported due to punching shear failures, resulting in human casualties and extensive damage. Other than placing conventional punching shear reinforcement, the deformation capacity and residual strength after punching can also be enhanced by placing integrity reinforcement to avoid progressive collapses of flat slabs. This paper presents the main results of an extensive experimental campaign performed at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) {{on the role of}} integrity reinforcement by means of 20 slabs with dimensions of 1500 x 1500 x 125 mm (≈ 5 ft x 5 ft x 5 in.) and various integrity reinforcement layouts.
