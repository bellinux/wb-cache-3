25|$|The line is {{monitored}} from the Operations Control Center (OCC). Responsibility for controlling service {{is shared by}} the control room and field personnel along the right of way. Track circuit and signal indications are not transmitted to the operational personnel sites. In lieu of track circuit indications, the AVI system is displayed {{in the control room}} to provide a periodic update to train position wherever AVI detectors exist. The AVI system user interface was solely text based until the current control room was opened, in which a new schematic display based on AVI data was instituted. Track circuit indications are available digitally in signal houses at the Park Street interlocking, at the new North Station interlocking, and at the new Kenmore interlocking, but are not transmitted to OCC. In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to add full vehicle <b>location</b> <b>tracking</b> on the Green Line for countdown signs and smartphone applications, including using AVI data in the tunnels and GPS receivers on the surface lines. The first real-time data—location data on the surface lines—became available in October 2014. Full tracking is expected by early 2015.|$|E

40|$|Most {{large scale}} traffic {{information}} systems rely on fixed sensors (e. g. loop detectors, cameras) and user generated data, this latter {{in the form}} of GPS traces sent by smartphones or GPS devices onboard vehicles. While this type of data is relatively inexpensive to gather, it can pose multiple security and privacy risks, even if the <b>location</b> <b>tracks</b> are anonymous. In particular, creating bogus <b>location</b> <b>tracks</b> and sending them to the system is relatively easy. This bogus data could perturb traffic flow estimates, and disrupt the transportation system whenever these estimates are used for actuation. In this article, we propose a new framework for solving a variety of privacy and cybersecurity problems arising in transportation systems. The state of traffic is modeled by the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards traffic flow model, which is a first order scalar conservation law with concave flux function. Given a set of traffic flow data, we show that the constraints resulting from this partial differential equation are mixed integer linear inequalities for some decision variable. The resulting framework is very flexible, and can in particular be used to detect spoofing attacks in real time, or carry out attacks on <b>location</b> <b>tracks.</b> Numerical implementations are performed on experimental data from the Mobile Century experiment to validate this framework. © 2013 ACM...|$|R

40|$|Current onsite safety {{management}} always relies on time-consuming predefinitions of hazardous zones {{based on the}} managers' personal capabilities. However, in a typical labor-intensive industry such as construction, the workers themselves can provide {{a wealth of information}} for hazard identification. Historical accident-free working locations on site provide a valuable means of recognizing safe workplaces. This paper presents an approach to the automated classification of construction site zones derived from the <b>location</b> <b>tracks</b> of workers collected from a real-time location system (RTLS). Through data mining, filtering and analysis, the <b>location</b> <b>tracks</b> are transformed into grid density maps and continuous density maps. These illustrate the characteristics of spatial-temporal activities onsite as well as providing a visual representation of the distribution of safe and hazardous individual workplaces. A personnel hazard map is generated automatically based on historical accident-free <b>location</b> <b>tracks</b> from a field project using the proposed approach. Compared with the actual workplaces in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity, the evaluation result reveals that the hazardous areas on a construction site can be automatically classified to improve the workplace management of individual workers. The contributions of this research include an automated zone classification algorithm and an evaluation framework consisting of four indicators for hazard awareness onsite.

2500|$|In {{ethics and}} politics, Deleuze again echoes Spinoza, albeit in a sharply Nietzschean key. In a {{classical}} liberal model of society, morality begins from individuals, who bear abstract natural rights or duties set by themselves or a God. Following his rejection of any metaphysics based on identity, Deleuze criticizes {{the notion of}} an individual as an arresting or halting of differentiation (as the etymology of the word [...] "individual" [...] suggests). Guided by the naturalistic ethics of Spinoza and Nietzsche, Deleuze instead seeks to understand individuals and their moralities as products of the organization of pre-individual desires and powers. In the two volumes of Capitalism and Schizophrenia, Deleuze and Guattari describe history as a congealing and regimentation of [...] "desiring-production" [...] (a concept combining features of Freudian drives and Marxist labor) into the modern individual (typically neurotic and repressed), the nation-state (a society of continuous control), and capitalism (an anarchy domesticated into infantilizing commodification). Deleuze, following Karl Marx, welcomes capitalism's destruction of traditional social hierarchies as liberating, but inveighs against its homogenization of all values to the aims of the market. [...] In a 1990 Postscript on the Societies of Control, Deleuze claims that institutions and technologies introduced since World War II have moved social coercion and discipline from only physical enclosures (such as schools, factories, prisons, office buildings, etc.) into the lives of individuals considered as [...] "masses, samples, data, markets, or 'banks'." [...] The mechanisms of modern [...] "societies of control" [...] will be continuous, following and tracking individuals throughout their existence via transaction records, mobile <b>location</b> <b>tracking,</b> and other personally identifiable information.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Integral {{projections}} {{reduce the}} size of input data by transforming 2 D images into significantly simpler 1 D signals, while retaining useful information to solve important computer vision problems like object detection, <b>location,</b> and <b>tracking.</b> However, previous attempts typically rely on simple heuristic analysis such as searching for minima or maxima in the resulting projections. We introduce a more rigorous and formal modeling framework based on a small set of integral projections –thus, we will call them 1. 5 D models – and show that this model-based analysis overcomes many of the difficulties and limitations of alternative projection methods. The proposed approach proves to be particularly adequate for the specific domain of human face processing. The problems of face detection, facial feature <b>location,</b> and <b>tracking</b> in video sequences are studied under the unifying proposed framework. Key words: 1. 5 D object models, integral projections, face detection, facial feature <b>location,</b> face <b>tracking.</b> ...|$|R
