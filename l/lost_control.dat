5|$|DRS was enabled on the 24th lap. Although Hamilton {{had closed}} Rosberg's lead {{to half a}} second and used the system, he could not pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a {{problematic}} pit stop that lap, as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front wheel nut correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On the 27th lap, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> of his rear end; his brakes locked, and {{he went into the}} turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin without trying to pass. Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and Hamilton got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> heading into the pit-lane straight.|$|E
