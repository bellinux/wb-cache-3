6000|$|MY DEAR, DEAR, DARLING CHARLEY,--I cannot {{tell you}} how much my heart [...] has yearned to see you, or hear from you, for many long, long months [...] past. Your last {{delightful}} letter, which I treasure up as the most [...] precious object I possess, has indeed explained to me how utterly [...] impossible it was to have written a day sooner than you did; but that [...] does not comfort me a bit, or make those weary packets more rapid and [...] frequent in their movements, or the time that passes between the [...] periods of hearing from you less dreary and anxious. God bless and [...] protect you, my darling, {{in the midst of all}} the dangers that surround [...] you. But I did not intend to begin this letter by murmuring, so pray [...] forgive me, and I shall try to atone for it by giving you a minute [...] account of everybody here about whom you are interested. Our beloved [...] father and mother, I am thankful to say, are quite well. Papa has [...] taken more than ever to smoking since you went away. He is seldom out [...] of the summer-house in the garden now, where I very frequently go, and [...] spend hours together in reading to and talking with him. He very [...] often speaks of you, and I am certain that he misses you far more than [...] we expected, although I think he cannot miss you nearly so much as I [...] do. For some weeks past, indeed ever since we got your last letter, [...] papa was engaged all the forenoon in some mysterious work, for he used [...] to lock himself up in the summer-house--a thing he never did before. [...] One day I went there at my usual time, and instead of having to wait [...] till he should unlock the door, I found it already open, and entered [...] the room, which was so full of smoke that I could hardly see. I found [...] papa writing at a small table, and the moment he heard my footstep he [...] jumped up with a fierce frown and shouted, [...] "Who's there?" [...] in that [...] terrible voice that he used to speak in long ago when angry with his [...] men, but which he has almost quite given up for some time past. He [...] never speaks to me, as you know very well, but in the kindest tones, [...] so you may imagine what a dreadful fright I got for a moment; but it [...] was only for a moment, because the instant he saw that it was me his [...] dear face changed, and he folded me in his arms, saying, [...] "Ah, Kate, [...] forgive me, my darling! I did not know it was you, and I thought I [...] had locked the door, and was angry at being so unceremoniously [...] interrupted." [...] He then told me he was just finishing a letter of [...] advice to you, and going up to the table, pushed the papers hurriedly [...] into a drawer. As he did so I guessed what had been his mysterious [...] occupation, for he seemed to have covered quires of paper with the [...] closest writing. Ah, Charley, you're a lucky fellow to be able to [...] extort such long letters from our dear father. You know how difficult [...] he finds it to write even the shortest note, and you remember his old [...] favourite expression, [...] "I would rather skin a wild buffalo bull alive [...] than write a long letter." [...] He deserves long ones in return, Charley; [...] but I need not urge you on that score--you are an excellent [...] correspondent. Mamma is able to go out every day now for a drive in [...] the prairie. She was confined to the house for nearly three weeks [...] <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> <b>with</b> some sort of illness that the doctor did not seem to [...] understand, and at one time I was much frightened, and very, very [...] anxious about her, she became so weak. It would have made your heart [...] glad to have seen the tender way in which papa nursed her through the [...] illness. I had fancied that he was the very last man in the world to [...] make a sick-nurse, so bold and quick in his movements, and with such a [...] loud, gruff voice--for it is gruff, although very sweet at the same [...] time. But the moment he began to tend mamma he spoke more softly even [...] than dear Mr Addison does, and he began to walk about the house on [...] tiptoe, and persevered so long in this latter that all his moccasins [...] began to be worn out at the toes, while the heels remained quite [...] strong. I begged of him often not to take so much trouble, as I was [...] naturally the proper nurse for mamma; but he wouldn't hear of it, and [...] insisted on carrying breakfast, dinner, and tea to her, besides giving [...] her all her medicine. He was for ever making mistakes, however, much [...] to his own sorrow, the darling man; and I had to watch him pretty [...] closely, for more than once he has been on the point of giving mamma a [...] glass of laudanum in mistake for a glass of port wine. I was a good [...] deal frightened for him at first, as, before he became accustomed to [...] the work, he tumbled over the chairs and tripped on the carpets while [...] carrying trays with dinners and breakfasts, till I thought he would [...] really injure himself at last; and then he was so terribly angry with [...] himself at making such a noise and breaking the dishes--I think he has [...] broken nearly an entire dinner and tea set of crockery. Poor George, [...] the cook, has suffered most from these mishaps--for you know that dear [...] papa cannot get angry without letting a little of it out upon [...] somebody; and whenever he broke a dish or let a tray fall, he used to [...] rush into the kitchen, shake his fist in George's face, and ask him, [...] in a fierce voice, what he meant by it. But he always got better in a [...] few seconds, and finished off by telling him never to mind, that he [...] was a good servant on the whole, and he wouldn't say any more about it [...] just now, but he had better look sharp out and not do it again. I [...] must say, in praise of George, that on such occasions he looked very [...] sorry indeed, and said he hoped that he would always do his best to [...] give him satisfaction. This was only proper in him, for he ought to [...] be very thankful that our father restrains his anger so much; for you [...] know he was rather violent once, and you've no idea, Charley, how [...] great a restraint he now lays on himself. He seems to me quite like a [...] lamb, and I am beginning to feel somehow as if we had been mistaken, [...] and that he never was a passionate man at all. I think it is partly [...] owing to dear Mr Addison, who visits us very frequently now, and papa [...] and he are often shut up together for many hours in the smoking-house. [...] I was sure that papa would soon come to like him, for his religion is [...] so free from everything like severity or affected solemnity. The [...] cook, and Rosa, and my dog that you named Twist, are all quite well. [...] The last has grown into a very large and beautiful animal, something [...] like the stag-hound in the picture-book we used to study together long [...] ago. He is exceedingly fond of me, and I feel him to be quite a [...] protector. The cocks and hens, the cow and the old mare, are also in [...] perfect health; so now, having told you a good deal about ourselves, I [...] will give you a short account of the doings in the colony.|$|E
