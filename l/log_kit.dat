Her eyes sparkled with excitement, but Kit felt half embarrassed because he did not know whether he had persuaded her to venture on an undignified adventure or she had persuaded him. It was a relief to hear her laugh.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} two algorithms {{that enables}} the MemoryLane system to support persons with mild dementia through creation of digital life stories. The MemoryLane system consists of a <b>Logging</b> <b>Kit</b> that captures context and image data, and a Review Client that recognizes activities and enables review of the captured data. The image filtering algorithm is based on image characteristics such as brightness, blurriness and similarity, and is a central component of the <b>Logging</b> <b>Kit.</b> The activity recognition algorithm {{is based on the}} captured contextual data together with concepts of persons and places. The initial results indicate that the MemoryLane system is technically feasible and that activity-based creation of digital life stories for persons with mild dementia is possible.

50|$|Bruce Ward {{was born}} and raised in Aroostook County, and founded the Northern Cedar Company, a lumber mill, in 1927. His early {{business}} focused on the production of peeled logs for use as telephone poles, and company lore holds that excess inventory prompted him to consider using them in building construction. The first structure his company built was an American Legion hall in Yarmouth, Maine, in 1931; this summer house was built in 1932 for his family. Two houses, built for year-round occupancy, were later built for the family in Presque Isle. Ward began advertising <b>log</b> home <b>kits</b> in 1935, shipping his products as far away as Wisconsin. Ward's company was sold out of the family after his death in 1944, and is now known as Ward Cedar Log Homes.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{none of the}} {{traditional}} kit house companies are still in business, pre-cut <b>log</b> home <b>kits</b> are offered {{by a number of}} manufacturers. And beginning in 2006, for a few years Lowe's supplied plans and materials (not pre-cut) for small stick-built homes called Katrina Cottages, with walls designed to withstand 140 mile-per-hour winds, intended to provide temporary housing for Gulf Coast residents who had lost their homes to Hurricane Katrina. Initially offered through Lowe's stores in Mississippi and Louisiana, in 2008 Lowe's began offering the cottages at all of its stores nationwide. However, although initially [...] "hailed as the new Sears & Roebuck house," [...] the program faced strong opposition from local governments in the Gulf Coast region who feared the cottages would lower property values, and by mid-2011, Lowe's had discontinued its product line.|$|R
