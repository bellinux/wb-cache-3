25|$|MPEG-2 doubles {{the number}} of {{sampling}} rates which are supported and MPEG-2.5 adds 3 more. When this was written, the suggested implementations were quite dated. Implementers of the standard were supposed to devise their own algorithms suitable for removing parts of {{the information from the}} audio input. As a result, many different MP3 encoders became available, each producing files of differing quality. Comparisons were widely available, so it was easy for a prospective user of an encoder to research the best choice. Some encoders that were proficient at encoding at higher bit rates (such as LAME) were not necessarily as good at lower bit rates. Over time, LAME evolved on the SourceForge website until it became the de facto CBR MP3 encoder. Later an ABR mode was added. Work progressed on true variable bit rate using a quality goal between 0 and 10. Eventually numbers (such as -V 9.600) could generate excellent quality <b>low</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> voice encoding at only 41kbit/s using the MPEG-2.5 extensions.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{introduce}} a novel coding technique which significantly improves {{the performance of}} the traditional vector quantisation (VQ) schemes at <b>low</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates.</b> High interblock correlation in natural images results in a high probability that neighbouring image blocks are mapped to small subsets of the VQ codebook, which contains highly correlated codevectors. If, instead of the whole VQ codebook, a small subset is considered for the purpose of encoding neighbouring blocks, it is possible to improve the performance of traditional VQ schemes significantly. The performance improvement obtained with the new method is about 3 dB on average when compared with traditional VQ schemes at <b>low</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates.</b> The method provides better performance than the JPEG coding standard at <b>low</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates,</b> and gives comparable results with much less complexity than address VQ...|$|R
40|$|The {{modified}} Differential Pulse Coded Modulation (DPCM) codec with multi-rate processing {{has been}} shown to able to code source with monotonically decreasing spectrum efficiently at <b>low</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> [1].

25|$|When {{performing}} lossy audio encoding, such {{as creating}} an MP3 data stream, {{there is a}} trade-off {{between the amount of}} data generated and the sound quality of the results. The person generating an MP3 selects a bit rate, which specifies how many kilobits per second of audio are desired. The higher the bit rate, the larger the MP3 data stream will be, and, generally, the closer it will sound to the original recording. With too low a bit rate, compression artifacts (i.e., sounds that were not present in the original recording) may be audible in the reproduction. Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks. When this type of audio is compressed, artifacts such as ringing or pre-echo are usually heard. A sample of applause compressed or an excerpt of triangle instrument with a relatively <b>low</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> provides a good example of compression artifacts. Most subjective testings on perceptual codecs tend to avoid using this type of extremely critical sound materials however this type of artifacts generated by percussive sounds is barely perceptible on the MP3 format due to the specific temporal masking feature of the 32 sub-band filterbank of Layer II on which the MP3 format is based.|$|E
