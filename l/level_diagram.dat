The electron transfer series would terminate with a low (non-radiative decay) of the energy The alternatives for producing an AND gate, using molecular photphysics, are two.(1) The emission produced by the electron drop from C*C (h) is not a valid output frequency.

5000|$|The red HeNe laser {{wavelength}} of 633 nm has an actual vacuum {{wavelength of}} 632.991 nm, or about 632.816 nm in air. The wavelengths of the stimulated emission modes lie within about 0.001 nm {{above or below}} this value, and the wavelengths of those modes shift within this range due to {{thermal expansion and contraction}} of the cavity. Frequency-stabilized versions enable the wavelength of a single mode to be specified to within 1 part in 108 by the technique of comparing the powers of two longitudinal modes in opposite polarizations. Absolute stabilization of the laser's frequency (or wavelength) as fine as 2.5 parts in 1011 can be obtained through use of an iodine absorption cell.The mechanism producing population inversion and light amplification in a HeNe laser plasma originates with inelastic collision of energetic electrons with ground state helium atoms in the gas mixture. As shown in the accompanying energy <b>level</b> <b>diagram,</b> these collisions excite helium atoms from the ground state to higher energy excited states, among them the 23S1 and 21S0 (LS or Russell-Saunder coupling, front number 2 tells that an excited electron is n = 2 state) in long-lived metastable states. Because of a fortuitous near coincidence between the energy levels of the two He metastable states, and the 5s2 and 4s2 (Paschen notation [...] ) levels of neon, collisions between these helium metastable atoms and ground state neon atoms results in a selective and efficient transfer of excitation energy from the helium to neon. This excitation energy transfer process is given by the reaction equations: ...|$|E

40|$|In many multiobjective {{optimization}} problems, the Pareto Fronts and Sets {{contain a}} large number of solutions and this makes it difficult for the decision maker to identify the preferred ones. A possible way to alleviate this difficulty is to present to the decision maker a subset of a small number of solutions representatives of the Pareto Front characteristics. In this paper, a two-steps procedure is presented, aimed at identifying a limited number of representative solutions to be presented to the decision maker. Pareto Front solutions are first clustered into "families", which are then synthetically represented by a "head-of-the-family" solution. <b>Level</b> <b>Diagrams</b> are then used to represent, analyse and interpret the Pareto Front reduced to its head-of-the-family solutions.
