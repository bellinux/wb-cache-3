A statement from Bush's spokesperson states that Bush [...] "did not approve of her inclusion in this advertisement nor is she associated with the group that made the ad in any way.

500|$|The season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} among television critics. Speaking of the premiere, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV {{noted that the}} special foreshadowed a [...] "very dark" [...] season, adding: [...] "The talk between George's mom {{and one of the}} surgeons [...] proved {{to be one of the}} more heart-breaking scenes in an episode that in itself is heartbreaking enough." [...] In contrast, Kelly West of TV Blend was critical of the premiere, writing: [...] "I don’t think based on the first episode that we can say that Grey's is headed in a new direction, nor do I think the writers are making much of an effort to bring the series back to the greatness that was its earlier seasons. That said, this is Grey's Anatomy and with that comes the usual drama, sex, love and whacky medical mysteries thrown in the mix to keep things moving. If that's what you’re looking for, I think you’ll enjoy the season premiere just fine." [...] Capshaw's performance this season was praised, with The TV Addict calling her [...] "immensely likeable". Although [...] "Sympathy for the Parents" [...] was the least viewed episode, TV Fanatic called the episode [...] "touching", praising Chambers' performance. TV Fanatics reaction to the season was fairly mixed, with Steve Marsi saying that Grey's Anatomy was facing an identity crisis after viewing [...] "Give Peace a Chance". He said that: [...] "Still popular but lacking its past magic, it's trying to decide what to become. All we can say is that if it becomes what we saw 12 hours ago, we are all for it. Last week saw the doctors plunging into ER-style chaos with 12 different doctors giving 12 different accounts of one case. <b>Last</b> <b>night,</b> <b>we</b> saw something else equally unusual." [...] He praised Patrick Dempsey's performance, saying: [...] "Again, it was a single case that took up the entire hour, but instead of 12 doctors' version of events, the focus was largely on just one, and the best one: Dr. Derek Shepherd. Patrick Dempsey's McDreamy character may be eye candy, but he's got substance. Last night's episode proved that in spades, and was one of the series' best in some time." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 30, 2013, del Toro {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} developing Hellboy 3 at Legendary Pictures. He stated: [...] "I hate giving pieces about it, but <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> <b>we</b> were at dinner and Ron said, 'I would be very happy to do Hellboy again, when are we doing Hellboy 3? Thomas Tull said, 'I {{would love to see}} Hellboy 3.' He didn't say he would love to do it he just said he'd like to see it, but today, I'll ask him." [...] Ron Perlman added his support for the idea, stating: [...] "Not just anybody can make this movie. I loved working for Legendary and I know for Guillermo working on Pacific Rim was one of his greatest experiences. The reason I loved working for them is because Guillermo was so happy. I came in six months into the shoot and he seemed as fresh as a daisy, simply because he was working for someone who appreciated and supported his outlandish visions of what he wanted to put on the screen. My immediate, silent wish was, wouldn't it be great if these guys came in and helped resolve the Hellboy series." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} from a year of study at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence (cut short by the First World War), Schmitt returned to Warren, where he received a number of commissions from prominent local citizens including Joseph G. Butler, Jr. and Henry K. Wick. In 1916 Schmitt returned to New York, where he established a studio in the Stuyvesant Square neighborhood. Hart Crane, then an unknown poet and newly arrived in New York, was a frequent visitor to Schmitt’s studio apartment {{in the early part}} of 1917. Crane and Schmitt had met in Warren the previous year through Crane’s aunt and Schmitt’s patron Zell Hart Deming. Just before moving to New York, Crane wrote to Schmitt about his life in Cleveland, Ohio. In one of his first letters to his mother from New York, Crane wrote, “Carl is a more wonderful man than you have any idea. A tremendous thinker!” A little later he wrote to his father: “Nearly every evening since my advent has been spent in the companionship of Carl. <b>Last</b> <b>night...</b> <b>we</b> talked until twelve, or after, behind our pipes. He has some splendid ideas.” Crane got to know some of the poets and writers in Schmitt's circle, including Conrad Aiken. Although they would each pursue their own interests and friends in later years, Schmitt and Crane carried on an extensive correspondence, Crane sending drafts of his poems to Schmitt for his review. They saw each other for the last time in 1925 in New York with Zell Hart Deming. Crane described his friend at this meeting: [...] "He was as always, looked and acted exactly the same as we remember him." [...] A portrait of Crane by Schmitt, done almost 50 years later, is now in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E
