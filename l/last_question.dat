2500|$|The [...] "false-photograph" [...] task {{is another}} task {{that serves as}} a measure of theory of mind development. In this task, {{children}} must reason about what is represented in a photograph that differs from the current state of affairs. [...] Within the false-photograph task, either a location or identity change exists. In the location-change task, the examiner puts an object in one location (e.g., chocolate in an open green cupboard), whereupon the child takes a Polaroid photograph of the scene. [...] While the photograph is developing, the examiner moves the object to a different location (e.g., a blue cupboard), allowing the child to view the examiner's action. [...] The examiner asks the child two control questions: [...] "When we first took the picture, where was the object?" [...] and [...] "Where is the object now?". [...] The subject is also asked a [...] "false-photograph" [...] question: [...] "Where is the object in the picture?" [...] The child passes the task if he/she correctly identifies the location of the object in the picture and the actual location of the object {{at the time of the}} question. However, the <b>last</b> <b>question</b> might be misinterpreted as: [...] "Where in this room is the object that the picture depicts?"

2500|$|The defense's chief {{expert witness}} was Fredric Wertham, a {{psychiatrist}} {{with an emphasis}} on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1–24). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly [...] "sacrificing" [...] a boy would be penance for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but {{he turned out to be}} larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy. Wertham then detailed Fish's cannibalism, which in his mind he associated with communion. The <b>last</b> <b>question</b> Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered [...] "He is insane". Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the difference between right and wrong. He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an [...] "insane knowledge". The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham's findings.|$|E
2500|$|The ethical and/or moral {{premises}} of healthcare {{are complex and}} intricate. To consolidate such {{a large segment of}} moral philosophy, it becomes important to focus on what separates healthcare ethics from other forms of morality. And on the whole, {{it can be said that}} healthcare itself is a [...] "special" [...] institution within society. With that said, healthcare ought to [...] "be treated differently from other social goods" [...] in a society. It is an institution of which we are all a part whether we like it or not. At some point in every person's life, a decision has to be made regarding one's healthcare. Can they afford it? Do they deserve it? Do they need it? Where should they go to get it? Do they even want it? And it is this <b>last</b> <b>question</b> which poses the biggest dilemma facing a person. After weighing all of the costs and benefits of her healthcare situation, the person has to decide if the costs of healthcare outweigh the benefits. More than basic economic issues are at stake in this conundrum. In fact, a person must decide whether or not their life is ending or if it is worth salvaging. Of course, in instances where the patient is unable to decide due to medical complications, like a coma, then the decision must come from elsewhere. And defining that [...] "elsewhere" [...] has proven to be a very difficult endeavor in healthcare philosophy.|$|E

2500|$|One India gave a {{positive}} review saying [...] "The music of Raaz – TMC indeed impresses, the soundtrack here {{is yet another}} good addition to the enviable music catalogue of the Bhatts and Emraan would certainly have some more chartbusters to add to his name. As for the <b>last</b> <b>question</b> i.e. whether Raaz – TMC matches up to Nadeem-Shravan's Raaz, then well, let's {{put it this way}} that albums like Aashiqui, Raaz or a Saajan are made only once and there shouldn't even be a conscious effort to replicate or surpass them. In this regard, the music of Raaz – TMC has its own place under the sun and what matters in the end is whether it works for the film or not. Well, the answer for this one is a firm Yes! Thaindian News also reviewed the music for the film. They said [...] "“Soniyo" [...] is the best number of the album. Sung by Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghoshal, the pleasant track moves at a very steady pace. Kumar keeps the lyrics as simple as the composition and it gives the singers ample space. Consisting mainly of melodic, slow paced tracks, the frontrunners of this album are two fast numbers. Both [...] "O Jaana" [...] and [...] "Soniyo" [...] are the highlights of the pack.

Their new question was about the first man to travel to space twice, and the correct answer to the question was Gus Grissom. They decided not to risk it this time and walked away with the £500,000. This amount is the highest amount that any celebrity couple has won on any British edition of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? The £468,000 they originally lost was also the greatest loss ever seen on the show, and no other contestant has ever answered the final question incorrectly in the United Kingdom version. The allegedly misleading question was [...] "Translated from the Latin, what is the United States motto?" [...] The answer given was [...] "In God We Trust" [...] which is originally English and has in fact been the motto of the United States since 1956.
