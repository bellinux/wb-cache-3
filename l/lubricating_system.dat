5000|$|Not all engines {{have the}} same oiling needs. High {{performance}} engines, for example, place higher stress on the <b>lubricating</b> <b>system.</b> In this case, the <b>lubricating</b> <b>system</b> must be especially robust to prevent engine damage. [...] Most engines in {{cars on the road}} today don’t run much past 5,000-6,000 rpm, but that isn’t always the case in performance engines, where engine speeds could reach up to 8000-9000 rpm. In engines like these, it is imperative that the oil circulates quickly enough, or air may become trapped in the oil. Also, to free up power, some engines in performance applications run lower weight oil, which requires less power to run the oil pump. Common oil weights in engines today are usually either 5w30 or 10w30 oil, whereas performance engines might use 0w20 oil, which is less viscous.|$|E

The particular requirements were specified by TFE with the aim of designing an advanced tram system tailored for the needs of Edinburgh.

5000|$|A {{supply of}} {{lubricating}} oil must be fed to the crankcase {{to supply the}} crankshaft bearings. Since the crankcase {{is also used to}} supply air to the engine, the engine's lubricating oil is carried into the cylinder with the air charge, burnt during combustion and carried out of the exhaust. The oil carried from the crankcase to the cylinder is used to lubricate the piston. This means that a two-stroke hot-bulb engine will gradually burn its supply of lubricating oil, a design known as a [...] "total-loss" [...] <b>lubricating</b> <b>system.</b> There were also designs that employed a scavenge pump or similar to remove oil from the crankcase and return it to the lubricating-oil reservoir. Lanz hot-bulb tractors and their many imitators had this feature. This reduced oil consumption considerably.|$|E

50|$|A vacuum {{ceramic filter}} is {{designed}} to separate liquids from solids for dewatering purposes. The device consists of a rotator, slurry tank, ceramic filter plate, distributor, discharge scraper, cleaning device, frame, agitating device, pipe system, vacuum system, automatic acid dosing system, automatic <b>lubricating</b> <b>system,</b> valve and discharge chute.

The disc material is inert, has a long operational life and is resistant to almost all chemicals. Performance can be optimized by taking into account all those factors which affect the overall efficiency of the separation process. Some of the variables affecting the performance of a vacuum ceramic filter include the solid concentration, speed rotation of the disc, slurry level in the feed basin, temperature of the feed slurry, and the pressure during dewatering stages and filter cake formation.|$|E
