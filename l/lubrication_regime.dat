50|$|Elastohydrodynamic lubrication: Mostly for nonconforming {{surfaces}} {{or higher}} load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact. Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost parallel gap for the fluid to flow through. Much as in hydrodynamic lubrication, {{the motion of}} the contacting bodies generates a flow induced pressure, which acts as the bearing force over the contact area. In such high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably. At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated lubricant film completely separates the surfaces. Contact between raised solid features, or asperities, can occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or boundary <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime.</b> In addition to Reynolds equation, elastohydrodynamic theory considers the elastic deflection equation, since in this regime elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes significantly to the lubricant film thickness.|$|E

The knowledge of the <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime</b> is essential for the improvement of the performance of high pressure vane pumps by reducing wear, increasing the volumetric efficiency and decreasing maintenance costs.

The proposed methodology is based on Archard’s law and takes advantage of wear experimental measurements, an empirical model for the estimation of contact pressure forces and hardness standard tests. The results of the analysis state that low wear and reduced friction can be obtained if elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication between vanes and pressure ring is established.

Three ionic liquids (ILs) were selected, namely, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methyl imidazolium ethylsulfate ([EMIM][EtSO 4]), 1 -ethyl- 3 -methyl imidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate ([EMIM] [FAP]), and 1 -hexyl- 3 -methyl imidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate ([HMIM][FAP]), to investigate the influence of hygroscopic and hydrophobic anions, as well as different alkyl chain lengths. We employed an extended surface forces apparatus (eSFA) to ascertain {{the structure of the}} confined films, whereas colloidal-probe lateral force microscopy (CPM) was used to measure shear forces in the nanosized contact between mica and a silica sphere. The presence of water, the anion, and the alkyl chain length of the imidazolium cation were found to influence the equilibrium structure of the nanoconfined film, as well as its dynamic properties. Adsorbed water appears to change both the ion-pair orientation and the slip condition for film-thickness transitions, that is, the resistance of the IL layers to being squeezed out from the contact. Three lubrication regimes have been identified: a boundary-film <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime</b> with the lowest friction, an intermediate <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime</b> that is highly dependent on the IL anion, and an isoviscous rigid hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime</b> (with Newtonian fluid-film behavior).

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{lubrication}} condition between seal faces directly affects the reliability, operating life and sealing performance of mechanical seals. Thus, {{the identification of}} <b>lubrication</b> <b>regimes</b> in face seals i. e. boundary lubrication (BL), mixed lubrication (ML) and hydrodynamic lubrication (HL) is of high importance for developing effective online condition monitoring approaches. This paper investigates the tribological behaviour and frictional characteristics of mechanical seals based on nonintrusive acoustic emission (AE) measurements. Mathematical models for AE generation mechanisms are derived based on the tribological behaviour and operating parameters of mechanical seals. They produce agreeable results with experimental data in explaining the types of AE signals observed in monitoring the face lubrication conditions. Frequency domain analysis of data shows that the viscous friction process generates more low frequency AE signals, whereas the asperity interactions show more high frequency AE. Moreover, the feasibility of using statistical parameters of the time domain data is shown to identify the <b>lubrication</b> <b>regimes</b> in face seals...|$|R
40|$|To ensure high device yields, wafer surface {{contamination}} and defects must be monitored and controlled {{during the entire}} process of semiconductor manufacturing. Particle surface concentrations on the wafers, mostly related to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) processes, must be kept at the lowest possible levels. Brush scrubber cleaning {{has the potential to}} achieve this goal. However, the particle removal mechanisms are still under discussion especially the removal of nano-sized particles. This paper investigates the interactions between the particle, the brush and the wafer surface and explores the potential and limitations of the brush scrubbing technique. Furthermore the effect of the various brush/wafer parameters on the particle removal efficiency (PRE) is studied. From a mechanistic viewpoint it is shown that brush scrubbing acts in a mixed <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime.</b> From an extensive analysis of the relevant forces and moments it can be concluded that in the hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime,</b> particles are removed by rolling under the dominant hydrodynamic drag force. In the boundary <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime,</b> particles can be removed by both rolling and lifting, mainly by the brush/particle van der Waals forces. The pH and the ionic strength of the cleaning fluid can influence the PRE. The chemical composition determines the electrostatic interactions of the particle once it is "kicked off" from the wafer surface: either the surface of the particles and the wafer carry the same charge and the particles remain in solution or the surface of the particles and the wafer has an opposite charge resulting in redeposition.

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of improving the}} performance of lubricated surfaces through surface texturing has been a topic of intense research in the latest years. Considerable efforts in both experimental and numerical works {{have been made to}} study the effects of micro-textures in load capacity, friction and wear. In the industry it has been {{known for a long time}} that some texturing is required in the liners of combustion engines to avoid stiction with the piston rings. The numerical simulation of that problem poses a challenge in modeling the intervening phenomena (cavitation, starvation, ring dynamics) and solving it efficiently. In this work we present numerical simulations of the piston ring/liner problem in the hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime</b> using the Elrod-Adams model and a mass-conserving algorithm. Realistic values are assumed for the parameters defining the problem. The formation of cavitation bubbles and its relation with the load-carrying capacity, friction and clearance is analyzed by considering different texture configurations and shapes in one-dimensional tests. Afterwards, two-dimensional dimpled surfaces are simulated for more than a hundred different texture configurations in the hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime</b> for several Stribeck numbers. A robust code accelerated by means of a multigrid implementation allowed the realization of this extensive study.

This research investigates into vibration responses of such bearings using a clustering technique for identifying different <b>lubrication</b> <b>regimes,</b> and consequently for assessing bearing lubrication conditions. It firstly understands that the vibration sources are mainly due to the nonlinear effects including micro asperity collisions and fluid shearing interactions. These excitations together with complicated vibration paths are difficult to be characterized in a linear way {{for the purpose of}} condition monitoring. Therefore, a clustering analysis technique is adopted to classify the vibration spectrum in high frequency ranges around 10 kHz into different representative responses that corresponds to different bearing modulus values and lubrication characteristics. In particular, the analysis allows sensitive signal components and sensor positions to be determined for monitoring the journal bearing effectively.
