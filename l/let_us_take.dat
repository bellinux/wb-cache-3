25|$|It is true {{there are}} cases in which, if we confine {{ourselves}} {{to the effects of}} the first order, the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>take,</b> for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers? … It is not on account of the evil of the first order {{that it is necessary to}} erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.|$|E

The label started to shelve the album {{until a few}} key radio stations started playing the song [...] "Lucky Denver Mint." [...] After Capitol Records decided not to release their next major-label album, the band left the label. At that time, Jimmy Eat World distributed their albums independently while on tour in Europe. Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, {{that was sort of}} a good thing, because it <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>take</b> control of what we needed to do.

Penney believed that Britain {{could not afford}} to develop a hydrogen bomb. Henry Tizard believed that the nation should focus on conventional forces instead of duplicating the nuclear capabilities of the American Strategic Air Command, which already defended Britain and Europe: [...] "We are a great nation, but if we continue to behave like a Great Power we shall soon cease to be a great nation. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>take</b> warning from the fate of the Great Powers of the past and not burst ourselves with pride." ...|$|E

2500|$|Electromagnetic waves (such as light), {{traveling}} in free space or another homogeneous isotropic non-attenuating medium, are properly described as transverse waves, meaning that a plane wave's {{electric field vector}} E and magnetic field H are in directions perpendicular to (or [...] "transverse" [...] to) the direction of wave propagation; E and H are also perpendicular to each other. Considering a monochromatic plane wave of optical frequency f (light of vacuum wavelength λ has a frequency of f = c/λ where c is the speed of light), <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>take</b> the direction of propagation as the z axis. Being a transverse wave the E and H fields must then contain components only in the x and y directions whereas Ez=Hz=0. Using complex (or phasor) notation, we understand the instantaneous physical electric and magnetic fields to be given by the real parts of the complex quantities occurring in the following equations. As a function of time t and spatial position z (since for a plane wave in the +z direction the fields have no dependence on x or y) these complex fields can be written as: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Delimited continuations are the {{meanings}} of delimited evaluation contexts in programming languages. We show they offer a uniform view of many scenarios that arise in systems programming, such as {{a request for a}} system service, an event handler for input/output, a snapshot of a process, a file system being read and updated, and a Web page. Explicitly recognizing these uses of delimited continuations helps us design a system of concurrent, isolated transactions where desirable features such as snapshots, undo, copy-on-write, reconciliation, and interposition fall out by default. It also <b>lets</b> <b>us</b> <b>take</b> advantage of efficient implementation techniques from programming-language research. The Zipper File System prototypes these ideas. ...|$|R
