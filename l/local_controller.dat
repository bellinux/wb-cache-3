The first officer of the USAir flight recalled hearing this conversation, but did not remember anyone being cleared to hold on the runway.|$|E

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{found that}} the {{probable}} cause of the accident was the procedures in use at the LAX control tower, which provided inadequate redundancy, leading {{to a loss of}} situational awareness by the <b>local</b> <b>controller.</b> The crash led directly to the NTSB's recommendation of using different runways for takeoffs and landings at LAX.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} constructing strategies to solve robot tasks. We use a planner along {{with a set of}} <b>local</b> task-level feedback <b>controllers</b> to create strategies that are robust and have globally convergent behavior. The planner and the <b>local</b> <b>controllers</b> can be interleaved during execution. The information gathered by the <b>local</b> <b>controllers</b> enables the creation of more robust paths, and the path ensures that the <b>local</b> <b>controllers</b> make progress globally. These <b>local</b> task-level feedback <b>controllers</b> are automatically created and updated from simulation models or from empirical trials. They handle the uncertainty and possibly time-varying dynamics that may be present during task execution. We present implementations of this approach in the planar pushing domain and in the non-holonomic planning and control domain.

With unified <b>local</b> <b>controllers,</b> automatic coordinated power control and mutual support among sub-systems under normal disturbances can be realized using local measurements.

25|$|The SkyWest {{aircraft}} was arriving at SFO after {{a flight from}} Modesto, California, and was cleared for a visual approach to runway 28R by NorCal approach control. After being switched over to the tower controller, SkyWest was cleared to land on runway 28R. At the same time, the Republic Airlines aircraft, bound for Los Angeles, California was instructed to taxi into position and hold for two minutes before takeoff clearance was also granted on the intersecting runway 1L. As the landing SkyWest aircraft passed the runway threshold the Republic Airlines {{aircraft was}} cleared for takeoff. Local procedures and FAA Order 7110.65 require the <b>local</b> <b>controller</b> {{to wait until the}} landing aircraft has passed through the intersection before clearing an aircraft for takeoff on one of the intersecting runways.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{prior to}} SkyWest 5569 {{reaching}} runway 24L, a Wings West aircraft had landed on 24R and was awaiting permission to cross 24L and taxi to the terminal. The <b>local</b> <b>controller</b> attempted {{to cross the}} Wings West aircraft but the crew had changed frequencies and did not answer, distracting the <b>local</b> <b>controller</b> as she attempted to reestablish communications. Shortly after 6 PM local time, as USAir Flight 1493 was making its final approach to LAX, the Metroliner was cleared by the <b>local</b> <b>controller</b> to taxi into its takeoff position on 24L {{at the intersection of}} taxiway 45, some [...] up from the runway threshold. After four attempts by the <b>local</b> <b>controller,</b> the Wings West aircraft finally responded to the tower and apologized for switching frequencies.

30|$|The local CMS {{consists}} of three parts: the <b>local</b> <b>controllers,</b> the I/O stations, and the local monitoring system of supplier. The <b>local</b> <b>controllers</b> are used to receive commands from the coordination controller and, thus, to achieve regional-level (380  V voltage level) coordination control; the I/O stations convert the protocol of the converter interface, collects data and sends control commands. The <b>local</b> <b>controllers</b> monitors the BESS in real-time by using the VxWorks embedded operating system. Additionally, at the local CMS layer, the PCS, battery and distribution-system operational statuses are monitored in real-time, and the upper-layer control instructions are promptly send to each control PCS unit. Overall, this hierarchical control system effectively guarantees the control precision and stability of the storage system.|$|R

2500|$|The NTSB's {{investigation}} of the crash revealed that the cockpit crew of the landing USAir jet {{could not see the}} commuter plane, which blended in with other airport lights. [...] The NTSB cited LAX's procedures which placed much of the responsibility for runways on the local controllers, which directly led to the loss of situational awareness by the <b>local</b> <b>controller.</b> The NTSB also noted that during the previous performance review a supervisor had noted four deficiencies in the <b>local</b> <b>controller</b> who ultimately worked the accident aircraft. These deficiencies were not addressed prior to the accident, and two of the deficiencies were apparent in the accident sequence—her loss of situational awareness and aircraft misidentification.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 27seconds {{later the}} Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS) issued an aural warning of an {{imminent}} collision, and the <b>local</b> <b>controller</b> instructed the SkyWest aircraft to stop, transmitting, [...] "uh, sky-, skywest uhh fifty seven forty one HOLD HOLD HOLD". The SkyWest aircraft {{came to a}} stop in the intersection of runways 1L and 28R, while Republic Airlines flight lifted off and overflew it.

40|$|Recently we {{developed}} supervisor localization, a top-down approach to distributed control of discrete-event systems. Its essence is {{the allocation of}} monolithic (global) control action among the local control strategies of individual agents. In this paper, we extend supervisor localization by considering partial observation; namely not all events are observable. Specifically, we employ the recently proposed concept of relative observability to compute a partial-observation monolithic supervisor, and then design a suitable localization procedure to decompose the supervisor into a set of <b>local</b> <b>controllers.</b> In the resulting <b>local</b> <b>controllers,</b> only observable events can cause state change. Further, to deal with large-scale systems, we combine the partial-observation supervisor localization with an efficient architectural synthesis approach: first compute a heterarchical array of partial-observation decentralized supervisors and coordinators, and then localize each of these supervisors/coordinators into <b>local</b> <b>controllers...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The NTSB's {{investigation}} of the crash revealed a failing system {{in the air and}} ground traffic control facilities at LAX: the ground radar system worked intermittently, and was not functioning {{at the time of the}} incident; the blind spot, from the control tower, when looking at the spot where SkyWest 5569 was waiting on the runway; the system for ground controllers in the tower to pass flight progress strips to the <b>local</b> <b>controller</b> did not support the local controller's workload; aircraft on runways were not required to turn on all their external lights until rolling for takeoff. [...] All these issues were rectified at LAX following this incident.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>local</b> <b>controller</b> who cleared both {{aircraft}} {{to use the}} same runway, Robin Lee Wascher, testified before the NTSB and accepted blame for causing the crash. She said she originally thought the landing USAir plane had been hit by a bomb, then [...] "realized something went wrong... I went to the supervisor and I said, 'I think this (the SkyWest plane) is what USAir hit.'" [...] She testified that rooftop lights in her line of sight caused glare in the tower, making it difficult to see small planes at the intersection where the SkyWest plane was positioned. Just before the accident, she confused the Skywest plane with another commuter airliner that was on a taxiway {{near the end of the}} runway. Making matters more difficult, the ground radar at LAX was not working on the day of the accident.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{economical}} {{and ecological}} constraints and ever-increasing power consumption stresses the power system to operate {{closer and closer}} to its safety and stability limits. Under such a stressed condition, voltage instability results from the inability of reaching a sustainable operating point in a controllable way, following a major disturbance in the power system, so that the steady-state post-disturbance system bus voltages are no longer acceptable.
