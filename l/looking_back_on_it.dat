500|$|Music for Captain Scarlet was {{composed}} by Barry Gray, an innovator in electronic music, who had scored all the Supermarionation series preceding it. The opening title sequence theme, [...] "The Mysterons", was rendered electronically {{and accompanied by}} a staccato drum beat to introduce the lead character of Captain Scarlet. This seven-note beat was also used to link scenes within episodes, and to cut to advertisement breaks, {{for which it was}} accompanied by a zooming image of the Spectrum logo as designed by Tony Dunsterville of the art department. On the subject of the beat, Anderson recalls, [...] "When I went to the recording session, I heard the drum beat he had come up with and I thought, 'Christ, is this all he could produce?' <b>Looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> however, I can see that what he came up with worked very well." ...|$|E
500|$|It took [...] "fifteen man-years" [...] {{and three}} actual {{years to develop}} the game. [...] In a 2006 interview, lead {{designer}} Johnson said, [...] "I had never really designed a game before ... It's funny <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> now—just by happenstance I ended up creating a very open ended system where players could go anywhere and do whatever and a story sort of unfolded." [...] Ybarra stated that the game was almost cancelled more than once, and came out about a year behind schedule. Johnson was guided by Archon designer Paul Reiche III during development. Reiche advised him to draft a [...] "story network" [...] that would highlight all the most important points {{of the story and}} list the in-game objects necessary to advance from one to the next. The designers rewrote the script multiple times. The group designed what they called a [...] "fractal generator", which took six man-years to develop and allowed them {{to increase the number of}} planets in the game from 50 to 800. The game was one of the earliest to use procedurally generated content for planets and everything on them. The techniques used created a type of roguelike environment on each planet, with the contents randomly distributed. The story network was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox game design. They created a separate ecosystem generator over the course of two man-years of work. The alien names were created by randomly combining syllables until they had names they liked, and their code for simulating communications was rewritten four times before completion.|$|E
2500|$|Of Human Bondage is {{considered}} to have many autobiographical elements. Maugham gave Philip Carey a club foot (rather than his stammer); the vicar of Blackstable appears derived from the vicar of Whitstable; and Carey is a medic. Maugham insisted the book was more invention than fact. The close relationship between fictional and non-fictional became Maugham's trademark, despite the legal requirement to state that [...] "the characters in [...] are entirely imaginary". He wrote in 1938: [...] "Fact and fiction are so intermingled in my work that now, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> I can hardly distinguish one from the other." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 2010, Young the Giant {{began work}} on its debut album with Grammy-winning {{producer}} Joe Chiccarelli. The album features live track recording, which the band had never previously attempted. Drummer Francois Comtois noted that working with Chiccarelli for the sessions [...] "was incredibly intimidating, but he kicked our asses into shape." [...] Gadhia also recalled the experience: [...] "We were criticized in ways we had never even thought of, and were constantly pushed to reach the next level. <b>Looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> [...] he shaped us into better musicians, performers, and songwriters. It was also great fun hearing his stories about Bono, Jay-Z and Elton John.|$|E

60|$|The Settlement {{effected}} by our 'Healing Parliament' in the Year of Grace 1660, though accomplished under universal acclamations {{from the four}} corners of the British Dominions, turns out to {{have been one of the}} mournfulest that ever took place in this land of ours. It called and thought itself a Settlement of brightest hope and fulfilment, bright as the blaze of universal tar-barrels and bonfires could make it: and we find it now, on <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> with the insight which trial has yielded, a Settlement as of despair. Considered well, it was a Settlement to govern henceforth without God, with only some decent Pretence of God.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{remember}} that Poe {{was also a}} very fine French scholar. Yet, with [...] all his superiorities, {{he was not the}} master spirit nor even the [...] favorite of the school. I assign, from my recollection, this place to [...] Howard. Poe, as I recall my impressions now, was self-willed, [...] capricious, inclined to be imperious, and, though of generous [...] impulses, not steadily kind, nor even amiable; and so what he would [...] exact was refused to him. I add another thing which had its influence, [...] I am sure. At the time of which I speak, Richmond {{was one of the most}} [...] aristocratic cities on this side of the Atlantic.... A school is, of [...] its nature, democratic; but still boys will unconsciously bear about [...] the odor of their fathers' notions, good or bad. Of Edgar Poe," [...] who [...] had then resumed his parental cognomen, [...] "it was known that his parents [...] had been players, and that he was dependent upon the bounty that is [...] bestowed upon an adopted son. All this had the effect of making the [...] boys decline his leadership; and, on <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> since, I fancy [...] it gave him a fierceness he would otherwise not have had." ...|$|E
60|$|Boots couldn't {{but feel}} with {{increased}} acuteness what a base deceiver he was, when they consulted him at breakfast (they had ordered sweet milk- and-water, and toast and currant jelly, overnight) about the pony. It really {{was as much}} as he could do, he don't mind confessing to me, to look them two young things in the face, and think what a wicked old father of lies he had grown up to be. Howsomever, he went on a lying like a Trojan about the pony. He told 'em that it did so unfortunately happen that the pony was half clipped, you see, and that he couldn't be taken out in that state, for fear it should strike to his inside. But that he'd be finished clipping in the course of the day, and that to-morrow morning at eight o'clock the pheayton would be ready. Boots's view of the whole case, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> in my room, is, that Mrs. Harry Walmers, Junior, was beginning to give in. She hadn't had her hair curled when she went to bed, and she didn't seem quite up to brushing it herself, and its getting in her eyes put her out. But nothing put out Master Harry. He sat behind his breakfast-cup, a tearing away at the jelly, as if he had been his own father.|$|E
6000|$|The wretchedness of {{a scheme}} to Box Hill was in Emma's {{thoughts}} all the evening. How it might be considered {{by the rest of}} the party, she could not tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways, might be <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> with pleasure; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than any she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her father, was felicity to it. There, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct, be open to any severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not without a heart. She hoped no one could have said to her, [...] "How could you be so unfeeling to your father?--I must, I will tell you truths while I can." [...] Miss Bates should never again--no, never! If attention, in future, could do away the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had been often remiss, her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more. In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.|$|E

6000|$|... 'We {{must get}} back to our command, then,' I answered. 'If I mistake not, I see the flutter of our {{standards}} in the market-place.' We spurred our weary steeds forward, and made our way with our little party and the supplies which we had collected, until we found ourselves back in our quarters, where we were hailed by the lusty cheers of our hungry comrades. Before noon the drove of bullocks had been changed into joints and steaks, while our green stuff and other victuals had helped to furnish the last dinner which many of our men were ever destined to eat. Major Hooker came in shortly after with a good store of provisions, but in no very good case, for he had had a skirmish with the dragoons, and had lost eight or ten of his men. He bore a complaint straightway to the council concerning the manner in which we had deserted him; but great events were coming fast upon us now, and there was small time to inquire into petty matters of discipline. For myself, I freely confess, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> that as a soldier he was entirely in the right, and that from a strict military point of view our conduct was not to be excused. Yet I trust, my dears, even now, when years have weighed me down, that the scream of a woman in distress would be a signal which would draw me to her aid while these old limbs could bear me. For the duty which we owe to the weak overrides all other duties and is superior to all circumstances, and I for one cannot see why the coat of the soldier should harden the heart of the man.|$|E
6000|$|... '"There's {{not much}} justice in this world," [...] he says, [...] "without a Navy." [...] But {{he got me}} leave {{to go with the}} barge and he gave me some money. That tobacco was all I had, and I {{followed}} it like a hound follows a snatched bone. Going up the river I fiddled a little to keep my spirits up, as well as to make friends with the guard. They was only doing their duty. Outside o' that they were the reasonablest o' God's creatures. They never even laughed at me. So we come to Paris, by river, along in November, which the French had christened Brumaire. They'd given new names to all the months, and after such an outrageous silly piece o' business as that, they wasn't likely to trouble 'emselves with my rights and wrongs. They didn't. The barge was laid up below Notre Dame church in charge of a caretaker, and he let me sleep aboard after I'd run about all day from office to office, seeking justice and fair dealing, and getting speeches concerning liberty. None heeded me. <b>Looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> I can't rightly blame 'em. I'd no money, my clothes was filthy mucked; I hadn't changed my linen in weeks, and I'd no proof of my claims except the ship's papers, which, they said, I might have stolen. The thieves! The door-keeper to the American Ambassador--for I never saw even the Secretary--he swore I spoke French a sight too well for an American citizen. Worse than that--I had spent my money, d'ye see, and I--I took to fiddling in the streets for my keep; and--and, a ship's captain with a fiddle under his arm--well, I don't blame 'em that they didn't believe me.|$|E
6000|$|The keeping of engagements had not as {{yet been}} a {{conspicuous}} {{feature in the}} life of young Val Dartie, so that when he broke two and kept one, it was the latter event which caused him, if anything, the greater surprise, while jogging back to town from Robin Hill after his ride with Holly. She had been even prettier than he had thought her yesterday, on her silver-roan, long-tailed 'palfrey'; and it seemed to him, self-critical in the brumous October gloaming and the outskirts of London, that only his boots had shone throughout their two-hour companionship. He took out his new gold 'hunter'--present from James--and looked not at the time, but at sections of his face in the glittering back of its opened case. He had a temporary spot over one eyebrow, and it displeased him, for it must have displeased her. Crum never had any spots. Together with Crum rose the scene in the promenade of the Pandemonium. To-day he had not had the faintest desire to unbosom himself to Holly about his father. His father lacked poetry, the stirrings of which he was feeling {{for the first time in}} his nineteen years. The Liberty, with Cynthia Dark, that almost mythical embodiment of rapture; the Pandemonium, with the woman of uncertain age--both seemed to Val completely 'off,' fresh from communion with this new, shy, dark-haired young cousin of his. She rode 'Jolly well,' too, so that it had been all the more flattering that she had let him lead her where he would in the long gallops of Richmond Park, though she knew them so much better than he did. <b>Looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> all, he was mystified by the barrenness of his speech; he felt that he could say 'an awful lot of fetching things' if he had but the chance again, and the thought that he must go back to Littlehampton on the morrow, and to Oxford on the twelfth--'to that beastly exam,' too--without the faintest chance of first seeing her again, caused darkness to settle on his spirit even more quickly than on the evening. He should write to her, however, and she had promised to answer. Perhaps, too, she would come up to Oxford to see her brother. That thought was like the first star, which came out as he rode into Padwick's livery stables in the purlieus of Sloane Square. He got off and stretched himself luxuriously, for he had ridden some twenty-five good miles. The Dartie within him made him chaffer for five minutes with young Padwick concerning the favourite for the Cambridgeshire; then with the words, [...] "Put the gee down to my account," [...] he walked away, a little wide at the knees, and flipping his boots with his knotty little cane. 'I don't feel a bit inclined to go out,' he thought. 'I wonder if mother will stand fizz for my last night!' With 'fizz' and recollection, he could well pass a domestic evening.|$|E
