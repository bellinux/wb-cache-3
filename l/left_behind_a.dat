5|$|Located in the Cleveland tri-state area, Youngstown {{is in the}} Mahoning Valley on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau. At the end of {{the last}} Ice Age, the glaciers <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> uniform plain with valleys eroded by the Mahoning River {{crossing}} the plain. Lakes created by glaciers that dammed small streams were eventually drained, leaving behind fertile terrain.|$|E

5|$|On July 19, 2009, {{an impact}} site was {{discovered}} at approximately 216 degrees longitude in System 2. This impact <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> black spot in Jupiter's atmosphere, similar {{in size to}} Oval BA. Infrared observation showed a bright spot where the impact took place, meaning the impact warmed up the lower atmosphere in the area near Jupiter's south pole.|$|E

5|$|As planned, the {{exposition}} <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> fairground {{and numerous}} public buildings and public works; some credit it with revitalizing Seattle's {{economic and cultural}} life (see History of Seattle since 1940). The fair saw {{the construction of the}} Space Needle and Alweg monorail, as well as several sports venues (Washington State Coliseum, now KeyArena) and performing arts buildings (the Playhouse, now the Cornish Playhouse), most of which have since been replaced or heavily remodeled.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{socio-economic}} stagnation Brezhnev {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. When Brezhnev died he <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> gerontocracy, a group of leaders who were significantly older than most of the adult population. Historians have largely agreed that Brezhnev's reign was one primarily of stagnation. However, in a poll taken in 2006, 61 percent of the people polled viewed the Brezhnev era as good for Russia.|$|E
5|$|Astorga and Henderson were {{released}} in March 1973 {{after the war}} ended. The remains {{of the rest of}} the crew of Bat 21, Hambleton's EB-66E Destroyer—Bolte, Gatwood, Giannangeli, Levis, and Serex have not been recovered to date. Gatwood <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> 13-week-old son he had never seen, Robin F. Gatwood III.

5|$|Erected at {{the behest}} of the Illinois General Assembly, the University of Illinois Observatory became {{important}} in the development of astronomy due, in large part, to pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins, from 1907 to 1922. Joel Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 but <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> legacy of discovery that helped alter the face of modern astronomy. The building served the University of Illinois astronomy department from its opening until 1979, when the department moved into a new, larger building to house its growing staff.|$|E
5|$|In {{the space}} of only a generation, public {{education}} had <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> highly regimented and politicized system dedicated to training children in the basic skills of literacy and the special discipline required of urban citizens, and had {{replaced it with a}} largely apolitical, more highly organized and efficient structure specifically designed to teach students the many specialized skills demanded in a modern, industrial society. In terms of programs this entailed the introduction of vocational instruction, a doubling of the period of schooling, and a broader concern for the welfare of urban youth.|$|E
5|$|Many ragstone {{quarries}} {{have been}} abandoned and backfilled once exhausted. When Ditton Quarry closed down in 1984, quarrying operations had <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> legacy of a lime-rich soil which formed {{the foundation of a}} thriving habitat for plants and wildlife; 140 wild flowers (including five that are rare in Kent), 18 butterfly species, and 50 bird species have been recorded. It is also home to foxes, rabbits, frogs, toads and newts. The quarry is now a Site of Nature Conservation Importance (SNCI). Public access is free.|$|E

5|$|Presque Isle is a recurved, sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it retreated to the north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> moraine consisting of clay, sand, and gravel that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula. The deposits are constantly being re-worked by wave action and are gradually migrating to the northeast due to longshore drift.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} passed onwards through Kejache territory, {{and arrived}} at {{the north shore of}} Lake Petén Itzá on 13 March 1525. The Roman Catholic priests accompanying the expedition celebrated mass {{in the presence of the}} king of the Itza, who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship the cross and to destroy his idols. Cortés accepted an invitation from Kan Ek' to visit Nojpetén. On his departure, Cortés <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> cross and a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity, but the animal soon died.|$|E
5|$|Although Stanford had fared poorly {{during the}} {{previous}} seasons, Thornhill had <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> team with a talented roster, which included 24returning lettermen. Shaughnessy believed the players were good, but unsuited to the single-wing offense that his predecessor had employed. Perhaps most importantly, Shaughnessy inherited back Frankie Albert, whom he considered a prototypical T formation quarterback. In 1943, Shaughnessy wrote that he considered the 1940 Stanford backfield—quarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee, right halfback Hugh Gallarneau, and left halfback Pete Kmetovic—as the greatest in history. While he believed the Indians backfield was better than any such combination in the single-wing, double-wing, short punt, or box formations, he added the caveat that this held true only in the Stanford players' employment in the T-formation.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the attempt}} to govern, the Assembly failed altogether. In {{the words of the}} 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, [...] "It <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> empty treasury, an undisciplined army and navy, and a people debauched by safe and {{successful}} riot." ...|$|R
5|$|Cowan later {{worked as}} a {{physiotherapist}} for cricket club Sussex CCC and ice hockey team Brighton Tigers. As a trainer with the Tigers he was named in the British National League All Star team for three years running from 1956 to 1958. He died on 4 October 1964 aged 63, when he suffered a heart attack, while refereeing a football charity match in aid of Sussex wicket keeper Jim Parks. He <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> widow and one son. In 2004, {{he was elected to}} Manchester City's Hall of Fame. A street near Manchester City's former ground Maine Road, Sam Cowan Close, is named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the FNLA and the MPLA, {{based in}} {{neighbouring}} countries, began a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule on several fronts. The Portuguese Colonial War, {{which included the}} Angolan War of Independence, lasted until the Portuguese regime's overthrow in 1974 through a leftist military coup in Lisbon. When the timeline for independence became known, most of the roughly 500,000 ethnic Portuguese Angolans fled the territory during the weeks before or after that deadline. Portugal <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> newly independent country whose population was mainly composed by Ambundu, Ovimbundu, and Bakongo peoples. The Portuguese that lived in Angola accounted {{for the majority of}} the skilled workers in public administration, agriculture, and industry; once they fled the country, the national economy began to sink into depression.|$|E
5|$|In about 1500 the Scottish monarchy {{turned to}} the {{recording}} of royal likenesses in panel portraits. More impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent {{for much of the}} sixteenth century, but it flourished after the Reformation. James VI employed Flemish artists Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson, who have <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> visual record of the king and major figures at the court. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone, who was succeeded by a series of portrait painters as the fashion moved down the social scale to lairds and burgesses.|$|E
