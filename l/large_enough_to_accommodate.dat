5|$|The Nagato {{class was}} {{equipped}} with a unique heptapodal (seven-legged) mast designed to maximize rigidity for range-finding purposes and survivability under shellfire. It consisted of a thick vertical leg in the center surrounded by six outer legs. The central leg was <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> an electric elevator running between the foretop and main deck. In November 1944, the tops of Nagatos mainmast and funnel were removed to improve the arcs of fire for her anti-aircraft guns.|$|E

5|$|Temporarily {{transferred}} to Ziguinchor, the Carabane mission closed in 1888. Missionaries returned in 1890 and, although they immediately expanded the church building, {{it was still}} not <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> all those who wished to attend. Thanks to subsidies by the bishop, Magloire-Désiré Barthet, and to donations by the parishioners, a new church was built and inaugurated on the Catholic feast day of Saint Anne in 1897. The mission also obtained two adjacent properties, lot #73 on the cadastral map. By the following year, the Christian community had performed 1,100 baptisms, {{as well as many}} catechumen.|$|E
5|$|Attached to {{the dome}} is a three-storey {{rectangular}} building which houses the telescope control room, computer room, kitchen etc. Almost no human presence is required inside the dome, {{which means the}} environmental conditions can be kept very stable. As a result, the WHT obtains perfect dome seeing. This building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant. Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> the mirrors from any other telescope on the mountain. As a result, {{all of the other}} telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT plant for their realuminising (with the exception of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, which has its own plant).|$|E
5|$|Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea {{each had}} their own {{separate}} rooms {{at each end of}} the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> the recording equipment. For over thirty days, the Chili Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment which allowed him to complete the rest of the lyrics. During production, the band agreed to let Flea's brother-in-law document the creative process on film. When the album's recording was complete, the Chili Peppers released the film, titled Funky Monks.|$|E

5|$|After an enquiry {{into the}} {{problems}} with the airborne missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted some recommendations. Aircrew had to be trained in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders landing before the main force had to have enough time to set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified, with complete brigades landing on one drop zone, instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used in Sicily. Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water, and their landing zones would be <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> the aircraft with room to spare. Following the friendly fire incident over the convoy, more training was given to ships' crews in aircraft recognition, and Allied aircraft were painted with three large white stripes on their wings. Training for pilots belonging to the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased, and improvements to the gliders were implemented, including better inter-aircraft communication.|$|E
5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children {{on all of the}} Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. I wanted to say thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's done for me.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{construction}} {{completion of the}} new Global Center for Health Innovation and spurred by a tax over run that was raised by the county to construct that facility, the first chief executive of Cuyahoga County, Ed FitzGerald spearheaded {{the notion that the}} county needed to mount a hotel project to meet demand for bigger conventions that would overlook Cleveland simply because it no longer had a <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> hotel <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> over 500 guests at a time in one location.|$|R

5|$|The Silver Reef {{area was}} first {{inhabited}} by Anasazi Native Americans between about 200AD and 1300AD. The Anasazi were nomads who followed {{the migration of}} the animals they hunted, typically deer, mountain sheep, elk, and jackrabbits. They were also farmers and gardeners, growing corn, wheat, rye, and barley. Many were potters, and pottery {{can be found in}} abandoned villages. The Anasazi usually constructed temporary dwellings out of sticks and leaves, often using bark for the roofs. Occasionally they built more permanent dwellings out of rocks, usually along the side of a mountain, often <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> several families. Storage pits were often placed behind the rock dwellings. Settlements were typically small, as food was scarce. A group of Virgin Anasazi lived in what is now the Red Cliffs Anasazi Site in Red Cliffs Recreation Area.|$|E
5|$|The spacewalk {{scene on}} the Enterprise {{exterior}} {{was one of the}} most challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built into the front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and deflector dish were built on gimbals at Paramount's largest sound stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero gravity sequences. The stage was not <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15percent.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} methods of burial: the coffin may be laid {{in a cave}} or in a carved stone grave, or hung on a cliff. It {{contains}} any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and takes {{a few months to}} complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that is <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a whole family. A wood-carved effigy, called Tau tau, is usually placed in the cave looking out over the land. The coffin of a baby or child may be hung from ropes on a cliff face or from a tree. This hanging grave usually lasts for years, until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground.|$|E

5|$|Edmund Sharpe {{started his}} {{practice}} {{at the end of}} 1835 in his mother's house in Penny Street, moving into premises in Sun Street in 1838. In October that year he took as his pupil Edward Graham Paley, then aged 15. Later in 1838 Sharpe took a house in StLeonard's Gate <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> himself and Paley; the practice continued to use the premises in Sun Street until after Sharpe's retirement. In 1841 Thomas Austin also joined the practice as a pupil, staying until 1852 when he left to set up on his own as an architect in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1845 Sharpe made Paley a partner, and in 1847 effectively handed the business over to him. At about this time also, John Douglas joined the firm as Paley's assistant, and stayed with the firm until about 1859, when he moved to Chester to establish his own practice. Sharpe retired completely from the practice in 1851, leaving Paley as sole principal. Also in 1851 Paley married Sharpe's sister, Frances.|$|E
5|$|After an enquiry {{into the}} {{problems}} with the airborne missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted recommendations in the aftermath of Operation Ladbroke. Aircrew were to be trained in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders were to be landed before the main force, to set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified with complete brigades landing on a drop zone, instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used on Sicily.

To provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery by air, the Royal Air Force started experimenting with how to use parachutes to drop them into combat, the jeeps and guns being carried in aircraft's bomb bays. A second Royal Air Force transport group, No. 46, was formed and equipped solely with Douglas Dakotas, instead of the mixture of aircraft in No. 38 Group. Together, the Royal Air Force groups were capable of supplying eighty-eight Albermarles, eighty-eight Stirlings, thirty-six Halifaxes and 150 Dakotas, a total of 362 planes which did not include aircraft held as reserves.|$|E

40|$|A lipase from Candida rugosa (CRL) {{has been}} immobilized in {{mesoporous}} rod-like silica and vesicle-like (or onion-like) silica supports by physical adsorption. The mesostructures {{and characteristics of}} the two mesoporous materials before and after adsorption of CRL were characterized by HRTEM, FESEM, SAXRD and N- 2 adsorption-desorption experiments. The pore sizes of the rod-like silica and the vesicle-like silicas were determined to be ca. 11 and 12 nm, respectively, <b>larger</b> than <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> lipase and 12 nm, respectively, <b>larger</b> than <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> lipase molecules (similar to 4 nm). The structural integrity of the rod-like silica {{as well as the}} vesicle-like silica is retained after adsorption of CRL into the mesopores. The catalytic activity, thermostability, and operational stability of the immobilized CRL were measured in phosphate buffer solution by hydrolysis of tributyrin, When the lipase immobilized in the vesicle-like silica was used as biocatalyst for hydrolysis of tributyrin in a batch process, the hydrolysis activity decreased only slightly from 74 % to 60 % over 10 cycles of reuse, indicating no obvious leaching out of the lipase from the round channels. The activity of vesicle-like silica immobilized CRL for catalytic hydrolysis of tributyrin is 21 % and 14 % higher than that of rod-like silica immobilized CRL at incubation temperature of 60 degrees C at 30 min and 90 min, respectively. The results demonstrate that the lipase immobilized in vesicle-like silica is superior to the rod-like silica in terms of higher activity, reusability and thermal stability. The unique curvature and the large size of the interlamellar pores of vesicle-like silica are suggested to be possible factors in achieving the higher activity and stability. Such a distinctive mesoporous geometry of the vesicle-like silica promises technological applications in protein adsorption and catalysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

An open bell may also contain a breathing gas distribution panel with divers' umbilicals to supply divers with breathing gas during excursions from the bell, and an on-board emergency gas supply in high-pressure storage cylinders. This type of diving chamber can only be used underwater, as the internal gas pressure is directly proportional to the depth underwater, and raising or lowering the chamber {{is the only way to}} adjust the pressure.|$|R
