40|$|Development of new {{materials}} with advanced optical properties {{is critical to}} the implementation of ultrafast networks and processors through optical modulators, <b>limiters,</b> <b>switches,</b> and routers. 1 Using purely optical means, all-optical limiters would allow transmission near unity at normal light intensities, while instantaneously decreasing it to minimal levels when the material is illuminated with a high intensity pulse. All-optical limiters can be produced from photonic crystals in which one of the component materials possesses optical nonlinearity. 1 Upon illumination, this photorefractive component changes its refractive index as function of light intensity. The stopband, defined as the wavelength range in which light is forbidden from propagating the photonic crystal, shifts its wavelength range as the photorefractive component changes its refractive index. Therefore, the all-optical limiter acts to limit light transmission at that wavelength range. The incorporation of semiconductor nanoparticles with strong nonlinear optical properties in the photonic crystal offers a promising means to obtain all-optical limiters.

40|$|We {{developed}} two ultra-wideband (UWB) radars for measurements {{over ice}} sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, and sea ice. One of the UWB radars operates over the frequency range of 150 - 600 MHz {{with a large}} cross-track 24 -element array. It is designed to sound ice, image ice-bed interface and map internal layers with fine resolution. The 24 -element-array consists of three 8 -element sub-arrays. One of these sub-arrays is mounted under the fuselage {{and the other two}} are mounted under the wings of BT- 67 aircraft. The measured inflight VSWR is less than 2 over the entire operating range. The fuselage sub- array is used both for transmission and reception, and wing-mounted sub-arrays are used for reception. The transmitter consists of 8 -channel digital waveform generator to synthesize chirped pulses of selectable pulse width and duration. It also consists of driver and power amplifiers to increase the power level to about 1 kW and a fast transmit/receive switch that can handle more than 1 kW of peak power. Each receiver consists of a <b>limiter,</b> <b>switches,</b> low-noise and driver amplifiers, and filters to shape and amplify received signals to the level required for digitization. The digital sub-section consists of timing and control sub-system, and 24 -A/D converters to digitize received signals at a rate of 1. 6 GHz. The radar performance is evaluated using a delay line to simulate returns from about 2 km thick ice and the loop sensitivity is more than 215 dB. The other UWB microwave radar operates over the frequency range of 2 - 18 GHz in the Frequency-modulated Continuous Wave (FM-CW) mode. It is designed to sound more than 100 cm snow over sea ice and map internal layers to a depth about 25 - 40 m in polar firn and ice. We operated the microwave radar over snow-covered sea ice and mapped snow as thin as 5 cm and as thick as 60 cm. With an early version of the radar we mapped internal layers to a depth of 45 m with fine resolution in West Antarctica.

Open-and closed-aperture Z-scans were employed to study the nonlinear absorption and nonlinear refraction of the MoX 2 dispersions, respectively. All the three-layered nanostructures exhibit prominent ultrafast saturable absorption (SA) for both femtosecond (fs) and picosecond (ps) laser pulses over a broad wavelength range from the visible to the near infrared. While the dispersions treated with low-speed centrifugation (1500 rpm) have an SA response, and the MoS 2 and MoSe 2 dispersions after higher speed centrifugation (10 000 rpm) possess two-photon absorption for fs pulses at 1030 nm, {{which is due to}} the significant reduction of the average thickness of the nanosheets; hence, the broadening of band gap. In addition, all dispersions show obvious nonlinear self-defocusing for ps pulses at both 1064 nm and 532 nm, resulting from the thermally-induced nonlinear refractive index.

Longer focal length lenses and macro lenses have a relatively long travel distance for the focusing mechanism inside the lens; this feature shortens the autofocus time.

40|$|Crystalline Colloidal Arrays (CCA, {{also known}} as {{colloidal}} crystals), composed of aqueous or nonaqueous dispersions of self-assembled nanosized polymer colloidal spheres, are emerging toward the development of advanced optical devices for technological applications. The spontaneous self assembly of polymer spheres in a dielectric medium results from the electrostatic repulsive interaction between particles of uniform size and charge distribution. In a way similar to atomic crystals that diffract X-rays, CCA dispersions in thin quartz cells selectively and efficiently Bragg diffract the incident visible light. The reason for this diffraction is because the lattice (body or face centered cubic) spacing is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light. Unlike the atomic crystals that diffract a fixed wavelength, colloidal crystals in principle, depending on the particle size, particle number and charge density, can diffract W, Vis or IR light. Therefore, the CCA dispersions can be used as laser filters. Besides, the diffraction intensity depends on the refractive index mismatch between polymer spheres and dielectric medium; therefore, it is possible to modulate incident light intensities by manipulating the index of either the spheres or the medium. Our interest in CCA is in the fabrication of all-optical devices such as optical <b>switches,</b> <b>limiters,</b> and spatial light modulators for optical signal processing. The two major requirements from a materials standpoint are the incorporation of suitable nonlinear optical materials (NLO) into polymer spheres which will allow us to alter the refractive index of the spheres by intense laser radiation, and preparation of solid CCA filters which can resist laser damage. The fabrication of solid composite filters not only has the advantage that the films are easier to handle, but also the arrays in solid films are more robust than in liquid media. In this paper, we report the photopolymerization process used to trap CCA in polymer matrices, the factors which affect the optical diffraction qualities of resulting polymer films, and methods to improve the efficiencies of solid optical filters. Before this, we also present the experimental demonstration, of controlling the optical diffraction intensities from aqueous CCA dispersions by varying the temperature, which establishes the feasibility of fabricating all-optical switching devices with nonlinear periodic array structures...|$|R
40|$|Variable attenuators are {{important}} circuits {{that can be}} employed in many radio frequency (RF) applications, e. g., in automatic gain control (AGC) amplifiers, broadband gain-control blocks at RF frequencies or as broadband vector modulators. For any applications, low insertion phase shift and low power consumption are of interest. A way to implement variable attenuators is using the RF PIN diode. The PIN diode {{is characterized by a}} low doped (I = intrinsic) semiconductor region between p- (P) and n-type (N) semiconductor regions. Besides the variable attenuators, the PIN-diode is used in other RF circuits, such as RF <b>switches,</b> <b>limiters</b> and phase shifters. This project presents the design of variable attenuators at 7. 5 GHz and 500 MHz frequency bandwidth for ultra-wideband (UWB) applications using two different PIN diodes. The variable attenuators have a topology based on 90 ° hybrid couplers. The design is performed using Advance Design Systems (ADS) from Agilent Technologies Inc. After presenting the PIN diode and its equivalent circuit, the theory of the 90 ° passive directional branch line coupler and the operation principle of the variable attenuators are presented. As the selection of the appropriate PIN diode is a critical step in the design, special attention is dedicated to this aspect. It follows the design of the variable attenuators with extensive descriptions of the simulations in ADS. Firstly, both series and shunt attenuators are presented. However, as these circuits normally offer narrow band variable attenuation, the 900 directional branch line coupler is used in the attenuator for broader band operation. At the end, a double hybrid coupler is found to eliminate the ripple in the high attenuation state of the single hybrid coupled attenuator. So the final topology of the variable attenuator is a double hybrid coupler variable attenuator- Moreover, in this project, different PIN diodes are investigated for variable attenuator applications. Different manufacture companies are currently providing different kinds of PIN diodes in terms of parameters and packages. Every type of PIN diodes are providing different sort of advantages to the designers. That is why it has become more difficult for the RF designers to choose the right device for the specified application. Beside the design of the variable attenuator using PIN diodes, some considerations in form of a guide line to the designers while they are using the PIN diode for designing the variable attenuator. In this work, the used PIN diodes are a beam lead PIN diode and chip PIN diode. The beam lead PIN diode is used because it is manufactured for high frequency and it produces excellent electrical performance and isolation at high frequencies. On the other hand, the chip PIN diode eliminates the problem of package parasitics. However, printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing limitations at the university laboratory incline the balance in the favor of the beam lead PIN diode, HPND- 4005 from Avagotech, instead of the also considered chip diode MA-COM MA 4 P 202...|$|R
