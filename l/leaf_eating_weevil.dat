5000|$|Weekly rations for the {{soldiers}} consisted of two gallons of corn, a pound of beans, a pound of pinole, half a pound of panocha, and four pounds of meat. The meat, delivered in barrels from the galleon San Antonio, often proved too putrid to <b>eat.</b> <b>Weevils</b> infested some of the corn and meal. The soldiers supplemented their diet by gathering wild herbs and hunting geese on Sundays. They also traded what goods they had like ponchos, knives, daggers and handkerchiefs for food from the Indians.

50|$|Encephalization quotients (EQs) may {{indicate}} how much brain power a species has {{in comparison to}} other mammals.

EQ has a high degree of correlation with the ecological conditions of an animal such as its feeding behaviours and food it consumes. <b>Leaf</b> <b>eating</b> monkeys have lower EQ than frugivorous or omnivorous monkeys since they have to work harder to forage than monkeys which eat abundant, easy to find leaves.|$|R

50|$|The first {{symptoms}} of hopperburn {{is that a}} leaflets margins start to curl up. As a plants infestation increases, its leaves cup downward, and they start to turn from green to yellow. In severe infestations this leads to leaf necrosis in which the leaf margins and intervein areas turn brown. Older plants completely lose their leaves. Young plants display tip-wilting and will be stunted in height. Plants that were damaged by stem feeding suffered more damage to their physiologies than those which were damaged by <b>leaf</b> <b>eating.</b>|$|R

50|$|Avahi meridionalis eats leaves (and buds) and, {{much more}} rarely, flowers and {{appears not to}} base food choice on abundance. Avahi meridionalis can eat adult leaves with higher content of easily soluble protein (than non-food leaves) and switch, as soon as possible, on young leaves, richer in crude protein, and poorer in acid {{detergent}} fiber and sugar. In Sainte Luce, A. meridionalis also ate leaves with condensed tannins, alkaloids, and intermediate concentrations of polyphenolics.

50|$|Both {{fitness and}} {{herbivory}} {{can be measured}} or analyzed using an absolute (additive) scale or a relative (multiplicative) scale (Wise and Carr 2008b). The absolute scale may refer to number of fruits produced or total area of <b>leaf</b> <b>eaten,</b> while the relative scale may refer to proportion of fruits damaged or proportion of leaves eaten. Wise and Carr (2008b) suggested that {{it is best to}} keep the measure of fitness and the measure of damage on the same scale when analyzing tolerance since having them on different scales may result is misleading outcomes. Even if the data were measured using different scales, data on the absolute scale can be log-transformed to be more similar to data on a relative (multiplicative) scale (Wise and Carr 2008b).|$|R

40|$|The Egyptian fruit-bat Rousettus aegyptiacus is {{regarded}} as a pest for agriculture. However, no quantitative data on its diet have been collected in Israel or in other Mediterranean areas, and control measures in the past reduced populations of insectivorous bats in Israel. We therefore studied the relative importance of native versus commercially cultivated fruit plants by analysis of bat faeces.

40|$|The {{rates of}} {{predation}} by the adults of Tenebroides mauritanicus were determined {{for the three}} stored-product pests. The average number of completely or partially eaten insects per beetle per day was - 2. 5 - 2. 7 for Rhyzopertha dominica, 0. 5 - 0. 7 for Sitophilus oryzae and 0. 2 - 0. 4 for Oryzaephilus surinamensis respectively., For the latter two species the number of insects consumed on the 1 st day was greater than the latter days. For the rice weevil the greater numbers of dead and partially <b>eaten</b> <b>weevils</b> were left behind {{than the other two}} species. The relative preferences for the three species were examined. R. dominica was. most and O. surinamensis least attractive to the cadelle in the preference. The per cent insects eaten in the preference increased for R. dominica and S. oryzae and decreased for O. surinamensis as compard with preying on the single species. Using S. oryzae and O. surinamensis as prey, preying on dead body was tested. Both the rates of predation increased on the dead insects. The rate of predation on the dead S. oryzae did not differ from that on the living R. dominica. The relative preferences for the three species were attributed to the differences of vagility and palatability among the prey species. It was considered that the cadelle {{played an important role in}} natural control over the stored-product pests...|$|R
