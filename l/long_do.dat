25|$|In some city, {{the fare}} {{of the public}} {{transportation}} depends on the travel distance, such as the MRT in Taipei, Taiwan. This increases the transportation expense for those who has been move to the urban area, what's more, they have less money to earn by investment because they are using all of money to pay their daily expense already. For example, the fare of New York city subway(MTA) is all the same no matter how <b>long</b> <b>do</b> you travel, it's all 2.75 USD. It's justice of Housing inequality.|$|E
25|$|In 1140, {{the priest}} Thân Lợi, calling himself {{the son of}} Lý Nhân Tông, raised a revolt against Lý Anh Tông in the {{northern}} region (now Thái Nguyên). The army of Thân Lợi successfully dominated the frontier region and defeated {{the army of the}} royal court led by the high-ranking official Lưu Vũ Nhĩ. After the victory, Thân Lợi, proclaimed himself King Bình (Bình Vương), and directly attacked the capital Thăng <b>Long.</b> <b>Đỗ</b> Anh Vũ, the chancellor, assumed the task of suppressing the rebellion, a mission that he accomplished after five months.

500|$|Drummer Mullen said of {{the song}} in 1983:"We're into the {{politics}} of people, we're not into politics. Like you talk about Northern Ireland, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday,' people sort of think, 'Oh, that time when 13 Catholics were shot by British soldiers'; that's not what the song is about. That's an incident, the most famous incident in Northern Ireland and it's the strongest way of saying, 'How long? How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> {{we have to put}} up with this?' I don't care who's who – Catholics, Protestants, whatever. You know people are dying every single day through bitterness and hate, and we're saying why? What's the point? And you can move that into places like El Salvador and other similar situations – people dying. Let's forget the politics, let's stop shooting each other and sit around the table and talk about it... There are a lot of bands taking sides saying politics is crap, etc. Well, so what! The real battle is people dying, that's the real battle." ...|$|E
