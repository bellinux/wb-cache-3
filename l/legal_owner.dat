5|$|Fownes {{was born}} into a family {{belonging}} to Devon's gentry and led the life of a country squire. In 1747, he married Margaret Luttrell, the heiress of Dunster Castle and added his wife's name to his own to comply with her late father's will. In accordance with the era's laws concerning the property rights of married women, on his marriage he became the <b>legal</b> <b>owner</b> of his wife's property, including not only Dunster Castle, but also the lordships of the manors of Dunster, Heathfield, and Kilton amongst others. The newly named Fownes Luttrell altered the castle considerably, remodelling its interior and park and building the Conygar Tower, a folly in the grounds. Following the death of his wife in 1766 he remarried in 1771.|$|E
5|$|Taxes were levied on {{artisans}} such as potters, sheep herders, weavers, oilmen, shopkeepers, stall owners, brewers and gardeners. Taxes on perishable {{items such}} as fish, meat, honey, medicine, fruits and essentials like fuel was as high as 16%. Taxes on salt and minerals were mandatory although the empire did not claim sole ownership of mines, implying that private mineral prospecting and the quarrying business may have been active. The state claimed all such properties whose deceased <b>legal</b> <b>owner</b> had no immediate family to make an inheritance claim. Other miscellaneous taxes included ferry and house taxes. Only Brahmins and their temple institutions were taxed at a lower rate.|$|E

25|$|Chattel {{property}} {{may also}} be adversely possessed, but owing to {{the differences in the}} nature of real and chattel property, the rules governing such claims are rather more stringent, favoring the <b>legal</b> <b>owner</b> rather than the adverse possessor. Claims for adverse possession of chattel often involve works of art.|$|E
25|$|Many {{building}} {{owners were}} not adequately compensated for their property. Due to city law, {{as soon as}} tenement buildings were condemned by the BRA, the city became the <b>legal</b> <b>owner.</b> This meant that building owners had no income as rent was paid directly to the city. Soon owners became desperate to sell their property at severely reduced prices.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of Brayne's death, the only legal {{documents}} that established {{that he had had}} any financial interest in the Theatre were the two bonds which he had managed to get Burbage to sign. Burbage allowed Margaret Brayne a share of the profits for a short time, but then cut her off.

25|$|In the {{recording}} system, {{each time a}} land title transaction takes place, the parties record the transfer instrument with a local government recorder located in the jurisdiction (usually the county) where the land lies. The government indexes the instrument by {{the names of the}} grantor (transferor) and the grantee (transferee) and photographs it so any member of the public can find and examine it. If such a transaction goes unrecorded for any reason or length of time, an unscrupulous grantor could sell the property to another grantee. In many states, the grantee whose transaction is recorded first becomes the <b>legal</b> <b>owner,</b> and any other would-be buyers are left without recourse..|$|E

25|$|In 1983, the Fabulous Moolah, {{who was the}} NWA World Women's Champion and <b>legal</b> <b>owner</b> of the title, {{joined the}} WWF and sold them {{the rights to the}} title after they disaffiliated from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and {{recognized}} her as the first WWF Women's Champion. Additionally, the WWF also recognized Moolah as having been champion ever since first winning the title from Judy Grable in 1956 and disregarded other reigns or title losses that occurred during the title's existence in the NWA. Thus, The Fabulous Moolah's reign was considered to have lasted 27 years by the promotion. WWF also introduced the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship with Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria recognized as the first champions after also defecting from the NWA.|$|E
25|$|Following its sale of Wind Hellas in 2007, Apax and Hellas {{co-owner}} TPG were sued {{by former}} bondholders of the telecom company, who allege that Apax and TPG unjustifiably enriched themselves from Hellas and misrepresented the true state of its accounts. Apax has countered {{that some of}} these bondholders only began their dispute after passing up on the chance of selling prior to the crash of 2007, and that Apax was not the <b>legal</b> <b>owner</b> of Hellas during the periods cited in some of the lawsuits. (In 2005 a New York judge awarded $56m to some of these bondholders, made against Hellas Telecommunications Finance and Hellas Finance, rather than Apax or TPG). Other lawsuits related to Apax and TPG’s ownership of Hellas are being heard in the USA. In December 2015 a separate legal action brought by the liquidators of Hellas Telecommunications was dismissed by a Luxembourg court.|$|E
25|$|In February 1925 Adele died of meningitis. Shortly {{afterwards}} Gustav {{filed for}} probate; he included {{a document that}} stated that the clause in the will was precatory, i.e. a request rather than a binding testament. He added that Ferdinand had said he would honour the clause, even though he, not Adele, was the <b>legal</b> <b>owner</b> of the paintings. The works by Klimt which Ferdinand owned, including the two portraits, were moved to Adele's bedroom as a shrine to her. The painting was lent for an exhibition at the Vienna Secession in 1928 to mark the tenth anniversary of Klimt's death; in 1934 it was displayed in London {{as part of the}} Austria in London exhibition. In 1936 Ferdinand gave Schloss Kammer am Attersee III to the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere; he later acquired a further Klimt painting, the Portrait of Amalie Zuckerkandl (1917–1918). In 1937 the golden portrait of Adele was lent for display at the Paris Exposition.|$|E

25|$|Poirot {{receives}} {{a visit from}} Emery Power, a rich art collector of Irish birth. Ten years ago he purchased at auction a gold goblet which was supposedly made for Pope Alexander VI by Benvenuto Cellini, which the Borgia Pope used to poison his victims. The design of the goblet is a coiled serpent, surrounding a tree bearing apples represented by emeralds. Poirot is immediately interested {{at the mention of}} apples. Power paid a sum equal to thirty thousand pounds to buy it at auction in 1929, but {{on the night of the}} sale the goblet and other items were stolen from the home of the seller, the Marchese di San Veratrino. The police at the time were certain that a gang of three international thieves were responsible. Two of the men were captured and some of the stolen items recovered but the goblet was not among them. A third man, an Irish cat burglar called Patrick Casey, died soon afterwards when he fell from a building attempting another crime. Power has spent ten years and a lot of money trying to locate the goblet but without success. The Marchese has offered to refund his money but Power does not want to take advantage of this offer as he would no longer be the <b>legal</b> <b>owner</b> of the goblet should it be found. He had suspected that the real criminal was Sir Reuben Rosenthal, who was his rival bidder at the auction in 1929, but they recently become business allies and Power is now convinced Rosenthal is innocent.|$|E
25|$|The film had {{its roots}} in an earlier concept for a new King Kong feature {{developed}} by Willis O'Brien, animator of the original stop-motion Kong. Around 1960, O'Brien {{came up with a}} proposed treatment, King Kong meets Frankenstein, where Kong would fight against a giant version of Frankenstein's monster in San Francisco. O'Brien took the project (which consisted of some concept art and a screenplay treatment) to RKO to secure permission to use the King Kong character. During this time the story was renamed King Kong vs. the Ginko when it was believed that Universal had the rights to the Frankenstein name (it actually only had the rights to the monster's makeup design). O'Brien was introduced to producer John Beck, who promised to find a studio to make the film (at this point in time, RKO was no longer a production company). Beck took the story treatment and had George Worthing Yates flesh it out into a screenplay. The story was slightly altered and the title changed to King Kong vs. Prometheus, returning the name to the original Frankenstein concept (The Modern Prometheus was the alternate name of Frankenstein in the original novel). Unfortunately, the cost of stop-motion animation discouraged potential studios from putting the film into production. After shopping the script around overseas, Beck eventually attracted the interest of the Japanese studio Toho, which had long wanted to make a King Kong film and was also planning for Godzilla to make a comeback around the same time. After purchasing the script, they decided to replace the Frankenstein creature with Godzilla to be King Kong's opponent and would have Shinichi Sekizawa rewrite Yates's script. The studio thought that it would be the perfect way to celebrate its thirtieth year in production. It was one of 5 big banner releases for the company to celebrate the anniversary alongside Sanjuro, , Lonely Lane, and Born in Sin. John Beck's dealings with Willis O'Brien's project were done behind his back and O'Brien was never credited for his idea. In 1963, Merian C. Cooper attempted to file a lawsuit against John Beck claiming that he outright owned the King Kong character, but the lawsuit never went through as it turned out he was not Kong's sole <b>legal</b> <b>owner</b> as he had previously believed.|$|E
500|$|Due to his {{advanced}} age and {{his inability to}} relocate to America, Martin's brother Denny Fairfax was unable to properly protect and maintain his American possessions and conveyed by deed on August 30, 1797, to James Markham Marshall [...] "all and every of those divers tracts, pieces and parcels of land, being {{part and parcel of}} the proprietary of the Northern Neck of Va., with all beneficial right and interest of whatsoever nature the same may be". This conveyance thus terminated the Fairfax and Martin families' interest in the proprietary. In 1799, the Virginia General Assembly authorized Marshall as the legal titleholder of Fairfax's remaining landholdings. The Northern Neck Proprietary was officially dissolved in 1806 when Virginia again became its <b>legal</b> <b>owner.</b>|$|E
