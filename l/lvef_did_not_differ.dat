We investigated whether these genetic variants associate with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and increased risk for in-hospital mortality after AMI. Consecutive AMI patients were recruited on admission and were genotyped for the above-mentioned polymorphisms.

40|$|Introduction. Depressed left {{ventricular}} (LV) ejection fraction (EF) {{is currently the}} major indication for implantation of primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) after myocardial infarction (MI). Because sudden cardiac death (SCD) also occurs in patients without a depressed EF, additional predictors are needed to identify patients {{at high risk for}} SCD after MI. A myocardial strain reduction by echocardiography can potentially be an indicator of regional dysfunctional myocardium. We hypothesized that electrical abnormalities in patients after MI will lead to LV mechanical dispersion, which can be measured as regional heterogeneity of contraction by myocardial strain. We aimed to compare myocardial strain data of patients with ischemic heart disease with and without ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) with preserved or slightly depressed LVEF. Methods. We enrolled 72 post-MI patients; 36 patients underwent ICD implantation due to prior history of sustained VAs and 36 patients were free of documented sustained VAs. Longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strain were measured by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (EchoPAC software, General Electrics, Fairfield, CT, USA). Global and segmental strain were obtained by averaging the maximum myocardial systolic shortening in a 16 -segment LV model. Results. <b>LVEF</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> between groups (42. 7 ± 8. 5 vs. 46. 3 ± 8. 5, p=ns, respectively). Inferior wall MI was present in 47. 2...|$|E
40|$|Gated {{myocardial}} perfusion SPECT allows {{assessment of}} left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV), left ventricular end-sys-tolic volume (ESV), left ventricular stroke volume (SV), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Acquiring images {{with the patient}} both prone and supine is an approved method of iden-tifying and reducing artifacts. Yet prone positioning alters phys-iologic conditions. This study investigated how prone versus supine patient positioning during gated SPECT affects EDV, ESV, SV, LVEF, and heart rate. Methods: Forty-eight patients scheduled for routine myocardial perfusion imaging were exam-ined with gated 99 mTc-sestamibi SPECT (at rest) while posi-tioned prone and supine (consecutively, in random order). All parameters for both acquisitions were calculated using the commercially available QGS algorithm. Results: Whereas EDV and SV were significantly lower (P 0. 0004) for prone acquisi-tions (EDV, 110. 5 39. 1 mL; SV, 55. 9 13. 3 mL) than for supine acquisitions (EDV, 116. 9 36. 2 mL; SV, 61. 0 14. 5 mL), ESV and <b>LVEF</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> significantly. Heart rate was significantly higher (P 0. 0001) during prone acquisitions (69. 1 10. 5 min 1) than during supine acquisitions (66. 5 10. 0 min 1).

Methods: We performed gated SPECT with 99 mTc-sestamibi on 38 patients with IDC before treatment with a -blocker and standard medication. Perfusion abnormalities, left ventricular (LV) function, and spheric distortion were as-sessed by a quantitative software program. Results: We clas-sified patients into 2 groups according to improvement in LV function after 4 mo of therapy. The groups consisted of 16 poor responders whose LV ejection fraction (LVEF) increased less than 10 % and 22 good responders whose LVEF increased by 10 % or more.

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{cardiovascular}} {{magnetic resonance}} (CMR) is frequently performed to measure accurate LV volumes and ejection fractions, LV volume-time curves (VTC) derived ejection and filling rates are not routinely calculated {{due to lack}} of robust LV segmentation techniques. VTC derived peak filling rates can be used to accurately assess LV diastolic function, an important clinical parameter. We developed a novel geometry-independent dual-contour propagation technique, making use of LV endocardial contours manually drawn at end systole and end diastole, to compute VTC and measured LV ejection and filling rates in hypertensive patients and normal volunteers. Methods 39 normal volunteers and 49 hypertensive patients underwent CMR. LV contours were manually drawn on all time frames in 18 normal volunteers. The dual-contour propagation algorithm was used to propagate contours throughout the cardiac cycle. The results were compared to those obtained with single-contour propagation (using either end-diastolic or end-systolic contours) and commercially available software. We then used the dual-contour propagation technique to measure peak ejection rate (PER) and peak early diastolic and late diastolic filling rates (ePFR and aPFR) in all normal volunteers and hypertensive patients. Results Compared to single-contour propagation methods and the commercial method, VTC by dual-contour propagation showed significantly better agreement with manually-derived VTC. Ejection and filling rates by dual-contour propagation agreed with manual (dual-contour – manual PER: - 0. 12 ± 0. 08; ePFR: - 0. 07 ± 0. 07; aPFR: 0. 06 ± 0. 03 EDV/s, all P = NS). However, the time for the manual method was ~ 4 hours per study versus ~ 7 minutes for dual-contour propagation. LV systolic function measured by <b>LVEF</b> and PER <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> between normal volunteers and hypertensive patients. However, ePFR was lower in hypertensive patients vs. normal volunteers, while aPFR was higher, indicative of altered diastolic filling rates in hypertensive patients. Conclusion Dual-propagated contours can accurately measure both systolic and diastolic volumetric indices that can be applied in a routine clinical CMR environment. With dual-contour propagation, the user interaction that is routinely performed to measure LVEF is leveraged to obtain additional clinically relevant parameters. </p...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: The EXPLORE (Evaluating Xience and Left Ventricular Function in Percutaneous Coronary Intervention on Occlusions After ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial evaluated whether patients with STEMI and concurrent CTO in a non-infarct-related artery benefit from additional percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of CTO shortly after primary PCI. METHODS: From November 2007 through April 2015, we enrolled 304 patients with acute STEMI who underwent primary PCI and had concurrent CTO in 14 centers in Europe and Canada. A total of 150 patients {{were randomly assigned to}} early PCI of the CTO (CTO PCI), and 154 patients were assigned to conservative treatment without PCI of the CTO (no CTO PCI). Primary outcomes were left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV) on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging after 4 months. RESULTS: The investigator-reported procedural success rate in the CTO PCI arm of the trial was 77 %, and the adjudicated success rate was 73 %. At 4 months, mean <b>LVEF</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> between the 2 groups (44. 1 +/- 12. 2 % vs. 44. 8 +/- 11. 9 %, respectively; p = 0. 60).

Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with CTO located in the left anterior descending coronary artery who were randomized to the CTO PCI strategy had significantly higher LVEF compared with patients randomized to the no-CTO PCI strategy (47. 2 +/- 12. 3 % vs. 40. 4 +/- 11. 9 %; p = 0. 02). There were no differences in terms of 4 -month major adverse coronary events (5. 4 % vs. 2. 6 %; p = 0. 25).
