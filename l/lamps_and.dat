5|$|A {{common set of}} {{calibration}} lamps (Helium and Neon arc <b>lamps,</b> <b>and</b> a Tungsten flat-field lamp) are permanently {{mounted at}} one of the broken-Cassegrain foci, and can be used for any of the other instruments.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> flags, <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with signal flags (during daylight) and signal lights (at night). Signal lights, which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by signal lights could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|For many years, {{the islanders}} had {{no means of}} {{contacting}} the mainland in emergencies other than signalling with hand <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> hoping that someone would see them. A radio telephone was installed in 1935, and in 1953 a telephone cable was laid. A red telephone box was installed in {{the centre of the}} island, symbolic of the 6 millionth phone box installation in the UK. It is still there today, though no longer in use.|$|E

5000|$|The college arms {{include a}} <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> an owl, symbolising the college's motto In nocte consilium (translated as [...] "study by night"). Because of this, the student {{magazine}} was called <b>Lamp</b> <b>and</b> Owl. Its name was changed in 2010 to 'Lampanelle', and after an 18-month hiatus returned in February 2012 {{with the name}} having reverted to The <b>Lamp</b> <b>And</b> Owl.|$|R

Tõnn <b>Lamp</b> <b>and</b> Jaak Prints are also actors. She is a grandmother.|$|R
5|$|In 1984, Honda {{released}} restyled {{versions of}} the Cubs on some markets, with square <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> plastic-covered handlebars and rear mudguard. On the domestic Japanese market the square style was optional, but in some places such as the UK they replaced imports of the traditionally styled round lamp Cub.|$|E
5|$|Kalpavrikshas are wish-granting trees which {{fulfill the}} desires of people in initial stages of worldly cycle as per Jain Cosmology. In initial times {{children}} are born in pairs (boy and girl) and don't do any karma. There are 10 Kalpavrikshas which grant 10 distinct wishes such as an abode to reside, garments, utensils, nourishment including fruits and sweets, pleasant music, ornaments, fragrant flowers, shining <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> a radiant light at night.|$|E
5|$|The kings also issued {{many types}} of coins for circulation. Several types of coins {{categorized}} as Sethu Bull coins issued from 1284 to 1410 are found in large quantities {{in the northern part}} of Sri Lanka. The obverse of these coins have a human figure flanked by <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> the reverse has the Nandi (bull) symbol, the legend Setu in Tamil with a crescent moon above.|$|E

5|$|The temple complex {{has a large}} {{hydraulically}} operated bell, which tolls with a high pitch at frequent intervals. Wood and stone carvings are profusely seen in the temple. In front of each deity there is a cushion, impressive scrolls, and candles set in very attractive suspended <b>lamps,</b> <b>and</b> {{with a large number}} of priests in attendance.|$|E
5|$|Vegetable oils are {{triglycerides}} {{extracted from}} plants. Such as oils {{have been part}} of human culture for millennia. Edible vegetable oils are used in food, both in cooking and as supplements. Many oils, edible and otherwise, are burned as fuel, such as in oil <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> as a substitute for petroleum-based fuels. Some of the many other uses include wood finishing, oil painting, and skin care.|$|E
5|$|Alates are {{collected}} when {{the rainy season}} begins. During a nuptial flight, they are typically seen around lights {{to which they are}} attracted, and so nets are set up on <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> captured alates are later collected. The wings are removed through a technique that is similar to winnowing. The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp. Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.|$|E

5|$|Brought by explorers, {{queen conch}} shells {{quickly became a}} popular asset in early modern Europe. In the late 17th century they were widely used as {{decoration}} over fireplace mantels and English gardens, among other places. In contemporary times, queen conch shells are mainly utilized in handicraft. Shells are made into cameos, bracelets and <b>lamps,</b> <b>and</b> traditionally as doorstops or decorations by families of seafaring men. The shell continues to be popular as a decorative object, though its export is now regulated and restricted by the CITES agreement. In modern culture, queen conch shells are often represented in everyday objects such as coins and stamps.|$|E
5|$|Like all Hindu Marathi {{people and}} to a varying degree with other Hindu Indians, Diwali is {{celebrate}}d over five days by the Deshastha Brahmins. Deshastha Brahmins celebrate this by waking up {{early in the morning}} and having an Abhyangasnan. People light their houses with <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> candles, and burst fire crackers over the course of the festival. Special sweets and savouries like Anarse, Karanjya, Chakli, Chiwda and Ladu are prepared for the festival. Colourful Rangoli drawings are made in front of the house. Marathi children make a replica mud fort in memory of Shivaji, the great Maratha king.|$|E
5|$|Materials used in {{the station}} are {{expected}} to last at least 100 years; include granite tile, ceramic tile, stainless steel panels on the walls, painted steel panels on the ceilings, energy-efficient fluorescent <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> LEDs, and mesh; and are supposed to conform to New York City Transit criteria, including slip-resistance. The station also uses acoustic ceiling tiles to reduce noise, in addition to using indirect lighting. The station is also compliant with National Fire Protection Association standards, despite its extreme depth, {{as it can be}} evacuated in six minutes in case of fire, and the platform can be cleared within four minutes.|$|E

5|$|The wrought-iron fence {{along the}} church {{driveway}} {{was installed in}} April 1895, replacing a picket fence. In 1905, the church's wood roof was replaced with a metal one, the present stained-glass windows were installed, its interior and woodwork were painted, and new lamps were installed for better illumination. The stained-glass windows were supplied by Madison Alling of Newark, New Jersey in memory of his father, who summered at nearby Capon Springs Resort. Alling also provided four hanging <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> calcimine for the interior walls and paint for the interior woodwork. Anton Reymann of Wheeling, West Virginia funded the metal roof and the sanctuary's painting and decoration.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his 40-year reign, Augustus {{presented}} eight gladiator {{shows in}} which a total of 10,000 men fought, as well as 26 staged beast hunts {{that resulted in the}} deaths of 3,500 animals. To mark the opening of the Colosseum, the emperor Titus presented 100 days of arena events, with 3,000 gladiators competing on a single day. Roman fascination with gladiators is indicated by how widely they are depicted on mosaics, wall paintings, <b>lamps,</b> <b>and</b> even graffiti drawings.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E

5|$|As a first-person shooter, Metro: Last Light {{features}} {{a variety of}} firearms, some fictional and some based on real weapons, which the player uses in combat. The game's protagonist, Artyom, also {{has the ability to}} kill an enemy directly with his melee weapon. Artyom has three weapons slots. Players can put any weapon into these slots without restriction. Players have access to four different secondary weapons, including throwing knives, claymores, incendiary grenades, and hand grenades. Mutants do not possess weapons and tend to physically attack the player in swarms, while humans fight with the same firearms available to the player. The player can knock out or kill most human enemies instead of shooting them, using stealth to avoid detection. As enemies are inefficient in spotting the player character in darkness, players can turn off oil <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> light bulbs to gain an advantage over their opponents.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on the bridge resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours. To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to the bridge, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) plan to build two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a semi-circular layout {{in the form of}} side wings, which will facilitate easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing LED <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An electronic toll collection system was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel of Light is {{an artistic}} display {{of color and}} sound {{surrounding}} the escalator at the station. 1800 fluorescent <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> 44 speakers are installed behind a layer of glass along the corridor, steadily changing color and mood. The theme is based on different experiences of travel in time and place. There are light and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and the software that mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E
