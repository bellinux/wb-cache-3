40|$|Voltage {{stability}} {{is an important}} problem in power system networks. In this paper, in terms of static voltage stability, and application of Neural Networks (NN) and Supported Vector Machine (SVM) for estimating of voltage stability margin (VSM) and predicting of voltage collapse has been investigated. This paper considers voltage stability in power system in two parts. The first part calculates static voltage stability margin by Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). The advantage of the used method is high accuracy in online detecting the VSM. Whereas the second one, voltage collapse analysis of power system is performed by Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and SVM. The obtained results in this paper indicate, that time and number of training samples of SVM, are less than NN. In this paper, {{a new model of}} training samples for detection system, using the normal distribution load curve at each <b>load</b> <b>feeder,</b> has been used. Voltage stability analysis is estimated by well-know L and VSM indexes. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods, IEEE 14 bus grid and the actual network of Yazd Province are used...|$|E

40|$|A {{large amount}} of power can be saved by optimal {{reconfiguration}} of radial distribution systems (RDS). Moreover, by transferring loads from the strongly <b>loaded</b> <b>feeders</b> to the lightly loaded ones, the reconfiguration of RDS can also achieve balancing of <b>feeder</b> <b>loads</b> and alleviate overload conditions. This paper presents a new approach for optimal reconfiguration of RDS based on a fuzzy-tuned genetic algorithm by minimizing real power loss and improving loading pattern of the feeder. The proposed algorithm overcomes the combinatorial nature of the reconfiguration problem and deals with the optimization of a non-linear, non-continuous objective function. The main features of the proposed genetic approach for network reconfiguration are: preserving radial property of the network without islanding any load point by an elegant coding scheme and an efficient convergence characteristic attributed to tuned mutation using fuzzy logic. The proposed algorithm is tested for seven case studies on a 69 -bus RDS. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{limitation}} of active power exchange between dynamic voltage restorers (DVRs) in an interline DVR (IDVR), selection of the appropriate voltage for each DVR in an IDVR is very important. In previous studies, an optimization problem by selecting the “minimization of the sum of rated apparent power of DVRs” as the objective function was proposed to select the rated voltage of DVRs in an IDVR. In that problem, <b>feeders</b> <b>load</b> {{is assumed to be}} constant and equal to the rated values, while <b>load</b> variations in <b>feeders</b> affect active power exchange between the DVRs and their injected voltages. Therefore, <b>load</b> variations in <b>feeders,</b> being the main contribution of the current research, must be considered in the mentioned optimization problem. As the number of time intervals in a load curve is big, the solution space will be very large and thus, searching the entire solution space is not possible. Therefore, it is essential to use smart optimization methods For this purpose, genetic algorithm (GA) is used. By proposing a convenient strategy based on a GA for considering <b>load</b> variations in <b>feeders,</b> the sum of the rating of DVRs is minimized. In order to prove the ability of the proposed method, various examples of <b>load</b> variations in <b>feeders</b> (2, 3, and 6 time intervals) are provided.

In this paper, a loop power controller (LPC) is applied for the control of real power and reactive power flows by adjusting voltage ratio and phase shift so that the loading balance of distribution feeders can be obtained. To incorporate photovoltaic (PV) power generation in <b>feeder</b> <b>loading</b> balance, a Taipower distribution feeder with large PV installation is selected for computer simulation.

By transferring loads from the heavily <b>loaded</b> <b>feeders</b> to the lightly loaded ones, network reconfiguration can balance <b>feeder</b> <b>loads</b> and alleviate overload conditions of a network. In this paper a novel method is proposed by formulating an algorithm to reconfigure distribution networks for load balancing. Systematic logical approach is used to determine the feasible switching combinations, select the status of the switches, and find the best combination of switches for maximum improvement in load balancing. The algorithm has been developed in two stages. In the first stage, a limited number of switching combinations is formed by trinary logic principle. A simultaneous switching approach is applied logically to find the best combination by selecting the appropriate switching options, connecting the switches accordingly, and assigning the loads for the newly formed combinations. In the next stage, the search is extended to investigate whether any other switching combination gives rise to maximum improvement in load balancing, compared to the improvement obtained in the first stage. This is carried out by considering one after another, the branches next to the open-branches of the best configuration, and the switching configuration that gives the maximum improvement in load balancing is identified. The proposed method has been tested on a 69 -bus test system, and the test results indicate that the algorithm proposed is able to determine the appropriate switching-options of the optimal (or near optimal) configuration with less computation.

The index value has to be minimum in the optimal configuration of load balancing. For optimal load balancing condition the branch load-balancing indices in the network are to be more or less equal, and also approximately equal to the system load-balancing index. A general formulation of the network reconfiguration for load balancing is given for the optimal balancing of loads in distribution network and a solution approach is presented. The solution employs a search over different radial configurations, created by considering branch-exchange type switches. The proposed algorithm, called distance measurement technique (DMT) has been developed based on the two-stage solution methodology. The first stage finds a loop, whch gives the maximum improvement in load balancing in the network. In the second stage, a switching option is determined in that loop to obtain maximum improvement in load balancing.
