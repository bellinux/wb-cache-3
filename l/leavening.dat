5|$|Many calcium {{compounds}} {{are used}} in food, as pharmaceuticals, and in medicine, among others. For example, calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate, calcium diphosphate, and tricalcium phosphate. The last is also used as a polishing agent in toothpaste and in antacids. Calcium lactobionate is a white powder that {{is used as a}} suspending agent for pharmaceuticals. In baking, calcium monophosphate is used as a <b>leavening</b> agent. Calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and calcium acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{ingredients}} in an old-fashioned doughnut include flour, sugar, eggs, sour cream or buttermilk, and <b>leavening</b> agents such as baking powder or baking soda. Additional ingredients may include milk, butter, vanilla extract and salt. The use of buttermilk or sour cream may impart a rich flavor to the doughnut. It is typically deep-fried, {{and may be}} deep fried at a lower temperature compared to other doughnut styles, having a crunchier texture compared to other cake doughnut styles. Frying at a lower temperature contributes to its rough, cracked texture. Being turned several times while cooking in the oil also contributes to its texture.|$|E
5|$|Abundant worldwide, most fungi are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a <b>leavening</b> agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.|$|E
25|$|Alternately {{attributed}} to the 16th and 17th centuries, Groote Wafelen from the Belgian Een Antwerps kookboek was published as the first recipe to use <b>leavening</b> (beer yeast): Take white flour, warm cream, fresh melted butter, yeast, and mix together until the flour is no longer visible. Then add ten or twelve egg yolks. Those {{who do not want}} them to be too expensive may also add the egg white and just milk. Put the resulting dough at the fireplace for four hours to let it rise better before baking it. Until this time, no recipes contained <b>leavening</b> and could therefore be easily cooked in the thin moule à oublies. Groote Wafelen, in its use of <b>leavening,</b> was the genesis of contemporary waffles and validates the use of deeper irons (wafelijzers) depicted in the Beuckelaer and Bruegel paintings of the time.|$|E
25|$|At {{its most}} basic, {{traditional}} bagel dough contains wheat flour (without germ or bran), salt, water, and yeast <b>leavening.</b> Bread flour or other high gluten flours are preferred {{to create the}} firm, dense but spongy bagel shape and chewy texture. Most bagel recipes call for {{the addition of a}} sweetener to the dough, often barley malt (syrup or crystals), honey, high fructose corn syrup, sugar, with or without eggs, milk or butter. <b>Leavening</b> can be accomplished using a sourdough technique or a commercially produced yeast.|$|E

25|$|Food-grade {{phosphoric acid}} (additive E338) {{is used to}} acidify foods and {{beverages}} such as various colas and jams. It provides a tangy or sour taste. Various salts of phosphoric acid, such as monocalcium phosphate, are used as <b>leavening</b> agents. Phosphoric acid in soft drinks {{has the potential to}} cause dental erosion.|$|E
25|$|Chametz {{does not}} include baking soda, baking powder or like products. Although these are defined in English as <b>leavening</b> agents, they leaven by {{chemical}} reaction, not by biological fermentation. Thus, bagels, waffles and pancakes made with baking soda and matzo meal are considered permissible, while bagels made with sourdough and pancakes and waffles made with yeast are prohibited.|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} the wheat protein gluten. This protein can {{determine}} the suitability of a wheat to a particular dish. A strong and elastic gluten present in bread wheats enables dough to trap carbon dioxide during <b>leavening,</b> but elastic gluten interferes with the rolling of pasta into thin sheets. The gluten protein in durum wheats used for pasta is strong but not elastic.|$|E
25|$|S. cerevisiae {{is used in}} baking; {{the carbon}} dioxide {{generated}} by the fermentation {{is used as a}} <b>leavening</b> agent in bread and other baked goods. Historically, this use was closely linked to the brewing industry's use of yeast, as bakers took or bought the barm or yeast-filled foam from brewing ale from the brewers (producing the barm cake); today, brewing and baking yeast strains are somewhat different.|$|E
25|$|Observant Jews {{spend the}} weeks before Passover {{in a flurry of}} {{thorough}} housecleaning, to remove every morsel of chametz from every part of the home. Jewish law requires the elimination of olive-sized or larger quantities of <b>leavening</b> from one's possession, but most housekeeping goes beyond this. Even the cracks of kitchen counters are thoroughly scrubbed, for example, to remove any traces of flour and yeast, however small. Any item or implement that has handled chametz is generally put away and not used during Passover.|$|E
25|$|In cooking, sodium bicarbonate, {{referred}} to as baking soda, is primarily used in baking as a <b>leavening</b> agent. It reacts with acidic components in batters, releasing carbon dioxide, which causes expansion of the batter and forms the characteristic texture and grain in pancakes, cakes, quick breads, soda bread, and other baked and fried foods. Acidic compounds that induce this reaction include phosphates, cream of tartar, lemon juice, yogurt, buttermilk, cocoa and vinegar. Baking soda may be used together with sourdough, which is acidic, making a lighter product with a less acid taste.|$|E
25|$|The Assyrian Church of the East uses leavened {{bread for}} Eucharist, like most churches of Eastern Christianity, {{but it is}} the only Church to include the {{additional}} ingredient of Holy Leaven. Holy Leaven is a powder added to sacramental bread before it is baked. Despite the name, Holy Leaven does not actually contain a <b>leavening</b> agent. Instead, khmira, fermented dough from previously used sacramental bread, is added and acts as leaven. What the Holy Leaven does contain is remainder from the original Holy Leaven, renewed annually by mixing it with common ingredients. The original Holy Leaven is said to contain residue from the original bread used at the Last Supper, mixed with the blood of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} battalions of these Thai {{mercenary}} volunteers were trained by early December 1970. With a dozen Royal Thai Special Forces (RTSF) as <b>leavening</b> in the cadre, the new units were deemed ready for service. The RLG, {{which had not}} been party to establishing Unity, now set conditions on the Thai deployment into Laos. The Thais had {{to be used in}} active operations, and they had to be far from the international press corps in Vientiane. Also, the battalions had to be disguised by being renamed as Bataillon Commandos (BC) to conform with RLA custom. Numbered 601 and 602 respectively, the new battalions began the new custom of numbering Thai mercenary units in the 600 series while they were in Lao service.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 14th century, {{the first known}} waffle recipe was penned in an {{anonymous}} manuscript, Le Ménagier de Paris, written by a husband {{as a set of}} instructions to his young wife. While it technically contains four recipes, all are a variation of the first: Beat some eggs in a bowl, season with salt and add wine. Toss in some flour, and mix. Then fill, little by little, two irons at a time with as much of the paste as a slice of cheese is large. Then close the iron and cook both sides. If the dough does not detach easily from the iron, coat it first with a piece of cloth that has been soaked in oil or grease. The other three variations explain how cheese is to be placed in between two layers of batter, grated and mixed in to the batter, or left out, along with the eggs. However, this was a waffle / gaufre in name only, as the recipe contained no <b>leavening.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} five types of grain {{are subject to}} the law of challah: wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye. Quantities of dough made from these {{different}} grains are counted together. They were also subject to the prohibition of the consumption of new produce before the waiving of the first sheaf, and to the prohibition of reaping prior to Passover. If they took root prior to the waiving of the first sheaf, the waiving of the first sheaf released them for consumption. But if not, they were prohibited until the next waiving of the first sheaf. The Mishnah taught that rice, millet, poppy seed, sesame, and legumes are exempt from challah (for though they are sometimes made into dough, they are not capable of <b>leavening),</b> as are less than five-fourths of a kav, or about 3½ pounds (the minimum subject to challah) of the five kinds of grain subject to challah. Sponge-biscuits, honey cakes, dumplings, pancakes, and dough made from a mixture of consecrated and unconsecrated grain are also exempt from challah.|$|E
25|$|Philo {{wrote that}} God {{instructed}} the Israelites to offer unleavened bread and bitter herbs {{together with the}} Passover sacrifice because unleavened bread signified great haste and speed, while bitter herbs signified the life of bitterness and struggle that the Israelites endured as slaves. Philo also taught that the deeper meaning was that leavened and fermented foods rose, while unleavened foods remained low, and each of these states symbolized types of the soul. <b>Leavening</b> symbolized the haughty soul swollen with arrogance, while the unleavened symbolized the unchangeable and prudent soul choosing the middle way rather than extremes. The bitter herbs manifested a psychic migration from passion to impassivity and from wickedness to virtue. For, Philo taught, those who naturally and genuinely repented became bitter toward their former way of life, lamenting {{the time that they}} had given over to the seductive and deceitful mistress of desire, being deceived by desire when they ought to have renewed themselves and advanced in the contemplation of wisdom toward the goal of a happy and immortal life. And so, those who desired repentance ate the unleavened bread with bitter herbs; they first ate bitterness over their old and unendurable life, and then ate the opposite of boastful arrogance in meditation on humility. For, Philo concluded, the memory of former sins caused fear, and by restraining sin through recollection, brought profit to the mind.|$|E

Fuller also noted {{the revelation of}} River Song being Amy's grown up child [...] "is perhaps a narrative strand which would sit uncomfortably with a series where loss has often been brushed off {{as soon as the}} next couple of episodes". However, he did have praise for the performance of Smith's Doctor, commenting [...] "the last few weeks have seen Matt Smith's Doctor in a welcome generally more serious vein, which he kept up here, with <b>leavening</b> at the right moments where his alien lack of comfort with human emotions, although used to comic effect, rang very true, as did his awkwardness when discovering the truth about River".|$|E

[...] GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd credited the on-foot action, stating that [...] "a few of the larger environments let you take on [...] from multiple angles, which are a nice change from the straight-on encounters that typify most of Mass Effect 2s battles." [...] He also praised the final boss battle, which was said to exceed that of the main game.|$|E
500|$|Fermentation of THB beer {{requires}} approximately {{eight hours}} for each mash of 130 hectoliters. The mash is {{a blend of}} malt (sprouted barley) and corn in an 80/20 ratio to which water and hops are added. [...] The mash is heated in a vat for around two hours to support fermentation. The product is filtered and then heated to 100 degrees Celsius to concentrate and sterilize it. The beer is then decanted and cooled for an hour at 10 degrees Celsius. Finally, a type of mushroom is added as a <b>leavening</b> and fermenting agent; the beer is allowed to ferment for a full week, and excess carbon dioxide produced by the process is collected for the production of soft drinks and other carbonated beverages at the factory. The beer is allowed to rest in vats for several more days before being filtered once more and then bottled and pasteurized at 62 degrees Celsius for three minutes. The automated bottling process yields crates of THB that are ready for shipment to regional wholesale distribution points.|$|E
500|$|As a batsman, Leyland {{generally}} {{batted in}} the middle order or occasionally opened the batting. Early in his career, commentators suggested that his batting technique was faulty, {{even when he was}} statistically successful. His use of the cut shot was mistrusted by some Yorkshire critics, and they suspected that his preference for attacking play would be unsuccessful; he was a faster scorer and more aggressive batsman than most of his Yorkshire contemporaries. Cardus suggested that, instead, he was in the line of [...] "humorous Yorkshiremen which the broad nature of his county produces from time to time as a contrast to and <b>leavening</b> of the generally dour lump. There was a twinkle in his eye and there was a twinkle in his bat, no matter how grimly and straight it may occasionally be obliged to defend a difficult situation in Yorkshire." [...] The cricket writer E. W. Swanton observed that Leyland's bat was often not straight when he played his shots—contrary to orthodox technique—but the speed of his footwork and his ability to watch the ball closely made up for any lapses. Opposing bowlers suggested that the impression was an illusion and that his bat was straight when he hit the ball.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, {{however, the}} arrival of Ornette Coleman on the jazz scene via his fall {{residency}} at the Five Spot club, consolidated by the release of his The Shape of Jazz to Come LP in 1959, muted the initial impact of Kind of Blue, a happenstance that irritated Davis greatly. Though Davis and Coleman both offered alternatives to the rigid rules of bebop, Davis would never reconcile himself to Coleman's free jazz innovations, although he would incorporate musicians amenable to Coleman's ideas with his great quintet of the mid-1960s, and offer {{his own version of}} [...] "free" [...] playing with his jazz fusion outfits in the 1970s. The influence of Kind of Blue did build, and all of the sidemen from the album went on to achieve success on their own. Evans formed his influential jazz trio with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian; [...] "Cannonball" [...] Adderley fronted popular bands with his brother Nat; Kelly, Chambers and Cobb continued as a touring unit, recording under Kelly's name as well as in support of Coltrane and Wes Montgomery, among others; and Coltrane went on {{to become one of the}} most revered and innovative of all jazz musicians. Even more than Davis, Coltrane took the modal approach and ran with it during his career as a leader in the 1960s, <b>leavening</b> his music with Coleman's ideas as the decade progressed.|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and <b>leavening.</b> Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E
500|$|Its {{writing and}} theme {{have been widely}} praised by critics. Michael S. Mammano of Den of Geek called the plot [...] "smartly-written" [...] and praised the animation.

According to Nick Hartel, the series touches on [...] "genocide and self-doubt" [...] themes without frightening younger children; rogue characters are redeemable, sending an important message that people can change and are not bonded to [...] "destiny". Chris Mitchell called the plot [...] "fantastic". D. F. Smith compared the series' plot to Japanese action cartoons, calling its tone and dialogue [...] "very American" [...] and praising the humor <b>leavening</b> an epic, dramatic theme suitable for all ages. Rob Keyes also praised the series' humor and affecting plot: [...] " [...] will capture your hearts". According to Mike Noyes, the series amalgamates elements of [...] "classic fantasy epics". Todd Douglass, Jr. called the plot engaging, well-thought-out and meaningful. The series' concept is [...] "well-realized", with a consistent story. Douglass wrote that the characters [...] " [...] {{a real sense of}} progression", and praised the writers for their humor, drama, and emotion. Joshua Miller called the series surprisingly dark despite its [...] "silly" [...] theme; the plot is livelier than Lost and, similar to the latter, emphasizes character development. According to Miller, its writing was [...] "true adult levels of storytelling". Tim Janson described the series as more than fantasy- and superhero- themed, seeing the characters as central and relateable. [...] "Cricket" [...] Te praised the series' use of Buddhist philosophies and the diverse presentation of its themes of courage and life.|$|E

Another Republican {{was said to}} have declared, [...] "His presence is a deadly poison" [...] and [...] "He is a sphinx; and I am repressed into dumbness when trying to hold a conversation with that man." [...] According to a southern newspaper that opposed his actions, Morton was [...] "a vice-reeking Hoosier bundle of moral and physical rottenness, leprous ulcers and caustic bandages, who loads down with plagues and pollutions the wings of every breeze that sweeps across his loathsome putrefying carcass." [...] Other critics and political opponents called him a tyrant and a bully, highlighting his ruthlessness in denouncing, even defaming his enemies, and spreading rumors that he had been a shameless womanizer, forcing himself on every female applicant for favor at the governor's mansion. One Democratic journalist wrote, [...] "There is not, probably, in this country, a more conscienceless, corrupt, and utterly profligate man in public life than Morton" [...] and [...] "He is rotten physically, morally and politically." [...] It was even alleged that his paralysis came from some unspeakable social disease, brought on by his habits. When the Senator declared himself in favor of woman suffrage, the Saint Paul Pioneer was not surprised. [...] "Why shouldn't Morton espouse the woman's cause?" [...] it asked.

2500|$|Passover celebrates The Exodus from Egypt {{where it}} is said the Jewish people [...] left so quickly, there was no [...] time for their bread to rise. Commemorating this event, Jews eat matzo and abstain from bread, cakes and other foods made with yeast and <b>leavening</b> agents. In modern times, [...] rabbinical {{authorities}} {{permit the use of}} chemical <b>leavening,</b> such as baking powder.

2500|$|Cereals {{formed the}} staple diet. The two main grains were wheat ( [...] sitos) and barley ( [...] krithe). Wheat grains were {{softened}} by soaking, then either reduced into gruel, or ground into flour ( [...] aleiata) and kneaded and formed into loaves ( [...] artos) or flatbreads, either plain or mixed with cheese or honey. <b>Leavening</b> was known; the Greeks later used an alkali ( [...] nitron) or wine yeast as a <b>leavening</b> agent. Dough loaves were baked {{at home in}} a clay oven ( [...] ipnos) set on legs. Bread wheat, difficult to grow in Mediterranean climates, and the white bread made from it, were associated with the upper classes in the ancient Mediterranean, while the poor ate coarse brown breads made from emmer wheat and barley.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{apparently}} not widely reviewed upon its 1950 release. Variety noted that [...] "Wagon Master {{is a good}} outdoor action film, done in the best John Ford manner.

2500|$|Bread was {{sometimes}} enriched {{by the addition}} of flour from legumes (...) [...] The Mishna (Hallah 2:2) mentions bread dough made with fruit juice instead of water. The sugar in the juice, interacting with the flour and water, provided some <b>leavening</b> and sweetened the bread. The Israelites also sometimes added fennel and cumin to bread dough for flavor, and dipped their bread in vinegar, (...) olive or sesame oil for extra flavor.|$|E
2500|$|Bread was {{primarily}} made from barley flour during the Iron Age ( [...] , [...] ), as barley was more widely and easily grown, and was thus more available, cheaper, {{and could be}} made into bread without a <b>leavening</b> agent even though wheat flour was regarded as superior.

2500|$|Emmer wheat {{may be one}} of {{the grains}} {{mentioned}} in ancient rabbinic literature as one of the five grains to be used by Jews during Passover as matzah (that is, kept from <b>leavening,</b> even accidental). However, this depends on the meaning of the Hebrew term shibboleth shu'al, which is uncertain and debated. The matter is further complicated by the cultivation of spelt (Heb. kusemet, Aramaic kusmin) in Israel of Biblical times and onwards (spelt is easily confused with emmer). However, it is fairly certain that spelt did not grow in ancient Israel, and emmer was probably a significant crop until the end of the Iron Age. Likewise, references to emmer in Greek and Latin texts are traditionally translated as [...] "spelt," [...] even though spelt was not common in the Classical world until very late in its history.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} breads {{on the market}} that boast having no high {{fructose}} corn syrup. [...] In lieu of high fructose corn syrup, however, one may find the production of special breads with a high inulin content, where inulin is a replacement in the baking process for the following: high fructose corn syrup, flour and fat. [...] Because of the caloric reduction, lower fat content, dramatic fiber increase and prebiotic tendencies of the replacement inulin, these breads are considered a healthier alternative to traditionally prepared <b>leavening</b> breads. [...] Though the touted health benefits may exist, sufferers of fructose malabsorption will likely find no difference between these new breads and traditionally prepared breads in alleviating their symptoms because inulin is a fructan, and, again, consumption of fructans should be reduced dramatically in those with fructose malabsorption {{in an effort to}} appease symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|The biblical {{regulations}} for the observance {{of the festival}} require that all <b>leavening</b> be disposed of {{before the beginning of}} the 15th of Nisan An unblemished lamb or goat, known as the Korban Pesach or [...] "Paschal Lamb", is to be set apart on Nisan 10, and slaughtered at dusk as Nisan 14 ends in preparation for the 15th of Nisan when it will be eaten after being roasted.
