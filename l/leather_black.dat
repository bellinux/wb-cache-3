2500|$|The {{characteristic}} {{notes of}} Grenache are berry fruit such as raspberries and strawberries. When yields {{are kept in}} check, Grenache-based wines can develop complex and intense notes of blackcurrants, black cherries, black olives, coffee, gingerbread, honey, <b>leather,</b> <b>black</b> pepper, tar, spices, and roasted nuts. When yields are increased, more overtly earthy and herbal notes emerge that tend to quickly fade on the palate. The very low-yielding old vines of Priorat can impart dark black fruits and notes of figs and tar with many traits similar to the Italian wine Amarone. Rosado or ros√© Grenaches are often characterized by their strawberry and cream notes while fortified vin doux nautrels and Australian [...] "port style" [...] wines exhibits coffee and nutty tawny-like notes.|$|E
