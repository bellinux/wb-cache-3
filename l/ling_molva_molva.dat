40|$|The burbot (Lota lota Linnaeus, 1758) is {{the only}} {{freshwater}} species from the cod family. Various taxonomic hypotheses were tested against molecular data by sequencing the mitochondrial cytochrome b locus of 120 burbot from 41 populations together with the related species <b>Molva</b> <b>molva</b> (<b>ling)</b> and Brosme brosme (tusk), which represented the other Lotinae genera. Within the genus Lota two distinct phylogroups were observed: one in North America south of the Great Slave Lakes (Lota Iota maculosa) and one in Eurasia and {{the remainder of the}} Nearctic region (Lota Iota Iota). The burbot lineage separated 10 Myr BP from the other Lotinae, while the genetic variation within burbot appeared to be approximately I Myr old. However, fossil evidence suggested that burbot already existed in the Early Pliocene in Europe, from were it probably colonized North America in the Early Pleistocene. While Nearctic burbot survived climatic oscillations and diverged in several refugia, the Eurasian form became extinct or was reduced to a very small population. In the Late Pleistocene the species recolonized the Palearctic region to establish its present distribution range. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

Catch rates and mean lengths of tusk and ling were similar for hook with plastic body and standard hook, indicating that an inedible body in combination with bait do not affect catching efficiency or size selectivity for these species. The results indicated, however, that this combination caught a lower proportion of small haddock.

60|$|Again, there lingers in the Cam, and a {{few other}} rivers of north- eastern Europe, that curious fish the eel-pout or 'burbot' (<b>Molva</b> lota). Now he is utterly {{distinct}} from any other fresh-water fish of Europe. His nearest ally is the <b>ling</b> (<b>Molva</b> vulgaris); a deep-sea fish, even as his ancestors have been. Originally a deep-sea form, he has found his way up the rivers, even to Cambridge, and there remains. The rivers by which he came up, the land through which he passed, ages and ages since, have been all swept away; and he has never found his way back to his native salt-water, but lives on in a strange land, degraded in form, dwindling in numbers, and now fast dying out. The explanation may be strange: but it is the only one which I can offer to explain the fact--which is itself much more strange--of the burbot being found in the Fen rivers.|$|R

This is a multi-species fishery, carried out by stern bottom trawlers, mainly between June and September, in depths mainly between 800 m to 1600 m. The importance of the fishing activity {{in this area is}} increasing notably. This fishery has been monitored since the beginning in 1996, with the collaboration of the fishing industry, by means of a scientific observer programme. The observers on board provide data on catches, discards, location and depth, haul by haul. Length samples of the main species and biological material are also collected. The species composition of the catches is presented. In terms of weight, the roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and the bairdii smoothhead (Alepocephalus bairdi i) are the most important species in the catches. Other less important species are the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis) and the blue <b>ling</b> (<b>Molva</b> dypterygia). In addition to the total catch, the composition of the retained catch and the discard are studied. For the main retained species, the dressing types are described and the conversion coefficients are presented. The length distribution of the catches and the discards, length-weight relationships and other biological aspects of some of the main species are analysed...|$|R

Aplotypes were TCC, CCC, CAT and CAC for Pacific cod, Atlantic cod, Haddock and Ling respectively. Confirmation of results was achieved by sequencing 16 s rRNA gene fragments of 16 G. morhua, 7 G. macrocephalus, 15 M. aeglefinus and 5 M. molva samples collected at different fish catching campaign.

Seven sea fish species {{were examined}} {{by means of the}} candling technique over a period of 4 months, from November 1996 to February 1997. Third-stage larvae of Anisakis simplex and Pseudoterranova decipiens were identified. A. simplex was the most abundant species with a prevalence of 84. 5 %, and was found in 192 of the examined fillets (10. 9 %). Pollock (Pollachius pollachius) was the most heavily infected fish species (82. 9 %). The prevalence in cod (Gadus morhua), saithe (Pollachius virens), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) was 34. 7 %, 26. 7 %, and 15. 4 % respectively.

40|$|The {{possibilities}} of the refractive index (RI) of the eye fluid as a freshness test for fish were investigated. Procedure details were studied {{in order to improve}} the usefulness of the method. The following fishes were used : cod (Gadus morhua L), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L), redfish (Sebastes marinus L) and blue <b>ling</b> (<b>Molva</b> byrkelange). It appears necessary to extract nearly the whole quantity of eye fluid. Checking the RI of left and right eye can be omitted. Centrifuging the eye fluid is not absolutely required but improves readability. Filtration has no practical value. Keeping the eye fluid during 24 hrs at I ° C results only in a very slight increase in RI : if necessary, determinations can be postponed without harm. The temperature of the refractometer must be maintained at 20 ° C ± 1, 5 o C. At fairly constant room temperature, no thermostat is required for routine analyses. A handrefractometer appears to be of little use. With redfish and blue ling, no satisfactory results are obtained. Spoilage curves of cod and plaice on the other hand agree fairly well with organoleptic judgment. The RI seems to be a useful freshness test with those species. Quality gradings are proposed. Advantages and limitations of the method were investigated. The RI can be determined very quickly with simple apparatus and by non specialised personnel. However, no determination is possible on beheaded of proccssed fish or on fish with very small eyes. As variations among individuals can be large, a sufficient number of fishes should always be taken for analysis...|$|R

40|$|Capture {{fisheries}} and aquaculture supplied {{the world with}} about 148 million tonnes of fish in 2010, of which about 128 million tonnes were utilized as food for people. The fishery market is becoming much more complex and stratified, with greater diversification among species and product forms {{and for this reason}} food safety remains a major concern facing the seafood industry. Along fish value chain {{there are a lot of}} concern regarding public health and for this reason the aim of this work was to propose an approach to antibiotic resistance and parasites risk assessment in fish production value chains. The main consequences of the use and the abuse of antibiotics is the development and diffusion of antibiotic resistance that become a serious global problem. The aim of this research was to evaluate the presence of antimicrobial residues and to assess the antimicrobial resistance in bacteria species isolated from different wild caught seawater fish and fishery products. Three antibiotic substances (Oxytetracicline, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim) were detected (by screening and confirmatory methods) in Octopus vulgaris, Sepia officinalis and Thais haemastoma. All Vibrio strains isolated from fish were resistant to Vancomycin and Penicillin. In Vibrio alginolyticus, isolated in Octopus vulgaris, a resistance against 9 antibiotics was noted. Human fishery product-borne parasitic diseases include those caused by cestodes, trematodes and nematodes. These diseases are either caused by an infection following ingestion of viable parasites, or as an allergic (hypersensitivity) reaction against parasite antigens which occurs for nematodes of the family Anisakidae. Parasite risk assessment was evaluated in 3 different steps: •	Different infection indexes in european hakes (Merluccius merluccius) belonging from Atlantic ocean (FAO zone 27 IXa) and from Tyrrhenian sea (FAO zone 37. 1. 2) were assessed identifying and charactering species and populations of parasites. A total of 2990 larval specimens of A. simplex (s. l.) from Merluccius merluccius captured in the two different fishing grounds were collected: 2836 anisakids in hakes from FAO 27 fishing ground and only 154 anisakids in hakes from 37. 1. 2 fishing ground. A. simplex (s. s.) and A. pegreffii co-infected the same individual fish host, in viscera and in the fillets (hypaxial and epaxial) fished from the FAO 27 fishing ground; only A. pegreffii in hakes from FAO area 37. 1. 2 in viscera and in hypaxial flesh was found. •	The presence of nematodes in 33 fish species belonging from different FAO areas using artificial peptic digestion was evaluated and parasites identification using microscopical techniques and RT-PCR was performed. A total of 10897 anisakid larvae were found and collected in the flesh. The blue <b>ling</b> (<b>Molva</b> dypterygia), european conger (Conger conger) and Peter's fish (Zeus faber) were the most highly infected species respectively. A total of 27, 27 % of the species analyzed were anisakid-free; a monitoring tool for the evaluation of parasite infection in fish lots with the aim to assess parasites impact on marketed fish, as EFSA states in a recent report, was applied; 29 % of the evaluated fish lots had a score between 0 - 3, refering to serious weaknesses in the fish lots. •	The survival of Anisakis larvae, naturally present in fish, at different stages of ripening process in traditional salted anchovies was evaluated since a recent EFSA panel on risk assessment of parasites in fishery products stated that research on identification of alternative treatments for killing viable parasites in fishery products are needed. Viability was tested with different methods and the results showed that all larvae were not viable at the 15 th ripening day. The dry salting process at mean salt concentration of 24 % in all parts of the flesh at the end of the ripening period can be considered an effective method for devitalising anisakids larval forms present in the raw material and obtain a safe product for the consumer...|$|R

Fish caught in coral habitats tended to be larger in size than in non-coral habitats. The diet of redfish, tusk and ling included the same prey groups in all habitats, but they differed at the species level. Lophelia-reefs may provide a profitable feeding place for tusk.

In 1992, Iceland, the Faroes and Norway initiated a three-year project which should provide improved knowledge of the biology of the three species (Bergstad and Hareide 1996; Magnusson et al. 1997). In that project it was focused specifically on age determination methods which could form a basis for future stock assessments and further studies of biology. For all the three species {{there was a need}} for reconsidering the ageing methods applied in earlier studies, and on that basis, perform further technical development and inter-calibration of age readings. This manual summarises results of efforts made for two of the species, ling and tusk, in the period 1993 - 1996. The manual illustrates the agreed practices which should provide reasonably precise age estimates. Data from several inter-calibration exercises carried out during the nordic project were presented by Bergstad et al. (1997). The only structure useful for determining the age of ling and tusk are the sagittal otoliths, and the otoliths are extracted by the same procedures as used for other gadoids (e. g. Williams and Bedford 1974). This manual aims at assisting age readers who are inexperienced with the reading of ling and tusk otoliths. It should be used as an initial guideline and reference only.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{effects of}} an offshore oil platform on local fish populations were assessed {{as part of the}} Water Column Monitoring (WCM) programme for 2014. The Njord A platform was chosen as the study location, which was not in operation and had no current discharge of produced water. Demersal fish species were targeted since they were believed to be less likely to migrate away from the platform than pelagic fish. By targeting organisms deeper in the water column and selecting a platform currently not in operation, the impact of drill cuttings and other sediment sources including leakages from well deposits were the main sources of contamination. Wild fish including <b>ling</b> (<b>Molva</b> <b>molva),</b> tusk (Brosme brosme), redfish (Sebastes sp.) and saithe (Pollachius virens) were caught with baited rod and line from within the 500 m safety zone of the Njord A platform during the summer of 2014. Reference fish were caught on a separate research cruise by trawling from a region of the Norwegian Sea less impacted by oil and gas activities. Limited numbers of reference ling were obtained and the reference data for ling collected from the North Sea as part of the WCM 2013 programme were used for comparison of the biomarker responses. Contaminant body burden and a suite of biological effects endpoints were measured in all fish groups and included DNA adducts, DNA strand breaks by comet assay, acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibition, ethoxyresorufin 0 -deethylase (EROD), vitellogenin (VTG), lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), liver and gill histopathology, PAH metabolites, and PAH body burden. The biomarker data were integrated using the integrated biological response index (IBR/n). Despite low and/or undetected concentrations of PAH and PAH metabolites in fish fillet and bile respectively significant responses in AChE, comet and DNA adducts were found. The biomarker responses indicated exposure to both neurotoxic and genotoxic chemicals in fish inhabiting the lower water column with influence from sediment sources around the Njord A platform. Integration of the biomarker responses (IBR/n) found that all four fish species that were caught from around the platform had markedly higher IBR/n values than their respective reference population. The study shows the advantage of using a suite of biomarkers for assessing the biological effects of low concentrations of complex mixtures with biological effects observed despite low concentrations of PAH measured.

40|$|The {{longline}} fisheries for <b>ling</b> (<b>Molva</b> <b>molva)</b> and tusk (Brosme brosme) {{have long}} traditions in Norway. Blue ling (Molva dipterygia) {{was always a}} by-catch in Norwegian slope waters but about 15 years ago this species became {{the target of a}} deep-water gill-net fishery. In recent years 5 - 10 % of the firsthand value of Norwegian landings was attributed to these species. This report provides an overview of the fisheries and population biology of the three species, with emphasis on aspects of relevance to future stock assessments, based on results from Norwegian investigations in 1993 - 95 and literature reviews. The Norwegian fleets which target ling, tusk and blue ling are the high-seas autoline vessels which operate in waters to the west and north of the British Isles, in the North Sea and at the Faroes and Iceland, and longline and gill-net vessels of various sizes fishing in home waters along the Norwegian slope. Exploitation occurs {{in all parts of the}} distribution area of the species. It is still unclear whether separate stocks occur in different sub-areas. Spawning areas are wide-spread, also the distribution of eggs and larvae. Very little is known about migrations. The age and size structure of the catches in various fishing areas show only minor variation. New studies by electrophoresis of tissue enzymes and hemoglobins indicate that tusk from all areas sampled in the northeastern Atlantic belong to the same gene pool, where the results for ling and blue ling are inconclusive. Estimates of mortality show that exploitation rates are high, and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) analyses of ling and tusk based on both private and official logbooks from the longliners indicate a considerable decline in the population sizes since the 1970 s. The catch per unit of effort may have declined by about 70 %. Strategies and requirements for future monitoring by improved CPUE measures and age-based assessement models are discussed. NORSK SAMMENDRAG:Linefisket etter lange og brosme har lange tradisjoner i Norge. Blålange har alltid vært tatt som bifangst i fisket på Eggakanten, men for rundt 15 år siden startet et direkte garnfiske etter denne arten på dypt vann. De sener år har disse artene gitt 5 - 10 % av førstehåndsverdien i norske landinger. Denne rapporten gir en oversikt over fisket og bestandsbiologien til disse tre artene med spesiell vekt på ting som er relevante for framtidige bestandsberegninger basert på resultat fra norske undersøkelser fra 1993 - 95 og relevant litteratur. Lange, brosme og blålange fiskes av den havgående autolineflåten i områdene vest og nord av de Britiske øyer, i Nordsjøen og ved Færøyane og Island. Dessuten av line- og garnbåter av forskjellig størrelse i hjemlige farvann langs Eggakanten...|$|E
