50|$|Normal {{lead styphnate}} exists as α and β polymorphs, both being monoclinic crystals. The <b>lead</b> <b>centres</b> are seven-coordinate and are bridged via oxygen bridges. The water {{molecule}} is coordinated {{to the metal}} and is also hydrogen-bonded to the anion. Many of the Pb-O distances are short, indicating some degree of covalency. The styphnate ions lie in approximately parallelplanes linked by Pb atoms.|$|R

50|$|Guildford {{was made}} a diocese in 1927, {{covering}} most of Surrey. Work began nine years later on its cathedral, {{which was to be}} a <b>lead</b> <b>centre</b> of worship and community events venue. The diocese chose Sir Edward Maufe as its architect and the foundation stone was laid by Dr Cosmo Gordon Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury in 1936. Construction was intended to span many years to allow necessary funds to be raised, but building work had to be suspended during the Second World War. In the meantime Guildford's restored Georgian Holy Trinity Church served as pro-cathedral. In 1952 Walter Boulton, who had ministered mostly in India, was made provost (head priest at the pro-cathedral and pastor of the parish), and revitalized the fund-raising for the new cathedral. The building could not be consecrated until 17 May 1961. When it was completed sufficiently for public worship, another cleric was chosen as first dean of the cathedral by the bishop, after consultation with various benefactors and influential clergy within Anglicanism.|$|E

50|$|The BWSCC is the <b>lead</b> <b>centre</b> for {{delivery}} of non-surgical cancer {{care for the}} West of Scotland, serving a population of 2.8 million and has clinical links with 16 hospitals in five health boards. The current clinical director of the BWSCC is David Dunlop who succeeded Prof. Alan Rodger in 2009. The Research UK Beatson Institute is led by Prof. Karen Vousden, CBE, FRS, FRSE and has strong links with the clinical facilities. An internationally known teaching centre, the BWSCC incorporates the academic units of Medical Oncology (Prof. Jeff Evans), Radiation Oncology (Prof. Anthony Chalmers), Neuro-Oncology (Prof. Roy Rampling), Haematology (Prof. Tessa Holyoake, FRSE) and Palliative Care (Prof. John Welsh) of the University of Glasgow, the fourth oldest university in the English speaking world (founded 1451). The BWSCC is Scotland's largest cancer centre, and the second largest in the UK. Each year, the centre sees more than 8,000 new patients, delivers more than 15,000 courses of chemotherapy and administers over 6,500 courses of radiotherapy. Its equipment is amongst the best in Europe with 11 linear accelerators and a PET-CT. The centre has an international reputation {{in the field of}} cancer research and is equipped with a state-of-the-art clinical research unit (CRU), a clinical trials unit (CTU) and an analytical services unit (ASU). The centre is a top recruiter in many clinical trials and contributes in many cancer research networks and cooperative oncology groups such as the NCRI (as a co-ordinating centre; CACTUS), SCRN (Scottish Cancer Research Network), NTRAC (National Translational Cancer Research), EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) and ACCOG (Anglo Celtic Oncology Group).|$|E
