5|$|About 120 SS {{personnel}} {{were assigned to}} the gas chambers and lived on site at the crematoria. Several SS personnel oversaw the killings at each gas chamber, while the bulk of the work was done by the mostly Jewish prisoners known as Sonderkommandos (special squads). Sonderkommando responsibilities included guiding victims to the gas chambers and removing, <b>looting,</b> <b>and</b> cremating the corpses.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Syrian Civil War, Palmyra {{experienced}} widespread <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> damage by combatants. In 2013, the façade of the Temple of Bel sustained a large hole from mortar fire, and colonnade columns have been damaged by shrapnel. According to Maamoun Abdulkarim, the Syrian Army positioned its troops in some archaeological-site areas, while Syrian opposition fighters positioned themselves in gardens around the city.|$|E
5|$|Guanche mummies are the {{intentionally}} desiccated {{remains of}} members of the indigenous Guanche people of the Canary Islands. The majority of Guanche mummies were made during the eras prior to Spanish settlement of the area in the 15th century. The methods of embalming are similar to those that were used by the Ancient Egyptians, though fewer mummies remain from the Guanche due to <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> desecration.|$|E
25|$|In Safed on 29 August 18 Jews {{were killed}} (some sources say 20) and 80 wounded. The attackers <b>looted</b> <b>and</b> {{set fire to}} houses and killed Jewish inhabitants. The main Jewish street was <b>looted</b> <b>and</b> burned.|$|R
50|$|In Hazaribagh, three Hindu temples in Bhagalpur Lane were attacked, <b>looted</b> <b>and</b> vandalised. The {{images were}} broken. 17 Hindus were stabbed at Nagar Beltoli Lane. In Nagar Beltoli and Hazaribagh around 100 Hindu houses and shops {{and about a}} dozen Hindu temples were <b>looted</b> vandalised <b>and</b> set on fire. In Sutrapur, {{fourteen}} Hindu temples, akharas and mutts were attacked, <b>looted,</b> vandalised <b>and</b> set on fire. More than 100 Hindu shops <b>and</b> houses were <b>looted</b> <b>and</b> vandalised. In most cases they were set on fire.|$|R

5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, and was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he sent to Asia Minor, ordering them to stay close to the coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> pillaging the local Christian inhabitants. As they marched on Nicaea in 1096, they were caught by the Turks and massacred almost to the man.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the capture}} of the city Japanese {{soldiers}} massacred Chinese prisoners of war, murdered civilians, and committed acts of <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> rape in an event known as the Nanking Massacre. Though Japan's military victory excited and emboldened them, the subsequent massacre tarnished their reputation {{in the eyes of}} the world. Contrary to Matsui's expectations, China did not surrender and the Second Sino-Japanese War continued for another eight years.|$|E
5|$|Still in Oriente, Castro was furious. Recognizing the {{establishment}} of a military junta, he ended the ceasefire and continued on the offensive. The MR-26-7 put together a plan to oust the Cantillo-Piedra junta, freeing the high-ranking military officer Colonel Ramón Barquín from the Isle of Pines prison (where he had been held captive for plotting to overthrow Batista), and commanding him to fly to Havana to arrest Cantillo. Accompanying widespread celebrations as news of Batista's downfall spread across Cuba on 1 January 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to take responsibility for policing the country, in order to prevent widespread <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> vandalism.|$|E

5|$|The Chicago race riot of 1919 {{was a major}} racial {{conflict}} that began in Chicago, Illinois, on July 27, 1919, and ended on August 3. During the riot, thirty-eight people died (23 black and 15 white) and over five hundred were injured. It is considered {{the worst of the}} approximately 25 riots during the Red Summer, so named because of the violence and fatalities across the nation. The combination of prolonged arson, <b>looting,</b> <b>and</b> murder made it the worst race riot in the history of Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The German colony at Madang on Kaiser-Wilhelmsland (the New Guinea mainland) was {{occupied}} on 24 September, although the German armed merchant raider SMS Cormoran—which was lurking nearby—escaped undetected. Over {{the next two}} months the remaining outposts were also occupied. Meanwhile, the German East Asiatic Squadron steamed across the Pacific before surprising and sinking a British force off Coronel on 1 November. After rounding Cape Horn into the Atlantic and attempting a raid on the Stanley naval station, the squadron was itself destroyed by a more powerful British force during the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December 1914. Later it was alleged that widespread <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> destruction of civilian property by Australian troops occurred during this period. Indeed, ill-discipline among the Australian force appears to have been an issue—perhaps due to the haste with which the AN had been raised and the poor character of some of those that were enlisted. Claims in the Australian media of criminal behaviour caused considerable controversy at the time, and later led to a parliamentary enquiry. In the end a number of soldiers were court martialled and imprisoned for <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> theft, although more serious allegations, including rape, also arose.|$|E
5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of Alexandria heard of Caracalla's claims that he had killed his brother Geta in self-defence, they produced a satire mocking this as well as Caracalla's other pretensions. In 215 Caracalla travelled to Alexandria and responded to this insult by slaughtering the deputation of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival, before setting his troops against Alexandria for several days of <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> plunder. Following the massacre at Alexandria, Caracalla moved east onto Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.|$|E

5|$|With no army left {{to defend}} Tigranocerta, and a foreign populace that gleefully opened the gates to the Romans, Lucullus' army began the {{wholesale}} <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> plunder of the city. The city was literally deconstructed piece by piece. The king's treasury, {{estimated to be}} worth 8,000 talents, was looted and each soldier in the army was awarded 800 drachma. The battle also resulted in severe territorial losses: most of the lands in Tigranes' empire {{to the south of}} the Taurus fell under the sway of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, the {{elements}} {{characteristic of the}} style include: the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or apsaras), bas-reliefs, and on pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.|$|E
5|$|During the Anarchy (1135–1153) rival {{factions of}} King Stephen and the Empress Matilda contested the kingdom and Worcestershire {{proved to be}} a key battleground. The first attack on Worcester itself {{occurred}} in late 1139 when an Angevin army from Gloucestershire assaulted the city. After an attempt to take the castle {{on the south side of}} the city, the Gloucester forces entered from the north, <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> burning. Worcester became a base for Stephen's forces for a period, before joining the Empress's faction. In response, Stephen first stormed and burnt the city in 1148, and then attacked it again in 1150, shortly before the end of the conflict. From the accounts of these sieges, it appears that Worcester still lacked substantial walls during this period.|$|E

5|$|Fearing Castro was a socialist, the U.S. {{instructed}} Cantillo to oust Batista. Cantillo secretly {{agreed to}} a ceasefire with Castro, promising that Batista would be tried as a war criminal; however, Batista was warned, and fled into exile with over US$300,000,000 on December 31, 1958. Cantillo entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra to be President, and began appointing the new government. Furious, Castro ended the ceasefire, and ordered Cantillo's arrest by sympathetic figures in the army. Accompanying celebrations at news of Batista's downfall on January 1, 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to prevent widespread <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> vandalism. Cienfuegos and Guevara led their columns into Havana on January 2, while Castro entered Santiago and gave a speech invoking the wars of independence. Heading toward Havana, he greeted cheering crowds at every town, giving press conferences and interviews.|$|E
5|$|In the storm's {{immediate}} aftermath, officials {{enacted a}} widespread curfew after reports of <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> vandalism. The government temporarily restricted constitutional rights for 15days. Officials urged residents to restrict water and fuel use, and alcohol sales were halted. The widespread flooding and the crippled infrastructure forced officials {{to rely on}} a limited number of helicopters to operate search and rescue missions and deliver supplies. A helicopter carrying fourpeople, including Tegucigalpa mayor and potential presidential candidate César Castellanos, crashed on November1 while touring flood damage, killing everyone aboard. In some areas, residents did not receive assistance until November12, more than two weeks after Mitch's landfall. About 285,000people remained in 1,375shelters, many of them schools, by three weeks after the hurricane struck. Some sports stadiums and churches were also used as makeshift shelters. Overcrowding at shelters caused various diseases.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September, after SAO Krajina forces {{captured}} Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica, {{the conflict}} shifted north, where {{a new line}} of control was established south of ZNG-controlled Sunja and Novska. Daily skirmishes continued there. After the ZNG pulled out of Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica, a substantial number of civilians left the area as well, leaving only about 120 Croat civilians in the two towns and the surrounding villages. About half of these stayed behind in Hrvatska Dubica, where <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> torching of houses owned by Croats or Serbs who had previously fled the town continued until mid-October. Most of the civilians who stayed in their homes were elderly or women.|$|E

5|$|On June 9, 1832, {{between two}} attacks that {{occurred}} at Fort Blue Mounds, {{a party of}} Native Americans crossed over from {{the west side of}} the Mississippi River near Galena. The group continued up the Apple River, <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> stealing horses along the way, including an incident about ¾ of the way up the Apple River in which about a dozen horses were stolen from a small stockade. The Sauk raiding parties were mostly stealing food and supplies for Black Hawk's band of 1,000 men, women and children which were camped in the marshes of southwestern Wisconsin. A similar incident a few days later, though without injury or death, prompted a reaction from the white militia in the area.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's economy {{suffered}} heavily {{during the}} 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, {{failure to maintain}} infrastructure, <b>looting,</b> <b>and</b> neglect of important cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment. The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,090 in 2017, compared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States. The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in August 2015, the exchange rate was 755 francs to the United States dollar. Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for monetary union amongst the five member nations, which could eventually lead to a common East African shilling.|$|E
5|$|A {{storm in}} the {{southern}} Atlantic caused the loss of several ships, and the six remaining ships eventually rendezvoused in the Mozambique Channel before proceeding to Calicut in India. Cabral was originally successful in negotiating trading rights, but Arab merchants saw Portugal's venture {{as a threat to}} their monopoly and stirred up an attack by both Muslims and Hindus on the Portuguese entrepôt. The Portuguese sustained many casualties and their facilities were destroyed. Cabral took vengeance by <b>looting</b> <b>and</b> burning the Arab fleet and then bombarded the city in retaliation for its ruler having failed to explain the unexpected attack. From Calicut the expedition sailed to the Kingdom of Cochin, another Indian city-state, where Cabral befriended its ruler and loaded his ships with coveted spices before returning to Europe. Despite the loss of human lives and ships, Cabral's voyage was deemed a success upon his return to Portugal. The extraordinary profits resulting from the sale of the spices bolstered the Portuguese Crown's finances and helped lay the foundation of a Portuguese Empire that would stretch from the Americas to the Far East.|$|E
