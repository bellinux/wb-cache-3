50|$|With <b>Live</b> <b>Meeting</b> 2007 Microsoft offered both a hosted {{model for}} Microsoft Office <b>Live</b> <b>Meeting</b> 2007 {{as well as}} a CPE (customer {{premises}} equipment) solution, namely Office Communications Server 2007. In addition to Microsoft directly hosting Microsoft Office <b>Live</b> <b>Meeting</b> 2007, hosting partners also offered Microsoft Office <b>Live</b> <b>Meeting</b> 2007 as a fee-based serviceref?.

50|$|<b>Live</b> <b>Meeting</b> Web Access (MWA) was {{redesigned}} in this {{release to}} provide a user experience nearly identical to the new Windows-based <b>Live</b> <b>Meeting</b> client.

50|$|The <b>Live</b> <b>Meeting</b> {{product was}} also {{intended}} {{to operate with}} the Polycom CX5000 (formerly known as the Microsoft RoundTable), a 360 degree video camera optimized to work with Microsoft Office <b>Live</b> <b>Meeting</b> 2007. One new feature included in this version allowed the Microsoft Office <b>Live</b> <b>Meeting</b> client to automatically switch the larger video window to the actively speaking participant. This auto-switch feature was not specific to the Polycom CX5000 product - it worked with any USB-based camera. The main advantage of the CX5000 was its 360 degree camera view, suitable for conference rooms with several participants. With specially designed microphones, the CX5000 was able to determine {{the location of the}} active speaker and then tell Microsoft Office <b>Live</b> <b>Meeting</b> which camera angle to focus on.|$|E

50|$|While many Telepresence {{solutions}} {{have focused}} on the ambiance aspects of remote meeting environments and whilemost web conferencing solutions {{have focused on}} the integration of webinar and telephony features into collaboration software offerings/services, little has been done to simulate or reflect the asynchronous or simultaneous aspects of <b>live</b> <b>meetings</b> over the internet. Ideally what is required is a set of technologies that enrich communications with sensory elements that provide a just-like-being-there experience for <b>live</b> <b>meetings.</b> The sensory experience should include a range of sight, sound, and touch interactions. However, the current state of web conferencing and telepresence solutions focus mainly on the sight and sound aspects of a meeting and fall short on the interaction capabilities of participants. Moreover, web conferencing and telepresence solutions are typically not vendor neutral and tend to be pricey.|$|R
