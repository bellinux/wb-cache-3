Documents can be renamed from the title bar. iWork documents automatically synchronize with iCloud. The full screen ability is on every display.|$|E

40|$|This study applies {{uncertainty}} management theory to reference interactions between law librarians and pro se <b>library</b> <b>users.</b> Focus groups {{were conducted with}} law librarians to obtain data. The results showed that law librarians assisting pro se <b>library</b> <b>users</b> experienced uncertainty in multiple and complex forms, arising both from interacting with users and from institutional and legal requirements; that they appraised uncertainty for its meaning; managed their own uncertainties through various techniques; dealt with challenges to managing their uncertainty; and attempted to influence the uncertainty of pro se <b>library</b> <b>users.</b> The results also highlighted a significant gap between standard reference interaction practices and theory and the realities experienced in reference interactions with pro se <b>library</b> <b>users.</b> ii To my grandfather...|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of these two {{situations}} and many others, the ALA affirmed the confidential status of all records which held patron names in a Policy on the Confidentiality of Library Records.

2500|$|For example, the Irish writer Brian O'Nolan, {{who lived}} from 1911 to 1966, wrote under many pen {{names such as}} Flann O'Brien and Myles na Gopaleen. Catalogers at the United States Library of Congress chose one form—"O'Brien, Flann, 1911-1966"—as the {{official}} heading. [...] The example contains all three elements of a valid authority record: the first heading O'Brien, Flann, 1911-1966 is {{the form of the}} name that the Library of Congress chose as authoritative. In theory, every record in the catalog that represents a work by this author should have this form of the name as its author heading. What follows immediately below the heading beginning with Na Gopaleen, Myles, 1911-1966 are the see references. These forms of the author's name will appear in the catalog, but only as transcriptions and not as headings. If a user queries the catalog under one of these variant forms of the author's name, he or she would receive the response: [...] "See O'Brien, Flann, 1911-1966." [...] There is an additional spelling variant of the Gopaleen name: [...] "Na gCopaleen, Myles, 1911-1966" [...] has an extra C inserted because the author also employed the non-anglicized Irish spelling of his pen-name, in which the capitalized C shows the correct root word while the preceding g indicates its pronunciation in context. So if a <b>library</b> <b>user</b> comes across this spelling variant, he or she will be led to the same author regardless. See also references, which point from one authorized heading to another authorized heading, are exceedingly rare for personal name authority records, although they often appear in name authority records for corporate bodies. The final four entries in this record beginning with His At Swim-Two-Birds ... 1939. constitute the justification for this particular form of the name: it appeared in this form on the 1939 edition of the author's novel At Swim-Two-Birds, whereas the author's other noms de plume appeared on later publications.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the library}} doesn't have {{information}} on a given topic, or if the <b>library</b> <b>user</b> wants more information, the librarian can refer the <b>library</b> <b>user</b> to another library or to an organization that can be contacted by phone or mail.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} use of the Internet, the online catalog was often the first information retrieval system <b>library</b> <b>users</b> ever encountered.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was offering a model to find of importance the characteristics of Iranian digital <b>libraries</b> <b>user</b> interface based of Delphi method. In relation, after study of the related literature and providing the researcher constructed checklist regarding the Delphi panel, ten key criteria (search, consistency, guidance, navigation, design, error correction, presentation, user control, interface language, and simplicity) included 114 features and sub-components were selected to find of importance of them in the design of Iranian digital <b>libraries</b> <b>user</b> interfaces. Then, based on obtained scores from the Delphi panel, importance of each sub-feature determined in the design of Iranian digital <b>libraries</b> <b>user</b> interfaces.
