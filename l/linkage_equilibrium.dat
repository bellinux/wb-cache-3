40|$|Data are {{presented}} concerning the gene arrangements in both {{arms of the}} X-chromosome of Drosophila robusta in eight altitudinal transects. The major change {{appears to be the}} increase of gene arrangement XL- 1 (and decrease in XL, sometimes also XL- 2) with increasing altitude. In each transect only one combination of XL- 1 with a right arm arrangement seems primarily responsible for the increases with altitudinal change, and only one combination of XL for the decreases. In four of the transects the increasing combination appears to be XL- 1. XR, XL- 1. XR- 2 in the other four. A substantial decrease with elevation in XL- 2. XR- 2 occurs only in the four areas where XL- 1. XR exhibits the major increase. These results indicate that interactions between arrangements {{play a significant role in}} the adaptation of this species to altitude.

50|$|Two loci {{are said}} to be in <b>linkage</b> <b>equilibrium</b> (LE) if their {{inheritance}} is an independent event. If the alleles at those loci are non-randomly inherited then we say that they are at linkage disequilibrium (LD). LD is most commonly caused by physical linkage of genes. When two genes are inherited on the same chromosome, depending on their distance and the likelihood of recombination between the loci they can be at high LD. However, LD can be also observed due to functional interactions where even genes from different chromosomes can jointly confer evolutionary selected phenotype or can affect the viability of potential offspring.|$|E

50|$|If all {{genes are}} in <b>linkage</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> {{the effect of}} an allele at one locus can be {{averaged}} across the gene pool at other loci. In reality, one allele is frequently found in linkage disequilibrium with genes at other loci, especially with genes located nearby on the same chromosome. Recombination breaks up this linkage disequilibrium too slowly to avoid genetic hitchhiking, where an allele at one locus rises to high frequency because it is linked to an allele under selection at a nearby locus. Linkage also slows down the rate of adaptation, even in sexual populations. The effect of linkage disequilibrium in slowing down the rate of adaptive evolution arises {{from a combination of}} the Hill-Robertson effect (delays in bringing beneficial mutations together) and background selection (delays in separating beneficial mutations from deleterious hitchhikers).|$|E

[...] Selection under these conditions rapidly changes allele frequencies to a state where they evolve as if in <b>linkage</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Kimura originally provided the sufficient conditions for QLE in two-locus systems, but recently several researchers have shown how QLE occurs in general multilocus systems. [...] QLE allows theorists to approximate linkage disequilibria by simple expressions, often simple functions of allele or genotype frequencies, thereby providing solutions to highly complex problems involving selection on multiple loci or polygenic traits.

50|$|Evolutionary biology {{has been}} the subject of {{extensive}} mathematical theorizing. The traditional approach in this area, which includes complications from genetics, is population genetics. Most population geneticists consider the appearance of new alleles by mutation, the appearance of new genotypes by recombination, and changes in the frequencies of existing alleles and genotypes at a small number of gene loci. When infinitesimal effects at a large number of gene loci are considered, together with the assumption of <b>linkage</b> <b>equilibrium</b> or quasi-linkage equilibrium, one derives quantitative genetics. Ronald Fisher made fundamental advances in statistics, such as analysis of variance, via his work on quantitative genetics. Another important branch of population genetics that led to the extensive development of coalescent theory is phylogenetics.

40|$|Most {{multipoint}} linkage programs assume <b>linkage</b> <b>equilibrium</b> {{among the}} markers being studied.

Here, we demonstrated that, when {{some or all of the}} parental genotypes are missing, assuming <b>linkage</b> <b>equilibrium</b> among tightly linked markers where strong LD exists can cause apparent oversharing of multipoint identity by descent (IBD) between sib pairs and false-positive evidence for multipoint model-free linkage analysis of affected sib pair data.

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{of the number of}} pairwise differences calculated from comparisons between n haploid genomes has frequently been used {{as a starting point for}} testing the hypothesis of <b>linkage</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> For this purpose the variance of the pairwise differences, V-D, is used as a test statistic to evaluate the null hypothesis that all loci are in <b>linkage</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The problem is to determine the critical value of the {{distribution of}} V-D. This critical value can be estimated either by Monte Carlo simulation or by assuming that V-D is distributed normally and calculating a one-tailed 95 % critical value for V-D, L, L = E(V-D) + 1. 645 root Var(V-D), where E(V-D) is the expectation of V-D, and Var(V-D) is the variance of V-D. if V-D (observed) > L, the null hypothesis of <b>linkage</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is rejected. Using Monte Carlo simulation we show that the formula currently available for Var(V-D) is incorrect, especially for genetically highly diverse data. This has implications for hypothesis testing in bacterial populations, which are often genetically highly diverse. For this reason we derive a new, exact formula for Var(V-D). The distribution of V-D is examined and shown to approach normality as the sample size increases. This makes the new formula a useful tool in the investigation of large data sets, where testing for linkage using Monte Carlo simulation can be very time consuming.

Geiringer's theorem shows that the limit of repeated applications of crossover is a population in <b>linkage</b> <b>equilibrium</b> (also known as Robbins' proportions). When gene pool recombination is applied to a population, the population goes to <b>linkage</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in one step. This can be achieved by choosing genes from the population rather than from two specific parents. After a gene pool recombination step, the complete state of the population is determined by the allele frequencies, and the number of these variables is linear rather than exponential in the string length. Thus, the gene pool GA can be much more tractible for analysis than the two-parent recombination GA. For the ones-counting (ONEMAX) and the needle-in-the-haystack (NEEDLE) fitness functions, explicit formulas are given for all fixed points. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that formulas for fixed points have been given for a GA that involves selection, recombination, and mutation and for arbitrary string length. We show that the unique fixed point for any linear fitness function is asymptotically stable. For the NEEDLE fitness function, we show that there can be either one or three fixed points (after a possible small perturbation of the needle height). If there is one fixed point, it is stable. If there are three fixed points, then two are asymptotically stable and one is unstable. When the model goes from three fixed points to one by a parameter change (mutation rate or needle height), "phase transition" behavior can happen where the model jumps to si [...] ...|$|E

For this to be true, it is not required that training individuals are related, but only that training and validation individuals are related. This is demonstrated below after basic definitions for linkage disequilibrium, cosegregation and additive-genetic relationships are given, and is finally completed by a simulation. Definitions Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is a population parameter defined as dependency between allele states at two loci on the same gamete in a natural breeding population [2].

Issue linkage may indeed increase the number of cooperators on the provision of a public good (a typical issue characterised by strong incentives to free-ride).
