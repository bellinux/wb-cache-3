50|$|Thermochromic dyes {{are based}} on {{mixtures}} of leuco dyes with suitable other chemicals, displaying a color change (usually between the colorless <b>leuco</b> <b>form</b> and the colored form) in dependence on temperature. The dyes are rarely applied on materials directly; they are usually {{in the form of}} microcapsules with the mixture sealed inside. An illustrative example is the Hypercolor fashion, where microcapsules with crystal violet lactone, weak acid, and a dissociable salt dissolved in dodecanol are applied to the fabric; when the solvent is solid, the dye exists in its lactone <b>leuco</b> <b>form,</b> while when the solvent melts, the salt dissociates, the pH inside the microcapsule lowers, the dye becomes protonated, its lactone ring opens, and its absorption spectrum shifts drastically, therefore it becomes deeply violet.

40|$|Opto-chemical {{capillary}} clocks {{are presented}} {{that are based}} on the measurement of a colored segment in a microchannel (a capillary). Color is created by a chromogenic chemistry involving the oxidation of a (virtually colorless) leuco-dye. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is used as a solvent, and indigo and thioindigo (in their reduced <b>leuco</b> <b>forms)</b> act as oxygen-sensitive dyes. The clock is started by removing one seal {{at the end of the}} capillary. A visible color change occurs as air diffuses into the microchannel due to an irreversible color reaction. The length of the colored segment is proportional to the time elapsed. PEGs of different average molar mass affect the diffusion rate of oxygen in the microchannel and thereby affect the rate of the migration of the color front. Both temperature and relative humidity exert a strong effect. Six types of such clocks are described that enable times to be determined in the range from 1 day to 6 months, possibly of even decades...|$|R
5000|$|A {{leuco dye}} (from the Greek leukos: white [...] ) is a dye which can switch between two {{chemical}} forms; {{one of which}} is colorless. Reversible transformations can be caused by heat, light or pH; resulting in examples of thermochromism, photochromism and halochromism respectively. Irreversible transformation typically involve reduction or oxidation. The colorless form is sometimes referred to as the <b>leuco</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E
50|$|At low temperatures, {{the mixture}} is a solid. The weak acid forms a colored complex with the leuco dye by causing the lactone ring {{in the center of}} the dye {{molecule}} to open. At high temperatures, above 24-27 °C, the solvent melts and the ammonium salt dissociates, allowing it to react with the weak acid. This reaction increases the pH, which leads to closing of the lactone ring of the dye to convert it to its colorless (<b>leuco)</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E
50|$|The central {{carbon in}} the <b>leuco</b> <b>form</b> is in a {{tetrahedral}} configuration, with four covalent bonds.In an acidic environment, the lactone ring is broken, with the oxygen detaching {{from the central}} carbon. This now-trivalent position is a planar carbocation that is resonance stabilized, interconnecting the π systems of the aromatic rings and the amino functional groups. This single large conjugated system is a chromophore with strong absorption in visible spectrum, giving this compound its distinctive color. This chemical is usually drawn in the resonance structure with the cation on nitrogen.|$|E

40|$|Spectral and photophysical {{properties}} of the indigo derivative Cibalackrot in keto and reduced (<b>leuco)</b> <b>forms</b> were studied by absorption spectra, fluorescence and pulse radiolysis and compared with the structurally similar indigo. With the keto form of this dye, fluorescence (phiF = 0. 76) and intersystem crossing (phiT = 0. 11) are dominant, whereas with indigo, efficient internal conversion (phiIC = 0. 99) is observed, probably involving proton transfer through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. With Cibalackrot, this pathway is blocked, supporting the above model for indigo. With the reduced form of Cibalackrot, more than 98 % of the absorbed quanta are dissipated through S 1 → S 0 internal conversion, which contrasts with leuco-indigo, where fluorescence (phiF = 0. 35), internal conversion (phiIC = 0. 53) and intersystem crossing (phiT = 0. 125) {{are found to be}} competitive. In addition, a synthetic precursor of Cibalackrot (preCiba) was also investigated. This has a rigid molecular structure (with a moiety identical to Cibalackrot and the other to indigo), but intra- or intermolecular proton transfer is allowed between adjacent carbonyl and N−H groups. With this precursor in its keto structure the photophysical parameters are generally very close to those of the keto form of indigo, and different from those of Cibalackrot. A more detailed investigation of the time-decay profiles of preCiba in dioxane (and with added water and D 2 O) has shown that these follow biexponential laws with a shorter component of 14 − 25 ps, which appears associated with a risetime at longer wavelength emissions (and to a positive preexponential at shorter emission wavelengths) and a longer lived (decay) component of 104 − 130 ps. In the steady-state spectra of preCiba, the variation with temperature reveals a blue shift of the emission maxima, which is interpreted as the presence (simultaneous emission) of two species (keto and enol) in the excited state. Indigo and deuterated indigo are also found to present a similar behavior. The overall data are interpreted as to be due to an excited-state process involving the proton transfer between keto and enol forms. Rate constants with values of 7 × 1010 s- 1 for preCiba and 1. 6 × 1011 s- 1 for deuterated indigo were obtained. This inverse isotope effect is justified {{on the basis of the}} proposed model for proton-transfer excited-state deactivation. [URL]...|$|R

In alcohols, small quantities of the <b>leuco</b> ether are <b>formed</b> in a reversible reaction. The {{physical and chemical}} properties of the excited singlet state of the trioxatriangulenium (TOTA(+)) carbenium ion are investigated by experimental and Computational means. The degeneracy of the lowest excited states is counteracted by Jahn-Teller-type distortion, which leads to vibronic broadening of the long wavelength absorption band. A strong fluorescence is observed at 520 nm (tau(n) = 14. 6 ns, phi(n) = 0. 12 in deaerated acetonitrile). The fluorescence is quenched by 10 aromatic electron donors predominantly via a dynamic charge transfer mechanism, but ground state complexation is shown to contribute in varying degrees. Quenching is also observed in the presence of halide ions. Quenching rate constants are derived from lifetime measurements while charge transfer (CT) complex formation constants follow from the steady-state Stern-Volmer plots. CT-complex formation with three discogenic triphenylenes is studied separately. Phosphorescence spectra, triplet lifetimes, and triplet-triplet absorption spectra are provided. In the discussion, TOTA(+) is compared to the unsubstituted xanthenium ion and its 9 -phenyl derivative with respect to the excited state properties...|$|R

This state is then conserved when the matrix solidifies again, if the cooling process is fast enough. As the <b>leuco</b> <b>form</b> is more stable in lower temperatures and solid phase, the records on thermochromic papers slowly fade out over years; this may lead to interesting effects in combination with accounting records, receipts from a thermal printer, and a tax audit.|$|E
50|$|A {{specialized}} type of vat dye called Inkodye is {{also used}} for sun-printing due to its light-sensitive quality.

Such dyes are typically used by craftspeople, fabric printers and artists and can be printed with photographic negatives, resist paste or through a silk screen.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} spectroscopic and photophysical {{study of}} the keto and leuco forms of indigo and three other ring-substituted derivatives in solution was performed.

For the case of the keto forms, pulse radiolysis experiments have revealed the existence of a triplet acceptor (from energy transfer from different donors) for the indigo, purple, and indirubin compounds.
