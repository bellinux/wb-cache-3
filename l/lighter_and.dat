5|$|While {{individual}} dogs may vary, {{in general}} show-bred Labradors are heavier built, slightly shorter-bodied, {{and have a}} thicker coat and tail. Field Labradors are generally longer-legged, <b>lighter,</b> <b>and</b> more lithe in build, making them agile. In the head, show Labradors tend to have broader heads, better defined stops, and more powerful necks, while field Labradors have <b>lighter</b> <b>and</b> slightly narrower heads with longer muzzles.|$|E

5|$|Highly {{combustible}} materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become <b>lighter</b> <b>and</b> seem to lose something in the process.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the 73-note Stage Piano was {{introduced}} as a <b>lighter</b> <b>and</b> more portable {{alternative to the}} existing two-piece style, featuring four detachable legs (used in Fender steel pedal guitars), a sustain pedal and a single output jack. Although the Stage could be used with any amplifier, catalogs suggested {{the use of the}} Fender Twin Reverb. The older style piano continued to be sold alongside the Stage and was renamed the Suitcase Piano, with 88 note models also becoming available.|$|E
5|$|Italian silk cloth {{was very}} expensive, {{as much a}} result {{of the cost of the}} raw {{material}} as of the production costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved unable to keep up with the exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded <b>lighter</b> <b>and</b> less expensive materials. These materials were used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes.|$|E

He steals Bernard's cup and, with a lighter borrowed from Beach, proceeds to burn away the wine to reveal a mysterious liquid at the bottom.

The base of the gliding surface is a plastic material that is designed both to minimize friction and, in many cases, to accept waxes. Glide wax may be used on the tails and tips of classic skis and across the length of skate skis.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} <b>lighter</b> <b>and</b> stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have to be painted to protect it from the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E

The two original PS3 Slim models, priced at US$299.99 and US$349.99 respectively, hold 120/250GB.

5|$|The Thayer {{system was}} white with large {{polygonal}} patches of light sea blue (called Thayer Blue).

Darkening the pattern increased course deception, but increased visibility at night and in haze.|$|E

The rubber ends of the balu are held between the opposing knobs of the gandingan and the player would use them to strike the knobs to achieve a sound.|$|E
5|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} in {{spectacle}} frames that are rather expensive but highly durable, long lasting, light weight, and cause no skin allergies. Many backpackers use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. Titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because it is <b>lighter</b> <b>and</b> more durable.|$|E

In its early years, silver coins were being hoarded or exported, and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce. Silver again circulated after Congress in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made <b>lighter,</b> <b>and</b> the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|As it {{has been}} since the {{creation}} of the Auxois stud book, only purebred horses and Ardennes and Trait du Nord crosses are allowed to be registered. This is to ensure selection for the desired breed characteristics, which are now a <b>lighter</b> <b>and</b> more active horse than was seen during the time of breeding for horse meat. Horses bred through artificial insemination and embryo transfer are allowed to be registered; those potentially bred through cloning are not. The Syndicat du Cheval de Trait Auxois (Auxois Draft Horse Association) is the national registry, managing the stud book, breed standard and promotion of the breed. An annual breed competition is held in September in Semur-en-Auxois.|$|E
