Our usual target group consists of Bachelor and Master students interested in learning Italian through drama techniques but whose subject is not primarily Modern Languages (non-specialist students). By proposing a set of standard skills that match CEFR parameters with artistic pedagogy training, we intend to promote valuable criteria for teachers, learners and examiners in order to promote language learning through artistic practice syllabi...|$|E
40|$|Taking up {{analytical}} {{issues raised}} primarily in Dixon (2000) and Dixon & Aikhenvald (2000), this dissertation combines descriptive {{work with a}} medium-sized (50 -language) typological study. Chapter 1 situates the dissertation against a concise survey of typological-functional work on causative constructions from the last few decades, and outlines the major research questions. Chapter 2 presents {{a case study of}} causative encoding in Hupa (California Athabaskan). I describe the morphosyntax and semantics of the Hupa syntactic causative construction, and analyze itsdistribution with respect to Dixon's (2000) proposals for a typology of causative constructions. I demonstrate that causee control (Dixon's parameter 3) over the caused microevent is a significantsemantic factor in licensing this construction. I show that Næss' (2007) model of transitivity as a set of semantic prototypes, as applied to causative event participants, nicely accounts for otheraspects of the distribution [...] particularly, why some events can be encoded in a causative construction, while other, quite similar, events must be encoded in a result clause or purposeclause. I end with an examination of how Hupa encodes causal chains within single lexical items, bringing together a small corpus study and a case study of Hupa encoding of cutting and breakingevents. Chapter 3 presents a case study of causative encoding in Chungli Ao (Tibeto-Burman). I offer a description of Chungli Ao's morphological and periphrastic causative constructions, and analyzetheir distribution with respect to Dixon's (2000) model, showing that directness of causer action (Dixon's parameter 6) can determine the choice between a lexical causative (where one is available), and a non-lexical causative construction. I present an in-depth case study of Chungli Ao encoding of cutting and breaking events, including a discussion of the semantics and distribution of several lexical suffixes and the elements of the causal chain they encode. Alsodiscussed are syntactic alternations systematically available to CUT-class verbs and BREAK-class verbs, respectively. Chapter 4 moves away from language-specific case studies, and turns to crosslinguistic research in order to address some broader research questions about universal tendencies in the encoding ofcausative relationships. I bring a new, larger body of empirical evidence to bear specifically on 2 Dixon's (2000) account of the formal and semantic factors influencing (or forcing) a speaker'schoice of one causative construction over another. Dixon's (2000) claims about prototypical patternings of compact vs. less compact constructions are not well-supported: in order for the claims to be well-supported, the values of Dixon's nine parameters would have to be correlated in individual languages at a statistically significant frequency. Parameter 5 (partially versus completely affected causee) was not found to be crucially encoded at all in a sample of 114 constructions from 50 <b>languages.</b> <b>Parameters</b> 7 (causer intentionality), 8 (naturalness of causer action) and 9 (causer accompanying or not accompanying causee) nearly always occur in isolation. The one instance of a solid correlation among parameter values (with a sample of more than 10 relevant pairing events) was that between parameters 3 (causee control) and 4 (causeewillingness). These two parameters were correlated: they were encoded together at particular values (both low or both high), or were both systematically absent, at a statistically significantfrequency. Since, in general, Dixon's proposed semantic parameters tend not to co-occur, the study shows that it is not feasible to model the distribution of causative constructions aroundnotions of semantic prototypicality. A much larger sample may show Dixon to be correct in his proposal regarding correlations between values of semantic parameters, but the current findingssuggest that his nine parameters are not likely to pattern together in subgroups. I conclude the chapter by presenting a series of constructions, encountered in the course of compiling thetypological sample, that obligatorily encode other semantic information along with causativity. I note potential patterns and propose questions for research to build on my typological study. Chapter 5 summarizes the contributions of the dissertation, and recapitulates various proposals for further study...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the task of {{unsupervised}} parser induction: automatically learning grammars and parsing models from raw text. We endeavor to induce such parsers by observing sequences of terminal symbols. We focus on overcoming the problem of frequent collocation that is {{a major source of}} error in grammar induction. For example, since a verb and a determiner tend to co-occur in a verb phrase, the probability of attaching the determiner to the verb is sometimes higher than that of attaching the core noun to the verb, resulting in erroneous attachment *((Verb Det) Noun) instead of (Verb (Det Noun)). Although frequent collocation is the heart of grammar induction, it is precariously capable of distorting the grammar distribution. Natural language grammars follow a Zipfian (power law) distribution, where the frequency of any grammar rule is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. We believe that covering the most frequent grammar rules in grammar induction will have a strong impact on accuracy. We propose an efficient approach to grammar induction guided by cross-linguistic <b>language</b> <b>parameters.</b> Our <b>language</b> <b>parameters</b> consist of 33 parameters of frequent basic word orders, which are easy to be elicited from grammar compendiums or short interviews with naïve <b>language</b> informants. These <b>parameters</b> are designed to capture frequent word orders in the Zipfian distribution of natural language grammars, {{while the rest of the}} grammar including exceptions can be automatically induced from unlabeled data. The <b>language</b> <b>parameters</b> shrink the search space of the grammar induction problem by exploiting both word order information and predefined attachment directions. The contribution of this thesis is three-fold. (1) We show that the <b>language</b> <b>parameters</b> are adequately generalizable cross-linguistically, as our grammar induction experiments will be carried out on 14 languages on top of a simple unsupervised grammar induction system. (2) Our specification of <b>language</b> <b>parameters</b> improves the accuracy of unsupervised parsing even when the parser is exposed to much less frequent linguistic phenomena in longer sentences when the accuracy decreases within 10...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel concept of dual-system simulation-sound non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs. Dual-system NIZK proof {{system can be}} seen as a two-tier proof system. As op-posed to the usual notion of zero-knowledge proofs, dual-system defines an intermediate partial-simulation world, where the proof simulator may have access to additional auxiliary information about the potential language member, for example a membership bit, and simulation of proofs is only guaranteed if the membership bit is correct. Further, dual-system NIZK proofs allow a quasi-adaptive setting where the CRS can be generated based on <b>language</b> <b>parameters.</b> This allows for the further possibility that the partial-world CRS simulator may have access to fur-ther trapdoors related to the <b>language</b> <b>parameters.</b> We show that for important hard languages like the Diffie-Hellman language, such dual-system proof systems can be given which allow unbounded partial simulation soundness, and which further allow transition between partial simulation world and single-theorem full simulation world even when proofs are sought on non-members. The construction is surprisingly simple, involving only two additional group elements in asymmetric bilinear pairing groups...|$|R

This effect was stronger when subjects previously were faced to the non-specific recovery task.

40|$|Building {{recognition}} {{systems for}} historical documents {{is a difficult}} task. Especially, {{when it comes to}} medieval scripts. The complexity is mainly affected by the poor quality and the small quantity of the data available. In this paper we apply an HMM based recognition system to medieval manuscripts from the 13 th century written in Middle High German. The recognition system, which was originally developed for modern scripts, has been adapted to medieval scripts. Beside the data processing, one of the major challenges is to create a suitable language model.

40|$|We {{define a}} novel notion of quasi-adaptive non-interactive zero {{knowledge}} (NIZK) proofs for probability distributions on parametrized languages. It is quasi-adaptive {{in the sense}} that the common reference string (CRS) generator can generate the CRS depending on the <b>language</b> <b>parameters.</b> However, the simulation is required to be uniform, i. e., a single efficient simulator should work for the whole class of parametrized languages.

For many cryptographic applications quasi-adaptive NIZKs suffice, and our constructions can lead to significant improvements in the standard model. Our construction can be based on any k-linear assumption, and in particular under the eXternal Diffie Hellman (XDH) assumption our proofs are even competitive with Random-Oracle based Σ-protocol NIZK proofs.

We distinguish linguistic deference, which concerns the use of language and the meaning of the words we use, from epistemic deference, which concerns our reasons and evidence for making the claims we make. In our in-depth study of linguistic deference, we distinguish two subcategories: default deference (roughly, the ubiquitous fact, noted by externalists like Burge or Putnam, that the truth conditions of our utterances are determined with respect to the <b>language</b> <b>parameter</b> supplied by the context), and deliberate deference (roughly, the intentional, commu-nicative act of using a given expression the way it is used in some contextu-ally specified idiolect or dialect). We also discuss the phenomenon of im-perfect mastery, often associated with deference, and which we show to be independent both of linguistic deference and of epistemic deference.
