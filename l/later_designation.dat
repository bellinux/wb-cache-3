The highway program reduced the site's integrity; on the other hand, it increased funding for emergency archeological investigations. These investigations became intensive, and today continue, and {{have led to the}} present understanding of the significance of the site. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 19, 1964, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the movie}} 50 First Dates, the {{character}} Marlin Whitmore (Blake Clark) wears a cap displaying the original designation DE-1071, indicating {{he may have}} served on the USS Badger.

5000|$|An old Yorkville family, the Stollerys owned {{a famous}} {{furnishings}} store named Stollery's, {{which opened in}} 1901 in downtown Toronto. Peter Stollery, the founder’s grandson, worked on and off at the haberdashery for 24 years, first as a furnishings’ man and eventually as a manager from 1965 to 1968 after his father, Alan Stollery, died suddenly. His attachment to these roots explain his <b>later</b> <b>designation</b> in the Canadian Senate as Senator for [...] "Bloor and Yonge", the intersection at which the store was located.|$|E

5000|$|The {{books of}} Maccabees use the names [...] "Judea" [...] and [...] "Israel" [...] (or cognates) as {{geographical}} descriptors throughout {{for both the}} land and people over whom the Hasmoneans would rule. The Talmud includes one of the Hasmonean kings under the description [...] "Kings of Israel". Scholars refer to the state as the Hasmonean Kingdom to distinguish it from the previous kingdoms of Israel. The name [...] "Judaea" [...] has also been {{used to describe the}} Hasmonean Kingdom although this name reflects the <b>later</b> <b>designation</b> of the region under the Romans at the time of Josephus' writings in the late 1st century.|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} {{is based}} on a draft from the years 1927-1929; six locomotives of the factory designation T1A and T2A were built by Fablok. The technical documentation survived until after World War II and it was decided to develop it into a new class of locomotive. 477 examples were delivered in the years 1948 - 1961 including to China, Romania and Hungary. The <b>later</b> <b>designation</b> were referred to as Ferrum 724. In China the locomotives were designated as XK 13 and several examples of the class were reported to be working in 1993, with at least three preserved thereafter.|$|E
5000|$|Rabbi Yisrael Ariel is {{the founder}} of the Temple Institute (Machon HaMikdash), which focuses on {{preparations}} for the rebuilding of the Third Temple. As a young man, he served in the paratroop unit that liberated the Western Wall (kotel) in the Six-Day War. For the 1981 Knesset elections, Rabbi Ariel ran as number 2 on the Kach list. His involvement predates the party's split after the death of party leader Rabbi Kahane in 1990 (who was assassinated by Egyptian El Sayyid Nosair), and the party's <b>later</b> <b>designation</b> as a terrorist Jewish group by the United States and Israel in 2001.|$|E

50|$|Lighter tanks formed {{almost the}} {{entirety}} of the German forces, but the heavier tanks were at least in prototype. In 1934 a number of heavy prototypes were constructed, based around either 75 or 105 mm main guns. Designated Neubaufahrzeug (NbFz) and very similar to contemporary Russian and British designs six were built by Rheinmetall and Krupp. Useful for propaganda purposes these tanks did not enter production, their <b>later</b> <b>designations</b> of PzKpfw V and VI were transferred to the production Panther and Tiger types. With the knowledge of the NbFz and the experiences of the lighter tanks in Spain, German designers began to create their own designs.|$|R

5000|$|Tiberianus was a 2nd-century Roman politician. The Byzantine chronicler Johannes Malalas (ed. Dindorf, p. 273) {{speaks of}} him as {{governor}} of the first province of Palestine (ἡγεμὼν τοῦ πρώτου Παλαιστίνων ἔθνους), {{in connection with the}} sojourn of Hadrian in Antioch (114). A similar notice may be found in Johannes Antiochenus (In Müller, [...] "Fragmenta Historicorum Græcorum," [...] iv. 580, No. 111) and in Suda, s.v. Τραϊανός. The designation [...] "Palestina prima," [...] which came into use {{in the middle of the}} fourth century, gives a historical character to this notice. These authors use a <b>later</b> <b>designation</b> for the earlier period.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, Kaprekar {{defined the}} {{property}} which {{has come to}} be known as self numbers, which are integers that cannot be generated by taking some other number and adding its own digits to it. For example, 21 is not a self number, since it can be generated from 15: 15 + 1 + 5 = 21. But 20 is a self number, since it cannot be generated from any other integer. He also gave a test for verifying this property in any number. These are sometimes referred to as Devlali numbers (after the town where he lived); though this appears to have been his preferred designation, the term self number is more widespread. Sometimes these are also designated Colombian numbers after a <b>later</b> <b>designation.</b>|$|E

50|$|The AN/PVS-4 uses a 25mm screw-type variable-gain Image Intensifier tube. Operational voltage is 3.0 Volts. Early {{production}} models feature two circular battery compartments {{located on the}} main housing. These battery compartments are designed to accommodate one 3.0V BA-5567/U, or two 1.5V BA-3058/U simultaneously. <b>Later</b> <b>designations</b> such as the AN/PVS-4A use two common AA batteries (BA-3058/U) via a purpose-built adapter (PN A3009873) that attaches {{to one of the}} circular battery compartments. Use of the adapter negates the need for BA-5567/U and BA-3058/U. AN/PVS-4s still in use today are typically upgraded with the AA battery adapter even if they have not been upgraded to a third generation tube. Some AN/PVS-4A models made after 1984 feature an integral AA battery housing that does not require the use of an external AA battery adapter.|$|R

5000|$|In 1974, 60 acre of Harmar was {{designated}} the Harmar Historic District and {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places. Forty-two buildings, plus the fort site and one object, {{were included in the}} district as contributing properties. In 1993, the district was expanded by the addition of more than two hundred contributing properties over an area of approximately 150 acre; the original district protected areas closer to the fort, while the <b>later</b> <b>designation</b> expanded the district {{to the base of the}} bluff at the far edges of the neighborhood. [...] Not all of the contributing properties are still in existence, as the destroyed Putnam Street Bridge was included in the district, but the replacement span was designed to be compatible with the architecture of Harmar to the west and the larger Marietta Historic District at its eastern end.|$|E
40|$|In the {{following}} report, we investigate the developing social worlds in late primary school, exploring the patterns in children’s general peer relationships, their closer and more significant friendships and bullying behaviours. Using cluster analysis, we identify unique {{groups of children}} characterized not only by their experiences of bullying and victimization, but the support and satisfaction they receive from their friendships and interactions {{between the ages of}} 8 and 10. We also expand past research by examining how children’s early development (ages 3 to 4) may predict their <b>later</b> <b>designation</b> as bullies and/or victims, and whether peer clusters relate to children’s contemporaneous and later adjustment...|$|E
