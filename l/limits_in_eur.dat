On 22 October 2008, Playtech announced that it would acquire private assets from Teddy Sagi in return for $250 million. Then in March 2011, Playtech bought PT Turnkey Services from Teddy Sagi for £125m. On July 2013, Playtech acquired PokerStrategy.com, one of the largest poker communities in the world with almost 7 million members, from etruvian Holdings Ltd for $49.2 million.

The plant material was obtained from a 50 -years-old female tree at the Comenius University Botanical Garden (Bratislava, Slovakia). Leaves were collected from early May to late September, with the last sample consisting of fallen leaves. The elements analyzed were: phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, scandium, iron, zinc, yttrium, molybdenum, tellurium, samarium, gadolinium, dysprosium, iridium, thallium and lead.

30|$|Subsequently, {{based on}} the volume of each {{assortment}} type, the value <b>in</b> Euro (<b>EUR)</b> was determined.

For each of the 20 stands analysed, the arithmetic mean dbh, the quadratic mean dbh, the mean height and the top height (mean height of 50 trees with the biggest dbh for each sample plot) were determined, {{as well as the}} relative spacing (the ratio of the average distance between the trees to the average dominant height of the stand) by Wilson (1946), the basal area (in square metre per hectare), the merchantable volume (in cubic metre per hectare), the value of each assortment (<b>in</b> <b>EUR)</b> and the total value of all the assortments from all the trees (<b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> per hectare).|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to the case study (see Sect.  6) alternative scenarios were prepared in order to evaluate {{the stability of the}} solution. In particular, the consequences of considering different discounting rates, uncertain demand as well as additional sustainability requirements are analyzed. Except the subject of analysis, the test instances of the scenarios are based on the same parameters as in the case study. Moreover, the same high-performance software and hardware with the same settings were used for the computations. As a result, the computation time (CT in seconds), the cash flows to/from the investor during his 3 -year engagement (FTE 0, FTE 1, FTE 2 and FTE 3 <b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> million), the expected annual cash outflow after his engagement determining the residual value (FTE 4 <b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> million), the present value of equity (VEQ <b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> million) and the overall percentage of demand coverage (COV in %) were recorded.|$|R

40|$|We {{calculate}} the electromagnetic (EM) form factors of the pseudoscalar mesons in the light-front framework. Specifically, these form factors are {{extracted from the}} relevant matrix elements directly, instead of choosing the Breit frame. The {{results show that the}} charge radius of the meson is related to both the first and second longitudinal momentum square derivatives of the momentum distribution function. The static properties of the EM form factors and the heavy quark symmetry of the charge radii are checked analytically in the heavy quark <b>limit.</b> <b>In</b> addition, we use the Gaussia-type wavefunction to obtain the numerical results.
