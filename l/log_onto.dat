The book's given links are no longer accessible on the PlayOnline website. Tetra Master was seen by GameSpot as inferior and confusing compared to Final Fantasy VIIIs minigame Triple Triad, as the rules for it were only vaguely explained {{in the game and}} there were very few rewards earned from playing it despite its expansive nature.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the album's release, Idol {{was asked}} if he feared his new {{interest}} in technology would be seen as an attempt to co-opt cyberculture. Idol denied this, stating that his belief in the relevancy of cyberpunk culture was genuine, and that he didn't care what others thought of him. However, the reaction by the majority of the online community was openly hostile and suspicious of Idol's motives. It was reported that his e-mail account on the WELL received mail from angry computer users, and was occasionally flooded with e-mail spam to antagonise him. Idol was also cast by many as a naive, tech-illiterate poseur. The charge of illiteracy was not entirely false, as {{at the time of the}} album's release, Idol was still typing using the [...] "hunt and peck" [...] system, and needed notes to <b>log</b> <b>onto</b> the internet.|$|E

500|$|From November 1, the UK {{division}} of Interscope held a contest {{to promote the}} album. The contest invited fans to <b>log</b> <b>onto</b> the band's website daily {{to pick up a}} series of coded clues which led to a hidden message. Fans who solved the riddle received an exclusive download, and were entered into a drawing for a one-week trip for two to meet the band in Hollywood. On November 14, the band took a break from the Guns, God and Government Tour to celebrate the album's US release date with a brief, invitation-only acoustic set at the Saci nightclub in New York City. Tickets for the show were given out via their website, in radio contests, and to the first 100 album buyers at Tower Records on Broadway in New York. The set consisted of four songs, including their cover [...] "Suicide Is Painless" [...] – the theme of the film (and TV series) M*A*S*H – which they had recently contributed to the [...] of [...] The following day, the vocalist appeared on Total Request Live in a segment entitled [...] "Mothers Against Marilyn Manson".|$|E
500|$|CityBridge {{emphasized}} {{that it takes}} security and privacy seriously [...] "and will never sell any personally identifiable information or share with third parties for their own use." [...] Aside from the unsecured network that devices can directly connect to, the Links provide an encrypted network that shields communications from eavesdropping within the network. There {{are two types of}} networks: a private (secured WPA/WPA2) network called [...] "LinkNYC Private," [...] which is available to iOS devices with iOS 7 and above; and a public network called [...] "LinkNYC Free Public Wi-Fi," [...] which is available to all devices but is only protected by the device's browser. Private network users will have to accept a network key in order to <b>log</b> <b>onto</b> the LinkNYC Wi-Fi. This would make New York City one of the first American municipalities to have a free, encrypted Wi-Fi network, as well as North America's largest. LinkNYC would also be the fastest citywide ISP in the world, with download and upload speeds between 15 and 32 times faster than on free networks at Starbucks, in LaGuardia Airport, and within New York City hotels.|$|E

Beyoncé knew what the videos' choreography would be before the filming began. She also planned her hairstyles, outfits and make-up. Beyoncé wanted each video to look different, and {{therefore}} she used different film techniques, fashion and styling. B'Day Anthology Video Album contains thirteen music videos and behind the scenes footage. The videos for [...] "Déjà Vu", [...] "Ring the Alarm", [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] had been shot prior to the album's filming. The other nine videos were filmed in a two-week period. B'Day Anthology Video Album contains music videos for all of the songs from the standard edition of B'Day except for [...] "Resentment". It also includes videos for [...] "Beautiful Liar", [...] "Flaws and All" [...] and [...] "Still in Love (Kissing You)", which were featured only on the deluxe edition. According to Vibe, the thirteen videos on B'Day Anthology Video Album gave Beyoncé the record of the most music videos released in a twelve-month period.|$|E
