2500|$|The other pathway, non-cyclic photophosphorylation, is a {{two-stage}} process involving {{two different}} chlorophyll photosystems. Being a light reaction, non-cyclic photophosphorylation {{occurs in the}} frets or stroma lamellae. First, a water molecule is broken down into 2H+ + 1/2 O2 + 2e− by a process called photolysis (or <b>light-splitting).</b> The two electrons from the water molecule are kept in photosystem II, while the 2H+ and 1/2O2 are left out for further use. Then a photon is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments surrounding the reaction core center of the photosystem. The light excites the electrons of each pigment, causing a chain reaction that eventually transfers energy {{to the core of}} photosystem II, exciting the two electrons that are transferred to the primary electron acceptor, pheophytin. The deficit of electrons is replenished by taking electrons from another molecule of water. The electrons transfer from pheophytin to plastoquinone, which takes the 2e− from Pheophytin, and two H+ atoms from the stroma and forms PQH2, which later is broken into PQ, the 2e− is released to Cytochrome b6f complex and the two H+ ions are released into thylakoid lumen. The electrons then pass through the Cyt b6 and Cyt f. Then they are passed to plastocyanin, [...] providing the energy for hydrogen ions (H+) to be pumped into the thylakoid space. This creates a gradient, making H+ ions flow back into the stroma of the chloroplast, providing the energy for the regeneration of ATP.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} {{of using a}} prism assembly in this way was far superior to the earlier <b>light-splitting</b> arrangements, since the prism assembly was neat and compact and reproducibility in manufacture was much improved. The problems previously experienced with double imaging (common with plate glass dichroic mirrors) were also eliminated. Furthermore, because of the near-normal incidence of light onto the dichroic surfaces, sensitivity to polarised light was reduced.|$|E

First, we propose {{a new concept}} for protecting nodes of light-trees under the sparse <b>light-splitting</b> and wavelength continuity constraints. Then, we integrate our concept in a novel algorithm, named node and link protecting candidate p-cycles based algorithm with sparse <b>light-splitting</b> constraints (NPCC-SSC). Our algorithm enables both node and link failure recovery in dynamic multicast traffic. Extensive simulations show that the NPCC-SSC algorithm achieves the best resource utilization, and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of blocking probability and computational time...|$|E
40|$|Limited by {{the sparse}} <b>light-splitting</b> {{capability}} in WDM networks, some nodes need to reroute the optical packet to different destination nodes {{with the high}} cost of routing for reducing packet loss possibility. In the paper, the longest path reroute optimization algorithm is put forward to jointly optimize the multicast routing cost and wavelength channel assignment cost for sparse splitting WDM networks. Based on heuristic algorithms, the longest path reroute routing algorithm calls multiple longest paths in existing multicast tree to reroute the path passing from the nodes which are violating the <b>light-splitting</b> constraint to the nodes which are not violating <b>light-splitting</b> constraint with few wavelength channels and low rerouting cost. And a wavelength cost control factor is designed to select the reroute path with the lowest cost by comparing the multicast rerouting path cost increment with the equivalent wavelength channel required cost increment. By adjusting wavelength cost control factor, we can usually get the optimized multicast routing according to the actual network available wavelength conversion cost. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can get the low-cost multicast tree and reduce the required number of wavelength channels...|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} {{proposed a}} mixed-integer linear-programming formulation, solved by CPLEX, {{which is a}} stateof-the-art optimization tool, and two heuristic solutions, layered all-optical multicasting algorithm (LAMA) and conservative fiber and wavelength assignment (C-FWA), for all-optical multicasting in wavelength-routed multifiber wavelength-division multiplexed networks with sparse wavelength conversion and <b>light-splitting</b> restrictions. However, LAMA was not suitable for large and dynamic multicasting problems. In this paper, we evaluate and propose scalable layered all-optical multicasting (SLAM), which is a scalable version of LAMA, for any size static or dynamic multicasting problems. We demonstrate that SLAM performs {{very close to the}} optimal (the lower bound/CPLEX) and LAMA, and significantly better than the existing work and C-FWA in terms of nearly all metrics, including the session- and groupblocking probabilities (SBPs and GBPs), since it does not separate routing and fiber-wavelength assignment steps as compared to the other candidates like the existing work and C-FWA. Additionally, transmitter-optimized SLAM, which is a version of SLAM that is specifically tuned to minimize the number of transmitters used, spends three times less extra transmitters than SLAM, without a performance loss in other metrics (one extra transmitter for 12 multicast sessions). Therefore, the adjustable parameters of SLAM make it very flexible to balance different objectives...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} the multicast-capable routing, {{modulation}} and spectrum assignment (MC-RMSA) schemes that consider the physical impairments {{from both the}} transmission and <b>light-splitting</b> in elastic optical networks (EONs). Specifically, we propose to provision each multicast request with a light-forest which consists {{of one or more}} light-trees to avoid the dilemma that because of the accumulated physical impairments, a relatively large light-tree may have to use the lowest modulation-level and hence consume too many frequency slots (FS'). In order to further improve the spectral efficiency and compensate for the differential delays among the light-trees, we incorporate the rateless network coding (R-NC) in the multicast system. We first formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model to solve the problem for static network planning. Then, we propose three time-efficient heuristics that leverage the set-cover problem and utilize layered auxiliary graphs. The simulation results indicate that in both the ILP and heuristics, the MC-RMSA with R-NC can achieve better performance on the maximum index of used FS' than that without. After that, we evaluate the heuristics in dynamic network provisioning. The results show that the MC-RMSA with R-NC can effectively improve the performance of all-optical multicast in EONs to reduce the blocking probability...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} multicast routing and wavelength assignment under the constraint of sparse light splitting or power budget. ^ The high cost of cross-connects capable of light splitting motivates us to {{investigate the}} problem of multicast routing in sparse splitting networks, where only a subset of cross-connects are capable of splitting light. We develop a rerouting algorithm that generates feasible solutions in sparse <b>light-splitting</b> optical networks. In addition, to further minimize the fiber usage in a solution, we present a heuristic based on Tabu Search that obtains solution within 10 % of the optimal in almost all the instances and within 5 % of the optimal in {{about half of the}} instances in our experiments. ^ Multi-drop path model presents a cost-effective and practical method for realizing multicast connections. In a multi-drop path model, multiple paths are employed to establish a multicast session, and each path can drop signals at no more than a predefined number of destination nodes. For the single session case, experimental results show that the proposed MFBH heuristic achieves the lower bound on the number of wavelengths in almost all instances for real-life and randomly generated networks. MFBH effectively minimizes the number of wavelengths used for a single multicast session, however, it does not perform well in minimizing the number of wavelengths used for multiple multicast sessions, because it does not consider the routing interactions among sessions. ^ To solve the problem of multicast routing and wavelength assignment under the multi-drop path model for multiple sessions case, a simple approach is to combine MFBH and the SL wavelength assignment heuristic proposed in literature. This algorithm is called MFBH-SL. We develop a more effective routing and wavelength assignment algorithm called TSH, which outperforms MFBH-SL in most instances for real-life and randomly generated networks. Furthermore, the wavelength saving is significant when session size is small (≤ 40 % of network nodes). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand of}} network {{capacity}} {{has been increasing}} steadily with more users than ever connected to the Internet through broadband access and the popularity of video based applications, such as YouTube. Optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks are expected to form the next-generation backbone network and to fulfill the insatiable appetite for bandwidth. Wavelength routed WDM optical networks offer the granularity of switching at a fiber, waveband, or a wavelength level. The finest granularity offered is at a wavelength level by provisioning lightpaths for different clients/services. All-optical packet switching is still deemed technically infeasible and its competitiveness as a backbone technology is debatable. Optical burst switching (OBS) presents itself as a promising technology for bridging the gap between optical wavelength switching and optical packet switching. OBS operates at the sub-wavelength level and is designed to improve the bandwidth utilization of wavelengths by exploring statistical multiplexing to deal with bursty traffic, and is therefore more resource efficient than optical wavelength switching. In OBS networks, arriving data packets (e. g., IP packets) are assembled at the ingress OBS nodes to form a data burst. A burst control packet (CP) is sent on a control channel ahead of the data burst to reserve resources and configure the switches along the route traversed by the data burst. In this dissertation, we will explore several important and challenging issues in OBS networks {{in order to improve}} the utilization of network resource. To reduce the switching overhead, small bursts may be groomed to reduce resource waste and switching penalty. We have studied the per-hop burst grooming problem where bursts with the same next hop may be groomed together to minimize the number of formed larger bursts and strike a proper balance between burst grooming and grooming cost, assuming all the network nodes have the grooming capability. In order to reduce computation overhead and processing delay incurred at the core nodes, we assume that grooming can only be performed at edge nodes and the core node can send a burst to multiple downstream links, that is, the core node has <b>light-splitting</b> capability. We have attempted to groom small bursts into larger bursts, and select a proper route for each large burst, such that total network resources used and/or wasted for delivering the small bursts is minimized. Optical signal transmission quality is subject to various types of physical impairment introduced by optical fibers, switching equipment, or other network components. The signal degradation due to physical impairment may be significant enough such that the bit-error rate of received signals is unacceptably high at the destination, rendering the signal not usable. Based on earlier work, we have studied scheduling and QoS provisioning problems in OBS networks, taking physical impairments into consideration. In the context of the JET signaling protocol, we have studied the burst scheduling problem and proposed three effective burst scheduling algorithms in OBS networks, taking into account physical impairment effects. Because the offset time of bursts varies in OBS networks, the voids or fragmentation on the channels in the outgoing links can severely degrade the network throughput and blocking probability performance, if not dealt with carefully. A signalling architecture called Dual-header Optical Burst Switching (DOBS) is proposed to reduce the scheduling algorithm complexity. We study the burst scheduling problem and propose an impairment aware scheduling algorithm in DOBS networks. QoS provisioning is an important issue in OBS networks. We have dealt with relative QoS support problem and proposed a QoS provisioning algorithm subject to the physical impairment constraints. A high-priority [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{literature}} on degenerative {{studies of the}} unmyelinated perivascular nerve plexus combined with histological examination is quite sparse. Tuckett (1895 - 1896) found that upon section of {{the branches of the}} superior cervical ganglion in the ox and rabbit histological and physiological changes began within twenty-four hours. At forty-three hours the irritability and conductivity of the peripheral stump were lost and the Remak fibers were degenerating. He believed that the Remak fiber had a sheath with a nucleus and that the "core" was homogenous and not composed of many fibrillae. In 1906 Lapinsky investigated the effects of denervation in the hind paw of the dog. The immediate effect was an increase in blood flow and vasodilation following denervation. The smooth muscle coat on the large arteries separated into individual cells and their nuclei swelled up and disintegrated. He was not able to find smooth muscle cells on the smaller arteries. He described the denervated arteries as losing tonus and being more fragile than normal. A somewhat more extensive study of the rabbit ear and the frog mesentery was published by Eugling (1908). Fifteen to sixteen days after denervation he found spindle-shaped nuclei with processes near the blood vessels. He believed that these were part of the degenerated nerve plexus. Since the nerve plexus had degenerated, Eugling did not think that these nuclei were ganglion-like though he did believe that {{they were part of the}} nervous system. Langley studied the effects of cutting the frog sciatic nerve and the nervus descendens communis in 1909. He reported that degeneration began in fourteen days and that the nerves disappeared in forty-two days. He believed that the axis cylinder lost its function throughout its whole length at about the same time. The sympathetic ganglia supplying the hind limbs of the cat were extirpated by Woollard (1926). He found no evidence for any "neural mechanism which survived proximal denervation". He also described the large branching spindle-shaped cells which persist after the degeneration of the nerve network. He thought that these cells were simply entwined with the nerve plexus proper. In 1929 Busch published on the problem of the innervation of the blood vessels and found no real histological differences among the frog, the guinea pig, the rabbit and man. According to Busch blood vessels, the sympathetic nerves of which had degenerated, did not completely regain tone up to ninety days following denervation. He considered the perivascular plexus to be sympathetic in nature. It was not possible for him to demonstrate autonomic ganglion cells in the limbs, and he believed that they were found only in the viscera. He obtained local contractions only, when stimulating vessels the nerve plexus of which had degenerated. In the present investigation the transilluminated denervated retrolingual membranes of living frogs, Rana pipiens, were observed directly through the microscope and simultaneously photographed with a motion picture camera by means of a <b>light-splitting</b> prism. Denervation was accomplished by sectioning the glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nerve trunks. The animals were maintained at room temperature and fed one gram of hog liver three times weekly. When the required period of time (zero to two hundred and sixty-three days) had elapsed the retrolingual membrane was exposed according to the method of Pratt and Reid (1930), as modified by Fulton and Lutz (1942). Physiological observations were then made using unipolar electrical stimulation with an especially developed micro-electrode (Fulton, 1941) and a micromanipulator. Adrenalin was administered by means of the microinjection apparatus of the Emerson micromanipulator. Dilutions of Parke-Davis adrenalin of 1 : 4 xl 06 to 1 : 1 x 103 were used. At the conclusion of the physiological testing the retrolingual membranes were prepared for histological study by a modified Ehrlich's method (Busch, 1929). [TRUNCATED...|$|E
