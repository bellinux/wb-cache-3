40|$|The {{technology}} {{used for the}} fabrication of microelectronics devices and microelectro- mechanical systems (MEMS) {{is based on the}} successive deposition or growth of planar layers and the subsequent transfer of the desired pattern onto these layers. Lithography and plasma or wet etching are the essential steps of this technology. Profile control of the etched structures is necessary for the efficient operation of the corresponding microelectronics devices and MEMS. The loss of microscopic uniformity (e. g reactive ion etching lag) and deviations from the perfectly anisotropic profiles of the structures (e. g. microtrenching, sidewall bowing, roughness) are etching artifacts that make the profile control difficult. There is a need to understand the mechanisms causing these artifacts and suppress them. Besides experimental study, topography evolution simulation of the etched structures can contribute to this direction. The goal of this work is the development of an integrated simulation framework for the topography evolution of structures etched with plasma. This framework links the bulk plasma gas phase with the profile of the etched structure and consists of: 1) A local flux calculation model. Shadowing and reemission of flux are taken into account. This model links the species fluxes in the bulk plasma gas phase with the local species fluxes inside features. 2) A surface etch model. This model includes the processes during the etching of SiO 2 and Si surface with fluorocarbon plasma. The surface model is a phenomenological model that takes into account the competitive phenomena of etching and deposition occurring during etching with fluorocarbon plasma. The model is based on site balances on the etched surface and links the species local fluxes with the <b>local</b> <b>etching</b> rate. 3) An algorithm for the topography evolution of the etched features. The level set method is implemented. The algorithm uses the <b>local</b> <b>etching</b> rate to move the topography of the etched structures. The third component of the simulation framework, the topography evolution algorithm, is a general boundary evolution algorithm, which can be applied in several areas, such as the evolution of an interface between two fluids in fluid mechanics. The coupling of the first two models of the simulation framework [components (1) and (2) ] that yields the <b>local</b> <b>etching</b> rate, defines the boundary evolution problem that the boundary evolution algorithm, namely the level set method, solves. ...|$|E
