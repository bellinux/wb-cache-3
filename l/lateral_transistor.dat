40|$|Abstract-Two-dimensional {{current flow}} in shallow-junction <b>lateral</b> <b>transistors</b> is analyzed. Emitter and base {{currents}} in stripe-geometry and circular devices {{are expressed in}} terms of a transform of the excess carrier concentration at the base surface. The dependence of current gain on device parameters is presented graphically. Modeling of <b>lateral</b> <b>transistors</b> is complicated by the twodimensional nature of current flow in the base. Several authors [11 -[4] have approached the problem by using a simplified model, considering the emitter current to be the sum of one-dimensional components in the lateral and vertical directions. Other authors [51 - [81 have used numerical methods for solving the two-dimensional continuity equation of minority carriers. It has been shown that for many cases the simple quasi-one-dimensional approach is plausible [41, and geometry-dependent factors may be used to relate two-dimensional current to that obtained from a one-dimensional model [6]. However, in the case of very shallow junctions, with depths much smaller than the lateral basewidth, the quasi-one-dimensional methods break down. For such devices (e. g., ion-implanted or mesa-structure devices) the lateral section of the transistor is very small and current flow is purely two-dimensional. The purpose of this correspondence is to present a simple approximate solution for the two-dimensional dc problem of shallow-junction <b>lateral</b> <b>transistors</b> at low-level injection.

The two {{main sources of}} low frequency 1 /f noise are mobility fluctuations and number fluctuations. Our 1 /f noise measurements in p-MOSFET's, bipolar <b>transistors,</b> and <b>lateral</b> pnp bipolar <b>transistors</b> were done at frequencies of 1 Hz and 1 KHz respectively by both the automatic and analog methods.

40|$|The {{operation}} of power <b>lateral</b> pnp <b>transistors</b> in gamma radiation field was examined by detection {{of the minimum}} dropout voltage on heavily loaded low-dropout voltage regulators LM 2940 CT 5, clearly demonstrating their low radiation hardness, with unacceptably low values of output voltage and collector-emitter voltage volatility. In conjunction with previous results on base current and forward emitter current gain of serial transistors, {{it was possible to}} determine the positive influence of high load current on a slight improvement of voltage regulator LM 2940 CT 5 radiation hardness. The high-current flow through the wide emitter aluminum contact of the serial transistor above the isolation oxide caused intensive annealing of the positive oxide-trapped charge, leading to decrease of the <b>lateral</b> pnp <b>transistor's</b> current gain, but also a more intensive recovery of the small-signal npn transistors in the control circuit. The high current density in the base area of the <b>lateral</b> pnp <b>transistor</b> immediately below the isolation oxide decreased the concentration of negative interface traps.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the piezojunction effect in silicon. The aim of this investigation is twofold. First, to propose some techniques to reduce the mechanical-stress-induced inaccuracy and long-term instability of many analogue circuits such as bandgap references and monolithic temperature transducers. Second, to apply the piezojunction effect to new mechanical sensor structures. The piezojunction effect changes the bipolar-transistor saturation current. This stress-induced change is mainly caused by the change in the conductivity of the minority-charge carriers. The piezojunction effect can be modeled by a polynomial approximation with a set of experimental constants, which are called the piezojunction coefficients. The magnitude of the piezojunction effect is determined according to the stress orientation and main carrier-flow direction through the bipolar-transistor base, both related to the silicon crystal axis. It has been found that the piezojunction effect hardly depends on the current density, as far the transistor is not operated in the high-injection level. Therefore, the voltage which is proportional to absolute temperature voltage VPTAT is much less stress sensitive than the base-emitter voltage VBE. The knowledge of the piezo-effects on device level has been used to predict and suggest methods to reduce their negative influence on the performance of important basic analogue circuits such as translinear circuits, temperature transducers and bandgap voltage references. A new stress-sensing element based on the piezojunction effect has been designed and tested. This stress-sensing element consists of two orthogonal L-PNP transistor pairs operated as a current mirror, which maximises the piezojunction effect and reduces the temperature cross-sensitivity. It has been verified that the linearity, gauge factor and temperature coefficient of the gauge factor are approximately the same as those of the sensors based on the piezoresistive effect. The predictable temperature-dependent base-emitter voltage can be used to compensate for the temperature coefficient of the gauge factor. For further reduction of the sensor area, a single <b>lateral</b> <b>transistor</b> with four split collectors has been designed to implement a stress-sensing device. In conclusion, it appears that the piezojunction effect is very suited to be used for low-power and miniaturised mechanical-stress sensors. Information Systems and Technolog...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{high voltage}} power transistor is a vertical device. That is, {{one in which}} the current flow is vertical. This construction technique has evolved from both physical reasons and the relative ease of construction of these devices. Whether the device is a Field Effect Transister (FET) or a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), this vertical current flow results in the substrate, that part of the silicon wafer on which the device is built, being the drain or the collector terminal. If it is wished to integrate circuitry to control the power device on the same chip, the fact that the substrate is a terminal which can change its potential as the load or device characteristics are varied, presents severe common mode problems. A <b>lateral</b> <b>transistor,</b> one in which all terminals are {{on the top of the}} chip and the resultant current flow is lateral to the top, can alleviate these problems to some extent. While this construction technique is not common, numerous examples of these devices exist in the literature. Generally these devices are either low voltage units or, for a given value of voltage/current capability, they use considerably more chip surface than a comparable vertical device. In this study, a new lateral device, The LAteral Bipolar Field Effect Transistor or LABFET, is described. This device replaces the normal n+-drain diffusion, used in the typical Double Diffused MOS (DMOS) transistor with a p-type diffusion. This p-diffusion acts as the emitter of a low gain p- n-p bipolar transistor. The base of this device is the n-substrate or n-well, when the device is part of an integrated circuit. The base current is supplied by turning on the DMOS Field Effect Transistor. The result is a conductivity modulated device, with all terminals on the top of the chip, a voltage withstand capability of 100 V and an on-staAte conductance of. 71 Siemans per cm of gate width. This is comparable with conventional vertical FET devices. The static and dynamic characteristics of 2 ̆ 2 Unit cell 2 ̆ 2 devices are presented with an explanation of the results and a description of the processing to produce them.

40|$|The {{international}} technology roadmap for semiconductors {{predicts that}} downscaling {{of the dimensions}} of electronic devices will continue according to Moore's law for the next 10 to 15 years. However, device scaling is {{getting more and more}} complicated due to physical limitations. Novel device architectures are needed to overcome these problems. Vertical transistors could be one potential solution since the channel length is independent from the device layout. In this thesis, novel concepts to reduce parasitic behaviour in vertical single and surround gate MOSFETs are presented. This includes a novel fillet local oxidation (FILOX) process, optimisations of the pillar, a pillar top insulator and the incorporation of polySiGe into the source of a vertical MOS transistor. Calculations based on industry layout rules at the l 00 nm technology node for vertical and lateral devices are presented. For the optimised minimum geometry single gate vertical MOSFET incorporating FILOX with optimised pillar structure, the gate/drain capacitance is 40 % and the gate/source overlap capacitance 60 % of that of a minimum dimension lateral MOS device. For optimised surround gate transistors the overlap capacitance is 20 % and 5 % of that of a <b>lateral</b> <b>transistor.</b> These calculations demonstrate the potential of optimised vertical MOS transistors. Pillar capacitors incorporating the FILOX process have been fabricated and a reduction in the measured capacitance is obtained by a factor of 1. 4 and 5. 6 for structures with nitride top and nitride top and FILOX, respectively. Device simulations confirm the measured reduction in capacitance. The extracted oxide thickness on the pillar sidewall is 9. 3 nm for the fabricated structures, which agrees within a factor of 1. 18 with the simulated oxide thickness on the sidewall. Kinks in CV measurements have been investigated and explained by the formation of an inversion layer underneath the field oxide. A low overlap capacitance, surround gate, vertical MOSFET technology is presented, which uses FILOX to reduce the overlap capacitance between the gate and the drain {{on the bottom of the}} pillar. Fabricated n-channel devices show subthreshold slopes of 111 and 123 mV/decade for 3 nm gate oxide thickness and a channel length of about 105 nm for single and surround gate devices, respectively.

The attractive features of these filters include their compact structure, their potential to run at high frequencies while operating from low power supplies, and their electronic tunability.

In this work, the development of log-domain filters in CMOS technology will be investigated. The <b>lateral</b> bipolar <b>transistor,</b> inherent to CMOS processes, will be used for this purpose.

40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry has largely relied on Moore’s law, {{based on the}} observation that every new generation of transistors has been better than the previous one in Power, Performance, Area and Cost (PPAC) metrics simultaneously. However, this trend is under a pressure now. The main issue {{is related to the}} enormous complexity of both technology and design, which drastically raises not only the manufacturing, but also the R&D costs. Therefore, in order to minimize risks and maximize benefits of a new technology, it is being co-optimized hand in hand with a design relying on this technology. The scaling of <b>lateral</b> <b>transistors</b> is going to reach its limit soon because it mainly relies on the scaling of contacted gate pitch (CGP), which, in turn, forces the scaling of gate length, S/D spacers and contacts. Reduction of any of these dimensions is undesirable as it leads to poorer electrostatic control, increased parasitic capacitance and increased access resistance, respectively. There are lateral devices, like nanowire-based FETs, which may postpone the problem of CGP budgeting but they cannot solve it. The focus of this PhD work is on the vertical devices. These devices are less constrained on gate length and spacer thickness as they are oriented vertically and thus should demonstrate better scalability than <b>lateral</b> <b>transistors.</b> We quantify the advantages of the vertical devices in terms of PPA metrics through a holistic benchmark by combining the design techniques and technology limitations which are likely to be in place at the 5 nm technology. In order to do this, we perform the layouts analysis, model and evaluate RC parasitics, calibrate compact models to TCAD and experimental data. Afterwards, we run simulations on a ring oscillator level to extract the PPA metrics. We have not limited ourselves to the conventional MOSFETs only, but we also benchmark vertical III-V heterojunction Tunnel FETs {{in order to get a}} better understanding under which conditions the vertical architecture is the most advantageous.
