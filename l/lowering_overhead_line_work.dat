40|$|The great {{extension}} of the electric transmission network entails {{a great number of}} intersections of <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> with other <b>works</b> e. g. streets, railway lines, ropeways, canals and rivers. In Italy, the law rules for installation of <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> regard also such cases (termed as "crossings") and compel (depending upon the rated voltage) a sum of installation criteria, electrical clearances, calculations of mechanical checks (for the conductors, the insulator strings and the towers) in order to achieve a suitable reliability in relation to detailed environmental situations particularly conservative. This paper, with relation to the "overpassings" of some electric <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> upon ropeways, reports the computations of the current magnitudes of a possible short circuit due to the accidental falling or lowering of an electric conductor upon a wire rope and with the experimental procedures performed in order to both re-create the short circuit occurrences and verify the subsequent damages on wire rope. This study has been promoted and financed by the Autonomous Province of Trento and the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta, and entrusted to the University of Padova (Department of Electrical Engineering) which has developed it through the following phases: 1. 	Hypotheses of possible occurrences; 2. 	Calculation of magnitudes and durations of possible short circuit currents; 3. 	Evaluation of fundamental and meaningful parameters to adopt in the electrical tests; 4. 	Coordination of electrical tests (tests with strong currents injected into different types of wire ropes, carried out by SVEPPI Laboratory) and of the damage checks by means of sight inspections and tensile tests on the wire ropes (carried out by LA. T. I. F Technological Laboratory). Even if the hypothesised occurrences have a very low probability (considering the conservative requirements of abovementioned Rules for the installation of <b>overhead</b> <b>lines),</b> the study results play a meaningful role since they put in evidence unsuspected phenomena with effects that are undetectable by sight inspections but very detrimental on the safety of ropeways...|$|R

In this project, the insulator length and clearances of swing conductor to tower body, top cross-arm, bottom cross-arm and conductor to conductor are considered. The purpose of this work {{is to determine the}} clearances necessary to insulator withstand for 400 kV line. In addition, {{it is also important to}} make sure that conductors have to maintain the clearances under TOV (temporary over-voltage), switching and lightning overvoltages. The work in this project have used Excel and Smart Draw to analyze the results and plot the clearance distances of swing conductor, also the phase to phase rms voltage and redrawing the existing overhead tower. Therefore, voltages rating for the L 3 tower can be determined through the available clearances. Firstly, the voltage rating is determined with standard 400 kV specification of insulator length. Then, the insulator is being shorted to do the analysis to the voltage rating and lastly, the overall cross-arm is changed to fully insulate such as composite cross-arm. As the result, by using standard insulator length, the tower only carried 351 kV rather than composite cross-arm that carry 450 kV. The standard L 3 tower will be increase the power transfer capacity to 400 kV in term of voltage by changing the steel cross-arm to composite cross-arm...|$|R
