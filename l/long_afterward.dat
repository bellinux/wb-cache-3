Upon his return, he wed Teresa Woynianka-Jasieniecka, but their marriage ended abruptly with her death not <b>long</b> <b>afterward.</b> The union, however, raised his social status. In 1700, he participated in the Lithuanian Civil War as {{a supporter of the}} Sapieha family, fighting in the Battle of Olkieniki.

Not <b>long</b> <b>afterward,</b> it heads into Raritan Township again, where it crosses CR523 (Walter E.

5|$|During the War of 1812, the Barbary states took {{advantage}} of the weakness of the United States Navy to again capture American merchant ships and sailors. After the Treaty of Ghent was signed, the United States looked at ending the piracy in the Mediterranean which had plagued American merchants for two decades. On 3 March 1815, the U.S. Congress authorized deployment of naval power against Algiers, beginning the Second Barbary War. Two powerful squadrons under the command of Commodores Stephen Decatur, Jr. and William Bainbridge, including the 74-gun ships of the line , , and , were dispatched to the Mediterranean. Shortly after departing Gibraltar en route to Algiers, Decatur's squadron encountered the Algerian flagship Meshuda, and, in the Action of 17 June 1815, captured it. Not <b>long</b> <b>afterward,</b> the American squadron likewise captured the Algerian brig Estedio in the Battle off Cape Palos. By June, the squadrons had reached Algiers and peace was negotiated with the Dey, including a return of captured vessels and men, a guarantee of no further tributes and a right to trade in the region.|$|E

25|$|After his death, he was {{excluded}} from the pantheon of revolutionary heroes until the Sonoran generals Obreg√≥n and Calles, whom he battled during the Revolution, were gone from the political stage. Villa's exclusion from the official narrative of the Revolution might have contributed to his continued posthumous popular acclaim. He was celebrated during the Revolution and <b>long</b> <b>afterward</b> by corridos, movies about his life, and novels by prominent writers. In 1976, his remains were reburied in the Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City in a huge public ceremony not attended by his widow Luz Corral.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, Pryor {{moved to}} Berkeley, California, where he {{immersed}} himself in the counterculture and rubbed elbows {{with the likes of}} Huey P. Newton and Ishmael Reed. He signed with the comedy-oriented independent record label Laff Records in 1970, and in 1971 recorded his second album, Craps (After Hours). Two years later, the relatively unknown comedian appeared in the documentary Wattstax (1972), wherein he riffed on the tragic-comic absurdities of race relations in Watts and the nation. Not <b>long</b> <b>afterward,</b> Pryor sought a deal with a larger label, and he signed with Stax Records in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Watts {{spent several}} {{holidays}} in France in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy Epicurean with strong interests in both Buddhism and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It was not <b>long</b> <b>afterward</b> that Watts felt forced {{to decide between}} the Anglican Christianity he {{had been exposed to}} and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the London Buddhist Lodge, which had been established by Theosophists, and was now run by the barrister Christmas Humphreys. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of meditation during these years.|$|E

Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate.|$|E

25|$|In poverty-stricken Virginia {{during the}} post-War period, the young Glass {{received}} only a basic education {{at a private}} school run by one-legged former Confederate Henry L. Daviess. However, his father kept an extensive library. He became an apprentice printer to his father (and Hardwicke) when he was 13 years old, and continued his education through reading. Carter Glass read Plato, Edmund Burke and William Shakespeare, among others that stimulated a lifelong intellectual interest. In 1876, Major Glass accepted an offer to edit the Petersburg News, and Carter joined him as a journeyman printer. Not <b>long</b> <b>afterward,</b> Major Glass accepted the editorship of the Danville Post, but Carter did not join him, but instead returned to Lynchburg.|$|E
25|$|If, therefore, in the {{following}} pages I fall into any errors, I hope they will be dealt with as honest mistakes, and not as indicating that I have forgotten our ancient motto.

25|$|In 1959, Gigante was convicted, with Vito Genovese, {{of heroin}} {{trafficking}} {{and sentenced to}} seven years in prison.

He was paroled after five years. Not <b>long</b> <b>afterward,</b> he was promoted from soldier to captain, running the Greenwich Crew.

25|$|Crescentius the Elder, {{the brother}} of Pope John XIII, had {{previously}} deposed and had strangled Pope Benedict VI, and helped install Antipope Boniface VII in Rome {{in opposition to the}} imperial candidates, Pope Benedict VII and Pope John XIV, the latter of which perished in the Castel Sant'Angelo like Benedict V. Crescentius the Younger, the son of Crescentius the Elder, likely had a strong hand in the election of Pope John XV, although the details of that papacy are incomplete and disputed. However, it is known that Crescentius the Younger deferred to Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor for the choice of the successor of John XV: Pope Gregory V, Otto III's cousin.

25|$|It was in 1891 {{that many}} of Petipa's {{original}} ballets, revivals, and dances from operas began to be notated in the method of dance notation created by Vladimir Stepanov. The project began with a demonstration to the committee of the Imperial Ballet (consisting of Petipa, Lev Ivanov, the former Prima Ballerina Ekaterina Vazem, the former premier danseur Pavel Gerdt, and the great teacher Christian Johansson) with Stepanov himself notating Lev Ivanov and Riccardo Drigo's 1893 ballet La Fl√ªte magique, and not <b>long</b> <b>afterward</b> the project was set into motion with a revival of Jules Perrot's ballet Le r√™ve du peintre.

25|$|Following his ordination, Gibbs became {{active in}} the {{abolitionist}} movement. He attended a series of black conventions where he worked with Frederick Douglass and served on committees. He gradually became known nationally {{for his work in}} the movement. Gibbs was featured in anti-slavery publications including The Liberator and The National Anti-Slavery Standard. His rising fame was indicative of Gibbs' own ambitions as well his skills as an orator and rising abolitionist minister. His growing involvement in New York's abolitionist movement separated him from his family. In part due to his extensive absences from home and his parish duties, Gibbs became increasingly alienated from his wife. Anna was accustomed to living standards that a young pastor could not afford. The tension between husband and wife prompted Gibbs to consider leaving the United States for Africa to work as a missionary. However, he was persuaded by his congregation to abandon these plans. The marital discord eventually led to lengthy and bitter divorce proceedings, which lasted until 1862. Not <b>long</b> <b>afterward,</b> Gibbs returned to his native Philadelphia where he continued work in the abolitionist movement.|$|E
