5|$|Schnaufer was {{transferred}} to IV Gruppe of NJG1 (IV./NJG1—4th group of the 1st Night Fighter Wing), based in the Netherlands at <b>Leeuwarden</b> Air Base, where he was appointed Staffelkapitän (squadron leader) of the 12. Staffel (12./NJG1—12th squadron of 1st Night Fighter Wing) on 13 August 1943. He took over command from Oberleutnant Eberhard Gardiewski, who had been taken prisoner of war. At the time, IV./NJG1 was {{under the leadership of}} Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Hauptmann Hans-Joachim Jabs. Jabs' first impression of Schnaufer was not entirely favourable. Shortly after Schnaufer's arrival, on one of his first missions in <b>Leeuwarden,</b> Schnaufer had taken right of way during taxiing. This forced Jabs into second place in order of takeoff, an act of insubordination and perceived as arrogant by Jabs.|$|E
5|$|III./JG 1 {{was formed}} in January 1942 in Husum. 7./JG 1 {{consisted}} of supplemental flights (Einsatz-Schwärme) of fighter pilot schools (Jagdfliegerschule or JFS) Gleiwitz, Breslau and Königsberg. III./JG 1 was re-designated I./JG 11 on 1 April 1943 and a new III./JG established on 23 May in <b>Leeuwarden</b> led by Major Karl-Heinz Leesmann.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord {{headed to}} Cambuur <b>Leeuwarden</b> in the {{beginning}} of November, resulting in a 0–2 win with goals by Immers and Te Vrede. The win moved Feyenoord back into fourth place in the league table. The club hosted AZ in the second week of November for a 2–2 draw. Te Vrede and Immers scored 3 minutes apart just after half time; the final score was reached after Jóhannsson successfully converted a penalty. During the international match break Feyenoord played a friendly behind closed doors against FC Groningen, a game they won 4–1. Feyenoord closed out the month of November with a road game against RKC Waalwijk. They lost the game due to a lone 93rd-minute goal by their opponent.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} before his 22nd birthday, on 15 February 1944, Schnaufer and his crew claimed aerial {{victories}} 45 to 47. Bomber Command had sent 561 Lancasters and 314 Halifax four-engined bombers, supported by de Havilland Mosquito night-fighters and bombers, destined for Berlin. Schnaufer, who had been suffering from stomach pains all day, and his crew returned to <b>Leeuwarden</b> at 00:14. Rumpelhardt {{had been the first}} to congratulate him on his birthday over the intercom. Their fellow airmen had prepared a birthday celebration. The stomach pains had become unbearable and Schnaufer was taken to a hospital with appendicitis. He stayed in the hospital for about two weeks before, together with Rumpelhardt, he went on vacation back home. Carelessly lifting his suitcase, he burst his stitches, resulting in further hospitalisation. He flew his first mission after these events on 19 March 1944.|$|E
5|$|Braham flew in {{the first}} wave. As Braham's wave reached <b>Leeuwarden</b> in the Netherlands and while {{four of the five}} RAF fighters made no contact, Braham {{attracted}} two enemy night fighters. The Messerschmitt Bf 110s were from IV./Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (Night Fighter Wing 1). Five had taken off under the command of Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who finished the war as the most successful night fighter of all time with 121 air victories. Schnaufer led his flight out toward the echo but turned back himself after engine trouble. Using his Serrate radar detector, Braham and his radar operator picked up the emissions made by the German fighters' Lichtenstein radar. He gained on and shot down Feldwebel Georg Kraft, an Experten with 15 air victories from 4./NJG 1. Kraft was killed. Another Bf 110 had witnessed the action and attempted to engage Braham but was outmanoeuvred and dispatched also. Its pilot, Feldwebel Heinz Vinke was the only member of his crew to survive. Braham considered shooting at one crew member, likely Vinke, who he had seen parachute out of the aircraft, but Bill Gregory persuaded him not to. Braham's Beaufighter was nearly struck by debris from the last victim. Braham had a habit of opening fire at very close range and the resulting disintegration of the Messerschmitt hurled debris at the closely following Beaufighter. One reason for firing at close-range was Braham's high state of fatigue. In such a state Braham could barely keep his eyes open. Whenever he peered ahead they smarted and misted.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1940, the first night fighters were {{transferred}} to <b>Leeuwarden</b> in the Netherlands. Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld {{was one of the}} pilots included in this small detachment. As early as 20 October 1940, he had taken over command of an independent night fighter commando at Schiphol and later at Bergen. On his first encounter with the Royal Air Force (RAF) bomber, in the night of 16 to 17 November 1940, he claimed a Vickers Wellington bomber from No. 115 Squadron RAF shot down at 02:05 hours. His second victory was claimed on the night of 15 January 1941, when he shot down an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley N1521 of the Linton-on-Ouse based No. 58 Squadron RAF over the northern Netherlands, near the Dutch coast in the Zwanenwater at a nature reserve at Callantsoog. He was wounded in action on 13 March 1941, while flying Bf 110 D-2 (Werknummer 3376– factory number) of the 4./NJG1 with his radio operator Josef Renette when he made an emergency landing at Bergen after their aircraft was hit by the defence fire, wounding them both. Shortly after midnight on 10 April 1941, Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld claimed a No. 12 Squadron RAF Wellington over the IJsselmeer, raising NJG1's victory score to 100. This achievement was celebrated at the Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam with General Josef Kammhuber, Wolfgang Falck, Werner Streib, Helmut Lent and others attending. On 30 June 1941 while flying Bf 110 C-4 (Werknummer 3273) on a practice intercept mission over Noord Holland, he collided with Bf 110 C-7 (Werknummer 2075) piloted by Leutnant Rudolf Schoenert of the 4./NJG1 and crashed near Bergen aan Zee. On 19 June 1941 he earned his first of four references in the daily Wehrmachtbericht, a daily bulletin from the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (High Command of the Armed Forces). By July 1941 his number of aerial victory claims stood at 10. Promoted to Oberleutnant he became Staffelkapitän of the 5th Staffel of Nachtjagdgeschwader 2 (NJG2) on 15 November 1941. By the end of 1941 he had claimed a total of 15 aerial victories.|$|E

25|$|Halbertsma's mother Ruerdtsje was {{the main}} force behind the {{thorough}} education her sons received. Justus she sent to the French school in the provincial capital of <b>Leeuwarden</b> for a year, and after that, she enrolled him in the Latin school in <b>Leeuwarden</b> from 1801 to 1806. At {{the advice of his}} mother and the Mennonite minister Jan Brouwer, from <b>Leeuwarden,</b> Justus Halbertsma chose a clerical career, for which he studied theology at the Mennonite Seminary in Amsterdam from 1807 to 1813. In that period he also immersed himself {{in the study of the}} North Germanic languages. In 1814, Halbertsma became minister in Bolsward, where he remained until 1821. Afterwards, he served the Mennonite congregation in the city of Deventer, in the province of Overijssel, from 1822 to his retirement in 1856.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the Noord Friesche Locaalspoorweg-Maatschappij built two {{lines in the}} north of Friesland. The line from <b>Leeuwarden</b> to Ferwerd opened in 1901, being {{extended}} to Metslauwier later that year. A line branched off at Stiens, reaching Harlingen by 1904, with a branch to Franeker and another goods-only branch to Berlikum. A final extension of the original line reached Anjum in 1913.|$|E
25|$|Pieter Jelles Troelstra (<b>Leeuwarden,</b> 20 April 1860 – The Hague, 12 May 1930) was a Dutch {{politician}} {{active in}} the socialist workers' movement.

He dropped Saki {{for the first time with}} a right uppercut. The second knockdown came from a right hook. Finally, he landed a right uppercut which dropped Saki and ended the fight.|$|E
25|$|In Haarlem's first match {{since they}} bought Derksen, he {{immediately}} impressed the club. He formed the link Haarlem's defence had missed. His contract was extended by {{a year in}} time. At {{the end of the}} season Haarlem had to play a last decisive game against Cambuur <b>Leeuwarden.</b> With a victory they'd have gathered enough points to celebrate the championship. They won, although nobody could deny they had been very lucky: many arbitral errors had helped them achieve their goal.|$|E
25|$|His first {{professional}} football club was Go Ahead Eagles, where he stayed for two years. Go Ahead Eagles was famous back then {{for having the}} country's most successful youth academy. Derksen {{was one of the}} six players in the club's boarding school, together with Oeki Hoekema, André van der Leij, Ger Veerman, Herman Tieselink and Tiny Broers. However, he did not make it in Deventer and the 19-year-old left-back then signed a one-year-contract with Cambuur <b>Leeuwarden.</b>|$|E
25|$|She {{was born}} in <b>Leeuwarden,</b> The Netherlands, but grew up in Africa. Her parents moved to Uganda shortly after they got together. Her father who had just {{graduated}} from Academie Minerva, an art school in Groningen, found a job at an advertising agency in Kampala. They {{moved back to the}} Netherlands to flee Idi Amin's reign of terror. Her mother was pregnant at the time, and a few months later she {{was born in}} the Frisian capital.|$|E
25|$|The Tadema {{family moved}} in 1838 {{to the nearby}} city of <b>Leeuwarden,</b> where Pieter's {{position}} as a notary would be more lucrative. His father died when Lourens was four, leaving his mother with five children: Lourens, his sister, and three boys from his father's first marriage. His mother had artistic leanings, and decided that drawing lessons should {{be incorporated into the}} children's education. He received his first art training with a local drawing master hired to teach his older half-brothers.|$|E
25|$|When Hidde Halbertsma died, in January 1809, and was {{followed}} in death {{by his wife}} Ruerdtsje Binnerts in December of that same year, the Brothers Halbertsma became orphans at a young age. Justus, the eldest brother, was in Amsterdam at that time, studying to become a minister, while Eeltsje, the youngest, was boarding in the provincial capital of <b>Leeuwarden,</b> where he attended the Latin school. In consequence, it fell to Tsjalling to keep their father's bakery running {{with the help of}} their father's baker's mates, until the third brother, Binnert, was old enough to take over the business.|$|E
25|$|Coehoorn {{was born}} in Britsum, a village north of <b>Leeuwarden</b> in the Dutch {{province}} of Friesland. He received an excellent military and general education, and {{at the age of}} sixteen became a captain in the Dutch army. During the Anglo-Dutch Wars, he took part in the defence of Maastricht in 1673 and in the siege of Grave in 1674, where he used the small mortars (called coehorns) invented by him to great effect against the French garrison. He was promoted to the rank of colonel for his gallant conduct at the battle of Seneffe (1674), and was also present at the Battle of Cassel (1677) and the Battle of Saint Denis (1678).|$|E
25|$|Due to a {{very severe}} {{outbreak}} {{at the end of}} the 1760s, some of the best-known names in Dutch medicine became involved in the struggle against the disease. Several independent trials were begun, most notably by Pieter Camper in Groningen and Friesland. The results of his experiment in Friesland were encouraging, but they proved to be the exception: testing by others in the provinces of Utrecht, <b>Leeuwarden</b> and Friesland obtained disastrous results. As a result, the Frisian authorities concluded in 1769 that the cause of rinderpest was God's displeasure with the sinful behavior of the Frisian people, and proclaimed 15 November a day of fasting and prayer. Interest in inoculation declined sharply across the country.|$|E
25|$|Alma-Tadema left Taeye's {{studio in}} November 1858 {{returning}} to <b>Leeuwarden</b> before settling in Antwerp, where {{he began working}} with the painter Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys, whose studio {{was one of the}} most highly regarded in Belgium. Under his guidance Alma-Tadema painted his first major work: The Education of the children of Clovis (1861). This painting created a sensation among critics and artists when it was exhibited that year at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp. It is said to have laid the foundation of his fame and reputation. Alma-Tadema related that although Leys thought the completed painting better than he had expected, he was critical of the treatment of marble, which he compared to cheese.|$|E
25|$|Troelstra was {{the member}} of {{parliament}} for the district of <b>Leeuwarden,</b> close to the men's village of Beetgum, and was drawn into the case after the brother's conviction. He collected additional evidence, which he published in socialist newspapers. One of his revelations was that soon after the burglary, three men had quickly emigrated to America and Germany. However, Troelstra did not manage to get the case retried. The affair gained fame, particularly in socialist circles, as the Dutch pendant of the French Dreyfus Affair, and Troelstra's role was, perhaps not coincidentally, not unlike that played by Émile Zola. Despite the failure of his efforts (the brothers served most of their sentence), they contributed to Troelstra's reputation and goodwill in the Frisian countryside.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in {{the rest}} of Oostergo and in Westergo {{resistance}} against the Hollanders flared up in many places. Officials appointed by the count were in fear of their life and could not let their guard down anywhere, as is shown by the fate of Simon van Zaanden, the steward of Oostergo and Westergo, who was murdered in the monastery (!) of Klaarkamp, shortly after the relief of Dokkum. But the matter did not end with a few violent incidents. Around the middle of June there was open insurrection in the area surrounding the city of <b>Leeuwarden,</b> the capital of Oostergo, and in the area directly inland from Staveren. From there it spread like an oil spill over the rest of Oostergo and Westergo.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{increased}} demand, F.4 production was divided between Gloster and Armstrong Whitworth. The majority of early F.4s {{did not go}} to the RAF: 100 were exported to Argentina, seeing action on both sides in the 1955 revolution; in 1947, only RAF Nos. 74 and 222 squadrons were fully equipped with the F.4. Nine further RAF squadrons converted from 1948 onwards. From 1948, 38 F.4s were exported to the Dutch, equipping four squadrons (322, 323, 326 and 327) split between bases in Soesterberg and <b>Leeuwarden</b> until the mid-1950s. In 1949, only two RAF squadrons were converted to the F.4, Belgium was sold 48 aircraft in the same year (going to 349 and 350 squadrons at Beauvechain) and Denmark received 20 over 1949–1950. In 1950, three more RAF squadrons were upgraded, including No. 616 and, in 1951, six more.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to nearby}} rivers, {{there are several}} major bridges in and around Zwolle. The most {{important}} bridge is the IJssel Bridge where the A28 motorway runs across. It was completed in 1970 and carries over 125.000 vehicles per day. Adjacent to this bridge is the older IJssel Bridge, which opened in 1930 and was destroyed twice during World War II. A third IJssel Bridge is the railway bridge (called Hanze boog) which carries the railway line from Zwolle to Amersfoort, and from 2012, to Lelystad. There are several bridges across the Zwarte Water River, including two 4-lane bridges, a 2-lane bridge, and a bus/bicycle bridge. There is also a bridge across the Vecht, which carries A28 motorway. Another local bridge is adjacent to this bridge. A third bridge carries rail traffic to <b>Leeuwarden</b> and Groningen. Numerous local bridges exist around the historic city center.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of all three Brothers Halbertsma, their short fiction and poetry was {{gathered}} {{under the supervision of}} librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff. In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in Deventer, under the title of Rimen en Teltsjes ("Rhymes and Tales"). Apart from a few of his poems and his part in De Skearwinkel fan Joutebaas ("Boss Joute's Barbershop"), Tsjalling Halbertsma works, however, remained outside of that collection. It was not until the fourth reprint of Rimen en Teltsjes, which was published in 1918 by publisher and bookshop owner Rinse van der Velde from <b>Leeuwarden,</b> that the composition of the work was thoroughly adjusted. At that time Tsjalling's contribution took a more visible form through the absorption of De Wiersizzerij fan Maaike Jakkeles ("The Fortune-telling of Maaike Jakkeles") and a number of shorter texts and poems.|$|E
25|$|After that, Tsjalling Halbertsma {{started to}} work {{for one of his}} uncles in Grou, who was a {{merchant}} trading in butter and cheese. At that time farmer's wives churned and made cheese at the farmstead, selling their products to merchants who traded it away, not seldom to foreign markets. In time, Halbertsma took over his uncle's company, which he expanded steadily over the course of many years. At first he worked on commission for the Amsterdam trading house of Pijnakker, but later on, he went into business for himself, buying up dairy products in Friesland and selling them with considerable profit in London. Halbertsma became a wealthy man, who, with his brother Binnert (who had sold the bakery and had become a wood merchant) and only ten others, such as Freerk Dirks Fontein of Harlingen, Michiel Hylkes Tromp of Woudsend, Hans Klazes Wouda of Sneek and Dirk Piers Zeper of <b>Leeuwarden</b> {{was a member of the}} new Frisian Chamber of Commerce. Furthermore, from 1850 to his death, he had a seat in the provincial assembly of Friesland.|$|E
25|$|By September it {{had become}} a general {{uprising}} and the Hollanders were driven into retreat everywhere. The fortress at Ter Luine was taken relatively early, probably in the middle of July. It was besieged by a large Frisian force and stormed day and night. The garrison of 200 men, led by Gillis van Schengen was not a match for this and asked for a free retreat, which was granted. Thereupon the city of Dokkum was besieged by Frisians from Oostergo, Achtkarspelen and the Frisian territories across the Lauwers, as well as by men of Groningen. The garrison surrendered around the beginning of September. Close to <b>Leeuwarden</b> the Cammingaburg, the castle of Gerard Camminga, one of Albert's main supporters in Oostergo, was also besieged and captured. Close to the city of Sneek the same fate befell the Rodenburg, the castle of Renik of Sneek, one of Albert's supporters in southern Westergo. Most of the Vetkoper headlings Albert had appointed to prominent positions had to flee to Holland at this point. The most important of these refugees were: Gerard Camminga, Feye of Dokkum, Renik of Sneek, Tsjerk Waltha, Gotschalk Heslinga, Galtke Aninga, Schelte Liauckama, and Bauwo of Sauwerd. Some others of Albert's erstwhile supporters, among them Heere Hottinga, Sjoerd Wiarda, and Haring Harinxma, apparently defected to the Schieringers.|$|E
500|$|In 1860, the Dutch {{government}} {{passed a}} law {{for the construction of}} ten state railways (...) [...] The Harlingen–Nieuweschans railway or Staatslijn B was opened between 1863 and 1868. The first part between Harlingen Haven and <b>Leeuwarden</b> was opened in 1863 and the second part between <b>Leeuwarden</b> and Groningen in 1865.|$|E
