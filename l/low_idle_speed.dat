Eight of the large cars were built, mainly for family members, but only a single prototype of the smaller machine.

50|$|In typical {{combustion}} engines found in vehicles, the torque is <b>low</b> at <b>idling</b> <b>speed,</b> reaches a maximal value between 1,500 and 6,500 RPM, and then falls {{more or less}} sharply toward the redline. Below the RPM of maximal torque, the compression is not ideal. Above this speed several factors start to limit the torque, such as growing friction, the required time for closing the valves and combustion, and insufficient intake flow. Due to increasing vibration and heat, an external RPM limitation may also be installed. Power {{is the product of}} torque multiplied by speed of rotation (analogous to force times speed), so peak power is produced in the upper speed range where there's both high torque and high RPM.|$|R

IC engines involve complex fluid dynamic interactions between air flow, fuel injection, moving geometries, and combustion. Fluid dynamics phenomena like jet formation, wall impingement with swirl and tumble, and turbulence production are critical for high efficiency engine performance and meeting emissions criteria.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} robust sliding mode {{control of}} uncertain time delay systems with unmatched parameter uncertainties and matched bounded external disturbances. Sliding mode control breaks down into two phases: sliding manifold design and controller design. Two types of sliding manifold design are considered: linear function of (i) current system states, and (ii) current and delayed system {{states as well as}} delayed control. Sufficient conditions in terms of Algebraic Riccati Inequalities and Linear Matrix Inequalities are given as functions of parameter uncertainties, external disturbances and time delays for the stability of system states restricted on the designed manifolds. Next (discontinuous) controllers are developed to globally attract system state trajectories to the designed manifolds. The control structure consists of three terms: an equivalent control for the underlying nominal system, a compensation term for the uncertainties, and a discontinuous term to ensure the reachability of the manifolds. The bounding techniques of the {{sliding mode control}}ler design are then used to develop a combined classical (non-sliding) controller-observer design method for uncertain time delay systems. Two observer structures are developed to estimate system states, and a linear feedback control is given based on the observed states to asymptotically stabilize the combined plant-controller-observer. Lastly the methods are applied to Internal Combustion engine idle speed control problem. Simulation results show that the controllers can operate the engine at a <b>low</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> and smoothly reject typical load disturbances. This would provide better fuel economy and more comfortable drive than current production controllers. ...|$|E

Crankcase emissions are a complex mixture of combustion products and aerosol generated from lubrication oil. The crankcase emissions contribute substantially to the total particulate matter (PM) emitted from an engine. Environment legislation demands that either the combustion and crankcase emissions are combined to give a total measurement, or the crankcase gases are re-circulated back into the engine. There is a lack of understanding regarding the physical processes that generate crankcase aerosols, with a paucity of information on the size/mass concentrations of particles present in the crankcase. In this study the particulate matter crankcase emissions were measured from a fired and motored 4 cylinder compression ignition engine at a range of speeds and crankcase locations. A sequence of sampling equipment was used to characterise the emissions in the size range 5 nm - 19 μm; Cambustion DMS 500 fast particulate spectrometer, TSI Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), TSI™ Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) and, TSI™ Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS). The combination of the two test engines and range of sampling equipment provided new information on the generation and behavior of aerodynamic particulate matter within an engine crankcase. Data is presented for the effect of controlled parameter changes on number distributions over the measured particle size range. A complex lognormal bimodal size distribution of sub micron accumulation mode particles was present in the crankcase of both engines at a <b>low</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> of 900 rpm. At 1400 rpm this complex distribution was not present. Increasing the engine load, on the fired engine, initially reduced the particle number concentration with a final significant increase in particle number concentration at 75 % load. At 900 rpm 50 % load there was a single strong peak at 32 nm in the rocker cover however sampling from the push rod gallery and sump showed a strongly bimodal distribution with peaks at 32 nm and 133 nm. All other sampling data, from the fired engine, was consistent at each sampling location. The SMPS results, 15 - 665 nm, on the motored engine showed location dependency, with the highest number concentration of particles present in the push rod gallery...|$|E
