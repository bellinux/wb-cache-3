5|$|Knights and <b>Ladies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thistle {{may also}} be {{admitted}} to the Order of the Garter. Formerly, many, but not all, Knights elevated to the senior Order would resign from the Order of the Thistle. The first to resign from the Order of the Thistle was John, Duke of Argyll in 1710; the last to take such an action was Thomas, Earl of Zetland in 1872. Knights and <b>Ladies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thistle {{may also be}} deprived of their knighthoods. The only individual to have suffered such a fate was John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar who lost both the knighthood and the earldom after participating in the Jacobite rising of 1715.|$|E

5|$|Melbourne's {{support in}} the House of Commons {{weakened}} through {{the early years of}} Victoria's reign, and in the 1841 general election the Whigs were defeated.

5|$|In 1807 Scipione Piattoli {{returned}} to Courland. There he finally settled, abandoned the priesthood, and married {{one of the}} <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court. In his final years in Courland he was involved with Courland's educational system, and hoped to pursue some scientific studies, a lifelong dream for which he never found enough time. He died of a lung infection in Altenburg on April 12, 1809. He was buried in a park in Löbichau.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} the {{tradition}} of the Sociedad to elect the First Lady of Argentina as president of the charity. But the <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sociedad did not approve of Eva Perón's impoverished background, lack of formal education, and former career as an actress. Fraser and Navarro write that the <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sociedad were afraid that Evita would set a bad example for the orphans, therefore the society ladies did not extend to Evita the position of president of their organization. It has often been said that Evita had the government funding for the Sociedad cut off in retaliation. Fraser and Navarro suggest that this version of events is in dispute, but that the government funding that had previously supported the Sociedad now went to support Evita's own foundation. The Fundación María Eva Duarte de Perón was created on 8 July 1948. It was later renamed to, simply, the Eva Perón Foundation. Its funding began with 10,000 pesos provided by Evita herself.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{only about}} $15,000 from the {{building}} fund was still available since money had already been spent on buying the property and materials from the Mellon Mansion. Further fund raising generated 1,200 pledges, 95 percent of which were fulfilled: 60 {{percent of the money}} came from 10 percent of the parishioners and approximately 10 percent of the people did not contribute at all. During this time, all of the books concerning the finances of the construction of the new church were kept by <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> St. Peter's Cenacle. The ladies not only recorded all of the pledges and collections, but they also recorded all notices and minutes from their meetings. While the church was being built, the Campaigners met almost every evening.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Compton officiated at {{the wedding}} of Anne and George of Denmark on 28 July 1683 in the Chapel Royal. Though it was an {{arranged}} marriage, they were faithful and devoted partners.

25|$|In {{the year}} AD39, {{according}} to tradition, the Virgin Mary appeared to Saint James the Great, in Zaragoza, Spain. The vision {{is now called}} Our <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pillar {{and is the only}} reported Marian apparition before her Assumption. <b>The</b> Basilica <b>of</b> Our <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pillar was built in Zaragoza, Spain and a key piece of Roman Catholic Marian art, <b>the</b> statue <b>of</b> Our <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pillar, refers to this apparition.|$|R
50|$|Adjacent to {{the monastery}} is <b>the</b> Our <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sacred Heart Convent, a brick {{building}} in Federation Gothic style, {{which was built}} in 1897. It was the original site for primary and secondary colleges that were established soon after <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convent, but these soon outgrew the premises. It is now the base for OLSH Provincial House and St Joseph's Aged Care Facility, while Our <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sacred Heart College is situated next door. Across the road is Our <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rosary Church (built 1906), Jubilee Hall and <b>the</b> Our <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rosary Primary School, which complete a large religious complex. The convent and church are heritage-listed.|$|R
5|$|Gia Long tolerated the Catholic {{faith of}} his French allies and {{permitted}} unimpeded missionary activities {{out of respect}} to his benefactors. The missionary activity was dominated by the Spanish in Tonkin and French in the central and southern regions. At {{the time of his}} death, there were six European bishops in Vietnam. The population of Christians was estimated at 300,000 in Tonkin and 60,000 in Cochinchina. However, he expressed dismay at the Catholic condemnation of the traditional ancestor worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture. Gia Long was also known for his disdain for Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of the population. Despite its popularity among <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court, Gia Long often restricted the activities of Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|In 1839, Melbourne {{resigned}} after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) {{voted against}} {{a bill to}} suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, {{to form a new}} ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In {{what became known as the}} bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.|$|E

According to Kawai, her {{relationship}} with the Chūnagon parallels Genji's relationship with Hanachirusato (<b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orange Blossoms), as both characters offer the heroes comfort when they are depressed. Kawai considers the emotions and [...] "pathos" [...] to be increased in Torikaebaya as the relationship is between two women.|$|R

5|$|Traditionally, reigning European monarchs are {{admitted}} to the Order as Strangers. Constantine II, King of the Hellenes has not succeeded his father Paul of Greece {{as a member of}} the Order, neither during his short reign nor after being deposed. Similarly, Albert II, King of the Belgians and his son and successor Philippe are the only Belgian monarchs to date not to have been {{admitted to the}} Order. For a time, both Juliana, Queen of the Netherlands and her successor, Queen Beatrix were concurrently members of the Order as Stranger <b>Ladies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garter. Juan Carlos I of Spain and his successor Felipe VI of Spain are concurrently Stranger Knights of the Garter.|$|E
5|$|Władysław's {{mother died}} on 10 February 1598, {{less than three}} years after giving birth to him. He was raised by one of her former <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court, Urszula Meierin, who {{eventually}} became a powerful player at the royal court, with much influence. Władysław's Hofmeister was Michał Konarski, a Polish-Prussian noble. Around early 17th century Urszula lost much of her influence, as Władysław gained new teachers and mentors, such as priests Gabriel Prowancjusz, Andrzej Szołdrski and Marek Łętkowski, and in the military matters, Zygmunt Kazanowski. Much of his curriculum was likely designed by priest Piotr Skarga, much respected by Sigmismund III. Władysław studied for several years in the Kraków Academy, and for two years, in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Each {{member of}} the Order, {{including}} the Sovereign, is allotted a stall in the Chapel, above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. If he is a peer, the coronet appropriate to his rank is placed beneath the helm. Under the laws of heraldry, women, other than monarchs, do not normally bear helms nor crests; instead, the coronet alone is used (if she is a peeress or princess). Lady Marion Fraser had a helm and crest included when she was granted arms; these are displayed above her stall {{in the same manner}} as for knights. Unlike other British Orders, the armorial banners of Knights and <b>Ladies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thistle are not hung in the chapel, but instead in an adjacent part of St Giles High Kirk. The Thistle Chapel does, however, bear the arms of members living and deceased on stall plates. These enamelled plates are affixed to the back of the stall and display its occupant's name, arms, and date of admission into the Order.|$|E

It was at Our <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lake that Vélez learned to speak English and began to dance. She later {{admitted}} that she liked dance class, but was otherwise a poor student. After the Mexican Revolution began, Jacobo joined the fight and Vélez was removed from school and returned to Mexico City. To help support the family, she began working in a department store.|$|R

5|$|The film {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q.

Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Though the roles of the leading players are unknown, it is likely that numerous other character roles and persons appeared in the film. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. The cast includes both leading <b>ladies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company, Anna Rosemond and Violet Heming.
