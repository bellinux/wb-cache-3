Medium staple cotton, also called standard medium-staple cotton is American Upland type with staple length varying from about [...] Long-staple cottons have relatively longer fibre, are expensive and used mostly to make fine fabrics, yarns, and hosiery. The country's economic development is largely dependent on the cotton industry and its related textile sector, and this has given a principal status to cotton in the country.

40|$|Three {{irrigation}} scheduling {{techniques are}} compared on both <b>long</b> and short <b>staple</b> <b>cotton</b> in replicated small plot trials on the Safford Agricultural Center. The Erie method uses historical evapotranspiration data {{developed in the}} Mesa area but mathematically adjusted for the elevation in Safford and incorporated in a computer spreadsheet. The AZSCHED method is a near real -time irrigation scheduling program using AZMET weather date, a modified Penman equation and heat unit based crop coefficients to calculate water deficits. This program will schedule irrigations on up to 60 fields. The third method utilizes infrared thermometry to determine crop water stress indices from foliage temperatures, ambient temperature and relative humidity. This latter method was used to track the crop stress throughout the growing season on all treatments.

40|$|Impact of the ginning method on fiber {{quality and}} textile {{processing}} performance of <b>Long</b> <b>Staple</b> Upland <b>cotton</b> Marinus HJ van der Sluijs 1, 2 With the {{increased demand for}} quality {{and the production of}} finer, longer and stronger Upland cottons, an increasing proportion of these cottons are ginned on roller gins to preserve and improve fiber quality. However, although the benefits of roller ginning on lint turn out and fiber quality are fairly well understood, it is still unclear whether these improvements translate into improved yarn quality and processing performance. The aim of this research was to com-pare the impact of saw and roller ginning on <b>Long</b> <b>Staple</b> Upland <b>cotton</b> in a high-production and commercial environ-ment and to evaluate quality and textile processing performance in a commercial textile mill. One field located within the central cotton growing area of Australia was planted with a <b>Long</b> <b>Staple</b> Upland variety, with a number of round modules selected at random from the field and processed by a saw and a rotary knife roller gin. There was {{a significant difference between the}} two ginning methods in some of the average fiber results, with the roller ginned fiber longer and more uniform with fewer short fibers and fibrous neps, as well as stronger with higher elongation. These improved fiber properties resulted in significant differences in the fine count combed hosiery ring spun yarn produced. On average the yarn spun from roller ginned cotton was significantly more even with fewer total imperfections, although there was no significant difference in yarn count, strength, elongation and hairiness. There were also no significant differences in terms of processing performance, fabric handle, appearance and strength...|$|R

Technological changes in the textile industry mean that priorities concerning fibre properties have also changed and cotton breeders have concentrated on improvement in fibre traits {{to meet the demands}} of industry. Because of adoption of rotor spinning that converts raw fibre into yarns at a speed of 150 mmin- 1 as compared to 20 m min- 1 of ring spinning, the requirements of textile industries of raw cotton have changed. According to these new norms, fibre strength is a greater determinant of yarn quality. India is the only country where all four of the cultivated species of cotton are grown for commerce.
