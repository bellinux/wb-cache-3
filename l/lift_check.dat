However, this valve {{generally}} has a spring that will 'lift' when there is pressure on the upstream side of the valve. The pressure needed on the upstream side of the valve to overcome the spring tension is called the 'cracking pressure'. When the pressure going through the valve goes below the cracking pressure, the spring will close the valve to prevent back-flow in the process.|$|E

40|$|Prior to {{the recent}} work {{performed}} by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) relative to nuclear industry check valve performance, no information was readily available regarding the failure characteristics of check valves based on valve type (e. g., swing check, <b>lift</b> <b>check).</b> Although it had been recognized by component experts that the two most significant factors in determining check valve performance were valve design (i. e., type) and operating conditions, no industry data was available relative to the former. In cooperation with the Nuclear Industry Check Valve Group (NIC), ORNL has reviewed and analyzed check valve failures from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations` (INPOs`) Nuclear Plant Reliability Database System (NPRDS) according to several parameters,including valve type. Since the valve type identification is not inherently included within the NPRDS engineering record for each component, ORNL had to rely upon input from NIC, valve manufacturers, and catalogs to supply the missing information. As {{a result of this}} effort, approximately 77 % of the check valve failures occurring during the 1991 - 1996 study period and nearly 62 % of the overall installed population were identified according to type. This data provided the basis to perform previously unavailable cross-correlations between parameters such as valve type versus failure mode and failure cause. Design characteristics and service applications differ markedly among check valve types, resulting in discernible differences in performance. This paper focuses on the performance characteristics of swing and lift type check valves since failure and population distributions have shown these to be the two most common types employed {{in a wide range of}} nuclear plant applications...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis for bounds checking of array sub-scripts that <b>lifts</b> <b>checking</b> assertions to program level under {{the form of}} an arbitrarily-complex predicate (inspector), whose run-time evaluation guards the execution of the code of interest. Sepa-rating the predicate from the computation makes it more amenable to optimization, and allows it to be split into a cascade of sufficient conditions of increasing complexity that optimizes the common-inspection path. While synthesizing the bounds checking invari-ant resembles type checking techniques, we rely on compiler sim-plification and runtime evaluation rather than employing complex inference and annotation systems that might discourage the non-specialist user. We integrate the analysis in the compiler’s reper-toire of Futhark: a purely-functional core language supporting map-reduce nested parallelism on regular arrays, and show how the high-level language invariants enable a relatively straightforward analy-sis. Finally, we report a qualitative evaluation of our technique on three real-world applications from the financial domain that indi-cates that the runtime overhead of predicates is negligible...|$|R

25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was a wheel rim which broke and damaged the train six kilometres south of the accident site. The wheel rim penetrated the carriage floor and <b>lifted</b> the <b>check</b> rail {{of a set of}} points close to Eschede station. The broken-off check rail then forced the point blades of the following set of points to change direction, and the rear cars of the trainset were diverted to a different track. They hit the pillars of a street overpass, which then collapsed onto the tracks. Only three cars and the front powerhead passed under the bridge, the rest of the 14-car train jackknifed into the collapsed bridge.|$|R

Unlike Doppelmayr <b>lifts</b> that <b>check</b> grip force while a grip and carrier are leaving the terminal, most Poma detachable lifts are not built to operate in reverse because a grip force failed grip can be brought to a halt within the terminal.|$|R

We will argue that this adjunction between coalgebras originates from a canonical adjunction between Set and Rel. In this paper we describe how, in a quite generic setting, an adjunction can be lifted to coalgebras, and we compare some sufficient conditions.

5000|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} of a flying wing {{aircraft}} came to Fauvel in July 1928 during a discussion of the design of high performance gliders; the central aim was to cut down drag to near the limit set by the lift induced drag of the wing by minimising other components. The best possible aircraft should avoid everything but the wing. In 1929 experiments were made with a model of his initial design, known as the AV.1, in the wind tunnel at the aeronautical laboratory at Saint-Cyr to <b>check</b> <b>lift,</b> drag and stability. He built his first full-size aircraft in collaboration with Louis Peyret. It could be flown as a glider or powered with a [...] engine. Peyret had no spare man-power in his factory and a deal was struck with the Société Makhonine. Initially it was intended that the AV.2 should be built by Guerchais at Saint Cloud but after their closure construction was taken over by Caudron and a more powerful engine fitted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} work we presented a model checking procedure for linear programs, i. e. programs in which variables range over a numeric domain and expressions involve linear combinations of the variables. In this paper we <b>lift</b> our model <b>checking</b> procedure for linear programs {{to deal with}} arrays via iterative abstraction refinement. While most approaches are based on predicate abstraction and therefore the abstraction is relative to sets of predicates, in our approach the abstraction is relative to sets of variables and array indexes, and the abstract program can express complex correlations between program variables and array elements. Thus, while arrays are problematic {{for most of the}} approaches based on predicate abstraction, our approach treats them in a precise way. This is an important feature as arrays are ubiquitous in programming. We provide a detailed account of both the abstraction and the refinement processes, discuss their implementation in the eureka tool, and present experimental results that confirm the effectiveness of our approach on a number of programs of interest. ...|$|R
40|$|Model {{checking}} is {{an automated}} technique for deciding whether {{a computer program}} satisfies a temporal property. Abstraction {{is the key to}} scaling model checking to industrial-sized problems, which approximates a large (or infinite) program by a smaller abstract model and <b>lifts</b> the model <b>checking</b> result over the abstract model back to the original program. In this thesis, we study abstraction in model checking based on exact-approximation, which allows for verification and refutation of temporal properties within the same abstraction framework. Our work in this thesis is driven by problems from both practical and theoretical aspects of exact-approximation. We first address challenges of effectively applying symmetry reduction to virtually symmetric programs. Symmetry reduction {{can be seen as a}} strong exact-approximation technique, where a property holds on the original program if and only if it holds on the abstract model. In this thesis, we develop an efficient procedure for identifying virtual symmetry in programs. We also explore techniques for combining virtual symmetry with symbolic model checking. Our second study investigates model checking of recursive programs. Previously, we have developed a software model checker for non-recursive programs based on exact-approximatin...|$|R
