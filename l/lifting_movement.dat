The main cause of this underestimation was a pelvic twist, resulting in an erroneous projection of a pelvic marker on to the sagittal plane due to pelvic twist.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the size-weight illusion {{is related to the}} manner in which objects are lifted. When the SWI occurs, the larger of two objects of equal objective weight is usually lifted with greater acceleration, deceleration, and maximum velocity than the smaller one, but to approximately the same height.

The relationship of <b>lifting</b> <b>movements</b> to judgments is consistent with the known behavior of proprioceptors which provide sensory input about muscular and <b>movement</b> events. <b>Lifting</b> <b>movements,</b> page 3 The size-weight illusion (SWI) is exemplified by the persistent and paradoxical tendency for the smaller of two objects of equal weight to feel heavier than the larger. It is a robust illusion; small objects often feel twice as heavy as large ones of equal weight (Cross & Rotkin, 1975), and it persists in spite of the observer's knowledge of their actual weight. An early but still tenable explanation of the illusion held that the observer expects the larger object to be heavier and therefore lifts it with greate...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} part of lifting {{movement}}s, the trunk movement is surprisingly resistant to perturbations. This study examined which factors contribute to this perturbation resistance of the trunk during lifting. Three possible mechanisms were studied: force-length-velocity characteristics of muscles, the momentum of the trunk as well as the effect of passive extending of the elbows. A forward dynamics modelling and simulation approach was adopted with two different input signals: (1) stimulation of Hill-type muscles versus (2) net joint moments. Experimental data collected during an unperturbed <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> were used as a reference, which a simulated <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> had to resemble. Subsequently, the simulated <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> was perturbed by applying 10 kg extra mass at the wrist (both before and after lift-off and with/without a fixed elbow), without modifying the input signals. The momentum of the trunk appeared to be insufficient to explain the perturbation resistance of trunk movements as found experimentally. In addition to the momentum of the trunk, the force-length-velocity characteristics of the muscles are necessary to account for the observed perturbation resistance. Initial extension of the elbow due to the mass perturbation delayed the propagation of the load to the shoulder. However, this delay is reduced due to the impedance at the elbow provided by the characteristics of muscles spanning the elbow. So, the force-length-velocity characteristics of the muscles spanning the elbow joint increase the perturbation at the trunk. © Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|E
40|$|Anticipation to {{the mass}} {{magnitude}} is important in lifting, but underestimation of a mass, in contrast to overestimation, does not cause major movement disturbances. This {{may be caused by}} corrections in muscle activity before the object is actually lifted. This study was designed to assess the importance of these corrections during the loading phase for the execution of a <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> when the mass is underestimated. Ten subjects lifted a box (1. 6 kg), of which the mass was increased by 10 kg without them knowing so. The mass was added either before the box had been lifted from the ground (perturbation before lift-off, PBL) or right perturbation after lift-off (PAL). In the PBL condition back muscle activity was increased before lift-off. Even though this early corrective response could obviously not occur in the PAL condition, the <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> was executed without clear problems. In sum, corrections in muscle activity before lift-off are not necessary for adequate correction of a perturbation induced by an unexpected heavier object. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E

40|$|When {{humans are}} about to {{manipulate}} an object, our brains use visual cues to recall an internal representation to predict its weight and scale the lifting force accordingly. Such a long-term force profile, formed through repeated experiences with similar objects, has been proposed to improve manipulative performance. Skillful object manipulation is crucial for many animals, particularly those that rely on tools for foraging. However, despite enduring interest in tool use in non-human animals, there has been very little investigation {{of their ability to}} form an expectation about an object’s weight. In this study, we tested whether wild chimpanzees use long-term force profiles to anticipate the weight of a nut-cracking hammer from its size. To this end, we conducted a field experiment presenting chimpanzees with natural wooden hammers and artificially hollowed, lighter hammers of the same size and external appearance. We used calibrated videos from camera traps to extract kinematic parameters of <b>lifting</b> <b>movements.</b> We found that, when lacking previous experience, chimpanzees lifted hollowed hammers with a higher acceleration than natural hammers (overshoot effect). After using a hammer to crack open one nut, chimpanzees tuned down the lifting acceleration for the hollowed hammers, but continued lifting natural hammers with the same acceleration. Our results show that chimpanzees anticipate the weight of an object using long-term force profiles and suggest that, similarly to humans, they use internal representations of weight to plan their <b>lifting</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} or {{trajectory of the}} body center of mass (COM) is often a parameter of interest when studying posture or movement. For instance, in balance control studies the body COM {{can be related to}} the ground reaction force or to the base of support. Since small displacements of the body COM are important in balance control studies, it is essential to obtain valid estimates of the body COM. The main source of error in the determination of the body COM is the estimation of the masses and centers of mass of the body segments. Especially the determination of the trunk COM is prone to error. In the current study five subjects maintained three postures, differing in trunk angle, during a few seconds. The relation between the center of pressure of the ground reaction force and the vertical projection of the body COM during the postures was used to optimize the trunk COM position. Additionally the subjects performed two <b>lifting</b> <b>movements.</b> The validity of the body COM trajectory estimation during the <b>lifting</b> <b>movements,</b> both with and without optimized trunk COM, was checked by relating the external moment of the ground reaction force with respect to the body COM to the rate of change of the angular momentum of the whole body. It was shown that the correspondence between the external moment and the rate of change of the angular momentum improved after optimization of the trunk COM. This suggests that the body COM trajectory estimation can be improved by the proposed optimization procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{movement}} self-selected by 39 subjects to lift light loads from 9 cm {{above the ground}} is described in kinematic and electromyographic terms. Hamstring length changes were estimated from hip and knee angular kinematics. Subjects adopted a posture {{at the start of}} the lift intermediate between stoop and full-squat postures. A consistent coordination between knee, hip, and lumbar vertebral joints during lifting was described through calculation of the relative phase between adjacent joints and found to be exaggerated with increases in load mass. During the early phase of lifting, knee extension leads hip extension, which in turn leads extension of the lumbar vertebral joints. Early in the <b>lifting</b> <b>movement,</b> when load acceleration is greatest, the erectores spinae are thus relatively long and shortening slowly. Both of these factors produce greater back extensor strength. Rapid hamstring shortening is also delayed, which enhances their strength, and coactivation of the monoarticular knee extensors and biarticular hamstrings observed early in the <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> suggested that the knee extensors contribute to hip extension through a tendinous action of the hamstrings...|$|E
40|$|The {{estimation}} of segment inertial parameters (SIPs) {{is an important}} source of error in inverse dynamic analysis. In most individual cases SIPs are derived from extrapolation of known SIPs of a certain population through regression equations (proportional models). Another well-known method is the use of mathematical approximation of the shape of human body segments combined with estimations of segment densities (geometric models). In the current study five males and five females performed four different lifting movements in the sagittal plane. A full body linked segment model was applied twice to the same data set, once using a proportional and once using a geometric anthropometric model. As a full body linked segment model is an overdetermined system of equations, four equations could be formed to test the summed effect of SIP errors on the inverse dynamic analysis. The overall performance in terms of coefficients of correlation was better for the geometric model as compared to the proportional model. When a back <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> was performed, the equations indicated systematic errors in the proportional model. However, when a leg <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> was performed, the equations indicated systematic errors in the geometric model. Therefore, analyzing only one kind of movement does not suffice to draw conclusions with respect to the reliability of an anthropometric model...|$|E
40|$|Asymmetric lifting is {{associated}} with an increased risk of low back disorders. Especially in lifting movements, characterized by a small amount of asymmetry, it is still the question if asymmetric lumbosacral torques occur, or if subjects try to avoid asymmetric back loading by twisting their pelvis with respect to the feet. An increase of the lifting speed or the box weight might amplify the lumbar torques but might also result in an attempt to limit further increase of asymmetric torques by increasing pelvic twist. In the current study, asymmetrical lifting movements were analyzed {{with the aid of a}} 3 D linked segment model, using cuffs mounted to the body segments. Eight subjects performed lifting movements with five different asymmetry conditions, ranging from 0 to 90 °lifting asymmetry with respect to the sagittal plane, using two lifting speeds and two box weights. A significant increase in lateral flexing and twisting low back torque was found for each increase in asymmetry of the <b>lifting</b> <b>movement.</b> Pelvic twist accounted more or less constantly for about 25 % of the lifting asymmetry and was hardly influenced by lifting speed or box weight. Even for 10 or 30 °of lifting asymmetry, subjects did not twist their pelvis far enough to avoid asymmetric loading of the low back. Assuming that asymmetric loading of the low back is more strenuous to the spine than symmetric loading, the current results indicate that even small deviations of a <b>lifting</b> <b>movement</b> from the sagittal plane can explain an increased risk of low back disorders...|$|E

40|$|Individuals usually {{report for}} two objects of equal mass but {{different}} volume {{that the larger}} object feels lighter. This so-called size-weight illusion has been investigated {{for more than a}} century. The illusion is accompanied by increased forces, used to lift the larger object, resulting in a higher initial lifting speed and acceleration. The illusion holds when subjects know that the mass of the two objects is equal and it is likely that this also counts for the enlarged initial effort in lifting a larger box. Why should this happen? Under microgravity, subjects might be able to eliminate largely the weight-related component of the lifting force. Then, if persistent upward scaling of the weight-related force component had been the main cause of the elevated initial lifting force under normal gravity, this elevated force might disappear under microgravity. On the other hand, the elevated initial lifting effort in the large box would be preserved if it had been caused mainly by a persistent upward scaling of the force component, necessary to accelerate the object. To test whether the elevated initial lifting effort either persists or disappears under microgravity, a lifting experiment was carried out during brief periods of microgravity in parabolic flights. Subjects performed whole-body lift ing movements with their feet strapped {{to the floor of the}} aircraft, using two 8 -kg boxes of different volume. The subjects were aware of the equality of the box masses. The peak lifting forces declined almost instantaneously with approx. a factor 9 in the first lifting movements under microgravity compared with normal gravity, suggesting a rapid adaptation to the loss of weight.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of a}} piston engine driven by compressed air. The compressed air engine was a modified 100 cm 3 internal combustion engine obtained from a motorcycle manufacturer. The experiments in this study used a test bench to examine the power performance and pressure/temperature variations of the compressed air engine at pressures ranging from 5 to 9 bar (absolute pressure). The engine was modified from a 4 -stroke to a 2 -stroke engine using a cam system driven by a crankshaft and the intake and exhaust valves have a small lift due to this modification. The highest power output of 0. 95 kW was obtained at 9 bar and 1320 rpm. The highest torque of 9. 99 N·m occurred at the same pressure, but at 465 rpm. The pressure-volume (P-V) diagram shows that cylinder pressure gradually increases after the intake valve opens because of the limited <b>lift</b> <b>movement</b> of the intake valve. Similar situations occurred during the exhaust process, restricting the power output of the compressed air engine. The pressure and temperature variation of the air at engine inlet and outlet were recorded during the experiment. The outlet pressure increased from 1. 5 bar at 500 rpm to 2. 25 bar at 2000 rpm, showing the potential of recycling the compressed air energy by attaching additional cylinders (split-cycle engine). A temperature decrease (from room temperature to 17 °C) inside the cylinder was observed. It {{should be noted that}} pressures higher than that currently employed can result in lower temperatures and this can cause poor lubrication and sealing issues.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Synkinesis is an {{involuntary}} movement accompanying a voluntary one. These unintentional movements {{are caused by}} an undifferentiated regeneration {{of the facial nerve}} that occurs after being compressed or partially damaged. Synkinesis can affect eating, drinking, and speaking and can be socially distressing because of facial asymmetry and disruption of intended emotional expressions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the frequency and location of synkinesis in patients with peripheral facial nerve paresis. METHODS: Patients were observed on video and analyzed using a standardized Synkinesis Scoring Form. Five voluntary expressions, derived from the Sunnybrook Facial Grading Scale, were tested: brow lift, eye closure, smile, snarl, and lip pucker. The Kruskal-Wallis test, 95 % confidence intervals, and analysis of variance were used to analyze data. RESULTS: Patients with a facial nerve paresis (n = 103) were observed, and all showed synkineses. Lifting-mouth-corner-synkinesis coupled to voluntary brow <b>lift</b> <b>movements</b> (89 %) or eye closure (85 %) occurred most frequently. The voluntary movement lip puckering evoked the most synkineses of the eye (narrowing, 82 %). During all voluntary expressions lifting-brow-synkineses occurred the least (17 %).
