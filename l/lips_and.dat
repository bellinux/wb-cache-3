40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure and compare the {{dimensions}} of the dental arches on three-dimensional digital study models in children with <b>and</b> without cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate before the primary surgery. The sample consisted of 223 digital models of children aged 3 - 9 months, divided into 5 groups: without craniofacial deformities, unilateral and bilateral incomplete cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> alveolus, unilateral and bilateral complete cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> alveolus, unilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate, <b>and</b> bilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. Dental casts of the maxillary dental arches of the children were used. The dental casts underwent a process of scanning through 3 D scanner and the measurements used for the correlation among groups were made on the scanned images. Statistical analysis was performed by t test and ANOVA followed by Tukey test. The results showed that the intercanine distance and anterior cleft width was wider in children with unilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. The intertuberosity distances and posterior cleft width was wider in children with bilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate among the groups. Children with cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate before the primary surgery had wider maxillary arch dimensions than the children without cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} dental {{development}} {{and rate of}} tooth development between children with <b>and</b> without cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. Patients: Age- and gender-matched pairs (231 in all) of southern Chinese children ages 3 to 12 years, with <b>and</b> without cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. Methods: Dental histories and radiographs were studied. From these, dental development was determined. Results: Of 2946 tooth pairs in the children with cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate, 252 (8. 6 %) {{were found to be}} asymmetric, significantly (p <. 001) more than the 63 of 3179 (2. 0 %) tooth pairs observed in the children without cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. The teeth with the highest frequency of asymmetry were the maxillary lateral incisors (38. 1 %). Differences in dental development on the cleft versus noncleft sides of children with unilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate were significant for both maxillary and mandibular teeth (p <. 001 and p =. 039, respectively). The mean delay in tooth formation of the children with cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate was 4. 4 months relative to the children without cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. The majority of the teeth in the cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate group were delayed by one developmental stage. This happened in 40. 0 % of the maxillary teeth and 30. 1 % of the mandibular teeth. The delay in tooth formation increased as the number of missing teeth increased in the children with cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate, although not significantly. Conclusions: This group of southern Chinese children with cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate demonstrated a higher prevalence of asymmetric and delayed dental development than did their counterparts who did not have cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Facial {{appearance}} and speech outcome may affect psychosocial functioning in girls and boys. Several studies reported dissatisfaction with facial {{appearance and}} more specifically the <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> mouth profile in children with cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate (CLP). The purpose of this controlled study was to measure the tongue <b>and</b> <b>lip</b> strength <b>and</b> endurance in boys and girls with CLP. METHODS: Twenty-five subjects (mean age: 10. 6 years) with a unilateral CLP and a gender- and age- matched control group were selected. All subjects with an unilateral CLP consulted the same craniofacial team and had undergone an identical surgical procedure. Surgical procedure of the lip was performed using a modified Millard technique without primary nose correction at {{an average age of}} 5. 5 months. The Iowa Oral Performance instrument was used to measure <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> tongue strength and tongue endurance. RESULTS: The results of the Iowa Oral Performance measurement showed {{no significant differences between the}} subjects with an unilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate and the age and gender matched control group without a cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. CONCLUSION: There is no significant differences regarding oral strength more specifically the <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> tongue strength and endurance between subjects with and without an unilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. ENT specialists and speech pathologists must be aware of this aspect of the normal <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> tongue functions...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this {{present study was to}} compare, by means of 3 D digital casts, the {{anterior}} transverse dimension of the dental arch of newborns with <b>and</b> without cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample was composed of ninety-four children aged from 3 to 9 months divided into three study groups: Group I - children without craniofacial deformities (control group); Group II - children with unilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate; Group III - children with bilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. Impressions were executed before <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate repair in patients with clefts. Dental casts were digitized using a 3 D scanner linked to a computer. Measurements of the intercanine distance were measured on the digital casts. Intergroup comparisons were performed using ANOVA (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: The results showed a mean of 36. 5 mm for unilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate group, 34. 8 mm for bilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate group and 27. 52 mm for the control group. There was a statistically significant difference between the control group and both groups of patients with cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. There was no statistically significant difference between complete unilateral <b>and</b> bilateral cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with complete cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate were born with an increased anterior dimension of the maxillary dental arch compared to non cleft patients...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{epidemiologic}} study of cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate in the Republic of Korea from January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993.

40|$|Objective. To review {{recent data}} on the {{aetiology}} of cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. Data sources. MEDLINE literature search (1986 - 2003). Study selection. Literature and data on aetiology of cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate using the following key words: 'cleft lip', 'cleft palate', 'aetiology', and 'genetics'. Data extraction. Relevant information and data were reviewed by the authors. Data synthesis. Cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate {{is one of the}} most common types of congenital malformation. The aetiology seems complex, but genetics plays a major role. Recently several genes causing syndromic cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate have been discovered. Three of them-namely T-box transcription factor- 22 (TBX 22), poliovirus receptor like- 1 (PVRL 1), and interferon regulatory factor- 6 (IRF 6) -are responsible for causing X-linked cleft palate, cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia syndrome, and Van der Woude's and popliteal pterygium syndromes, respectively; they are also implied in non-syndromic cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. The nature and function of these genes vary widely, illustrating high vulnerability within the craniofacial developmental pathways. The aetiological complexity of non-syndromic cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate is also exemplified by the large number of candidate genes and loci. Conclusions. The aetiology of non-syndromic cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate is still largely unknown, but mutations in candidate genes have already been identified in a small proportion of cases of non-syndromic cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate. Determining the relative risk of cleft <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> palate, on the basis of genetic background and environmental influence, including smoking, alcohol use, and dietary factors, will aid in genetic counselling and the development of future preventive measures. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design.

5|$|Lesbianism, or the {{suggestion}} of it, began early in filmmaking. The same constructs of how lesbians were portrayed—or for what reasons—as what had appeared in literature were placed on women in the films.

Actresses appeared as men in male roles because of plot devices as early as 1914 in A Florida Enchantment featuring Edith Storey. In Morocco (1930) Marlene Dietrich kisses another woman on the <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> Katharine Hepburn plays a man in Christopher Strong in 1933 and again in Sylvia Scarlett (1936).

5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease.

Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E
