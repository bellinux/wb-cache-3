40|$|The {{impedance}} of <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>units</b> can {{be described}} by lumped-element models, which increase the efficiency and accuracy of cross-over design if applicable over the entire frequency range. We have extended current models to obtain excellent description in the entire useful range. Also, algorithms have been designed which automatically find the best parameters for the lumped-element model and a compensation network, which are easily implemented on a PC. Summary. Most lumped-element models, used for {{the description of the}} impedance of electro-dynamic <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>units</b> deviate from the true behaviour {{in a part of the}} useful frequency range. However, the design of cross-over networks can be done more efficiently and accurately using computer models, in which the <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>units</b> are replaced by their lumped-element equivalents. The accuracy of the design thus depends on the accuracy of the description of the impedance by the lumped-element model. We have therefore improved such models to describe the entire useful frequency range in order to eliminate the problem of deviation. Our final model comprises eight elements, and therefore requires automatic determination by an efficient algorithm. The major problem with such algorithms is that as the number of dimensions increases, th...|$|R

50|$|The Jabez Gough Enclosure (also {{known as}} the Jabez Gough Loudspeaker, or Gough Loudspeaker) was invented in 1960 by Jabez Gough, a radio engineer, living in Cardiff, South Wales.

50|$|A <b>loudspeaker</b> drive <b>unit</b> (typically a woofer or {{subwoofer}} drive unit) may be approximated as {{a series}} connection of a zero-impedance voltage source, a resistor, a capacitor and an inductor.

50|$|Electronic sirens {{consist of}} an {{electronic}} tone generator, a high-power amplifier, and a horn loudspeaker. Typically the <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>unit</b> incorporates horn loading, which {{causes them to}} be similar in appearance to some electromechanical sirens. Many of these loudspeakers incorporate a vertical array of horns to achieve pattern control in the vertical plane. Each cell of the loudspeaker horn is driven {{by one or more}} compression drivers. One type of compression driver for this type of loudspeaker handles 400 watts of electrical power and uses two donut-shaped permanent magnet slugs to provide magnetic flux. For siren applications, high-fidelity sound is a secondary concern to high output, and siren drivers typically produce large amounts of distortion which would not be tolerable in an audio system where fidelity is important.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{efficient}} parameterization of the Room Transfer Function (RTF). Typically, the RTF rapidly varies with varying source and receiver positions, hence requires an impractical number of {{point to point}} measurements to characterize a given room. Therefore, we derive a novel RTF parameterization that is robust to both receiver and source variations with the following salient features: (i) The parameterization is given {{in terms of a}} modal expansion of 3 D basis functions. (ii) The aforementioned modal expansion can be truncated at a finite number of modes given that the source and receiver locations are from two sizeable spatial regions, which are arbitrarily distributed. (iii) The parameter weights/coefficients are independent of the source/receiver positions. Therefore, a finite set of coefficients is shown to be capable of accurately calculating the RTF between any two arbitrary points from a predefined spatial region where the source(s) lie and a pre-defined spatial region where the receiver(s) lie. A practical method to measure the RTF coefficients is also provided, which only requires a single microphone unit and a single <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>unit,</b> given that the room characteristics remain stationary over time. The accuracy of the above parameterization is verified using appropriate simulation examples. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|CSIRO Building, Construction and Engineering has {{conducted}} {{research on the}} active attenuation of windows {{for the last three}} years.

The polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) pieze-electric film is clear and CSIRO Telecommunications and Industrial Physics successfully deposited experimental clear electrodes on a small sample of PVDF film. Unfortunately the sound levels that could be cancelled were not high enough to justify the commercial cost. Experimentation was then switched to double-glazed windows whose cavity was driven by a horn <b>loudspeaker</b> driver <b>unit.</b> The sound levels that could be cancelled were sufficiently high. Successful feed forward control of a periodic signal was achieved using software from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Adelaide. Unfortunately, no feed forward control achieved with random noise or traffic noise. Analogue feedback control was then used with random noise and gave some attenuation at some frequencies. It was not possible to obtain broadband attenuation...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} vibration of <b>loudspeaker</b> drive <b>units</b> {{is described by}} a set of linear transfer functions and geometrical data which are measured at selected points {{on the surface of the}} radiator (cone, dome, diaphragm, piston, panel) by using a scanning technique. These distributed parameters supplement the lumped parameters (T/S, nonlinear, thermal), simplify the communication between cone, driver and loudspeaker system design and open new ways for loudspeaker diagnostics. The distributed vibration can be summarized to a new quantity called accumulated acceleration level (AAL) which is comparable with the sound pressure level (SPL) if no acoustical cancellation occurs. This and other derived parameters are the basis for modal analysis and novel decomposition techniques which make the relationship between {{mechanical vibration}} and sound pressure output more transparent. Practical problems and indications for practical improvements are discussed for various example drivers. Finally, the usage of the distributed parameters within finite and boundary element analyses is addressed and conclusions for the loudspeaker design process are made. 1...|$|R

40|$|This Part {{describes}} a mine pager phone to public telephone interconnect sys tem that permits mine paging telephones to be selectively interconnected {{with the public}} telephone system, as illustrated by Figure 1. This interconnect concept was first conceived and demonstrated in breadboard form by H. E. Parkinson of Industrial Hazards and Communications, PMSRC, as one means for providing improved emergency and off-hours communications. The third-generation prototype unit described in this Part was designed and fabricated by Arthur D. Little, Inc. This unit is a small desk-top or wall-mounted unit that connects directly to both the public telephone line and the mine pager phone line, and requires no modifications to either the public dial telephone or mine pager phones. As part of this task, ADL also built, under a very compressed time schedule, a second-generation prototype unit suitable for reliable demonstration of the interconnect concept during the Bureau's technology transfer seminar on mine communications in March 1973. * A major objective of {{the design of the}} third-generation unit described in this Part was that it be compatible with present mine pager phone systems utilizing DC voltage on the mine phone line to activate the phone <b>loudspeakers.</b> Therefore, this <b>unit</b> was designed to operate in a push- to-talk, push-to-listen mode that accommodates the inherent design differences and operation modes of the mine phones of different manufacturers. Though this push- to- talk, push- to-listen mode of operation may seem slightly unusual at first sight, we have found it is easily learned by new users. However, mine phone manufacturers wishing to expand their product lines with such an interconnect system will probably find it to their advantage to customize the design of this system to their particular mine phones, thereby utilizing the unique attributes offered by their individual product lines. This customization should not be difficult, and Section III below suggests some of the features that can be easily added to future designs. Detailed parts lists and circuit schematics for the present third-generation proto- type system can be obtained from the system manual submitted to PMSRC and placed on public file...|$|R
