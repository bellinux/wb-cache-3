5|$|As {{fighting}} raged in the Wheatfield and Devil's Den, Col. Strong Vincent of V Corps had {{a precarious}} hold on <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top, an important hill {{at the extreme}} left of the Union line. His brigade of four relatively small regiments was able to resist repeated assaults by Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's brigade of Hood's division. Meade's chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, had realized {{the importance of this}} position, and dispatched Vincent's brigade, an artillery battery, and the 140th New York to occupy <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top mere minutes before Hood's troops arrived. The defense of <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top with a bayonet charge by the 20th Maine, ordered by Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain but possibly led by Lt. Holman S. Melcher, {{was one of the most}} fabled episodes in the Civil War and propelled Col. Chamberlain into prominence after the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} on Ward's brigade was eventually too great, {{and he was}} forced to call for a retreat. Hood's division secured Devil's Den and the southern part of Houck's Ridge. The center of the fighting shifted to the northwest, to Rose Woods and the Wheatfield, while five regiments under Evander Law assaulted <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top to the east. Benning's men spent the next 22 hours on Devil's Den, firing across the Valley of Death on Union troops massed on <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out in a {{defensive}} formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, and the Peach Orchard. On the Union right, Confederate demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill. All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Gettysburg was {{depicted}} in the 1993 film Gettysburg, based on Michael Shaara's 1974 novel The Killer Angels. The film and novel focused primarily on the actions of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, John Buford, Robert E. Lee, and James Longstreet during the battle. The first day focused on Buford's cavalry defense, the second day on Chamberlain's defense at <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top, and the third day on Pickett's Charge.|$|E
5|$|The First Fork is {{the second}} largest {{tributary}} and has its source in Cummings Township. It flows south-southeast passing to the southwest of <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top and Puterbaugh Mountain, then leaves the dissected Allegheny Plateau at Fishery Point. It then enters Mifflin Township, where it joins Larrys Creek just south of Salladasburg, 4.2 miles (6.8km) from the mouth. Historically, much of the First Fork was protected {{as part of the}} Ogontz Lodge, a private hunting and fishing club.|$|E
5|$|Two of Benning's Confederate regiments, the 2nd and 17th Georgia, {{moved down}} Plum Run Valley around Ward's flank. They {{received}} murderous {{fire from the}} 99th Pennsylvania and Hazlett's battery on <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top, but they kept pushing forward. Capt. Smith's New York battery was under severe pressure from three sides, but its supporting infantry regiments were suffering severe casualties and could not protect it. Three 10-pound Parrott rifles were lost to the 1st Texas, and they were used against Union troops the next day.|$|E

5|$|The Second Fork flows {{south along}} {{the eastern side of}} Henson Ridge, then east of Puterbaugh Mountain. The only named peak on the east bank of the Second Fork is Clapp Point, which marks the {{boundary}} of the dissected plateau and is southwest of Harris Point. The First Fork flows past the southwest edge of <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top and then continues on the southwest side of Puterbaugh Mountain. Fishery Point is {{at the southern end of}} the Allegheny Plateau, just west of the First Fork. The three features named Point are each part of the Allegheny Front, the edge of the Allegheny Plateau.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet's {{attack was}} delayed, however, because he {{first had to}} wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, and then he was forced to march on a long, {{circuitous}} route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in front of them on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order.|$|E
5|$|This final Confederate assault {{through the}} Wheatfield {{continued}} past Houck's Ridge into the Valley of Death at about 7:30 p.m. The brigades of Anderson, Semmes, and Kershaw were exhausted from hours of combat {{in the summer}} heat and advanced east with units jumbled up together. Wofford's brigade followed to the left along the Wheatfield Road. As they reached the northern shoulder of <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top, they were met with a counterattack from the 3rd Division (the Pennsylvania Reserves) of the V Corps, under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford. The brigade of Col. William McCandless, including a company from the Gettysburg area, spearheaded the attack and drove the exhausted Confederates back beyond the Wheatfield to Stony Hill. Realizing that his troops were too far advanced and exposed, Crawford pulled the brigade back to the east edge of the Wheatfield.|$|E

5|$|When Sickles {{arrived with}} his III Corps, General Meade {{instructed}} {{him to take}} up a position on Cemetery Ridge that linked up with the II Corps on his right and anchored his left on <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top. Sickles originally did so, but after noon he became concerned about a slightly higher piece of ground 0.7 miles (1,100 m) to his front, a peach orchard owned by the Sherfy family. He undoubtedly recalled the debacle at Chancellorsville, where the high ground ("Hazel Grove") he was forced to give up was used against him as a deadly Confederate artillery platform. Acting without authorization from Meade, Sickles marched his corps to occupy the peach orchard. This had two significant negative consequences: his position now took the form of a salient, which could be attacked from multiple sides; and he was forced to occupy lines that were much longer than his two-division corps could defend. Meade was furious about this insubordination, {{but it was too late}} to do anything about itthe Confederate attack was imminent.|$|E

25|$|Of the 2,996 Union troops engaged at <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top, {{there were}} 565 {{casualties}} (134 killed, 402 wounded, 29 missing); Confederate losses of 4,864 engaged were 1,185 (279 killed, 868 wounded, 219 missing).|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top was undefended by Union troops. Maj. Gen. George Meade, {{commander}} of the Army of the Potomac, had ordered Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles's III Corps to defend {{the southern end of}} Cemetery Ridge, which would have just included <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top. But Sickles, defying Meade's orders, moved his corps a few hundred yards west to the Emmitsburg Road and the Peach Orchard, causing a large salient in the line, which was also too long to defend properly. His left flank was anchored in Devil's Den. When Meade discovered this situation, he dispatched his chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, to attempt to deal with the situation south of Sickles's position. Climbing <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top, Warren found only a small Signal Corps station there. He saw the glint of bayonets in the sun to the southwest and realized that a Confederate assault into the Union flank was imminent. He hurriedly sent staff officers, including Washington Roebling, to find help from any available units in the vicinity.|$|E

25|$|<b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top was the {{starting}} point for a Union counterattack at dusk on July 2, conducted by the 3rd Division of the V Corps (the Pennsylvania Reserves) under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford, launched to the west {{in the direction of the}} Wheatfield.|$|E
25|$|The {{response}} to this request for help came from Maj. Gen. George Sykes, commander of the Union V Corps. Sykes quickly dispatched a messenger to order his 1st Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. James Barnes, to <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top. Before the messenger could reach Barnes, he encountered Col. Strong Vincent, commander of the third brigade, who seized the initiative and directed his four regiments to <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top without waiting for permission from Barnes. He and Oliver W. Norton, the brigade bugler, galloped ahead to reconnoiter and guide his four regiments into position. Upon arrival on <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top, Vincent and Norton received fire from Confederate batteries almost immediately. On the western slope he placed the 16th Michigan, and then proceeding counterclockwise were the 44th New York, the 83rd Pennsylvania, and finally, {{at the end of}} the line on the southern slope, the 20th Maine. Arriving only ten minutes before the Confederates, Vincent ordered his brigade to take cover and wait, and he ordered Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, commander of the 20th Maine, to hold his position, the extreme left of the Army of the Potomac, at all costs. Chamberlain and his 385 men waited for what was to come.|$|E
25|$|Garry Adelman has countered the {{argument}} that a Confederate capture of <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top would have badly hurt the Union effort. Examining {{the number of troops}} available in the vicinity in the late afternoon, he determined that at most 2,650 Confederates could have been available to defend the hill after capturing it, and that these men would have been exhausted from combat and short on ammunition. In contrast, 11,600 fresh Union reinforcements were available within a mile, primarily from Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick's VI Corps. In addition, the value of <b>Little</b> <b>Round</b> Top as an artillery position has been overstatedthe shape of {{the crest of the hill}} forces guns to be placed one behind the other, limiting their effectiveness when engaging targets directly to the north, such as the Union line on Cemetery Ridge.|$|E

50|$|A chine in boating {{refers to}} a sharp change in angle in the cross section of a hull. A hull without chines has a {{gradually}} curving cross section. The term hard chine indicates an angle with <b>little</b> <b>rounding,</b> where a soft chine would be more rounded, but still involve the meeting of distinct planes. Chine log construction is a method of building hard chine boat hulls. Hard chines are common in plywood hulls, while soft chines are often found on fiberglass hulls.|$|R
