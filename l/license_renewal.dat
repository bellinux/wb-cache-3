A number of complaints about the station began to be accumulated. In October 1930 a new set of hearings began with respect to the <b>license</b> <b>renewal</b> of the socialist radio station. A range of violations of the 1927 Radio Act were cited, including repeated failure to announce station call letters on the air every 15 minutes and inability to stay on its assigned wavelength. A recommendation was made by the FRC examiner assigned to the case to deny the station's <b>license</b> <b>renewal</b> application.|$|E

25|$|For {{a number}} of years in the 2000s, it became rare that the station would {{announce}} its call letters. To most, it was simply 102.1 The Edge. Perhaps due to CRTC regulations requiring radio stations to announce their call letters, the station began in August 2005 to identify itself as both CFNY and the Edge during identification breaks. In 2006, however, the station fell afoul of the CRTC. The regulating body opted to give CFNY only a four-year <b>license</b> <b>renewal,</b> rather than the customary seven. The regulator's concerns reportedly involved the station failing once to meet its mandated Canadian content targets.|$|E
25|$|Units 2 and 3 {{were both}} {{originally}} {{licensed by the}} NRC for 40 years of operation. The NRC limits commercial power reactor licenses to an initial 40 years, but also permits such licenses to be renewed. This original 40-year term for reactor licenses was based on economic and antitrust considerations, not on limitations of nuclear technology. Due to this selected period, however, some structures and components may have been engineered {{on the basis of}} an expected 40-year service life. The original federal license for Unit Two expired on September 28, 2013, and the license for Unit Three was due to expire in December 2015. On April 30, 2007, Entergy submitted an application for a 20-year renewal of the licenses for both units. On May 2, 2007, the NRC announced that this application is available for public review. Because the owner submitted <b>license</b> <b>renewal</b> applications at least five years prior to the original expiration date, the units are allowed to continue operation past this date while the NRC considers the renewal application.|$|E

In turn, this satisfied the requirements and he had his license renewed.|$|E

500|$|In April 1947, the FCC {{denied the}} <b>license</b> <b>renewal,</b> [...] saying that Lafount {{and the other}} owners had shown [...] "gross {{carelessness}} and willful disregard [...] " [...] in giving false information about the ownership structure and financial status of the station. The agency sought other applicants for the 950 AM band frequency, while Lafount appealed their decision in federal court. In December 1948, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the FCC on a 2–to-1 decision, saying that the FCC had acted [...] "arbitrarily, capriciously, and unreasonably" [...] in refusing the renewal. [...] The U.S. Justice Department appealed, however, and in May 1949, the United States Supreme Court handed down a brief, unsigned, unanimous decision that overturned the appeals court and stated that the FCC acted within its power when it refused the <b>license</b> <b>renewal</b> for Lafount and the other owners. [...] The station, which had stayed on the air via temporary licenses, went off the air on May 30, 1949. [...] (The station returned in October 1950, under new ownership.) ...|$|E

Although {{he does not have}} the money, Tom reveals part-ownership in a nightclub is a longtime dream of his, so he seeks assistance from his fast-talking friend, Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz), who contributes $5,000. Tom has $4,000 of his own but still needs $1,000, so he seeks further help from his co-workers. Donna (Retta) expresses an interest, but decides against it when she meets Jean-Ralphio, of whom she immediately declares, [...] "I hate that guy." [...] Meanwhile, when Andy's (Chris Pratt) band-mate Burly (Andrew Burlinson) tells Andy he can no longer live with him, April (Aubrey Plaza) helps Andy look for an apartment. They find one near her house, prompting a smitten April to note that they can carpool to work together. But when Andy learns Tom needs $1,000, he forgoes the apartment to give Tom the money as a gift. April is surprised by the choice and disappointed with the result. In the episode's final scene, Tom is shown enjoying his nightclub part ownership, until he learns Donna has bought three shares herself.|$|E
