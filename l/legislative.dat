5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the <b>legislative</b> classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the <b>legislative</b> objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the <b>legislative</b> objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route36, an {{unsigned}} <b>legislative</b> {{route that}} extended from Owego to Seneca Falls via Candor, Ithaca, and Ovid.
