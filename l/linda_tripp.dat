25|$|Lewinsky was a {{graduate}} of Lewis & Clark College. She was hired during Clinton's first term in 1995 as an intern at the White House and was later an employee of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. Some believe that Clinton began a personal relationship with her while she worked at the White House, the details of which she later confided to <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp,</b> her Defense Department co-worker who secretly recorded their telephone conversations.|$|E
25|$|The law conferred broad investigative powers on Starr and {{the other}} {{independent}} counsels named to investigate the administration, {{including the right to}} subpoena nearly anyone who might have information relevant to the particular investigation. Starr would later receive authority to conduct additional investigations, including the firing of White House Travel Office personnel, potential political abuse of confidential FBIfiles, Madison Guaranty, Rose Law Firm, Paula Jones law suit and, most notoriously, possible perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up President Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The Lewinsky portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp,</b> requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they might have seen while guarding Clinton. With the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political hit man than as a prosecutor.|$|E
500|$|An FBI {{document}} {{suggested that}} Livingstone {{had been given}} his position because First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton {{was a friend of}} Livingstone's mother and recommended him. [...] Hillary Clinton stated that while she was once photographed with the mother in a large group, she did not know her. Hillary Clinton was briefly deposed at the White House by the Independent Counsel regarding this matter on January 14, 1998. [...] (That same day, the same Office of the Independent Counsel staff were listening to taped conversations of <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp</b> and Monica Lewinsky; the Lewinsky scandal was soon to break.) [...] In 1999, Clinton gave a sworn statement that she {{had nothing to do with}} Livingstone's hiring. Livingstone also stated under oath there was no truth to the supposed hiring relationship. Hillary Clinton would later refer to the whole files matter as a [...] "pseudoscandal".|$|E
50|$|<b>Linda</b> Rose <b>Tripp</b> (n√©e Carotenuto; born November 24, 1949) is {{a former}} U.S. civil servant who figured in the Monica Lewinsky scandal of 1995-1996.|$|R
50|$|According to <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp's</b> {{grand jury}} testimony, she felt Willey pursued a romance with Clinton {{from the start}} of her White House affiliation. Willey had speculated with Tripp as to how {{she might be able to}} set up an {{assignation}} between herself and the president. She routinely attended events at which Clinton would be present, wearing a black dress she believed he liked. According to Tripp's testimony, Willey wondered if she and Clinton could arrange to meet in a home to which she had access, on the Chesapeake Bay.|$|R
5000|$|During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Weiner was subpoenaed {{to testify}} before the Whitewater-Lewinsky grand jury by {{independent}} council Kenneth Starr. [...] Starr cited Weiner's work as a White House spokesman at the time to justify his subpoena; however it was later revealed that Starr was motivated by Weiner's comments to a friend concerning the legality of <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp's</b> secret recording of private phone calls with Monica Lewinsky, a felony in the state of Maryland. Upon exiting the courthouse, Weiner is quoted as saying [...] "this is an incredible overreach by the prosecutor to have subpoenaed us. It is Big Brother at its worst and it really scares you." ...|$|R
2500|$|On April 1, 1998, U.S. District Court Judge Susan Webber Wright granted summary {{judgment}} to Clinton in Jones v. Clinton. [...] A witness in Jones v. Clinton, Monica Lewinsky, denied having {{engaged in a}} sexual relationship with Clinton. [...] A Lewinsky friend, <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp,</b> had recorded conversations where Lewinsky discussed her affair with Clinton. [...] Tripp then turned the tapes over to Kenneth Starr, an independent counsel investigating Clinton's misconduct in office. [...] The revelations from these tapes became known as the Lewinsky scandal.|$|E
2500|$|Lewinsky {{confided in}} [...] <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp</b> about her {{relationship}} with Clinton. Tripp persuaded Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her, and not to dry clean a semen-stained blue dress. Tripp reported their conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, who advised her to secretly record them, which Tripp began doing in September 1997. Goldberg also urged Tripp to take the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr {{and bring them to}} the attention of people working on the Paula Jones case. In the fall of 1997, Goldberg began speaking to reporters (including Michael Isikoff of Newsweek) about the tapes.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} several months and through the summer, the media debated whether an affair had {{occurred}} and whether Clinton had lied or obstructed justice, but nothing could be definitively established beyond the taped recordings because Lewinsky was unwilling to discuss the affair or testify about it. On July 28, 1998, a substantial delay after the public break of the scandal, Lewinsky received transactional immunity in exchange for grand jury testimony concerning her relationship with Clinton. [...] She also turned over a semen-stained blue dress (that <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp</b> had encouraged her to save without dry cleaning) to the Starr investigators, thereby providing unambiguous DNA evidence that could prove the relationship despite Clinton's official denials.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Kathleen Willey {{alleged that}} Clinton groped {{her in a}} hallway in 1993. An {{independent}} counsel determined Willey gave [...] "false information" [...] to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation. On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office. An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct. <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp's</b> grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1998, Bacon {{released}} {{details of}} employee <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp's</b> personnel file to a reporter, disclosing that Tripp had omitted on her employment application {{an incident that}} occurred when she was arrested for theft when she was 19 years old. Tripp, a Defense Department employee, had been a friend of Monica Lewinsky, who had herself worked as an assistant in Bacon's office in 1996 and 1997 (having been hired {{on the recommendation of}} the White House). Bacon was criticized for violating privacy laws and harming Tripp's reputation. In response to a Defense Department Inspector General's report in 2000 that concluded that Bacon had not followed authorized procedures, William Cohen published a letter that had been sent to Bacon in which Bacon's actions were called [...] "hasty and ill-conceived". Bacon issued a statement that the information he released was driven by [...] "a desire to be responsive to an urgent media inquiry" [...] and that the Inspector General's two-year investigation did not find any connection to the White House. In a 2003 settlement, following a lawsuit which claimed that the revelations violated the Privacy Act of 1974, Tripp received a payment of $595,000, retroactive promotion and salary increases for the years 1998 to 2000 and the right to reapply for government employment.|$|R
2500|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} transferred {{her from}} the White House to the Pentagon because they felt she was {{spending too much time}} around Clinton. At the Pentagon, she worked as an assistant to chief Pentagon spokesperson Kenneth Bacon. [...] Lewinsky told co-worker <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp</b> about her relationship with the President. Beginning in September 1997, Tripp began secretly recording their telephone conversations regarding the affair with Clinton. In December 1997, Lewinsky left the Pentagon position. In January 1998, after Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit in the Paula Jones case denying any physical relationship with Clinton, and had attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in that case, Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, adding to his ongoing investigation into the Whitewater controversy. Starr then broadened his investigation beyond the Arkansas land use deal to include Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible perjury and subornation of perjury in the Jones case. Tripp reported the taped conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg. She also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their relationship, and not to dry clean what would later become known as [...] "the blue dress". Under oath, Clinton denied having had [...] "a sexual affair", [...] "sexual relations", or [...] "a sexual relationship" [...] with Lewinsky.|$|E

50|$|On January 19, 2001, {{the last}} {{full day of}} the Clinton Administration, <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp</b> was fired from her job in the Pentagon.

50|$|Goldberg met <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp</b> in 1993 or 1994 {{while working}} on the {{proposal}} for {{the book on the}} death of Clinton aide Vince Foster. The two women became friends, and in 1997 Goldberg advised Tripp to secretly record former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, talking about her sexual relationship with President Bill Clinton.

50|$|Goldberg {{has spoken}} {{of his mother}} and the Lewinsky scandal:My mother was the one who advised <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp</b> to record her conversations with Monica Lewinsky and to save the dress.

5000|$|Jones's lawyers {{decided to}} show to the court a pattern of {{behavior}} by Clinton that involved his allegedly repeatedly becoming sexually involved with state or government employees.

5000|$|Colapinto was {{successful}} {{in the first case}} in which a [...] "hostile work environment" [...] was found to exist for a whistleblower who worked at a nuclear power plant. He also helped obtain whistleblower protection for Federal Bureau of Investigation employees and helped force the F.B.I. crime lab to obtain accreditation, the latter development involving him in the O.J. Simpson Trial. As co-counsel to Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, Colapinto was behind the lawsuit that forced the Department of Justice to implement regulations protecting F.B.I. employee whistleblowers.

50|$|<b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp,</b> the Clinton Administration staffer who {{secretly}} taped {{her phone}} conversations with Monica Lewinsky {{in order to}} expose the latter's affair with the President, testified under oath that Willey's sexual contact with President Clinton in 1993 was consensual, that Willey had been flirting with the President, and that Willey was happy and excited following her 1993 encounter with Clinton. Six other friends of Willey confirmed Tripp's account, that Willey had sought {{a sexual relationship with}} the President. Ken Starr, who had deposed Willey in the course of investigating the sexual history of President Clinton, determined that she had lied under oath repeatedly to his investigators. Starr and his team therefore concluded that there was insufficient evidence to pursue her allegations further. In 2007 Willey published a book about her experiences with the Clintons.|$|E

Her affair was exposed by her supposed friend - Melinda Fall (Elizabeth Alley), a take off on <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp.</b> Sara went on to develop a relationship with local lifeguard Casey Mitchum, and their relationship and her sibling rivalry with her sister (who at one point started an affair with Casey) made up the bulk of Sara's storylines, although she was also famous for her TV show-inspired fantasy sequences, which included spoofs of the opening titles for Friends and The Mary Tyler Moore Show.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, Aldrich {{formed a}} nonprofit organization, The Patrick Henry Center for Individual Liberty, to support other federal level whistle-blowers; the group's stated aim is [...] "promoting the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights and {{supporting}} the right of citizens to engage in ethical dissent." [...] His first client was <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp,</b> the White House staff member who reported the extramarital affair between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky in 1998. The Patrick Henry Center has since supported a few more whistle-blowers reporting fraud and abuse in government. The Center additionally promotes limited government, individual liberty, and constitutional rule of law. In 2014, the 501(c)3 status of PHCIL was revoked by the IRS {{on the basis that}} it had [...] "operated as an action organization because you participated in or intervened in political campaigns on behalf of and in opposition to candidates for public office".|$|E

In the course of the investigation, <b>Linda</b> <b>Tripp</b> provided Starr with taped phone conversations in which Monica Lewinsky, a former White House Intern, discussed having performed fellatio on Clinton. At the deposition, the judge rejected the plaintiff's lawyer's definition of the term [...] "sexual relations" [...] that Clinton claims to have construed to mean only vaginal intercourse. Judge Wright then told the attorneys they could be as explicit as necessary in asking their questions.|$|E
