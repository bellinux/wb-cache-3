60|$|It {{went down}} at an acute angle for some fifty feet, the floor being covered with broken stone. Thence there {{extended}} a long, straight passage {{cut in the}} solid rock. I am no geologist, but the lining of this corridor was certainly of some harder material than limestone, for there were points where I could actually see the tool-marks which the old miners had left in their excavation, as fresh {{as if they had}} been done yesterday. Down this strange, old-world corridor I stumbled, my feeble flame throwing a dim circle of light around me, which made the shadows beyond the more threatening and obscure. Finally, I came to a spot where the Roman tunnel opened into a water-worn cavern--a huge hall, hung with long white icicles of <b>lime</b> <b>deposit.</b> From this central chamber I could dimly perceive that a number of passages worn by the subterranean streams wound away into the depths of the earth. I was standing there wondering whether I had better return, or whether I dare venture farther into this dangerous labyrinth, when my eyes fell upon something at my feet which strongly arrested my attention.|$|E

The town was initially gazetted as Leschenault in 1921, but this name was seen as too confusing because of the name's connection with Bunbury. It was then renamed Garbanup, but the Railway Department complained as this was too similar to Dardanup, so in 1923 it changed again to Lake Clifton. For a short period it was a busy company town, but the mine closed at the end of 1923 and the railway was removed and transported to Lake Grace, Western Australia for use in a railway to Newdegate.|$|E

They are used for removing <b>lime</b> <b>deposits</b> from inside kilns and for removing slag deposits from inside blast furnaces, both being used during routine maintenance. The idea is comparable to sandblasting, in that projectiles are forcibly delivered by gas under pressure. When used for generating seismic shots, they provide very repetitive and consistent peak amplitude levels. Industrial shotguns have also been used in lesser sizes (most commonly 10 and 12 gauge) for use in bird control around airports. Both blanks and slugs are used in industrial shotguns, depending on the exact effect desired, blanks most commonly being used for bird control.|$|R

50|$|The {{techniques}} used by Bluegrass are particularly advantageous {{when applied to}} heavy industry. Diamond wire sawing allows for precise cutting of concrete and metal {{with the benefit of}} being free of vibration, debris and dust. It does not compromise the integrity of adjacent structures, leaves a smooth exposed surface, and can be deployed in confined spaces by using remote control operations and/or free-form saws. Also, and often the most significant factor, is the advantage of supporting project schedule by providing a predictable outcome. Examples of application to heavy industry include foundation removals and modifications, chest removals in the pulp and paper industry, brick and refractory removal primarily using robotic hammers, and boiler segmentation. In many industrial plants such as cememt, lime, copper, aluminum, and chemical, the kiln's refractory lining wears out and needs to be replaced, or is compromised by lime buildup which must be removed. For these demolition jobs, remotely operated robotic hammers are used to break up the refractory for removal, and for chipping off <b>lime</b> <b>deposits.</b>|$|R

In order to establish the influence that the experimental treatments make on the number and the breadth of solution ideas proposed by problem solvers with different knowledge levels, students from different years of study were recruited. Ninety students from the Offenburg University of Applied Sciences, Germany were divided into three groups. All students were asked to generate ideas on cleaning <b>lime</b> <b>deposits</b> from the inside of a water pipe and were given 16 minutes to record their individual ideas. Students of two experimental groups were shown some words for two minuted each. The Su-Field group was exposed to the eight fields of MATCEMIB. The Random Word group was shown eight random words every two minutes. The Su-Field group outperformed both the Control group and the Random Word group in the number of ideas generated. It was also found that the students from the Su-Field group proposed significantly broader solutions than the students from the Control and Random Word groups. The overall results of the experiment support the conclusions made by the RMIT researchers that simple ideation techniques can significantly improve idea generation and that the systematised Substance-Field Analysis is a suitable heuristic for engineering students...|$|R

Dreft does not leave a <b>lime</b> scum <b>deposit</b> and it does not contain harsh chemicals such as bleach. It is suitable for fine washables such as silk or wool as well as flame-resistant fabrics. The Fairy brand of washing-up liquid and Cascade brand of dishwashing detergent are also sold under the name [...] "Dreft" [...] in some countries, including the Netherlands. In Canada, it is called Ivory Snow.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} well-defined {{settlements in}} the Tula area appear around 400 BCE. Tula was probably settled by people of various ethnic backgrounds which may have included the Nonoalcas and the Chichimecas {{from the south and}} north respectively. The area probably was under the political control of Teotihuacan in the Epiclassic period, according to Teotihuacan designs found on Tula pottery. The area’s <b>lime</b> <b>deposits</b> were probably an important source for the plaster used in construction. At this time Tula was a small urban settlement with modest public architecture concentrated at Tula Chico (Small Tula). The constructions at Tula Chico are smaller than those in other Epiclassic sites, and was probably a minor player in the political and economic activity of the time. Tula Chico’s occupation is from 650 to 900. From 650 to 750, Tula Chico developed, and at its height spanned five to six km2, parts of which may be buried under Tula Grande. The population was somewhere between 19,000 to 27,000 at its height. Tula Chico was abandoned between 850 and 900CE, and Tula Grande began to develop. After the decline of Teotihuacan, there was a power vacuum with city states dominating small regions. Tula ceramics change during this period, as styles and techniques come under new influences. At the same time, settlement patterns of the area significantly changed with occupation mostly on hilltops and high hillsides. Architecture and pottery show influence from the west and north, with some from the east, suggesting a multiethnic population.|$|R
5000|$|The mining of <b>lime</b> {{from this}} <b>deposit</b> was first {{mentioned}} in a deed of enfeoffment dated 1528. This {{was a result}} of lease agreements or was a fiscal deed produced {{under the direction of the}} Royal Saxon Forestry Offices. In 1567, the existence of a quarry and two kilns is recorded in a deed of sale by the Barony of Rauenstein to Prince-Elector Augustus.|$|R

The subsequent development given to the phosphate industry by that of agriculture needs have attracted a great interest in phosphate deposits. This, interest quickly developed for the phosphatic concretions dredged durin the Challenger expedition in the vicinity the Cape of Good Hope and in the Indian Ocean in a line drawn South from Africa to Marion Island.

5000|$|Squaw Island {{is located}} {{at the north end of}} the lake. It is the {{smallest}} Fish and Wildlife Management Area in New York State and one of only two islands in the eleven Finger Lakes. The Seneca recall that the island was used to hide the Seneca women and children during the Sullivan Expedition against the Six Nations of the Iroquois in 1779. The island exhibits an extremely rare form of carbonate of <b>lime</b> forms <b>deposits</b> on pebbles (conglomerate). It is a feathery light rock which is calcified from algae filtered by sand and pond scum. The rock, locally called [...] "water biscuits", is hard in the water but crumbles if allowed to dry out. In recent years the island has been eroding rapidly from the forces of ice, wind, water currents and development changing the wave patterns.|$|R
40|$|Seagrass beds {{contribute}} to oceanic carbonate lime mud production {{by providing a}} habitat {{for a wide variety}} of calcifying organisms and acting as efficient sediment traps. Here we provide evidence for the direct implication of Thalassia testudinum in the precipitation of aragonite needles. The crystals are located internally in the cell walls, and as external deposits on the blade, and are similar in size and shape to the aragonite needles reported for modern tropical carbonate factories. Seagrass calcification is a biological, light-enhanced process controlled by the leaf, and estimates of seagrass annual carbonate production in a Caribbean reef lagoon are as significant as values reported for Halimeda incrassata. Thus, we conclude that seagrass calcification is another biological source for the aragonite <b>lime</b> mud <b>deposits</b> found in tropical banks, and that tropical seagrass habitats may play a more important role in the oceanic carbon cycle than previously considered...|$|R
