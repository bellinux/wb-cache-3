5|$|Muramasa was {{worked on}} by 16 people, {{over half the}} entire staff of Vanillaware, {{including}} Kamitani as the game's writer. The Wii {{was chosen as the}} game's platform of release as its specs were fairly close to that of the PlayStation 2, the console for which Odin Sphere was developed. This meant that the team could carry over their earlier experience rather than start from scratch learning about new hardware. Kamitani did create design proposals for versions on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but went undeveloped due to budget limitations. Using the Wii's motion controls was tested by the team, but due to the game's old-fashioned style there was little need to implement them. The biggest problem when developing for the Wii was the graphics, especially how to get the various pieces of artwork in the game's scenery to interact and respond properly. They also wanted to keep loading times down to a minimum, which was made possible due to the Wii's area pre-loading abilities. Technical tinkering of this kind went on until the end of development. The game's programmer was Kentaro Ohnishi, whose biggest challenge was creating a battle system which allowed for cancelling of attacks, while maintaining the appearance of smooth attack animation. The resultant code <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> strange that another programmer thought it was a fault and deleted it, forcing Ohnishi to rebuild it. The team was highly dedicated {{to the success of the}} project, putting a large amount of work to make it as good as it could be for players. By the time of release, funds for the company had been drained.|$|E
5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E
25|$|Satirical {{pamphlets}} {{directed against}} royalty were a {{common form of}} literature and the chronicles left by courtiers were influenced by rivalries or prejudice, so {{he may not have}} <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> bad. Based on collaborating evidence from other sources, however, it is probably safe to assume that he was tall, and not plump.|$|E

25|$|The Emperor {{was greatly}} pleased and asked young Araniko to repair an {{important}} bronze idol {{presented as a}} gift by a Song emperor. It took him two years to finish the restoration. In the second month of 1265, Arniko finished the restoration and the statue <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> perfect {{that even the most}} skilled artists of China greatly admired his work.|$|E
25|$|From the batsman’s {{viewpoint}} {{it looked}} perfect. It was a rusty brown, {{but seemed to}} hold a thousand runs, and both Hammond and Bradman were enthusiastic in their keenness to win the toss. When the England skipper called correctly he smiled with confident pleasure.... Imagine Hammond's surprise when before an hour had passed the wicket, which <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> docile, {{was in fact a}} dangerous spin-taking nightmare.|$|E
25|$|Although the British and US {{had agreed}} to release their data in full, {{at this point the}} overall {{director}} of the US program, Lewis Strauss, decided to hold back the release. Tuck argued that the field <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> promising that it would be premature to release any data before the researchers knew that fusion was definitely taking place. Strauss agreed, and announced that they would withhold their data for a period to check their results.|$|E

25|$|Second {{match was}} against West Indies, where they <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> {{strong in the}} group. Sri Lanka batted first and only managed to score 122/9 in 20 overs. Few poor umpire {{decision}} gone wrong way to the Lankans as well, where lbw decision for Dilshan was highly criticised by the commentators. West Indies came to the crease, where Gayle {{was not in the}} frame. With the fast start with Andre Fletcher, Windies won the match by 7 wickets.|$|E
25|$|My {{assignment}} {{was on the}} bridge in the pilot house as helmsman.

25|$|Before his death, Ralph Quarles {{arranged}} for his Quaker friend William Gooch {{to be made}} guardian of his children. As requested by Quarles, after the parents both died in 1833 when John Langston was four, Gooch moved with the boys and their half-brother William Langston to Chillicothe, Ohio, in a free state. Their father had left his natural sons substantial inheritances that provided for their education and, as adults, enabled them to work for political reform. The oldest brother, Gideon Quarles, <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> much like his father that at age 21 he took the Quarles surname.|$|E

25|$|Ex-Governor Charles Robinson was {{an object}} of special search among them. He {{was one of the}} men they {{particularly}} wanted. During the whole time they were in town he was in his large stone barn on the hillside. He had just gone to the barn to get his team to drive out into the country, when he saw them come in and saw them make their first charge. He concluded to remain where he was. The barn overlooked the whole town, and he saw the affair from beginning to end. Gangs of raiders came by several times and looked at the barn and went round it, but it <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> much like a fort, that they kept out of range.|$|E
25|$|When {{the series}} Judge Dredd was being {{developed}} in 1976–77 {{it was originally}} planned that the story would be set in New York, in the near future. However, when artist Carlos Ezquerra drew his first story for the series, a skyscraper {{in the background of}} one panel <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> futuristic that editor Pat Mills instructed him to draw a full-page poster of the city. Ezquerra's vision of the city – with massive tower blocks and endless roads suspended vast distances above the ground with no visible means of support – was so futuristic that it prompted a rethink, and a whole new city was proposed. Art director Doug Church suggested that the city should extend along the entire Eastern Seaboard, and be called Mega-City One, and his idea was adopted.|$|E
25|$|Third {{and most}} {{important}} match in the group came against England. England batted first and scored 171/4 with Jos Buttler's magnificent fifty. Sri Lanka in the chase, again <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> poor, where 50 runs for 5 wickets after 9 overs. The defending champions were {{on the brink of}} a huge defeat in the match, Angelo Mathews came to the crease. He with Kapugedera smashed England spinner in all corners where the match went down to the wire at the end. With falling wickets in regular intervals, Sri Lanka lost the match by 10 runs at the end, where skipper Mathews played a gem of an innings with a hamstring injury. But his 54 ball 73 was not enough at the end and Sri Lanka along with South Africa were eliminated from the World Twenty20.|$|E

25|$|The {{showcasing}} and unorthodoxy of Dilshan {{was best}} highlighted against India on 15 December 2009, where Sri Lanka chased a mammoth target of 414 posted by India. The pitch at Rajkot <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> nice to bat on, Dilshan started the run chase with Tharanga, instead of Jayasuriya. The blistering knock reached fifty from 38 balls and then hundred from 73 balls. His first 150 came from 115 balls and Sri Lanka {{on the brink}} of a sensational win. The knock of 160 was full of hooks, pulls and many scoops of his variety, leading the way to victory. But after Dilshan falls bowled by Harbhajan Singh, the match opened for Indians. They took all the advantages and Sri Lanka bowled out for 411 runs, in an eye margin for the victory. This was Dilshan's third century in ODIs, where the match was described by commentators as one of the best chases in World Cricket.|$|E
25|$|Consensus {{held that}} if Virginia, {{the most populous}} state at the time, did not ratify the Constitution, the new {{national}} government would not likely succeed. When the Virginia Ratifying Convention began on June 2, 1788, the Constitution {{had not yet been}} ratified by the required nine states. New York, the second largest state and a bastion of anti-federalism, would likely not ratify it without Virginia, and Virginia's exclusion from the new government would disqualify Virginian George Washington from being the first president. Virginia delegates believed that Washington's election as the first president was a condition for their acceptance of the new constitution and the new government. Arguably the most prominent anti-federalist, the powerful orator Patrick Henry was a delegate and had a following second only to Washington (who was not a delegate). Most delegates believed that Virginians mainly opposed the constitution. Initially Madison did not want to stand for election to the Virginia ratifying convention, but was persuaded to do so because the situation <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> bad. His role at the convention was likely critical to Virginia's ratification, and thus {{to the success of the}} constitution generally.|$|E
