The {{international}} slave trade was prohibited in 1808, and planters used the domestic slave trade to procure laborers for developing cotton culture in the Deep South. Three of Davis's older brothers served in the War of 1812. In 1813, Davis began his education at the Wilkinson Academy {{in the small town}} of Woodville, near the family cotton plantation.|$|E
5|$|Famous Fantastic Mysteries was an American {{science fiction}} and fantasy pulp {{magazine}} published from 1939 to 1953. The editor was Mary Gnaedinger. It was {{launched by the}} Munsey Company {{as a way to}} reprint the many science fiction and fantasy stories which had appeared over the preceding decades in the Munsey magazines, such as Argosy. The first issue was dated September/October 1939; the magazine was immediately successful, and <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later</b> a companion magazine, Fantastic Novels, was launched.|$|E

5|$|A statewide {{review by}} {{emergency}} management officials recorded 249 fatalities in Alabama, 23 {{of which were}} not tornado-related. Damage and power outages in the Huntsville area were so widespread {{that at one point}} over 650,000 people were out of power in the Tennessee Valley Authority system. The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant further to the northeast. These towers were the main supply of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado just missed the Limestone Correctional Facility, which <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later</b> would be struck by another tornado.|$|E
5|$|By a {{day after}} the storm made landfall, the record power outages were largely restored. However, salt damage {{prevented}} restoration in some areas for several days. The outages left residents temporarily without water after water pumps were shut down. In Hiroshima, lack of power caused traffic congestion, shut down banks, and disrupted hospitals. The widespread power outages related to Mireille prompted the government to reconstruct transmission towers with anemometer, or wind measurement devices. Following the storm, insurance companies paid $6billion to policy holders in Japan, which was a world record related to wind damage; this was surpassed <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later</b> by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida. The typhoon still holds the title as the costliest non-Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Chanel {{bought the}} five acre plot on which La Pausa {{was built for}} 1.8 million French francs in February 1929.

The villa was built <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later.</b> The final cost of the villa was 6 million francs, a large sum for the time. It is not clear whether Chanel or her lover, Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster financed the building and furnishing of La Pausa. La Pausa was built by architect Robert Streitz, who sought to build 'the ideal Mediterranean villa'.|$|E

In 1781 Harvey briefly commanded HMS Dolphin, but took leave once again four months later. In 1782 Harvey again returned to the Navy just as peace was agreed and was promoted to commander on 21 March 1782, briefly taking over the sloop HMS Otter before rapidly making the jump to Post Captain <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later,</b> on 20 January 1783.|$|E

Uchikoshi examined the possibility of financing the development through the use of crowdfunding on a website like Kickstarter, but felt that the idea would not be persuasive enough for it to meet the goal; he also sought out opportunities with executives and investors. The series' fandom created Operation Bluebird, an online campaign to raise awareness of the series and support the game's development, in response to its hiatus.|$|E

He was buried in a private ceremony at Old Ipswich Cemetery on 7 May 1999.

5|$|The {{first phase}} of the ship's first {{modernization}} began on 12 April 1930 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal; machinery was replaced, armor was reinforced, and torpedo bulges were fitted. Fusō arrived on 26 September 1932 at Kure Naval Arsenal, where her armament was upgraded and her torpedo tubes were removed. Her sea trials began on 12 May 1933, and the second phase of her modernization began <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later.</b> The ship's stern was lengthened and work was completed in March 1935. Captain Jinichi Kusaka was assigned command from November 1935 to December 1936. After sporadic use for training for the next two years, Fusō was assigned as a training ship in 1936 and 1937.|$|E
5|$|Upon commissioning, {{all three}} ships were {{assigned}} to the 1st Division of the Home Fleet and St Vincent became the flagship of the division's second-in-command. In July, they were present when King George V visited the fleet in Torbay and participated in his Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 24 June 1911. <b>Less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later,</b> the 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. Collingwood became the squadron flagship on 22 June and reverted to a private ship again two years later. Each of the sisters underwent a lengthy refit before the First World War began in mid-1914.|$|E
5|$|Air Vice Marshal Ian Dougald McLachlan, CB, CBE, DFC (23 July 1911– 14 July 1991) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Born in Melbourne, he was a cadet at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, before joining the Air Force in December 1930. After serving in instructional and general flying roles, he took command of No.3 Squadron in December 1939, leading it into action in the Middle East <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later.</b> Awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, he returned to Australia in 1942 to command air bases in Canberra and Melbourne. The following year he was posted to the South West Pacific, where he led successively Nos.71 and 73 Wings.

5|$|Air Vice Marshal Joseph Eric (Joe) Hewitt, CBE (13 April 1901– 1November 1985) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). A Royal Australian Navy officer who transferred permanently to the Air Force in 1928, he commanded No.101 (Fleet Cooperation) Flight in the early 1930s, and No.104 (Bomber) Squadron RAF on exchange in Britain shortly before World WarII. Appointed the RAAF's Assistant Chief of the Air Staff in 1941, Hewitt was posted the following year to Allied Air Forces Headquarters, South West Pacific Area, as Director of Intelligence. In 1943, he took command of No.9 Operational Group, the RAAF's main mobile strike force, but was controversially sacked by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later</b> over alleged morale and disciplinary issues.|$|E
5|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} came from the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned {{in the general population}} since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later</b> amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a Companhia Correcional (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb on the practice, as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the Companhia Correcional but not have any change in their daily routines.|$|E
5|$|Basilicata {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} Campania. Both ships were built on the same slipway. They were launched <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>later</b> on 23 July 1914. Fitting-out work proceeded more slowly on Basilicata, and she was completed on 1 August 1917, four months after her sister ship. After completion, Basilicata was stationed in Italian Libya. On 13 August 1919, while moored in Tewfik {{at the southern end of}} the Suez Canal, one of Basilicatas boilers exploded, which sank the ship. Salvage operations began thereafter, and on 12 September 1920, the ship was refloated. The Regia Marina decided that repairing the ship was not worth the cost, and so on 1 July 1921 she was sold to ship breakers in Suez.|$|E
