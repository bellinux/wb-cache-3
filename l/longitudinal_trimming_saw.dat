40|$|This paper {{presents}} a static aeroelastic model and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> {{model for the}} analysis of a flexible wing transport aircraft. The static aeroelastic model is built using a structural model based on finite-element modeling and coupled to an aerodynamic model that uses vortex-lattice solution. An automatic geometry generation tool is used to close the loop between the structural and aerodynamic models. The aeroelastic model is extended {{for the development of a}} three degree-of-freedom <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> model for an aircraft with flexible wings. The resulting flexible aircraft <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> model is used to simultaneously compute the static aeroelastic shape for the aircraft model and the longitudinal state inputs to maintain an aircraft trim state. The framework is applied to an aircraft model based on the NASA Generic Transport Model (GTM) with wing structures allowed to flexibly deformed referred to as the Elastically Shaped Aircraft Concept (ESAC). The ESAC wing mass and stiffness properties are based on a baseline "stiff" values representative of current generation transport aircraft...|$|R

50|$|The 1931 Westland-Hill Pterodactyl IV was a {{tailless}} design whose lightly swept wings could vary their sweep {{through a}} small angle during flight. This allowed <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> {{in the absence of}} a separate horizontal stabiliser.|$|R
50|$|Plywood-skinned low-set {{tailplane}} and {{fin with}} fabric-covered built-up wooden elevators and rudder {{are at the}} tail end of the fuselage, the elevators fitted with trim tabs, one for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> and one to compensate for pitch-up with operation of the airbrakes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{final stage}} of the system usually {{consists}} of a <b>trim</b> <b>saw</b> that cuts the countertops to rough lengths, typically 8', 10' and 12', ready for distribution.|$|R
40|$|Tests of a 1 / 20 -scale {{model of}} the Fleetwings XBTK- 1 {{airplane}} have been performed in the Langley 15 -foot free-spinning tunnel to determine the trim tendencies of the airplane at attitudes above the stall. The results of the tests indicated that the model would trim longitudinally only in the normal range of angles of attack and that the yaw trim tendencies for such <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> conditions were normal. Although wide oscillations in yaw were noted for some conditions, they occurred at angles of attack larger than those indicated as possible for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> and spin equilibrium. It appears, therefore, that the oscillatory motions reported for the airplane {{may have been the}} direct result of control movements rather than the result of inherent oscillatory tendencies...|$|R
50|$|As speed {{increases}} and becomes fully supersonic, the wing centre of lift moves backwards, causing {{a change in}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> and a pitching-down tendency known as Mach tuck. Supersonic aircraft {{had to be made}} capable of adjusting sufficiently, in order to maintain adequate control at all stages of flight.|$|R
50|$|The next {{model to}} be built was a three-seat cabin {{monoplane}} to Ministry Specification 16/29, in which the all-moving tips were replaced by conventional ailerons. An unusual feature {{was the use of}} variable wing sweep to provide <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim.</b> Designated the Mk. IV, it first flew in 1931.|$|R
5000|$|One {{approach}} to resolving this compromise {{is the use}} of a variable-geometry wing, commonly known as the [...] "swing-wing," [...] which spreads wide for low-speed flight and then sweeps sharply, usually backwards, for supersonic flight. However, swinging affects the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> of the aircraft and the swinging mechanism adds weight and cost.|$|R
50|$|Longitudinal {{dihedral}} {{can also}} mean the angle between the zero lift {{axis of the}} wing and tail instead of between the root chords of the two surfaces. This is the more meaningful usage because the directions of zero-lift are pertinent to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> and stability while the directions of the root chords are not.|$|R
5000|$|On 25 February 1964, Eastern Air Lines Flight 304 (a Douglas DC-8) {{flying from}} New Orleans International Airport to Washington-National Airport crashed into Lake Pontchartrain en route due to [...] "degradation of {{aircraft}} stability characteristics in turbulence, because of abnormal <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> component positions."

Air Forces' {{accelerated}} transonic flight tests of the XS- 1 No. 1 airplane for the Mach number range from 0. 70 to 1. 25 at altitudes from 30, 000 to 49, 000 feet.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of current prediction methodologies {{to estimate the}} aerodynamic uncertainties identified for the E 205 configuration is presented. This evaluation was accomplished by comparing predicted and wind tunnel test data in three major categories: untrimmed <b>longitudinal</b> aerodynamics; <b>trimmed</b> <b>longitudinal</b> aerodynamics; and lateral-directional aerodynamic characteristics...|$|R
50|$|While {{elevators}} and swivelling propellers provide {{fine control}} of altitude, larger changes of height {{used to be}} controlled by either venting gas to lose altitude or dropping ballast to gain altitude. Large airships typically carried several water tanks fore and aft, allowing them to adjust <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> as well as height. Some modern designs instead pump lifting gas between the gas bags and storage cylinders.|$|R
40|$|Flight {{records are}} {{presented}} {{from an early}} flight test of a wing-tip mounted tilting-ducted-fan, vertical-take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft configuration. Time histories of the aircraft motions, control positions, and duct pitching-moment variation are presented to illustrate {{the characteristics of the}} aircraft in hovering, in conversion from hovering to forward flight, and in conversion from forward flight to hovering. The results indicate that during essentially continuous slow level- flight conversions, this aircraft experiences excessive <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> changes. Studies have shown that the large trim changes are caused primarily by the variation of aerodynamic moments acting on the duct units. Action of the duct-induced downwash on the horizontal stabilizer during the conversion also contributes to the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> variations. Time histories of hovering and slow vertical descent {{in the final stages of}} landing in calm air show angular motions of the aircraft as great as +/- 10 deg. about all axes. Stick and pedal displacements required to control the aircraft during the landing maneuver were on the order of 50 to 60 percent of the total travel available...|$|R
50|$|A {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} Vagabond was the method of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trimming.</b> Rather than {{changing}} {{the angle of the}} tailplane with respect to the fuselage, the whole rear part of the fuselage was hinged just ahead of the lower wing's trailing edge. This was controlled via a handwheel between the two cockpits; the rear fuselage was raised {{at the start of a}} landing descent to increase drag and slow the aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary flight {{measurements}} of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> and dynamic stability of the BAC 221 aircraft have been made. The flight measurements are of reasonable quality in spite of difficulties associated with the aileron control system, an early instrumentation standard, and the handling characteristics of the aircraft at high incidence. Useful comparisons with wind-tunnel results are made, and the agreement is generally reasonable, although some unexplained differences remain. Flight and wind-tunnel tests to investigat...|$|R

40|$|Drag and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> at low lift of the North American YF- 100 A {{airplane}} at Mach {{numbers from}} 0. 76 to 1. 77 as determined from the flight {{test of a}} 0. 11 -scale rocket model are presented herein. Also included are some longitudinal stability and some qualitative pitch-damping data. The subsonic external-drag-coefficient level was about 0. 012, and the supersonic level was about 0. 043. The drag rise occurred at a Mach number of 0. 95. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> change at low lift consisted basically of a mild nose-up tendency at a Mach number of 0. 90. An indication of wing flutter was present at Mach numbers from 0. 95 to 1. 11. However, the full-scale airplane wing has approximately twice the scaled first-bending frequency as the model tested and, hence, will probably be free {{of this type of}} flutter. The aerodynamic-center location was 71 percent behind {{the leading edge of the}} mean aerodynamic chord at a Mach number of 1. 03 and 62 percent at a Mach number of 1. 74. Qualitative measurement of damping in pitch indicates that at low lift coefficients damping will be low at a Mach number of 1. 03...|$|R

5000|$|Elevator trim frees {{the pilot}} from exerting {{constant}} {{pressure on the}} pitch controls. Instead, the pilot adjusts a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim</b> control (often {{in the form of}} a wheel) to cancel out control forces for a given airspeed / weight distribution. Typically, when this trim control (wheel or lever) is rotated or moved forward, the nose is held down; conversely, if the trim control is moved back, the tail becomes [...] "heavy". Many newer aircraft, especially jet aircraft, have electric trim controls.|$|R
