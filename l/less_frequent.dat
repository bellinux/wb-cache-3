5|$|Some species build complex nests called polycalic nests; this {{habitat is}} called polycalism. Polycalic species of {{termites}} form multiple nests, or calies, connected by subterranean chambers. The termite genera Apicotermes and Trinervitermes {{are known to}} have polycalic species. Polycalic nests appear to be <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> in mound-building species although polycalic arboreal nests have been observed in a few species of Nasutitermes.|$|E

Since April 2007, the monthly sample size has varied between 2,900–3,900 with {{a margin of}} error of about ±1.8%. (Polling does not include Åland as it has its own party system.) However, there were also other <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> opinion polls.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, tremors, agitation, fearfulness, and muscle spasms. The <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> effects are irritability, sweating, depersonalization, derealization, hypersensitivity to stimuli, depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, seizures, and delirium tremens. Severe symptoms usually {{occur as a}} result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal. Abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous, therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended.|$|E

5|$|After Shepard's death Margaret {{lived there}} {{in the spring and}} fall, with her visits {{becoming}} <b>less</b> <b>frequent.</b> By 1900 she began selling property to Frank A.

Vanderlip and Rockefeller assembled a board of directors to create a country club; they first met at Vanderlip's National City Bank Building office at 55 Wall Street (Vanderlip was president of the bank at the time). Sleepy Hollow Country Club was founded, with Woodlea becoming its clubhouse and the J. Butler Wright house as its golf house.|$|E
5|$|On January 11, 1943, U.S. forces {{captured}} Amchitka, {{an island}} just fifty miles from Kiska. However, challenges faced the Americans stationed {{there from the}} outset – {{on the first night}} that the Americans spent on the ground, harsh winds destroyed many of the Americans' boats, and on the second night a blizzard reduced the base's line of sight. By mid-February, Army engineers had completed an airfield on the island, after which attacks on the island by the Japanese became <b>less</b> <b>frequent.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better.

5|$|The town {{wall was}} kept in good repair whilst there was a threat of {{invasion}} from the Scots. In 1342, David II of Scotland invaded Northumberland and laid siege to Newcastle, without success. In 1388, another Scottish army under the Earl of Douglas assaulted the town, but was repulsed. As the border wars between England and Scotland became <b>less</b> <b>frequent,</b> and in particular following the union of the two crowns in 1603, the wall was allowed to deteriorate.|$|E

A very dangerous surfing beach, it is best left to expert surfers.|$|R

5|$|This {{species at}} its {{breeding}} sites gives a long mournful call like the hooting of a tawny owl, {{and a much}} <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> sound like the whimpering of a pup. It is silent at sea. The breeding calls {{are very similar to}} those of Fea's petrel, and Bretagnolle's analysis of the calls of the soft-plumaged petrel complex led him to suggest in 1995 only a two-way species split, with the northern forms madeira, feae and deserti all as subspecies of Fea's petrel.|$|E
5|$|While OCD {{may affect}} any joint, the knee—specifically the medial femoral condyle in 75–85% of knee cases—tends {{to be the}} most {{commonly}} affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. The elbow (specifically the capitulum of the humerus) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases. <b>Less</b> <b>frequent</b> locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the scapula.|$|E
5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1998 and was opened on July 18, 2009, {{as part of}} the inaugural Link line, after five years of tunnel boring and station construction.

Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> service at other times. Beacon Hill Station is also served by two King County Metro buses that stop at a pair of sheltered bus stops on Beacon Avenue.|$|E
50|$|For <b>less</b> <b>frequented</b> {{relations}} and for operational flexibility, a 2001 study proposed a train created by scaling down the planned commercial {{version of the}} HSR-350x, by shortening the train, removing powered bogies from intermediate cars, and lowering top speed.Hyundai Rotem received orders for altogether 24 such trains, called KTX-II, in three batches from July 2006 to December 2008.|$|R

60|$|In this, however, Lord Glenvarloch was mistaken; for, as he strolled {{slowly along}} with his arms folded in his cloak, and his hat drawn over his eyes, he was {{suddenly}} pounced upon by Sir Mungo Malagrowther, who, either shunning or shunned, had retreated, or had been obliged to retreat, to the same <b>less</b> <b>frequented</b> corner of the Park.|$|R
5|$|By April 2008, Ezarik {{had largely}} reduced her lifecasting {{productions}} to a <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> basis. She had resumed pursuit of her web designer and video editor career and {{was living in}} Carnegie. Her new equipment by Nokia enabled her to lifecast and produce streaming video live without a computer connection. She continued to make weekly appearances on her own iJustine website at www.ijustine.tv. Still a Carnegie resident at the time, Ezarik planned to be vacationing in North Carolina when the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 and hoped to find an AT wireless store to upgrade while on vacation. That June, Ezarik was named by Intel and its PR firm Ogilvy & Mather to a 10-member social media strategy advisory board. In late 2008, she relocated her base of operation from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Los Angeles, California.|$|E
5|$|Capitol Hill {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{as the site}} of a subway stop in unimplemented plans from 1911 and 1968, but voter approval did not come until 1996. It was built as part of the University Link Extension, which began construction in 2009 and opened on March 19, 2016. Construction of the station required the demolition of two city blocks along Broadway, which will be redeveloped into a transit-oriented, mixed-use complex in 2019. Light rail trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with <b>less</b> <b>frequent</b> service at other times.
