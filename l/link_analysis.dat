Dynamic network analysis brings together traditional {{social network analysis}}, <b>link</b> <b>analysis</b> and multi-agent systems within network science and network theory. Through the use of key concepts and methods in social network analysis, agent-based modeling, theoretical physics, and modern mathematics (particularly graph theory and fractal geometry), this method of inquiry brought insights into the dynamics and structure of social systems. New computational methods of localized social network analysis {{are coming out of}} the work of Duncan Watts, Albert-László Barabási, Nicholas A. Christakis, Kathleen Carley and others.|$|E

40|$|Context {{and aims}} With {{improvements}} in cancer outcomes, existing models of care can see cancer survivors continuing to attend hospital-based follow-up appointments for many years, creating demands on an already stretched {{health care system}} and increasing costs. This study explores patient, general practitioner (GP) and cancer specialist views on the feasibility and acceptability of transferring the continuing care of survivors with no current evidence of recurrence to primary care. Methods Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 16 oncologists, 22 of their breast and/or colorectal cancer patients, and 18 of their GPs. Respondents were asked their views on their GPs taking a greater or leading role in follow-up care. Recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was performed in Nvivo version 10. Researcher triangulation was used to refine the coding framework and themes; source triangulation and member checks to increase credibility. The linked responses of GP, specialists and patient were analysed. Findings Analysis within groups (patient, and medical, surgical and radiation oncologists) indicate that most participants considered a staged, shared care team arrangement with both GPs and specialists flexibly providing continuing care to be acceptable. However, when <b>linked</b> <b>analysis</b> is performed within individual patient-GP-oncologist clusters, we found that it was much less frequent that all three parties agreed.
