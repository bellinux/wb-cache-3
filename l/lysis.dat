5|$|Release {{occurs when}} the new viruses escape or are {{released}} from the cell. Most viruses achieve this by making the cells burst, a process called <b>lysis.</b> Other viruses such as HIV are released more gently by a process called budding.|$|E
5|$|Fully {{assembled}} poliovirus {{leaves the}} confines of its host cell by <b>lysis</b> 4 to 6 hours following initiation of infection in cultured mammalian cells. The mechanism of viral release from the cell is unclear, but each dying cell can release up to 10,000 polio virions.|$|E
5|$|During the infection, {{rotavirus}} produces mRNA {{for both}} protein biosynthesis and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus {{as early as}} two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought {{to be made by}} two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by <b>lysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mycena aurantiomarginata uses a tetrapolar mating system, whereby genes at two {{different}} locations on the chromosomes regulate sexual compatibility, or mating type. This system prevents self-fertilization and ensures {{a high degree}} of genotypic diversity. When the fungal mycelia is grown in culture on a petri dish, the colonies are white, odorless, and typically have a central patch of congested aerial hyphae that grow upward from the colony surface, which abruptly become flattened to submerged, and occasionally form faint zone lines. The hyphae commonly form deposits of tiny amorphous crystals where they contact other mycelial fronts, especially where the hyphae are vegetatively incompatible and destroy each other by <b>lysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{base of the}} Y {{plays a role in}} {{modulating}} immune cell activity. This {{region is}} called the Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region, and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody. Thus, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen, by binding to a specific class of Fc receptors, and other immune molecules, such as complement proteins. By doing this, it mediates different physiological effects including recognition of opsonized particles (binding to FcγR), <b>lysis</b> of cells (binding to complement), and degranulation of mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils (binding to FcεR).|$|E
5|$|The {{incubation}} period between contraction {{and the first}} obvious symptoms of the disease is around 12 days. Once inhaled, variola major virus invades the oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) or the respiratory mucosa, migrates to regional lymph nodes, and begins to multiply. In the initial growth phase the virus seems to move from cell to cell, but around the 12th day, <b>lysis</b> of many infected cells occurs and the virus {{is found in the}} bloodstream in large numbers (this is called viremia), and a second wave of multiplication occurs in the spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} {{structural}} and biochemical effects that viruses {{have on the}} host cell is extensive. These are called cytopathic effects. Most virus infections eventually result {{in the death of}} the host cell. The causes of death include cell <b>lysis,</b> alterations to the cell's surface membrane and apoptosis. Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activities because of suppression by virus-specific proteins, not all of which are components of the virus particle.|$|E
5|$|An evasion {{strategy}} used {{by several}} pathogens {{to avoid the}} innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents <b>lysis</b> by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms {{to protect themselves from}} the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).|$|E
5|$|Bacteriophages are {{a common}} and diverse group of viruses and are the most {{abundant}} form of biological entity in aquatic environments– there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria, reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater. These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell. Within {{a short amount of}} time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell <b>lysis.</b> Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, {{in the case of the}} T4 phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, he {{designed}} the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter {{with a small}} fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural <b>lysis</b> of adhesions, {{sometimes referred to as}} percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low-back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area.|$|E
5|$|To {{perform in}} vitro analysis, a protein must be {{purified}} {{away from other}} cellular components. This process usually begins with cell <b>lysis,</b> in which a cell's membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate. The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation, which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins; membrane lipids and proteins; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. Precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this lysate. Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge and binding affinity. The level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein's molecular weight and isoelectric point are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity. Additionally, proteins can be isolated according their charge using electrofocusing.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, HIV causes AIDS by {{depleting}} CD4+ T cells. This {{weakens the}} immune system and allows opportunistic infections. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases. During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell <b>lysis</b> and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of {{the immune system}} to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.|$|E
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell <b>lysis,</b> the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of herpes virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E
25|$|Products of the <b>lysis</b> genes S,R, Rz and Rz1 cause cell <b>lysis.</b> S is a holin, a small {{membrane}} protein that, {{at a time}} determined by the sequence of the protein, suddenly makes holes in the membrane. R is an endolysin, an enzyme that escapes through the S holes and cleaves the cell wall. Rz and Rz1 are {{membrane protein}}s that form a complex that somehow destroys the outer membrane, after the endolysin has degraded the cell wall. For wild-type lambda, <b>lysis</b> occurs at about 50 minutes {{after the start of}} infection and releases around 100 virions.|$|E
25|$|Complement {{fixation}} assay. The {{complement fixation}} test was modified to assay Antiserum mediated RBC <b>lysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{the organ}} gets a metastatic disease {{it begins to}} shrink until its lymph nodes burst, or undergo <b>lysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Transcription {{from the}} PR {{promoter}} can now extend to produce mRNA for the <b>lysis</b> {{and the head}} and tail proteins.|$|E
25|$|Translation {{takes place}} by -1 ribosomal frameshifting, viral initiation, and ribosomal skipping. The virus exits the host cell by <b>lysis,</b> and viroporins.|$|E
25|$|Cell <b>lysis</b> is {{mediated}} by the phiX174-encoded protein E, which inhibits the peptidoglycan synthesis leading to an eventual bursting of the infected cell.|$|E
25|$|In {{cell biology}} {{aprotinin}} {{is used as}} an enzyme inhibitor to prevent protein degradation during <b>lysis</b> or homogenization of cells and tissues.|$|E
25|$|Also proteases are {{released}} during cell <b>lysis,</b> which will start digesting the proteins in the solution. If the protein {{of interest is}} sensitive to proteolysis, it is recommended to proceed quickly, {{and to keep the}} extract cooled, to slow down the digestion. Alternatively, one or more protease inhibitors can be added to the <b>lysis</b> buffer immediately before cell disruption. Sometimes it is also necessary to add DNAse {{in order to reduce the}} viscosity of the cell lysate caused by a high DNA content.|$|E
25|$|New viral {{particles}} are subsequently assembled. This occurs during the budding process {{which is also}} responsible for the accumulation of the envelope and cell <b>lysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mixing of aqueous {{contents}} from vesicles as {{a result}} of <b>lysis,</b> fusion or physiological permeability can be detected fluorometrically using low molecular weight soluble tracers.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} distinction {{here is that}} between the two decisions; lysogeny and <b>lysis</b> on infection, and continuing lysogeny or <b>lysis</b> from a prophage. The latter is determined solely by the activation of RecA in the SOS response of the cell, as detailed in the section on induction. The former will also be affected by this; a cell undergoing an SOS response will always be lysed, as no cI protein {{will be allowed to}} build up. However, the initial lytic/lysogenic decision on infection is also dependent on the cII and cIII proteins.|$|E
25|$|Phage-ligand {{technology}} {{makes use}} of proteins, which are identified from bacteriophages, characterized and recombinantly expressed for various applications such as binding of bacteria and bacterial components (e.g. endotoxin) and <b>lysis</b> of bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Phages may be {{released}} via cell <b>lysis,</b> by extrusion, or, {{in a few}} cases, by budding. <b>Lysis,</b> by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called endolysin, which attacks and breaks down the cell wall peptidoglycan. An altogether different phage type, the filamentous phages, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain Mycoplasma phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a lysogenic cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as prophage.|$|E
25|$|Rightward {{transcription}} {{expresses the}} O, P and Q genes. O and P {{are responsible for}} initiating replication, and Q is another antiterminator that allows the expression of head, tail, and <b>lysis</b> genes from PR’.|$|E
25|$|Unlike lytic {{replication}} {{for many}} other viruses, EBV lytic replication does not inevitably lead to <b>lysis</b> of the host cell because EBV virions are produced by budding from the infected cell. Lytic proteins include gp350 and gp110.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{bacterial}} {{variants of}} phospholipase C are characterized {{into one of}} four groups of structurally related proteins. The toxic phospholipases C are capable of interacting with eukaryotic cell membranes and hydrolyzing phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, ultimately leading to cell <b>lysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Blood {{agar plates}} (BAPs) contain {{mammalian}} blood (usually sheep or horse), typically at {{a concentration of}} 5–10%. BAPs are enriched, differential media used to isolate fastidious organisms and detect hemolytic activity. β-Hemolytic activity will show <b>lysis</b> and complete digestion of red blood cell contents surrounding a colony. Examples include Streptococcus haemolyticus. α-Hemolysis will only cause partial <b>lysis</b> of the red blood cells (the cell membrane is left intact) and will appear green or brown, due to the conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. An example {{of this would be}} Streptococcus viridans. γ-Hemolysis (or nonhemolytic) is the term referring to a lack of hemolytic activity. BAPs also contain meat extract, tryptone, sodium chloride, and agar.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} P. aeruginosa uses an exoenzyme, ExoU, which degrades {{the plasma}} membrane of eukaryotic cells, leading to <b>lysis.</b> Increasingly, {{it is becoming}} recognized that the iron-acquiring siderophore, pyoverdine, also functions as a toxin by removing iron from mitochondria, inflicting damage on this organelle.|$|E
25|$|Oocysts {{are passed}} in the feces of an {{infected}} definitive host. The oocyst undergoes sporogony creating two sporocysts. Once this is complete the oocyst itself undergoes <b>lysis</b> releasing the sporocysts into the environment. Sporocysts typically contain 4 sporozoites and measure 15-19 by 8-10 micrometres.|$|E
25|$|Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) can {{be caused}} by tumor <b>lysis</b> {{syndrome}} and also due direct effects of drug clearance by the kidneys. Different drugs will affect different parts of the kidney and the toxicity may be asymptomatic (only seen on blood or urine tests) or may cause acute renal failure.|$|E
25|$|Operons {{are also}} found in viruses such as bacteriophages. For example, T7 phages have two operons. The first operon codes for various products, {{including}} a special T7 RNA polymerase which can bind to and transcribe the second operon. The second operon includes a <b>lysis</b> gene meant to cause the host cell to burst.|$|E
25|$|Other: TCT, {{bleeding}} time, mixing test (whether an abnormality corrects if the patient's plasma {{is mixed}} with normal plasma), coagulation factor assays, antiphospholipid antibodies, D-dimer, genetic tests (e.g. factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation G20210A), dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT), miscellaneous platelet function tests, thromboelastography (TEG or Sonoclot), euglobulin <b>lysis</b> time (ELT).|$|E
25|$|The late {{phase of}} the {{adenovirus}} lifecycle is focused on producing sufficient quantities of structural protein to pack all the genetic material produced by DNA replication. Once the viral components have successfully been replicated, the virus is assembled into its protein shells and released from the cell {{as a result of}} virally induced cell <b>lysis.</b>|$|E
