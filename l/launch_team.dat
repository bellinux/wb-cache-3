25|$|At T-31 seconds, {{just before}} Atlantis's {{computers}} {{were supposed to}} take control of the flight, the launch countdown clock stopped. This was because of a lack of an indication that the Gaseous Oxygen Vent Arm had retracted and properly latched, a problem that had never occurred during previous launches in the program's history. Soon the <b>launch</b> <b>team</b> was able to verify the Vent Arm's position with the help of a closed circuit camera, and the countdown clock resumed after approximately 2 minutes, 18 seconds.|$|E
25|$|While Canada was {{the third}} country to build a {{satellite}} which was launched into space, it was launched aboard an American rocket from an American spaceport. The same goes for Australia, who launched first satellite involved a donated U.S. Redstone rocket and American support staff {{as well as a}} joint launch facility with the United Kingdom. The first Italian satellite San Marco 1 launched on 15 December 1964 on a U.S. Scout rocket from Wallops Island (Virginia, United States) with an Italian <b>launch</b> <b>team</b> trained by NASA. By similar occasions, almost all further first national satellites was launched by foreign rockets.|$|E
25|$|On 12 October 2010, the STS-133 crew {{arrived at}} the Kennedy Space Center to conduct the Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test (TCDT). The TCDT {{consisted}} of training for both the crew and the <b>launch</b> <b>team</b> that simulated the final hours up until launch. During the TCDT, the crew went {{through a number of}} exercises that included rescue training and a launch day simulation that included everything that would happen on launch day – except the launch. Commander Steve Lindsey and Pilot Eric Boe also performed abort landings and other flight aspects in the Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA). For the TCDT, the crew also received a briefing from NASA engineers, outlining the work that had been carried out on Discovery during the STS-133 processing flow. After successfully completing all the TCDT tasks, the crew returned to the Johnson Space Center on 15 October 2010.|$|E

25|$|The first launch {{attempt was}} delayed by 24 hours due to weather concerns, {{including}} multiple weather violations in NASA's launch rules beginning over 2 {{hours before the}} scheduled launch. During the second attempt on Wednesday morning, {{a problem with a}} LH2 fill-and-drain fuel valve inside Discoverys aft compartment led to another scrubbing. The problem arose when sensors did not detect the closure of the valve when commanded to do so. The issue was thought to be with the sensors rather than the valve itself. After inerting the orbiter's tank, which involved draining it, tests were conducted on the valves. Despite the valves working normally, another delay was called for to have more confidence in the system, and to give the console operators who performed the test some rest. The <b>launch</b> <b>team</b> evaluated the issue, passing on a possible launch window on 27 August 2009 at 01:10 EDT. The launch was delayed until 23:59 EDT, 28 August 2009, to allow the engineers to be fully satisfied with the vehicle. Later the mission was cleared for launch which involved a flight rule waiver for cycling the valve and a discussion to analyze the test failure of an Ares-1 booster that was similar to the SRBs used for the mission. NASA feared another delay when storms formed near the Kennedy Space Center on 28 August 2009, but the weather cleared in time for a successful launch of Discovery at 23:59 EDT.|$|E

2500|$|Discovery later {{rolled out}} from the VAB to Launch Complex 39A on 4 August 2009, in a slow drive {{on the top of}} the Crawler-transporter. The [...] rollout began at 02:07 EDT, and ended with the launch {{platform}} secured in place at about 13:50 EDT. The move took longer than expected due to adverse weather conditions, which included lightning warnings. The crawler also had to pause occasionally so mud could be removed from its treads and bearings. Technicians then quickly prepared the shuttle to host the crew’s countdown dress rehearsal known as the Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test (TCDT). Discovery’s seven astronauts flew to Kennedy on 5 August 2009 for the training activity which concludes later in the week with a complete practice countdown, minus liftoff, involving the crew and the <b>launch</b> <b>team.</b> Meanwhile, in an unprecedented operation, modifications were made to the left Solid rocket booster on the pad. The modifications involved replacement of a check valve filter assembly in the booster which was found to have broken. In a potentially delaying factor, in depth testing of the external tank with X-ray revealed voids in the foam which might have formed during the injection molding of the foam. This has also been decided as a suspect factor in the foam shedding during STS-127. The air in the voids could have expanded due to the high temperatures generated during ascent thus breaking the foam. The reviews considered a rollback as an option since the defect could not be set right in the pad. Later, the tank was cleared for launch as is without any additional inspections.|$|E
