50|$|Recently, an {{alternative}} mechanism to regulate differentiation {{has been proposed}} in addition to inhibition through growth factors. Changes in <b>local</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of neural stem cells {{have been shown to}} modulate the differentiation capacity of growth factors. Over developmental time, neural stem cells lose the ability to respond to growth factors that influence differentiation as intrinsic changes occur to receptor structure and function of these cells. It has been shown Notch receptors require 50-fold higher concentrations of ligand effectors to initiate differentiation responses similar to that of developmentally earlier neural stem cells. Decrease in sensitivity of Notch receptors reduces the activity of Notch-signaling required for gliogenesis to occur. Consequently, neural stem cells have developed a general mechanism limiting further differentiation after intense specialization during the early developmental periods.|$|E

A nonlinearity measure N is introduced which relates the shape of the classification function to the generalization capability of a classifier.

Moreover N shows to be a predictor for the <b>local</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of a classifier.

We consider an alternative to utility maximization, similar to the “good-deal ” pricing framework in incomplete markets. We perform a dynamic riskreward analysis for a family of non-self-financing strategies of practical importance: deterministic time hedging; i. e., hedging at predetermined, fixed, times. In the limit of small relative transaction costs, we carry out the asymptotic analysis and find that transaction costs affect the hedge ratios and that the time between trades is related in a simple way to the <b>local</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the replication target.

40|$|Robustness {{has always}} been an {{important}} element of the foundation of Statistics. However, it has only been in recent decades that {{attempts have been made to}} formalize the problem beyond ad hoc measures towards a theory of robustness. Robustness studies also have recently received considerable interest among Bayesians. Robust Bayesian analysis is the study of the sensitivity of Bayesian answers to uncertain inputs. These uncertain inputs are typically the model, prior distribution, or loss function, or some combination. Based on this reason, in this thesis we study the Bayesian robustness analysis for those typical uncertain inputs using different measures. In addition, the sensitivity analysis or the robustness issues in Bayesian inference can be classified into two broad categories: global and <b>local</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> In this thesis, we will mostly concentrate on the <b>local</b> <b>sensitivity</b> analysis for the prior and the likelihood to investigate the effects of perturbations.

In this work, the <b>local</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the conversion and derivative conversion {{with respect to the}} frequency factor, the logarithm of the frequency factor, the activation energy and the reaction order for the first and nth order kinetic models are calculated by using the finite difference method. The results show that the sensitivities of the first and nth order kinetic models with respect to the activation energy and the logarithm of the frequency factor are significant, while the frequency factor and the reaction order affect the nth order kinetic model slightly. Compared with the frequency factor, the natural logarithm of the frequency factor is a better choice in the parameter estimation of the first and nth order kinetic models.
