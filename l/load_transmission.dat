50|$|The ulnar {{variance}} {{influences the}} amount of load that is transmitted through the distal ulna. The <b>load</b> <b>transmission</b> is directly proportional to this ulnar variance. In neutral ulnar variance, approximately 20 percent of the load is transmitted. With negative ulnar variance, the load across the TFC is decreased. This occurs during supination, because the radius moves distally on the ulna and creates a negative ulnar variance. With positive ulnar variance it is reversed. The load that is transmitted across the TFC is then increased. This positive ulnar variance occurs during pronation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present the}} design and {{implementation}} of a pe-riodically <b>loaded</b> <b>transmission</b> line, which simultaneously exhibits negative refractive index (NRI) and negative group delay (and, hence, negative group velocity). This is achieved by <b>loading</b> the <b>transmission</b> line in series with capacitors and RLC resonators and in shunt with inductors. We discuss the dispersion characteristics of such a medium and identify the frequency bands of NRI and negative group delay. The structures are theoretically studied using S-parameters simulations on truncated <b>loaded</b> <b>transmission</b> lines of different lengths, and the predicted results are compared to the measured scattering parameters of such lines printed on circuit boards using coplanar waveguide technology.

50|$|The {{discipline}} of biomimetics applies the information gained {{by comparing the}} foot morphology {{of a variety of}} terrestrial vertebrates to human-engineering problems. For instance, it may provide insights that make it possible to alter the foot's <b>load</b> <b>transmission</b> in people who wear an external orthosis because of paralysis from spinal-cord injury, or who use a prosthesis following the diabetes-related amputation of a leg. Such knowledge can be incorporated in technology that improves a person's balance when standing; enables them to walk more efficiently, and to exercise; or otherwise enhances their quality of life by improving their mobility.|$|E
5000|$|High-voltage {{direct current}} (HVDC) systems {{are used for}} bulk {{transmission}} of energy from distant generating stations or for interconnection of separate alternating-current systems. These HVDC systems use electronic devices like mercury-arc valves, thyristors or IGBTs that were unavailable during the War of Currents era. Power is still converted to and from alternating current at {{each side of the}} modern HVDC link. The advantages of HVDC over AC systems for bulk transmission include higher power ratings for a given line (important since installing new lines and even upgrading old ones is extremely expensive) and better control of power flows, especially in transient and emergency conditions that can often lead to blackouts. Many modern plants now use HVDC as an alternative to AC systems for long distance, high <b>load</b> <b>transmission,</b> especially in developing countries such as Russia, China, India and Brazil. One of the principal advantages is the ability to transfer power between two AC systems that are not in synchronized phase. (See List of HVDC projects for more details.) ...|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} has been developed by the authors to estimate the load share of worm gear drives, and to calculate the instantaneous tooth meshing stiffness and <b>loaded</b> <b>transmission</b> errors. In the approach, the finite element (FE) modelling {{is based on the}} modified tooth geometry, which ensures that the worm gear teeth are in localized contact. The geometric modelling method for involute worm gears allows the tooth elastic deformation and tooth root stresses of worm gear drives under different load conditions to be investigated. On the basis of finite element analysis, the instantaneous meshing stiffness and <b>loaded</b> <b>transmission</b> errors are obtained and the load share is predicted.

40|$|We have {{simulated}} {{and constructed}} a one-dimensional metamaterial {{composed of a}} periodically <b>loaded</b> <b>transmission</b> line that exhibits both negative and positive group velocities in a band of effective negative index of refraction. The negative group velocity or, equivalently, the negative group delay, is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally in the time domain using modulated Gaussian pulses. Due to this negative delay, we can show an output pulse peak emerging from the <b>loaded</b> <b>transmission</b> line prior to the input peak entering the line, i. e., the output pulse precedes the input pulse. The fact that this surprising behavior does not violate the requirements of relativistic causality is illustrated with time-domain simulations, which show that discontinuities in the pulse waveforms are traveling at exactly {{the speed of light}} in vacuum. The pulse-reshaping mechanism underlying this behavior is also illustrated using time-domain simulations...|$|R
40|$|Nonlinearly <b>loaded</b> {{lossless}} <b>transmission</b> lines {{inside a}} rectangular cavity are studied using the left- and right-hand Green's {{functions of the}} problem in time domain. These Green's functions are developed for a transmission line with quasi-matched loads. This ensures Green's functions of a short duration. Therefore, the amount of frequency data necessary to obtain time-domain Green's functions is quite limited. The time-domain Green's functions are finally convolved with the left- and right-hand line voltages. With this technique it is possible to treat arbitrarily <b>loaded</b> <b>transmission</b> lines in resonators.

40|$|Objective To {{design a}} cadaveric model for AO type C 3 {{fracture}} of distal radius and {{to evaluate the}} axial <b>load</b> <b>transmission</b> pattern on the model fixed with dorsal plating. Methods A cadaveric model for biomechanical study on fixation methods for AO type C 3 fractures of distal radius was designed and produced, and its efficacy was assessed. Results 100 N axial load was found to produce only a 1 to 2 mm axial shortening in the intact specimen, and the deformation was elastic. The axial <b>load</b> <b>transmission</b> through intact radius was 83. 82 %of the total distal axial load. A model of uniform AO type C 3 distal radius fracture was successfully created in seven cadaveric forearms. After fixation of the fracture with dorsal plating, axial <b>load</b> <b>transmission</b> through radius was 75. 64 %of the total distal axial load. Conclusion A standardized AO type C 3 fracture of distal radius can be reproduced with good reproducibility of the setup and results of this model. The results suggest that dorsal plating can not totally restore the axial loading transmission pattern of normal radius with 100 N axial load. 目的設計一個C 3 型橈骨遠端骨折尸骨模型并評估其有效性。方法設計并制作一個C 3 型橈骨遠端骨折尸骨模型,并用其評估背側鋼板固定橈骨遠端骨折的生物力學特性。結果在完整標本上 100 N縱向負荷僅使橈骨產生 1 ～ 2 mm彈性變,其中橈骨傳遞 83. 82 %的負荷。在 7 具標本上成功制作C 3 型橈骨遠端骨折模型,用背側鋼板固定骨折后,發現橈骨傳遞 75. 64 %的負荷。結論本研究成功制作可重復性好的C 3 型橈骨遠端骨折尸骨模型,生物力學測試提示在 100 N縱向負荷下,背側鋼板固定不能完全重建橈骨遠端骨折的力學性能...|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveKnee {{instability}} and joint <b>loading</b> <b>transmission</b> are two important biomechanical factors {{in subjects with}} knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, {{the relationship between these}} factors in a rehabilitation treatment remains unclear. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the responsiveness of a new three-dimensional (3 D) acceleration method used as an estimation of knee {{instability and}} joint <b>loading</b> <b>transmission</b> during gait in OA subjects after a rehabilitation treatment. MethodTwenty-four subjects with medial knee OA were included in this study. They had clinical and gait evaluations before and after 12 weeks of treatment. 3 D linear knee accelerations, quadriceps and hamstring isometric strength and Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain were quantified, and compared between both evaluations. Nine asymptomatic subjects participated in this study for gait comparison. ResultsA significant reduction of the anterior posterior (AP) knee acceleration peak (P= 0. 02) had been detected after the treatment. No difference for both distal and lateral knee accelerations peak was found. A significant increase in quadriceps (P< 0. 001) and hamstring (P= 0. 006) strength was seen after treatment. The WOMAC of pain had shown significant reduction after the treatment (P< 0. 001). ConclusionThe present study demonstrates that the estimation of knee acceleration parameters is sensitive to changes in knee OA gait after a rehabilitation treatment. This study also indicates that a treatment of 3 months which combines therapeutic and exercises program could have benefits on knee OA by increasing AP knee stability and stabilize joint <b>loading</b> <b>transmission</b> during gait...|$|R
