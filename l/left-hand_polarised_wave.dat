In the present contribution we discuss investigations on electron whistler <b>waves,</b> right-hand <b>polarised</b> electromagnetic <b>waves</b> in the frequency range ω ci ce, and ion whistler <b>waves,</b> <b>left-hand</b> <b>polarised</b> electromagnetic <b>waves</b> below the ion cyclotron frequency ω ci. Firstly, the dispersion behaviour of electron {{whistler waves}} is studied at wavelength up to the plasma dimensions. For smaller wavelengths {{it turns out that the}} dispersion relation derived for unbounded whistler waves describes the experimental observations well. For wavelengths greater than the vacuum vessel diameter it is necessary to take the boundary into account. The transition between the two regimes is studied for constant plasma conditions. Secondly, ion whistler waves are considered. In a single-component plasma, the wave dispersion has a real solution only for frequencies below the ion cyclotron frequency ω ci. In a multicomponent plasma, the dispersion relation of ion whistler waves exhibit a different behaviour. In an intermediate frequency regime located between the two neighbouring ion cyclotron frequencies, the wave has a maximum group velocity. This feature is used as a diagnostic tool in satellite measurements to determine the ion composition in atmospheric plasmas, but the results have been subject of a scientific debate. Our laboratory study shows first results on ion whistler wave measurements and aims to contribute to clarify the discussed discrepancies...|$|R

These inclusions consist of cavity backed apertures, located at an arbitrary {{distance from the}} edge of the wedge.

By resorting to a particular formulation of the equivalence principle, which implies covering the apertures with metallic plates, the original issue is divided into an exterior problem (perfectly conducting wedge) and a number of interior problems equal to that of the apertures. The exterior canonical problem is formulated by exploiting the exact perfectly conducting wedge Green's function or its asymptotic approximation. The more involved interior problems are treated by employing the finite element method. The solutions are then joined by enforcing the continuity condition of the fields at each aperture opening. The problem of nonphysical interior resonances is addressed. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the technique...|$|R

A description is given of some alternative methods of treating the scattering problem, with particular reference to the application of Green's function to the single cylinder and its application to the plane grating. The literature concerned with multiple grating configurations is also surveyed. A polarisation cascade matrix is derived which describes the transmission of a normally incident elliptically <b>polarised</b> <b>wave</b> through a grating of parallel wires whose angle is arbitrary. The terms of the matrix contain the well-established complex reflection and transmission coefficients for a linearly <b>polarised</b> plane <b>wave</b> incident upon a grating.

The product of a series of matrices representing a series of gratings whose wires are at different angles to a fixed direction gives the total complex transmission and reflection coefficients. The results are shown to be in agreement with previously published work on a double grating system and experimentally verified for configurations of two and five gratings. These results confirm that such a series of gratings can be used to design either broad-band polarisation rotators for linear polarization, or broad-band circular or elliptical polarisers or analysers. A sharp resonance reflection condition when gratings are separated by approximately half a wavelength can also be used in the design of frequency filters...|$|R

To explain the presence of only one 8. 44 GHz pulse per period, we analyse the case of auroral radio emission limited only to a magnetospheric sector activated by an external body, like the case of the interaction of Jupiter with its moons.
