5|$|At {{the start}} of John's reign {{there was a sudden}} change in prices, as bad harvests and high demand for food {{resulted}} in much higher prices for grain and animals. This inflationary pressure was to continue {{for the rest of the}} 13th century and had <b>long-term</b> <b>economic</b> consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns. It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs. At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy. The result was political unrest across the country. John attempted to address some of the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.|$|E

California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Stephen Pollard, Dang TranDeveloping Countries, <b>Economic</b> <b>Long-term</b> Growth, <b>Economic</b> Openness, OECD, Regional Economics, Spatial EconomicsRegional {{economics}} is topic that has recently faded with {{increased levels of}} globalization causing many {{to think that the}} world is 'flat' and opportunities for economic success are equal for all countries. The aim of this thesis is to test whether region has an impact on <b>long-term</b> growth and <b>economic</b> trade openness for countries across the globe. After gathering panel data for 150 countries for the years 2002 to 2009, it was concluded that region has a significant impact on both variables. Policies and laws developed to promote economic growth and increase trade should differ for countries, depending on what region they are located in. Some regions are drastically ahead of others.

25|$|The OPEC {{oil embargo}} marked a <b>long-term</b> <b>economic</b> {{transition}} since, {{for the first}} time, energy prices skyrocketed, and American factories faced serious competition from foreign automobiles, clothing, electronics, and consumer goods. By the late 1970s the economy suffered an energy crisis, slow economic growth, high unemployment, and very high inflation coupled with high interest rates (the term stagflation was coined). Since economists agreed on the wisdom of deregulation, many of the New Deal era regulations were ended, such as in transportation, banking, and telecommunications.|$|E
