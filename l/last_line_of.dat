5|$|The text is {{presented}} in six stanzas of nine lines each. It is in bar form, three lines form the Stollen, three the Abgesang, with the meter 6.6.5.6.6.5.7.8.6. The <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the last stanza repeats {{the first line of}} the first stanza. The song is written in the first person, addressing Jesus.|$|E
5|$|Initially a {{force of}} a dozen men {{under the auspices of}} the SA, the Schutzstaffel (SS) grew to become one of the largest and most {{powerful}} groups in Nazi Germany. Led by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler from 1929, the SS had over a quarter million members by 1938 and continued to grow. Himmler envisioned the SS as being an elite group of guards, Hitler's <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defence. The Waffen-SS, the military branch of the SS, became a de facto fourth branch of the Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, von Pahlen's Corps {{attacked}} forts 23 and 24, and the Polish {{position at}} the Evangelical Cemetery. Heavy fighting followed, and many Russian commanders, including Paskevich, proposed that further fighting be postponed until the following day. General von Toll insisted on reaching the <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> Polish defences before sunset. The surrounding forts changed hands many times, {{but in the end}} most of them remained in Russian hands by 22:00, when the Russians broke off. Around midnight General Berg arrived in Warsaw with a new ultimatum signed by Paskevich.|$|E

5|$|The chord pattern differs little {{throughout}} the song. On guitar, {{it consists of}} the chords (played with a capo at the fifth fret) of B minor 7, F minor, A minor 7, F, C, E sus. 7 and E7. A variation from this sequence occurs during the repeated <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> each second verse, {{with the addition of}} the chords D7/F and F major 7.|$|E
5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are the <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E
5|$|When an {{aircraft}} carrier deploys, it takes a Strike Group, made up of several other warships and supply vessels which allow the operation to be carried out. The armament of the Nimitz class is made up only of short range defensive weapons, used as a <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense against enemy missiles and aircraft. An aircraft carrier, as with all surface ships, is particularly vulnerable to attack from below, specifically from submarines. An aircraft carrier is a very expensive, hard to replace and strategically valuable asset and therefore logically has a huge target value.|$|E

5|$|Breaking out {{of their}} newly {{established}} bridgehead west of the Canal at {{the northern end of}} the Great Bitter Lake, the IDF launched an offensive from Deversoir toward Ismailia. A combined force of Egyptian paratroopers and commandos fought a delaying battle, falling back upon defensive positions further north under increasing pressure from IDF infantry and armor. By October 22, they were occupying a <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense, including positions along the Ismailia canal. Though outnumbered, they repulsed a final Israeli effort to capture the city; a United Nations ceasefire was then imposed, bringing the battle to an end. The Egyptians registered a tactical and strategic victory in the defense of Ismailia, stopping an encirclement of their large forces on the east bank of the Suez Canal and ensuring their supply lines remained open.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a request from the New Zealand government, Barrowclough was nominated by Freyberg for command of the Pacific Section of 2NZEF, which was based in Fiji. With the entry of Imperial Japan into the war, this was an important command as Fiji was the <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defence for mainland New Zealand. Barrowclough embarked for New Zealand in early 1942 but during his transit, the commanding officer of the Pacific Section became seriously ill and was invalided home to be immediately replaced by Major General Owen Mead. On Barrowclough's arrival in New Zealand, he was disappointed to find that his expected command was no longer available. He was eventually posted as {{the commander of the}} Northern Division with the rank of major general. He was responsible for the defence of the upper North Island, and {{for the next few months}} oversaw the reorganisation and training of his new command.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{soldiers}} marched from Shanghai to Nanking at a breakneck pace, rapidly defeating {{pockets of}} Chinese resistance. By December 9 {{they had reached}} the <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense, the Fukuo Line, behind which lay Nanking's fortified walls. On December 10 Matsui ordered an all-out attack on Nanking, and after less than two days of intense fighting Chiang decided to abandon the city. Before fleeing, Tang ordered his men to launch a concerted breakout of the Japanese siege, but by this time Nanking was largely surrounded and its defenses were at the breaking point. Most of Tang's units simply collapsed, their soldiers often casting off their weapons and uniforms in {{the streets in the}} hopes of hiding among the city's civilian population.|$|E

5|$|Master Chief first {{appears in}} the games as the protagonist of Halo: Combat Evolved and the 2003 novelization, Halo: The Flood. During the opening {{cinematic}} of Halo: Combat Evolved, the Chief is awakened from cryonic sleep. Upon exiting slipspace, the Pillar of Autumn is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on Halo, a ring-shaped megastructure. Master Chief escapes the ship via an escape pod. Upon landing on Halo, his first task is to find other survivors. While fighting the Covenant, Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race, the Forerunners, as a <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense against an alien parasite called the Flood. The Covenant accidentally release the Flood, which begins to spread across the ring. At {{the request of the}} installation's resident AI 343 Guilty Spark, Master Chief retrieves the Index, a device used to activate Halo's defenses and eliminate the Flood. However, Guilty Spark neglects to inform the Master Chief that Halo would accomplish this by destroying all sentient life in a vast radius, essentially starving the Flood to death. Cortana intervenes to prevent the activation of Halo. She and the Master Chief destroy it by detonating the Pillar of Autumns fusion reactor core. The Master Chief and Cortana escape in a Longsword spacecraft, believing they are the only survivors.|$|E
5|$|The main access {{route to}} Ollantaytambo runs along a narrow valley {{formed in the}} {{mountains}} by the Urubamba River, which connects the site with Machu Picchu {{to the west and}} with Pisaq and Cusco to the east. After his uprising, Manco Inca fortified the eastern approaches to fend off attacks from the former Inca capital, now under Spanish occupation. The first line of defense was a steep bank of terraces at Pachar, near the confluence of the Anta and Urubamba rivers. Behind it, the Incas channeled the Urubamba to make it cross the valley from right to left and back thus forming two more lines backed by the fortifications of Choqana on the left bank and 'Inkapintay on the right bank. Past them, at the plain of Mascabamba, eleven high terraces closed the valley between the mountains and a deep canyon formed by the Urubamba. The only way to continue was through the gate of T'iyupunku, a thick defensive wall with two narrow doorways. In the event of these fortifications being overrun, the Temple Hill, a religious center surrounded by high terraces overlooking Ollantaytambo, provided a <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins in}} orbit above planet Reach, as {{humanity}} fights the Covenant invasion forces. The <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense {{for the planet}} is an array of magnetic accelerator cannons (MACs) orbiting the planet. The Master Chief sends a team of Spartans {{to the surface of}} Reach to protect the MAC's planet-based power generators. Ultimately, the Covenant are able to destroy the generators and begin bombarding the planet's surface - melting its surface to glass ('glassing the planet'). The surviving Spartans flee underground to the hidden headquarters of the Office of Naval Intelligence. There they meet Dr. Halsey who, with help of some of the surviving Spartans, uncovers a strange crystalline shard in a cavern built by the ancient Forerunners. Pursued by the Covenant, the Spartans retrieve the shard and collapse the passage behind them, which saves them from the pursuing Covenant forces, but also traps them deep under the surface of Reach.|$|E

25|$|Originally, a full-back was the <b>last</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defence, but as {{the game}} {{developed}} in the early 20th century, the centre-half role was dropped backwards and {{came to be known}} as 'centre-back', and the full-backs were then pushed out wider to create the right-back and left-back positions.|$|E
