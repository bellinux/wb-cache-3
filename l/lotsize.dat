40|$|The paper investigates an EPL (Economic Production <b>Lotsize)</b> {{model in}} an {{imperfect}} production {{system in which}} the production facility may shift from an 'in-control' state to an 'out-of-control' state at any random time. The basic assumption of the classical EPL model is that 100 % of produced items are perfect quality. This assumption may not be valid for most of the production environments. More specifically, the paper extends the article of Khouja and Mehrez [Khouja, M., Mehrez, A., 1994. An economic production lot size model with imperfect quality and variable production rate. Journal of the Operational Research Society 45, 1405 - 1417]. Generally, the manufacturing process is 'in-control' state at the starting of the production and produced items are of conforming quality. In long-run process, the process shifts from the 'in-control' state to the 'out-of-control' state after certain time due to higher production rate and production-run-time. The proposed model is formulated assuming that a certain percent of total product is defective (imperfect), in 'out-of-control' state. This percentage also varies with production rate and production-run time. The defective items are restored in original quality by reworked at some costs to maintain the quality of products in a competitive market. The production cost per unit item is convex function of production rate. The total costs in this investment model include manufacturing cost, setup cost, holding cost and reworking cost of imperfect quality products. The associated profit maximization problem is illustrated by numerical examples and also its sensitivity analysis is carried out.

40|$|Complex {{manufacturing}} Systems can be decomposed in {{a network}} of simpler single stage production systems. The cycle time of jobs consists of the raw process time and the time the jobs wait {{in front of the}} machine. The cause for waiting is the variability of the single stage systems. Two different sources of variability can be distinguished random variation and controllable variation. This thesis deals with the second source of variation and quantifies the effects on the cycle time using queueing models. A closed formula was found describing the relationship between the average <b>lotsize,</b> the minimal cycle time and the influencing parameters like the productive utilization and the variability of the system. This formula supports a better understanding how the parameter determine the optimal <b>lotsize</b> and the minimal cycle time. The effect of dispatch rules reducing the overall setup time can be quantified using an algorithm developed in this thesis. Now systems can be evaluated having non-exponential interarrival and services times. The dispatch rules do not assume a cyclic priority pattern but account for state probabilities. Single stage production systems with multiple (alternative) tools are common in real world environments. These alternative tools support the routing flexibility of jobs. Alternative tools where the individual tools differ with respect to the production speed and the dedication of jobs to tools can be evaluated with an algorithm based on a simple open queueing network. The algorithm accounts for the different loading and the variability of the alternative tools due to different lotsizes in contrast to classical optimization approaches where load-independent assingment probabilities are assumed. An open field of research is the case of inhomogenous alterantive tools sharing a common buffer. This thesis shows the impact of the inhomogenity on the cycle time using a simple two tools single stage production system. (orig.)

40|$|The subject {{dealt with}} in this thesis is the {{development}} of a procedure suitable for practical application aiming at the improved organization and planning of production processes, in particular of production logistics. The procedure developed contributes to harmonizing the company's own requirements of a steady utilization of capacity and low capital tie-up - and thus reduced volumes of in-process inventories and of products in stock - with the customers' requirements of strict adherence to due dates and short delivery periods. The focus of this approach is on the optimization of lot sizes, since these have a substantial influence on throughput times and inventories. This optimization is achieved under consideration of dynamic system performance and the system interactions, such as for instance the competition of the jobs for production equipment or capacity restrictions. The approach for lot size planning presented is based on a model representing in-process inventories and costs. On the basis of an initial solution, which comprises the lot sizes of all the products which can be manufactured, the corresponding inventories are modelled using a queueing model of the underlying manufacturing system. These inventories are taken into account together with the lot sizes, when costs are assessed by means of suitable cost functions. The optimization algorithm changes the combination of the lot sizes considered ('lotsize vector'), so as to reduce the costs depending on the new <b>lotsize</b> combination. For this purpose the gradient search method is used. The sequence 'assessment of inventories - assessment of costs - adjustment of the <b>lotsize</b> vector' is repeated until a cost minimum has been found. In order to represent system performance, modelling based on queueing theory is applied which is to be preferred to discrete, event-oriented simulation because it provides an approach for the explanation of system performance and because of its superior computing performance accompanied by a neglible loss of accuracy. Finally the procedure is illustrated by a practical example. (orig.)

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{functions}} of an MRP system is to issue rescheduling messages that urge the planner tospeed up or slow down open orders. It seems in practice that these messages are not used at all by planners.

Reschedule-out messages are usually ignored because planners {{do not see the}} value of the message. Other reasons for not adhering to rescheduling messages are a lack of maintenance of MRP parameters or simply the wrong use of the MRP function. In the future, MRP rescheduling functionality will be used even less than today, due to the changing role of MRP within the planning framework. With the uprise of finite capacity scheduling packages, MRP is being pushed one level upward in the planning hierarchy.

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the production and}} inventory management problem of a two-stage semi-process production system. In case both production stages are physically connected {{it is obvious that}} materials are forced to flow. The economic <b>lotsize</b> depends on the holding cost of the end-product and the combined change-over cost of both production stages. On the other hand this 'flow shop' is forced to produce at the speed of the slowest stage. The benefit of this approach is the low amount of Work In Process inventory. When on the other hand, the involved stages are physically disconnected, a stock of intermediates acts as a decoupling point. Typically for the semi-process industry are high change-over costs for the process oriented first stage, which results in large <b>lotsize</b> differences for the different production stages. Using the stock of intermediates as a decoupling point avoids the complexity of synchronising operations but is an additional reason to augment the intermediate stock position. The disadvantage of this model is the high amount of Work-In-Process inventory. This paper proposes the 'synchronised planning model' realising a global optimum instead of the combination of two locally optimised settings. The mathematical model proves (for a two-stage single-product setting) that the optimal two-stage production frequency corresponds with the single EOQ solution for the first stage. A sensitivity study reveals, within these two-stage lotsizing models, the economical cost dependency on product and change-over cost ratio‟s. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to understand under which conditions the „joined setup‟ or the „two-stage individual eoq model‟ remain close to the optimal model. Numerical examples prove that the conclusions about the optimal settings remain valid when extending the model to a two-stage multi-product setting. The research reveals that two-stage individually optimized EOQ lotsizing should only be used when the end-product stage has a high added value and small change-over costs, compared to the first stage. Physically connected operations should be used when the end-product stage has a small added value and low change-over costs, or high added value and large change-over costs compared to the first production stage. The paper concludes with suggesting a practical common cycle approach to tackle a two-stage multi-product production and inventory management problem.
