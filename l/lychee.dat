25|$|<b>Lychee</b> giant stink bugs, Tessaratoma papillosa, are {{destructive}} pests of <b>lychee</b> trees (Litchi chinensis) in China. They also {{feed on the}} {{closely related}} Sapindaceae fruit trees like longan (Dimocarpus longan) and rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum).

50|$|Zhumadian was {{previously}} known as Yicheng, for {{it used to}} be a relay station. In the Tang Dynasty, the emperor ordered his soldiers carry <b>lychees</b> from Guangdong to his charming princess Yang who loved to eat <b>lychees.</b> And Zhumadian was one of the relay stations.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the feeding behaviour ofRousettus leschenaulti Desmarest, 1820 on <b>lychees,</b> the preferred cultivated food of this bat in captive conditions. We found that feeding comprised 25 – 30 % {{of the total}} activity of these animals in a flight cage and that feeding durations {{were not significantly different}} between two sexes. To evaluate the role of odor and vision in foraging behaviour, we provided animals with artificial <b>lychees,</b> real <b>lychees</b> and artificial <b>lychees</b> soaked in the juice of real <b>lychees</b> and we recorded the number of feeding approaches to the different “fruit” types. The results indicated that bats approached real fruit significantly more than artificial fruit, and that the number of approaches to the soaked artificial fruit was also significantly higher than to the unsoaked artificial fruit. There {{were no significant differences between}} sexes in approach rates to any “fruit” type. We discuss the role of different sensory cues in the foraging behaviour of these bats and emphasize that the olfactory cue is important in detecting food resources and discriminating between different kinds of food items...|$|R

25|$|Musgraveia sulciventris is parasitized by the wasps Eupelmus poggioni and Telenomus spp.; Tessaratoma javanica by the wasps Anastatus colemani and Anastatus kashmirensis(?); and the <b>lychee</b> giant stink bug Tessaratoma papillosa by the wasps Ooencyrtus phongi, Anastatus spp. (particularly Anastatus japonicus), and Trissolcus spp. (particularly Trissolcus latisulcus).|$|E

25|$|In tessaratomids {{considered}} to be agricultural pests (like the Musgraveia sulciventris and Tessaratoma papillosa), the wasps that parasitize them are being studied as potential biological control agents. In the Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces of China, mass-reared Anastatus japonicus are being released to combat Tessaratoma papillosa pests in <b>lychee</b> and longan crops. The same measures are also reportedly being done in Thailand.|$|E

25|$|Lingnan garden (Jyutping: Ling5 naam5 jyun4 lam4; Traditional Chinese: 嶺南園林), or Cantonese garden, is {{the style}} of garden design native to the Lingnan region. Geographically, Lingnan has very {{different}} climate from China's heartland (i.e., Zhongyuan), resulting in her developing a different style in designing gardens. The most frequently cited traits of Lingnan gardens are: (1) they tend to surround their plants with buildings to provide protection to the plants, due to the frequent rainfalls and storms in the region; (2) Lingnan gardens usually use plant species native to the region, such as red cotton flowers and <b>lychee</b> trees; and (3) due to Lingnan being {{far away from the}} center of power (i.e., Zhongyuan), gardens in the region have historically been less bounded by royal standards, resulting in a style that leans more towards the common people, e.g., Lingnan gardens are decorated with a large amount of folk arts, ranging from sculptures to porcelains, and also tend to use smaller buildings.|$|E
