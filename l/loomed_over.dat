5|$|The Methodist {{movement}} was growing rapidly in pre-Civil War America, but was beset by disputes about slave-holding {{and the rule}} over the church by bishops, resulting in a formal split into two groups in 1844. The faction in favor of giving church authority to a hierarchy of bishops called themselves the Methodist Episcopal Church and took an anti-slavery stance in the north. Those in opposition formed the Methodist Protestant Church in the United States. As the impending Civil War <b>loomed</b> <b>over</b> {{the nation in the}} 1850s, local Towson Methodists continued to worship together at Epsom Chapel.|$|E
5|$|Blink-182 {{consisted}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, and by 2004 had {{been regarded as}} the most successful pop punk act of the time since the releases of Enema of the State (1999) and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). During its brief hiatus in 2002, DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back and collected several darker musical ideas he viewed unsuitable for the band; the ideas were used in supergroup Box Car Racer's self-titled album, recorded with assistance from Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy. Box Car Racer {{was intended as a}} one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band involving Barker. The side project would cause personal conflicts between DeLonge and Hoppus, the latter was {{not a member of the}} supergroup and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter on Box Car Racer was incorporated into the sound of Blink-182, who explored experimentalist elements on their eponymous fifth studio album (2003). After the success of Box Car Racer, DeLonge declined a solo recording deal offered by Geffen Records because he believed it would cast negative light on Blink-182, but it <b>loomed</b> <b>over</b> the band in addition to growing internal tension.|$|E
5|$|By 2004, Blink-182, {{consisting}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, had {{emerged as the}} biggest pop punk act of the era, releasing the seven-times-multiplatinum Enema of the State (1999) and number one album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back, during which time he collected several darker musical ideas he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them into a record, Box Car Racer. The album, recorded {{with the help of}} Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, was intended as a one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit. The side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter and music on Box Car Racer edged its way into the Blink sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, an eponymous fifth studio album (2003). Geffen Records, after the success of Box Car Racer, offered DeLonge a solo recording deal, which he declined, feeling that it would cast a negative shadow over the band. Nevertheless, the possible deal <b>loomed</b> <b>over</b> the band, contributing to internal tension.|$|E

25|$|The Second National Assembly {{embarked}} on passing legislation strengthening the economy. Unfortunately {{the cloud of}} the Second World War <b>loomed</b> <b>over</b> the horizon. Certain laws passed by the First National Assembly were modified or repealed to meet existing realities. A controversial immigration law that set an annual limit of 50 immigrants per country which affected mostly Chinese and Japanese nationals escaping the Sino-Japanese War was passed in 1940. Since the law bordered on foreign relations it required {{the approval of the}} U.S. President which was nevertheless obtained. When the result of the 1939 census was published, the National Assembly updated the apportionment of legislative districts, which became the basis for the 1941 elections.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there was}} 35 minutes for England to bat until stumps they survived with 10/0 as a stormcloud <b>loomed</b> <b>over</b> the ground. Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson were sending down three short balls an over and Umpire Bailhache {{told them they}} should bowl fuller, but the next ball was a Thommo bouncer and the umpire gave the English batsmen {{the benefit of the}} bad light. Ian Chappell complained about the umpire's {{interference}} as strictly speaking he could not tell the bowlers what to bowl and the ABC commentator Frank Tyson agreed. Brian Luckhurst edged Lillee (2/25) to Ian Chappell early the next morning leaving Dennis Amiss and John Edrich to bat, both of whom had broken bones in their hands from the first innings. Edrich took pain-killing injections in the drinks break, but was plainly out of sorts and was bowled by Thomson (6/46). Amiss received a brute of a ball from Thomson that he sent to Doug Walters at third slip. This brought Mike Denness and Keith Fletcher together at 40/3 and they resisted for an hour when the captain was taken by Walters off another Thommo thunderbolt, soon followed by Fletcher, caught by Greg Chappell off Terry Jenner (2/45) and Tony Greig bowled by Thomson yorker at 94/6. There was little hope of England lasting the day, but Alan Knott held out for two hours making 19, adding 29 with Peter Lever and 47 with the top-scorer Derek Underwood (30). When Underwood fell at 162/8, Knott and Hendrick soon followed and England were all out for 166 to lose by 166 runs, 84 minutes short of saving the game. Thomson took 6/46, which remained the best Test figures of his career.|$|E

500|$|At {{the heart}} of the castle was a huge motte, or {{artificial}} mound, sunk into a deep surrounding ditch, and protected on the north site by two sets of complex ramparts, which were probably part of the original Iron Age fortifications of the site. At [...] high - [...] {{from the base of the}} ditch - and [...] wide across the base, this is the second largest man-made mound in England. The castle would have probably included a large timber keep on top of the motte, and a rectangular bailey fortification, approximately , stretched away from the motte, exploiting the former Iron Age fortifications on one side.

500|$|In 1996, Six Flags Great Adventure {{announced}} that it would be adding a new roller coaster in 1997, bringing their coaster count back up to seven. It was then {{announced that}} the coaster would be a prototype linear induction motor (LIM) launched dual tracked shuttle coaster dubbed [...] "Batman & Robin: The Chiller". The theme was chosen with the intent of promoting the Batman & Robin film, which was set to open in summer that year. The Observatory scenery piece, that eventually <b>loomed</b> <b>over</b> the launch tracks and exit ramp, was taken directly from the film source material. A track was devoted to both title characters, with the icy blue track being christened Batman and its fiery red companion being labeled Robin.

500|$|Their critics {{expressed}} {{concerns about the}} effect of modern technology and urban living on the human condition, arguing that skyscrapers generated pollution and noise, and imposed a regimented and dehumanising lifestyle on the people that worked in them. Social commentator Lewis Mumford reflected the concerns of many in his critiques entitled Is the Skyscraper Tolerable? and The Intolerable City. Political theorist Stefan Hirsch condemned the buildings as [...] "bandages covering the sky, stifling our breath". Inventor Thomas Edison expressed fears that an uncontrolled expansion of skyscrapers would result in overcrowding and disaster. Artist Howard Cook's engravings critiqued the oppressive character of the new skyscrapers as they <b>loomed</b> <b>over</b> the traditional city. Berenice Abbott's photographic studies of New York in the 1930s explored the complex theme of urban change and the effect of skyscrapers on the older ways of life in the city, echoing Steigler's work {{in the first decade of}} the century.|$|E

500|$|This {{outcome was}} the subject of {{controversy}} in Romania, where the territorial exchange was generally considered unfair, with some voices even arguing that the country could again accept Ottoman suzerainty as a means to overturn the state of affairs. Unbeknown to them, the Budjak cession had been secretly agreed upon with Nelidov in early 1877. Even then, against his subordinates in the diplomatic corps, but in consonance with the Domnitor, Kogălniceanu privately noted that he [...] "fully agreed" [...] with it, and that he regarded the new province as a [...] "splendid acquisition". However, in April 1877, Kogălniceanu had explicitly assured Parliament that no real threat <b>loomed</b> <b>over</b> the Budjak. By that point in time, both the Germans and the Austrians had begun suspecting that Kogălniceanu was in fact a favorite and agent of influence of the Russians, and, reportedly, he even encouraged the rumor to spread. Andrássy reportedly commented: [...] "Prince Carol is really unfortunate to have people like Mr. Kogălniceanu in his service".|$|E
500|$|In August 1923, Andrić {{experienced}} an unexpected setback in his career. A law {{had been passed}} stipulating that all civil servants {{had to have a}} doctoral degree. As Andrić had not completed his dissertation, he was informed that his employment would be terminated. Andrić's well-connected friends also intervened on his behalf and appealed to Foreign Minister Momčilo Ninčić, citing Andrić's diplomatic and linguistic abilities. In February 1924, the Foreign Ministry decided to retain Andrić as a day worker with the salary of a vice-consul. This gave him the opportunity to complete his Ph.D. Three months later, on 24 May, Andrić submitted his dissertation to a committee of examiners at the University of Graz, who gave it their approval. This allowed Andrić to take the examinations necessary for his Ph.D to be confirmed. He passed both his exams, and on 13 July, received his Ph.D. The committee of examiners recommended that Andrić's dissertation be published. Andrić chose the title Die Entwicklung des geistigen Lebens in Bosnien unter der Einwirkung der türkischen Herrschaft (The Development of Spiritual Life in Bosnia Under the Influence of Turkish Rule). In it, he characterized the Ottoman occupation as [...] that still <b>loomed</b> <b>over</b> Bosnia. [...] "The effect of Turkish rule was absolutely negative," [...] he wrote. [...] "The Turks could bring no cultural content or sense of higher mission, even to those South Slavs who accepted Islam." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} revival {{to break away}} from the {{original}} staging and interpretation was an Australian production directed by Christopher Renshaw, starring Hayley Mills as Anna, in 1991. Renshaw pointedly ignored the printed stage directions in the script when reshaping the piece into what he called [...] "an authentic Thai experience". The production had a more sinister Siamese setting, a less elegant but more forceful Anna, and a younger King (Tony Marinyo). The attraction between Anna and the King was made explicit. Renshaw [...] "cut a few lines and lyrics, and translated others into Thai to reinforce the atmosphere of a foreign land", and all Asian roles were played by Asian actors. He also asked choreographers Lar Lubovitch and Jerome Robbins to create a [...] "spiritual" [...] ballet, for the King's entrance in Act 1, and a procession with a sacred white elephant in Act II. According to Renshaw, [...] "The reds and golds were very much inspired by what we saw at the royal palace", and set and costume elements reflected images, architecture and other designs in the palace and elsewhere in Bangkok. For example, the stage was framed by columns of elephant figures, a large emerald Buddha <b>loomed</b> <b>over</b> Act I, and hundreds of elephant images were woven into the set. Renshaw said, [...] "The elephant is regarded as a very holy creature ... they believe the spirit of Buddha often resides {{in the form of the}} elephant." ...|$|E

500|$|The cordon {{sanitaire}} {{turned out to}} be counterproductive with the Centre Democrats winning 77 seats in the 1994 local elections and gaining representation in almost every city where it fielded a candidate. Large cities were strongholds of the party, winning more than 10% of the vote in Rotterdam. It became the fifth largest Dutch political party. After the elections, however, scandal <b>loomed</b> <b>over</b> the Centre Democrats, largely because of its weak organization and lack of active party members. Many of its previously won local seats became vacant after a while, as elected representatives failed to take them up, joined or founded other parties, left the party or left politics altogether. Before the 1994 general election opinion polls predicted that the party could win more than five seats in the House of Representatives. However, media reports claiming that some newly elected local members had extremist pasts damaged the Centre Democrats' prospects. A secret recording broadcast on national television one week before the election showed an Amsterdam council member bragging about having set immigrant centers on fire in the early 1980s. In the election that followed, the Centre Democrats won 2.5% of the vote and three seats in the House of Representatives (Janmaat was joined by Wil Schuurman and Cor Zonneveld), well below earlier expectations. Janmaat claimed that the relatively poor result was a result of an anti-CD campaign in the media. Due to its growth, and questions arising amongst the other parties over the development of a multicultural society, [...] political opponents began to confront the Centre Democrats directly rather than maintain a strict {{cordon sanitaire}} around it.|$|E

2500|$|The Australian umpires {{were willing}} to give the batsmen the benefit of bad light {{if there was a}} {{thunderstorm}} in the offing, or the Australian sunset came too soon and were particularly prone to do this if Lillee, Thomson or Willis were bowling.

2500|$|After {{the first}} day, Cowan pulled the tanks {{out of the}} town during the night, {{although}} he left patrols to defend the area already captured. The next day, 1 March, Cowan had the Corps commander (Lieutenant General Frank Messervy) and General Slim watching anxiously {{over his shoulder at}} his headquarters, both worried that the Japanese might hold out for weeks. In the event, in spite of desperate resistance, the town fell in less than four days. Although the Japanese had plenty of artillery, they were unable to concentrate their fire sufficiently to stop any single attacking brigade. Lack of anti-tank weapons gravely handicapped the defenders. Slim later described watching two platoons from 1/7th Gurkha Rifles supported by a single M4 Sherman tank overrun several Japanese bunkers and eliminate their defenders in a few minutes, with only a few casualties to themselves. In an attempt to improvise anti-tank defences, some Japanese soldiers crouched in trenches, clutching [...] aircraft bombs, with orders to strike the detonator when an enemy tank <b>loomed</b> <b>over</b> the trench.
