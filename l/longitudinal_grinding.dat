40|$|There {{are many}} miles of portland cement {{concrete}} pavement in Iowa {{that due to}} normal wear, {{and in some cases}} accelerated wear from studded tires, the surface has become polished resulting in less than desirable friction values. Retexturing the surface may be an economical way to re-establish desirable friction values. Retexturing by grinding with diamond blades and transverse grooving with diamond blades are two methods of rehabilitating p. c. c. surfaces. MU Inc. of Lebanan, Tennessee proposed to provide without charge to the Iowa Department of Transportation, one 1500 ft x 12 ft section each of three methods of texturing. They are <b>longitudinal</b> <b>grinding,</b> transverse grooving and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>grinding</b> followed by transverse grooving. A section of 1500 feet is needed to properly evaluate a texturing method. It was decided by Iowa DOT personnel that due to possible differential friction it would be undesirable to texture only one lane. The decision was made to do test sections of 1500 ft x 24 ft with the cost of the additional texturing paid by the Iowa DOT. Iowa also has areas where the p. c. c. pavement has faulted at the joints and cracks which results in poor riding quality. Methods of correcting the faulting are to underseal the pavement where needed and/or grinding the surface to eliminate the faulted areas. It was decided to include in this research project a section for profiling by grinding...|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial decapods {{consume a}} wide variety of plant and animal material. The {{potential}} adaptations of carnivorous, omnivorous, and herbivorous terrestrial crustaceans were studied by examining the functional morphology of the gastric mill. Two closely related species from each feeding preference group were examined to identify which features of the mill were due to phylogeny and which were due to adaptation. The morphology of the gastric mill matched the diet well; the gastric mills of the carnivorous species (Geograpsus grayi and Geograpsus crinipes) possessed a blunt, rounded medial tooth and flattened lateral teeth with a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>grinding</b> groove. These features make them well suited to a carnivorous diet of soft animal tissue as well as hard material, such as arthropod exoskeleton. In contrast, the mill of the herbivorous gecarcinids (Gecarcoidea natalis and Discoplax hirtipes) consisted of a medial tooth with sharp transverse ridges and lateral teeth with sharp interlocking cusps and ridges and no grinding surface. These features would efficiently shred fibrous plant material. The morphology of the mill of the omnivorous coenobitids (Coenobita perlatus and Birgus latro) was more generalized toward a mixed diet. However, the mill of B. latro was more adapted to deal with highly nutritious food items, such as nuts and heavily calcified decapods. Its mill possessed lateral teeth with extended ridges, which sat close to the calcified cardiopyloric valve to form a flattened floor. Hard items trapped in the mill would be crushed against this surface by the medial tooth. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Due to {{existence}} of relative motion between the grinding machine body and working table, the manufacturing error of guide track {{would result in}} a considerable grinding error inevitably. Thus the guide direction error becomes the most important static error source for <b>longitudinal</b> cylindrical <b>grinding.</b> In this paper, an error compensation system based on industrial computer was developed and used to counteract the guide direction error. In order to verify the performance of the proposed system, several grinding experiments were carried out. The experimental results show that the grinding error due to guide track error reduces by about 33 % using the error compensation system...|$|R

40|$|OBSI {{testing of}} the I- 70 Surface Texture Test {{sections}} was conducted on June 23, 2011. The results indicated the NGCS texture is the quietest at 100. 6 dBA and the exposed aggregate the loudest at 104. 3 dBA. The rank order of the sections from quietest to loudest was NGCS, longitudinally grooved drag texture, drag texture, conventional diamond <b>grinding,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> tined, and exposed aggregate. All textures have increased in level since their construction in 2008 with the NGCS indicating the greatest increase. Recess of the compression seal within the NGCS sections appears to be increasing the overall level. 1 IGG...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{pavements}} can {{be designed}} and constructed to be as quiet as any other conventional pavement type in use today. This report {{provides an overview of}} how this can be done—and done consistently. In order to construct a quieter concrete pavement, the texture must have certain fundamental characteristics. While innovative equipment and techniques have shown promise for constructing quieter pavements in the future, quieter concrete pavements are routinely built today all across the United States using the following standard nominal concrete pavement textures: drag, <b>longitudinal</b> tining, diamond <b>grinding,</b> and even, to limited extent, transverse tining. This document is intended to serve as a guide that describes better practices for designing, constructing, and texturing quieter concrete pavements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently, diamond {{grinding}} {{has gained}} increasing attention as pavement preservation treatment to restore desired surface characteristics, particularly friction. Compared to other pavement preservation treatments such as surface overlays and high friction surface treatments, diamond grinding may cost less, save construction time, or require minimum maintenance. Diamond <b>grinding</b> produces <b>longitudinal,</b> continuous, and line-type texture that contains corrugations with evenly spaced ridges. The improved surface texture will immediately enhance pavement surface friction and reduce the possibility of hydroplaning in rainy weather. However, little information has been documented on the texture characteristics and long-term friction performance of diamond-ground pavements. A field evaluation was conducted to examine the surface texture and friction characteristics in diamond-ground concrete and asphalt pavements by the authors. Five pavement test sections, including two diamond-ground concrete pavements, one diamond-ground concrete bridge deck, one diamond-ground asphalt pavement, and one transversely tined concrete pavement, were selected for evaluation. Laser scanner testing was performed to capture both macro and microtexture profiles. Locked wheel testing was performed to measure the friction numbers. The test results were examined and compared so as to evaluate two performances, after construction and long-term friction performance of diamond-ground pavements. It was found that <b>longitudinal</b> diamond <b>grinding</b> can provide durable, satisfactory surface friction performance for both concrete and asphalt pavements...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a {{comparison}} of longitudinal diamond ground and transverse tined pavement surface texturing for newly constructed Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (PCCP). The study area is located along a test-section of I- 190 in Buffalo, New York. The two PCCP surface treatment types being evaluated in this report are compared based on safety, noise, construction cost, service life, rideability, handling, and maintenance requirements. This paper documents the initial evaluation and also analysis of follow-up noise and skid resistance measurements conducted approximately one year later. Analysis of the initial testing indicates that the relative skid resistance of the experimental longitudinal diamond ground surface is as good or better than that of the transverse-tined surface. The results of the noise analysis indicate that the longitudinal diamond ground surface is 2 to 5 decibels quieter depending primarily on the traffic vehicle mix. Noise and skid resistance measurements conducted one year later showed little change. While less construction time was required for the transverse tined pavement as compared to the diamond ground pavement, the actual cost difference is not quantifiable. However, a higher initial cost for <b>longitudinal</b> diamond <b>grinding</b> would likely be partially offset by an extended service life...|$|R
40|$|Thin overlays, diamond <b>grinding,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> grooving, {{transverse}} grooving, {{and milling}} {{have been successful}} techniques for restoring frictional properties on portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. Shotblasting offers a lower cost alternative if successful. Five test sections of shotblasting were placed on IA 9 from Decorah east to the Winneshiek County line (milepost 260. 0 to 270. 0). Both smooth tire and ribbed tire friction testing (ASTM E 274) was performed. The conclusions and recommendations are: Based on the study, friction enhancement by shotblasting has a relatively short service life when measured by the ribbed tire test. However, when measured by the smooth tire test, the friction enhancement is longer lasting. Consideration of shotblasting for friction enhancement may be warranted to gain additional information, particularly when smooth tire friction properties are at issue...|$|R
40|$|At {{present time}} there is not {{information}} {{about the influence of}} rigidity of hardened steel parts on the parameters of flatness deviations: EFEmax, EFEa, EFEq, which are called correspondingly greatest, arithmetic average and quadratic average. To model the variable rigidity of workpieces, an arrangement with the frame structure was used. It allowed to simulate the variable compliance of parts with constant sizes in the direction of <b>longitudinal</b> feed of <b>grinding</b> machine. Searching for models of multiple dispersion analysis was carried out using the D-optimal plan of experiment. They predicted that in rough grinding all parameters of flatness deviations increase with the growth of the part rigidity. In the subsequent grinding stages, the increase of part rigidity is accompanied by the favorable decrease of the flatness deviations. The compliance of low-rigid parts in the finishing stage of grinding should be reduced using additional technological devices...|$|R
40|$|Traffic noise {{generated}} by tire–pavement interaction {{is a matter}} of major concern for the Cali-fornia Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Research is underway in California and other States to evaluate tire–pavement noise characteristics of both concrete and asphalt pavements using the on-board sound intensity (OBSI) method, which allows for detailed characterization of noise levels at the source. In California, both concrete and asphalt pavement research studies are being conducted by the University of California Pavement Research Center (UCPRC) in collaboration with and funding from Caltrans. The concrete pavements and bridge decks study involves a total of 144 sections in different regions throughout the State. The surface textures evaluated in the study comprise of <b>longitudinal</b> tining, diamond <b>grinding,</b> diamond grooving, and burlap drag. Preliminary results indicate that diamond-ground surfaces can be the quietest of the concrete pavement surface textures. With only part of the test sections analyzed, OBSI levels from California concrete pavements range between 101. 2 and 107. 3 dB(A). The asphalt pavement research evaluates tire–pavement noise characteristics and performance properties of about 70 sections from throughout the State. This study considers acoustic and structural per-formance of four main asphalt surface types: open-graded asphalt concrete (OGAC), rubberized open-graded asphalt concrete (RAC-O), rubberized gap-graded asphalt concrete (RAC-G) and dense-graded asphalt concrete (DGAC). OBSI measurements indicate that average noise levels increased by 1. 3 dB(A) from 100. 8 dB(A) to 102. 1 dB(A) over the 2 -year period. Overall, a noise level of around 100. 0 dB(A) measured at 60 mi/h (96 km/h) using the OBSI method ap-pears to be a reasonable goal for both concrete and asphalt quieter pavements, based on the UCPRC data and other studies. Further analysis on the data being collected will answer ques-tions about acoustic durability of different types of concrete and asphalt pavements...|$|R
