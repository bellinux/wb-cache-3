5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by KID, with direction by Takumi Nakazawa, planning and scenario writing by Kotaro Uchikoshi, character design by Yuu Takigawa, and music by Takeshi Abo. Nakazawa and Uchikoshi were appointed to their respective positions as they had worked on the previous game in the Infinity series, , which had been well received. As Ever 17 was to be released on consoles, it was required to be finished {{two months before the}} planned August release, meaning that after the scenario's completion in May, there was only time for debugging until late June. Uchikoshi and Nakazawa described this as a tight development schedule, and said that the game was only possible through the staff working very hard, and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> being worked on at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other way he could win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do whatever he wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E

I mean, what is color? Painting {{has to do with}} a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> Color is among the things it has to do with. It has to do with surface. It has to do with shape, It has to do with feelings which are more difficult to get at.|$|E

Because I think people need to see things another way; they need to see it other than just celebrity.|$|E

She was serious and she wants Andrea to pull her weight; certain people are stuck with certain tasks and {{to a certain extent}} people are retreating back into traditional gender roles because of how this survival-crazy world seems to work. Lori has a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> going on so she's definitely going to be behaving somewhat irrationally at times as she tries to cope with the pregnancy and the conflict between Rick and Shane as well as dealing with the fact that Rick was out on the road again.

500|$|Hobart {{was more}} {{assertive}} as Senate president than his predecessors had been. [...] It was customary {{for the vice}} president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. [...] Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation.

[...] In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; [...] "I don’t know if there’s a point to releasing records if they’re not physical releases, if we're going to release a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> digitally then I don’t see why we couldn’t release a song a week or a song a month or just put out what we like from whenever we record."
