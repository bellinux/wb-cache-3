Black incarceration peaked before and after radical Reconstruction, when Southern whites exercised virtually unchecked power and restored [...] "efficiency" [...] to the criminal courts. For example, 384 of North Carolina's 455 prisoners in 1874 were black, and in 1878 the proportion had increased slightly to 846 of 952. By 1871, 609 of Virginia's 828 convicts in—including all but four of its sixty-seven female prisoners—were black.

If the lease agreement represents the materialization of the will of the parties (lender and user), it is fact only a stage (final stage) of several operations that precede and accompany the leasing operations along their development. It is recognized in the doctrine that within the leasing operations we have a sequence of operations and contracts without which the final act, namely the lease agreement would not exist. We are referring to the sale-purchase contract signed by the financier with the supplier of goods, the mandate contract of the financier concluded with the user and the actual funding contract, the last two coexisting in the wording of the lease agreement.

40|$|Abstract—In {{cognitive}} radio systems, Dynamic Spectrum Leas-ing (DSL) {{can improve the}} efficiency of spectrum utilization. In DSL, the primary user who has the license for {{a part of the}} bandwidth, decides to lease it to a secondary user or not. In this paper, we assume an OFDM-based system and perform the <b>leasing</b> <b>operation</b> in this system where the primary user leases the spectrum for a number of OFDM symbols to secondary users in exchange of a better quality-of-service achieved by secondary network cooperation. The secondary users use a part of the spectrum for relaying the primary data to the primary receiver {{and the rest of the}} spectrum for their own transmissions. More precisely, we propose a time-frequency domain leasing scheme. Simulation results show that both primary and secondary users benefit from this proposed spectrum sharing strategy. I...|$|E

TesisEn la actualidad, el sector de los Micro y Pequeñas empresas constituyen más del 80 % de la actividad económica del país, y como eje principal en la producción nacional, mueven una gran cantidad de dinero en el mercado financiero, utilizando diferentes fuentes de financiación que les proporcionan las entidades especializadas en ese sector. Existen diferentes opciones con las que cuenta las Micro y Pequeñas empresas para su financiación, en la mayoría de los casos éstas son empleadas para solventar la expansión de sus operaciones o para invertirlo en capital de trabajo. No obstante, aun se observa que los empresarios optan por reinvertir sus utilidades en el giro del negocio, ya que persiste una cierta desconfianza por adquirir préstamos, a causa de no estar informados sobre las modalidades de financiación existentes. En tal sentido, debido a la importancia del sector micro y pequeña empresa en el crecimiento y desarrollo del país, permite presentar al Leasing como una alternativa de financiación a mediano plazo que facilita adquirir activos fijos sin la necesidad de tener liquidez, optimizando el manejo financiero y tributario de los negocios. Así, cuando realice una operación de leasing, el empresario podrá registrar como gasto la depreciación del activo más los intereses financieros; así mismo podrá acelerar la depreciación de los bienes en forma lineal hasta en el plazo del contrato. En el presente informe la definición, clasificación y contabilización del Leasing están de acuerdo a los criterios comprendidos en la Norma Internacional de Contabilidad NIC 17 Arrendamientos. Se hará énfasis en el Leasing Financiero debido a que es de mayor aplicación y se mostrará casos prácticos para su mejor entendimiento y adecuada contabilización.
