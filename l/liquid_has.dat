5|$|HeliumI has a {{gas-like}} {{index of}} refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless <b>liquid</b> <b>has</b> a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.|$|E
25|$|Spiral Flow/Cross Flow: One fluid is in spiral {{flow and}} the other in a cross flow. Spiral flow {{passages}} are welded at each side for this type of spiral heat exchanger. This type of flow is suitable for handling low density gas, which passes through the cross flow, avoiding pressure loss. It can be used for liquid-liquid applications if one <b>liquid</b> <b>has</b> a considerably greater flow rate than the other.|$|E
50|$|Theoretically, the {{coefficient}} of linear expansion can be found from {{the coefficient}} of volumetric expansion (αV ≈ 3α). For liquids, α is calculated through the experimental determination of αV. <b>Liquids,</b> unlike solids <b>have</b> no definite shape and they take the shape of the container.

50|$|Ionic <b>liquids</b> <b>have</b> been {{considered}} as solvents {{in a variety}} of liquid-liquid extraction processes, but never commercialized.

25|$|Yeast {{is added}} to the wort in a large vessel (often tens of {{thousands}} of litres) called a washback. Washbacks are commonly made of Oregon Pine or stainless steel. The yeast feeds on the sugars, and as a by-product, produces both carbon dioxide and alcohol. This process is called fermentation and can take up to three days to complete. When complete, the <b>liquid</b> <b>has</b> an alcohol content of 5 to 7% by volume, and is now known as wash. Up until this point the process has been quite similar to the production of beer.|$|E

Spraying the <b>liquid</b> <b>has</b> developed into one of the preferred measures adopted by the IDF to meet the challenge of civil disobedience and demonstrations by Palestinians. The tactic was devised to tamp down organized civilian protests in the West Bank. It has been used regularly against the villagers of Bil'in, Ni'lin, Kafr Qaddum, and Nabi Saleh, where weekly protests against the occupation are practiced.|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} energy: surface tension [...] of a liquid is {{the ratio of}} the change in the energy of the liquid, and the change in the surface area of the liquid (that led to the change in energy). This can be easily related to the {{previous}} definition in terms of force: if [...] is the force required to stop the side from starting to slide, then this is also the force that would keep the side in the state of sliding at a constant speed (by Newton's Second Law). But if the side is moving to the right (in the direction the force is applied), then the surface area of the stretched liquid is increasing while the applied force is doing work on the liquid. This means that increasing the surface area increases the energy of the film. The work done by the force [...] in moving the side by distance [...] {{is at the same time}} the total area of the film increases by [...] (the factor of 2 is here because the <b>liquid</b> <b>has</b> two sides, two surfaces).

2500|$|... 3. In three {{dimensions}} {{a consequence of}} the Brouwer fixed-point theorem is that, {{no matter how much you}} stir a cocktail in a glass (or think about milk shake), when the <b>liquid</b> <b>has</b> come to rest, some point in the liquid will end up in exactly the same place in the glass as before you took any action, assuming that the final position of each point is a continuous function of its original position, that the liquid after stirring is contained within the space originally taken up by it, and that the glass (and stirred surface shape) maintain a convex volume. [...] Ordering a cocktail shaken, not stirred defeats the convexity condition ("shaking" [...] being defined as a dynamic series of non-convex inertial containment states in the vacant headspace under a lid). [...] In that case, the theorem would not apply, and thus all points of the liquid disposition are potentially displaced from the original state.|$|E

60|$|POTABLE, n. Suitable for drinking. Water {{is said to}} be potable; indeed, some declare it {{our natural}} beverage, {{although}} even they find it palatable only when suffering from the recurrent disorder known as thirst, for which it is a medicine. Upon nothing has so great and diligent ingenuity been brought to bear in all ages and in all countries, except the most uncivilized, as upon the invention of substitutes for water.

60|$|The {{quantity}} of this dirty-looking stuff, {{that we call}} the scum and the lees, goes on increasing until it reaches a certain amount, and then it stops; {{and by the time}} it stops, you find the liquid in which this matter has been formed has become altered in its quality. To begin with it was a mere sweetish substance, having the flavour of whatever might be the plant from which it was expressed, or having merely the taste and the absence of smell of a solution of sugar; but by the time that this change that I have been briefly describing to you is accomplished the <b>liquid</b> <b>has</b> become completely altered, it has acquired a peculiar smell, and, what is still more remarkable, it has gained the property of intoxicating the person who drinks it. Nothing can be more innocent than a solution of sugar; nothing can be less innocent, if taken in excess, as you all know, than those fermented matters which are produced from sugar. Well, again, if you notice that bubbling, or, as it were, seething of the liquid, which has accompanied the whole of this process, you will find that it is produced by the evolution of little bubbles of air-like substance out of the liquid; and I dare say you all know this air-like substance is not like common air; it is not a substance which a man can breathe with impunity. You often hear of accidents which take place in brewers' vats when men go in carelessly, and get suffocated there without knowing that there was anything evil awaiting them. And if you tried the experiment with this liquid I am telling of while it was fermenting, you would find that any small animal let down into the vessel would be similarly stifled; and you would discover that a light lowered down into it would go out. Well, then, lastly, if after this <b>liquid</b> <b>has</b> been thus altered you expose it to that process which is called distillation; that is to say, if you put it into a still, and collect the matters which are sent over, you obtain, when you first heat it, a clear transparent liquid, which, however, is something totally different from water; it is much lighter; it has a strong smell, and it has an acrid taste; and it possesses the same intoxicating power as the original liquid, but in a much more intense degree. If you put a light to it, it burns with a bright flame, and it is that substance which we know as spirits of wine.|$|E
