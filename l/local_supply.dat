25|$|The {{original}} {{buildings were}} built using native limestone – greystone – which was mined {{just north of}} campus. Over the years, this greystone {{became one of the}} most recognizable campus signatures. When the <b>local</b> <b>supply</b> of limestone was exhausted, the University turned to Tyndall stone, which is quarried in Manitoba. Saskatchewan's Provincial University and Agricultural College were officially opened May 1, 1913 by Hon. Walter Scott.|$|E

25|$|In May 2010, Dornier Seaplane {{announced}} that it would build the Seastar in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, about half an hour away from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The site was picked due to the strength of the <b>local</b> <b>supply</b> chain and presence of skilled aerospace workers, as well as its proximity to Lake Champlain for flight operations. At this point, the company aimed to deliver their first production aircraft in 2012; production was projected to rise from a single aircraft in 2012, to six in 2013 and to 12 in 2014; dependent on demand, as many as 50 Seastars per year could eventually be built.|$|E
25|$|This is {{one reason}} for girls leaving {{secondary}} school or missing classes. No privacy and lack of water supply means that girls prefer {{to stay at home}} during menstruation. Girls may lack knowledge of menstrual hygiene since the subject is taboo. An intervention in four districts of Southern Ethiopia, identified and tested local material for making sanitary pads, trained local tailors to make and mass-produce them, established <b>local</b> <b>supply</b> outlets and lobbied stakeholders to up-scale. Successful testing and raising awareness of the problem resulted in improved facilities for girls in five primary schools and one secondary school.|$|E

25|$|Historically, Victoria {{has been}} a hub for the {{manufacturing}} plants of the major car brands Ford, Toyota and Holden; however, closure announcements by all three companies in the 2010s has meant Australia will completely lose their car manufacturing industry {{by the end of}} 2017. Holden's announcement occurred in May 2013 following Ford's decision in December the previous year (Ford's Victorian plants, in Broadmeadows and Geelong, closed in October 2016).

25|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that the Russians were entirely unprepared for war beyond their western border and had not realistically evaluated their potential supply problems in East Prussia. Apraxin, at best a modest commander, had assessed supplies in the region and believed they were sufficient; he had not established specifically Russian supply depots in Poland-Lithuania Commonwealth, which was neutral, but intended to rely on <b>local</b> <b>supply.</b> In 1757, the ongoing support of the 92,000 horses alone required more fodder than was available from any of the friendly territories in Livland, much less unfriendly East Prussia. Furthermore, the Russians had made no effort to expand their supply depots using the Baltic's seaports, which would have been the most obvious way to feed that number of troops at that distance. Finally, the efforts at the troops to requisition supplies were met by a localized guerilla uprising; farmers burnt their crops and destroyed their supplies rather than give to the Russians. Once the Russians reached Livland, observers noted exhausted troops hauling carts because their horses, living on a diet of oak leaves, dropped dead by the hundreds every day.|$|E
500|$|Legal {{documents}} dated 1624 {{state that}} Milnrow consisted of six cottages; {{there were a}} further nine at Butterworth Hall, and three at Ogden. Milnrow did not expand until {{the introduction of a}} woollen weaving trade which began in the Late Middle Ages and continued until the 19th century. During this time nearby Rochdale—the local market town—was used as a central marketing, finishing and fellmongering hub. The handloom weaving of woollen cloth and flannels in the domestic system became the staple industry of Milnrow, facilitating the community's growth and prosperity. Between 40,000 and 50,000 sheep skins were needed every week to provide for Milnrow's industries, and as early as the 16th century, the demand for wool was so great it had outstripped the <b>local</b> <b>supply</b> of the region and had to be imported from Ireland and the English Midlands. As a consequence of the woollen trade, rows of [...] "fine stone domestic workshops" [...] or weavers' cottages were constructed beyond Milnrow's original core, with dwelling quarters on the lower floors and loom-shops on the top floor.|$|E

500|$|The {{remnants}} of Cyclone Sose were {{a significant factor}} in stormy weather over the North Island of New Zealand between April 12 and April 14. Numerous locations received 10 to 20 cm (3.9 to 7.9 in) of rainfall, and [...] of precipitation fell at Glenbervie, Northland region, in just seven hours. The heavy rainfall rates caused [...] "significant" [...] flooding of low-lying roads and farmlands in the region. Floodwaters inundated the township of Kaeo and entered several local businesses. The swollen Kaeo River temporarily rendered New Zealand State Highway 10 impassable to most vehicles at a bridge over the waterway. A hospital became isolated {{from the rest of the}} town. Further to the west, State Highway 1 was blocked by flooding at Rangiahua, as was State Highway 2 between Te Puke and Te Maunga Junction. At the former, the rains triggered a landslide and polluted the <b>local</b> <b>supply</b> of drinking water. Several residences throughout the region sustained damage. A 22-year-old man drowned in high waters along the Wairoa River. Rising waters from the Kerikeri River threatened to affect the Mission House, the nation's oldest surviving building, where staff were on standby to relocate furnishings if necessary.|$|E
500|$|In the 13thcentury, Poulton's {{economy was}} largely agricultural. Over the next centuries, the town became a {{commercial}} centre for the area, importing and exporting goods through harbours on the River Wyre at Skippool and Wardleys. Imports of flax were vital {{for a local}} linen industry, particularly in nearby Kirkham, and Poulton craftsmen were part of this industry {{by the beginning of}} the 19thcentury. During the early part of this century the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution led to a decline in the craft industries in Poulton. New methods were not embraced by local producers and the town suffered from its location, far from coalfields and large labour markets. Following the development of the new town and port of Fleetwood from 1836, Poulton's role as a major commerce centre waned. For some time, the town's market remained important as a <b>local</b> <b>supply</b> of goods for growing Fleetwood and Blackpool. Eventually Poulton was overshadowed by Fleetwood and Blackpool. In his 1837 work on Blackpool, William Thornber called Poulton the [...] "metropolis of the Fylde". This was a time when Poulton was still prominent among its near neighbours; David Foster commented in 1972 that not only was Thornber's description of the town no longer apt, it had ceased to be accurate even from 1850 with the rapid growth of the coastal resorts.|$|E

After the 1909-1910 strike by coal miners in the Hunter Valley, the Victorian state government were determined to ensure stability in <b>local</b> <b>supplies</b> of coal. The State Coal Mine {{and the town of}} Wonthaggi came into being in 1910 to supply coal for the Victorian Railways. It was {{one of the largest and}} most dangerous collieries in Australia.

Elizabeth appointed William Fermor as the new Russian commander and the next year the invasion started again. Fermor had an entirely different attitude toward supply his troops, and developed an extensive network of <b>local</b> <b>supply</b> depots and sources outside of the Russian boundary. [...] This, though, attracted aspersions from his political enemies in St. Petersburg, who claimed he was wasting the imperial treasury; however, Fermor was considerably more successful in 1758 than his predecessor had been in 1757.|$|E

On 4 August 1937 Bai rejoined the Central Government {{at the invitation}} of Chiang Kai-shek. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45), he was the Deputy Chief of the General Staff responsible for operations and training. He was the key strategist who convinced Chiang to adopt a [...] "Total War" [...] strategy in which China would trade space for time, adopt guerrilla tactics behind enemy lines and disrupt enemy supply lines at every opportunity. When the better armed and trained Japanese troops advanced, the Chinese would adopt a scorched earth campaign in the enemy's path to deny them <b>local</b> <b>supply.</b> Bai was also involved in many key campaigns including the first major victory at the Battle of Tai'erzhuang in Shandong Province in the spring of 1938 when he teamed up with Gen.

Subsequently, Bai was appointed Commander of the Field Executive Office of the Military Council in Guilin, with responsibility for the 3rd, 4th, 7th and 9th War Zones. In that capacity he oversaw the successful defense of Changsha, capital of Hunan Province. Between 1939-42 the Japanese attacked Changsha three times and were repelled each time.

2500|$|In {{response}} {{to all these}} pressures, a completely new coinage was struck in 1279 with a different design which made clipping much easier to detect. Millions of coins were struck at London and Canterbury and the public could take their old, underweight, short and long-cross pennies to the mint and exchange them for new coins of the correct weight and fineness. This exchange {{also served as a}} form of taxation as moneyers were required to charge a fee for the service. The new coins were much admired in Europe and were extensively copied there, often with poorer fineness silver – but this only made Edward's coins even more popular and severely drained the <b>local</b> <b>supply</b> of silver such that the export of English coins was forbidden in 1299. The strong, good-quality coins strengthened the economy and brought prosperity to the country. The 1279 penny was different from earlier issues in many ways. The king's bust is more lifelike, facing the front, and the legend on the obverse is longer, usually EDW REX ANGL DNS HYB – Edward King of England Lord of Ireland. The reverse had a long cross going {{to the edge of the}} coin; the moneyer's name is omitted except for one issue, but the name of the mint is usually given in full, e.g. CIVITAS LONDON City of London, or VILLA NOVI CASTRI Town of Newcastle. The new coins also contained a privy mark, small differences such as a rose on the king's breast, differences in the king's hair style, or an alteration in the size of the king's eyes, or the style of a letter; these differences were not caused by carelessness but to enable identification of the moneyer who produced the coin, in place of giving the moneyer's name.|$|E
