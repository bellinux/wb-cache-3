50|$|In Roman historiography commentarii {{is simply}} a raw account of events often not {{intended}} for publication.

The dialogue too, was simple, everyday speech, without dramatic flamboyance or <b>literary</b> <b>flourish.</b> The slow, soft and cleverly modulated dialogue became a hallmark not only of Barua’s but all of New Theatres’ films." ...|$|E
40|$|The common {{definition}} of metaphor as a “comparison between {{two things that}} does not include the words ‘like’ or ‘as’” has, in the recent decades, lost the respect of serious students of language. Originating in Aristotelian thought, this “Comparison Theory” of metaphor is oversimplifying and therefore inadequate. By using examples to outline these inadequacies, a more accurate, more robust view of metaphor emerges. Far from being a mere <b>literary</b> <b>flourish,</b> the concept of metaphor—especially as metaphor is identified as the means through which symbols function—is at the very base of the general process of meaning conveyance through language. In order to conduct a fruitful discussion of metaphor in its true scope, a close analysis of a single metaphor from Fitzgerald’s novel The Great Gatsby, “her voice is full of money,” is given. In light of the shortcomings of The Comparison Theory, analysis of the power of a single metaphor to draw connections throughout a work will shed light on the necessity for a study of metaphor that reflects the continuity-building aspects of metaphor. Discussions of metaphor that attempt to define the phenomenon by isolating the context of terms run against the process of association and synthesis by which metaphor functions. Therefore, a fruitful study of metaphor is necessarily one that analyzes metaphor across contexts, as this thesis does...|$|E

40|$|For a {{few days}} there {{it seemed that the}} {{successful}} student march of May 4 would be the last of the big demos and soon everyone would be back on campus attending classes again. Railing against this rather pleasant and natural inclination, strident wall posters at Shida and Beida called for continuing the student strike. One of the more florid campus wall posters that I managed to snap a photo of was a florid eulogy to the Great Hall of the People as a symbol of representative rule. The dark message, written on May 5, 1989 was at odds with the general euphoria {{in the wake of the}} May 4 March, for it predicted an outcome with blood flowing down Chang’an Boulevard. Brushed in ink on a large sheet of paper, written with such <b>literary</b> <b>flourish</b> that I needed help to decipher it, the poem was signed by an anonymous author who went by the name, “The Wild One. ” “*Drawing blood on Chang’an Jie until the dawn dawns red, smashing to bits the bona fide dream of the people*. ” On the morning of May 10, the student-rigged loudspeakers at the center of the Beijing University campus started crackling with a call to action. A Beida physics student explained they were calling on other schools to join Beida students in a new form of protest with Chinese characteristics: the bicycle demonstration! We sat on our bikes under a tree near the front gate of Beida to observe the hatching of this new and unusual type of protest. The “marchers” rolled in from all directions, mostly walking their bicycles due to the utter congestion. Like earlier protests, which used patriotic anthems as a cover for covert political action, the demo on wheels could hide in plain sight in a city of a million tinkling bicycles. The tree-lined road leading to the main gate on campus was by now attracting black bicycles like crows, watching and waiting for a sign to take flight en masse...|$|E
40|$|Edmund Randolph is a New Yorker and a Princeton {{graduate}} who came {{west in the}} 1920 s and took up ranching in southeastern Montana. In Beef, Leather and Grass, he presents an autobiographical account of his partnership venture during the 1940 s and early 1950 s in a big-time ranching operation on the Antler spread, which lay on the Crow Reservation in the Little Big Hom Valley. The book, as the preface tells us, 2 ̆ 2 deals with this situation in a unique manner, not as a fictional account of a ranch, a would-be 2 ̆ 7 Western 2 ̆ 7 or an autobiography, but from personal observation. It {{is a bit of}} biographical history, a first-person, factual description of places, people, customs and a form of American life that had its being in pioneer days and is now almost gone [...] Only the names have been changed,. and for obvious reasons: out of respect for the dead or the privacy of the living 2 ̆ 2 (pp. x-xi). This volume is most valuable for the insights it provides into the operations of a large-scale cattle ranch in the mid-twentieth-century West. What we find here is what surprisingly few people even yet understand: that ranching was and is a truly cosmopolitan and complex business, involving intricate financial dealings and farflung geographical maneuverings. Randolph describes the familiar scenes and characters of western ranching: the shrewd and down-toearth stockman, with 2 ̆ 2 the standard middleaged cattleman 2 ̆ 7 s starch-and-fried-food paunch just showing over the silver belt buckle 2 ̆ 2 (p. 36); the crusty but trustworthy hired hands; the brandings, roundups, and rides. But more interestingly, he also tells of the extensive stock-buying forays into Mexico; the rigors of moving cattle by train north to Montana; the partnership that he and his partner formed with an Austrian nobleman and his wife during World War II; and even the filming of a movie on the ranch by a Hollywood crew. The story ends with a retrospect that is largely a warning against destroying this still lightly populated range country through thoughtless development, mainly by open-pit coal mining. Randolph writes well, with a smooth <b>literary</b> <b>flourish.</b> His book is interesting for its deft character portraits and for the unpretentious manner in which the author tells his story of a fascinating time, place, and way of life. Yet it leaves one wishing that he had not confined himself to a series of vignettes that are revealing but do not fully encompass the breadth of his experience. Had he rounded out his book more in the fashion of a standard autobiography and· used the real names of particcipants, historians would find it of more general value. As it is, Beef, Leather and Grass is limited in scope, but it nevertheless captures the spirit of an age that is rapidly fading from memory...|$|E
