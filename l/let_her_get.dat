500|$|Phoenix debuted on WWE's main roster on the May 8, 2006, {{episode of}} Raw as a face by attacking Mickie James while James was assaulting Trish Stratus. After this incident, James berated Phoenix for [...] "ruining everything" [...] and {{questioned}} why {{she showed up}} in the first place. A week later, Phoenix was formally introduced by Stratus and then attacked a distracted James on Stratus's behalf. When James finally escaped, Phoenix claimed that James had [...] "ruined her life", and would not <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>get</b> away with it, before calling her a [...] "psycho". On the following episode of Raw, Phoenix attacked James after her match with Torrie Wilson. Then, on the May 29 episode of Raw, Phoenix and Wilson, with Stratus in their corner, teamed together to defeat Candice Michelle and Victoria, who had James in their corner. During the June 5 episode of Raw, Phoenix suffered a legitimately fractured mandible during a match with Victoria, but was able to continue the match, and emerged victorious despite the injury. She spent a year having surgeries and recovering, including getting a titanium plate and nine screws placed in her jaw, but she was only out of action for two months, as she returned to action in OVW instead of on the main roster.|$|E
500|$|Around May 28, local family {{planning}} officials phoned Feng {{to try to}} persuade her to have an abortion. The attempt was unsuccessful, so on May 30 they visited the family house while Feng's husband was away at work. [...] At first, authorities tried to persuade her to voluntarily have an abortion. After several hours, she told the officials she was going out to buy food, and left them in her living room. Instead, she went to an aunt's house, but around 15 officials followed her. They did not immediately arrest Feng, instead setting up shifts to keep watch over her at the aunt's house. [...] Early the next morning, Feng escaped, causing the guards to panic. [...] She flagged down a van and persuaded the driver to help her. [...] The driver let her out down the road, and Feng hid in hillside brush for the next 14 hours, waiting for the cover of darkness in the cold and rainy weather. [...] When night came, she went to a relative's house in the countryside, where she hid under the bed. Authorities from the {{family planning}} office found her regardless, and allegedly assaulted her. [...] They <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>get</b> a night's sleep before taking her to the hospital on June 2. Several witnesses reported that four men carried Feng out of the house with a pillowcase over her head.|$|E
