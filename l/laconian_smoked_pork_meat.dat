5000|$|Pljeskavica (пљескавица, [...] ), {{a grilled}} dish of spiced meat patty mixture of pork, beef and lamb, is a {{national}} dish of Serbia, also popular in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. It is a main course served with onions, kajmak (milk cream), ajvar (relish), and urnebes (spicy cheese salad), either on plate with side dishes, or with lepinja (flatbread, {{as a type of}} hamburger). Recently, Pljeskavica has gained popularity elsewhere in Europe and is served in a few speciality fast food restaurants in Germany, Sweden, and Austria. Varieties include the [...] "Leskovac Pljeskavica" [...] (Leskovačka pljeskavica) very spicy with onions, [...] "Šar Pljeskavica" [...] (Šarska pljeskavica) stuffed with kačkavalj cheese, [...] "Hajduk Pljeskavica" [...] (Hajdučka pljeskavica) of beef mixed with <b>smoked</b> <b>pork</b> <b>meat,</b> and [...] "Vranje Pljeskavica" [...] (Vranjanska pljeskavica).|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of surface treatment with {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB), previously cultivated in an alternative substrate, on the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and biogenic amines (BAs) in cold <b>smoked</b> <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> sausages was investigated. Moreover, sausages treatment with LAB after the smoking on PAHs content changes was evaluated. Additionally, the inhibitory effects of LAB metabolites on food spoilage bacteria was determined using the agar well diffusion assay method. The metabolites of Pediococcus acidilactici KTU 05 - 7, Pediococcus pentosaceus KTU 05 - 9 and Lactobacillus sakei KTU 05 - 6 strains showed good inhibitory properties against tested pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria. Moreover L. sakei produced bacteriocins inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the treatment of sausages surface with LAB before smoking decreased the content of cadaverine and spermidine, whereas the treatment of sausages surface with LAB after smoking decreased the content of putrescine (approx. 53...|$|R
25|$|Cooking {{was done}} on a stove, burning corncobs (from the mule feed) or {{sometimes}} coal. Washing clothes and children was typically done at night by moonlight, after tying up the boat, {{along the side of}} the canal. Food and provisions for the trip (e.g. flour, sugar, coffee, salt <b>pork,</b> <b>smoked</b> <b>meat,</b> etc.) were bought in Cumberland on Wineow street, from stores such as Coulehan's, Dennis Murphy's, or John McGrinnis's. Some boatmen carried chickens or pigs on the boats. Fish caught in the canal also served as food, as well as turtles. Additional supplies could be bought along the way from lockkeepers and at towns.|$|R
50|$|As regards meat-eating, the Danes {{primarily}} eat pork: salted and <b>smoked</b> <b>pork,</b> hams, pork roasts, pork tenderloin, pork cutlets and chops are all popular. Ground <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> {{is used in}} {{many traditional}} recipes requiring ground meat. Danish bacon is generally of good quality (in Denmark; exported Danish bacon is of exceptional quality), and available in both the striped and back varieties. While still the most popular, pork has lost ground to turkey, beef and veal in recent years.|$|R
40|$|The people (Tribes) of Arunachal Pradesh {{have the}} natural {{tendency}} to remain {{close contact with}} animals since immortal. The domestic animals are kept in basement {{of the house with}} human occupants in the first floor of same house. They remain in close contact with cattle, sheep, goat, pigs, poultry, cats and dogs throughout the year, exposing them to many animal born diseases of occupational risk. People are not aware of zoonotic diseases sharing between domesticated animal and human beings except for Rabies. So, there is regular out break of most common protozoan zoonotic diseases in human Giardiosis caused by Giardia spp. and amoebosis caused by Entamoeba spp. in the state. Another important disease of clinical significance is toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma usually causes a febrile illness and abortions in pregnant women. The source of infection in humans may be due to close proximity with cats and unhygienic sanitation. Similarly high incidences of sarcocystis were reported form many district of Arunachal Pradesh.

40|$|China is a {{great country}} and also the most {{populated}} of the world. Chinese people are the first producers and the first consumers of <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> in the world. Their actual production overhang lightly their consumption, but the consumption of <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> is continually rising. So can we believe this country will be, in {{a more or less}} short period of time, importer of <b>pork</b> <b>meat?</b> In this actual study, we are trying to determine how the <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> distribution network of this country works, the differents interveners of the industry and the ways they work. This study let us know those interveners according to differents parameters: in accordance with their production, the carriers they used, the polical status of the owner of the means of production and the origin of <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> as well of the origin of live animals. Moreover, that research permits us to appraise the interprovincial trade in that field of activity. This study proves that private retailers tower above the market in accordance with the quantities traded and with the number of business. Also the small private farms tower above the live pork market in accordance with the level of their production and the number of their business. We also notice the global <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> consumption is rising although the local live pork production is decreasing. For those who want to export <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> to China, it could be interesting to keep an eye open and maintain some relations with the local interveners of <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> industry in China, in order to be ready for the moment when the <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> consumption will move above the chinese production capacity...|$|R
40|$|Six assays of low-fat venison salchichon were {{produced}} using varying proportions {{of olive oil}} to replace the traditional <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> added. The control contained 75 % lean venison and 25 % pork meat; in the other assays, 15, 25, 35, 45 and 55 % of the <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> was replaced by olive oil. Samples were evaluated by quantitative descriptive sensory analysis and consumer testing. Descriptive sensory analysis revealed significant differences {{for most of the}} attributes studied. The replacement of 35 % or more of <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> by olive oil, prompted a decrease in odour intensity, spicy odour, hardness and an increase of fat mouthfeel, together with the olive oil perception. By contrast, the replacement of 25 % of <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> by olive oil yielded a salchichon not greatly different to the control. Consumers accepted all assays, but preferred those in which no more than 25 % of the <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> was replaced by olive oil. From a sensory standpoint, therefore, it is recommended that the replacement of <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> by olive oil in this product should not exceed 25 %...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} was conducted to provide information {{on the influence of}} stunning methods in conjunction with refrigeration and freezing time on the textural and rheological properties of raw <b>meat.</b> <b>Pork</b> raw <b>meat,</b> commercially available, was analyzed for textural properties such as hardness, cohesiveness, adhesiveness and fracture force. Sample were analyzed fresh, after 3 days of refrigeration, and 15 days, 30 days and 60 days freezing time in commercially available refrigerators mimicking the storing conditions used by consumers. For <b>pork</b> raw <b>meat,</b> hardness increased sharply after 3 days of refrigeration and showed no significant differences after 15 days of freezing compared to 3 days refrigeration time. After 30 days of freezing the raw <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> samples’ hardness decreased significantly compared to the hardness of the samples freeze for 15 days. Hardness of gas stunning raw <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> samples compared to electrical stunning raw <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> samples was 2. 57 times higher indicating a better firmness of the gas stunning raw <b>pork</b> <b>meat.</b> The cohesiveness of the raw <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> from gas stunned animals maintained its levels after 60 days of freezing while the meat from electrically stunned animals showed significant modificati...|$|R

40|$|The {{spoilage}} of perishable foods {{is mainly}} caused by bacterial activity. The risk of unwanted bacterial growth is particularly high in the minced <b>pork</b> <b>meat.</b> In this work, the natural microbial contaminants of the minced <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> were followed by 16 S ribosomal DNA deep sequencing (metagenetics) during aging tests at different temperatures. Brochothrix thermosphacta MM 008 strain was selected {{as one of the}} main contaminants responsible for the spoilage of the <b>meat.</b> Minced <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> previously sterilized by gamma irradiation was inoculated with B. thermosphacta MM 008 for challenge tests measuring growth and then incubated at different temperatures. Minced meat samples were taken and analyzed by H-NMR 1 D at time 0 and at final time (from 14 to 19 days, depending on the incubation temperature). Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) showed that samples, regardless of the incubation temperature, could be splitted into 3 groups according to their spectral profile: 1) samples taken at time 0, 2) samples inoculated with B. thermosphacta and taken at final time, 3) samples uninoculated, taken at final time. From the analysis of the metabolomics data, higher concentrations of glycerol, glucose, taurine, lactate, carnitine, betaine and glycine were identified in the samples of uninoculated minced <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> and an increased production of creatine, acetate and acetone was found in the samples of minced <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> inoculated with B. thermosphacta MM 008.
