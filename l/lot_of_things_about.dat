[...] He {{acquired}} United States citizenship in early 1918 with the expectation that his medical history would exempt him from his final year of draft eligibility. [...] So it came as an unpleasant surprise that within months Berlin was drafted and serving as a private at Camp Upton at a salary of $30 a month, far below his usual earnings. [...] Although as a civilian he employed a private valet, as an Army private he was compelled to perform unskilled labor in support of camp operations. [...] "There were a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> army life I didn't like", said Berlin, [...] "and the thing I didn't like most of all was reveille." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 11, 1970, Hendrix {{gave his}} final {{interview}} in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let that bother me. Because they say a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." [...] Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which he laughed and replied: [...] "A mad scientist approach... I don't consider [...] the invention of psychedelic, it's just asking a lot of questions." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Kinberg {{would later}} state that [...] "there are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> 'X3' that I love {{and there are}} a lot of things that I regret", {{detailing}} that he would have preferred the Dark Phoenix as the main plotline and [...] "I would have fought harder" [...] for that, considering that at the period [...] "the darkness of her story was a little bit daunting on a huge $200 million studio movie" [...] leading Fox to ask for rewrites. Previous X-Men director Bryan Singer declared that The Last Stand [...] "isn't what I would have done" [...] and he was dissatisfied with the busy plot and excessive character deaths, but Singer still liked some parts of the movie, such as Ellen Page's casting – leading Singer to bring her back as Kitty Pryde in [...] – and the scenes with Leech, which he described as [...] "really sweet moments". Matthew Vaughn, who was attached as director before dropping out, criticized Ratner's direction: [...] "I could have done something with far more emotion and heart. I'm probably going to be told off for saying that, but I genuinely believe it." [...] While promoting his own installment of the franchise, 2011's , Vaughn would say regarding The Last Stand that [...] "I storyboarded the whole bloody film, did the script. My X3 would have been 40 minutes longer. They didn't let the emotions and the drama play in that film. It became wall-to-wall noise and drama. I would have let it breathe and given far more dramatic elements to it." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{overwhelmingly}} negative reviews, a few reviewers {{had positive}} {{things to say}} about the song and video. Entertainment Weekly writer Joseph Lynch noted that there was [...] "something sickeningly catchy about this tune that keeps you coming back for more." [...] Rolling Stones Perpetua stated, [...] "When you see this video, you immediately notice everything that it does 'wrong', but it actually gets a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> pop music right, if just by accident." [...] OK! Magazine also noted that [...] "some are calling the 13-year-old signed singer the next Justin Bieber." [...] After watching the video, singer Chris Brown said: [...] "Honest opinion? It was great. I'll be jammin' to it on Friday, Friday." [...] Fellow teenage singer Miley Cyrus denied that she had criticized Black, saying [...] "I am a fan" [...] and that she sang [...] "Friday" [...] while driving. Simon Cowell praised Black, saying [...] "I love her [...] the fact that she's gotten so much publicity. People are so upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. [...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being deadly serious. Whatever she's done has worked. Whether you like her or not, she's the most talked-about artist in America right now. Nobody over the age of 18 should understand her or like her. So she should just do it her way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pullman {{himself was}} {{described}} by a Times interviewer as sounding [...] "ambivalent" [...] and [...] "guarded" [...] about the film, saying in March 2008: [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> it were good... Nothing's perfect. Nothing can bring out all that's in the book. There are always compromises". He hoped, however, {{that the rest of}} the trilogy would be adapted with the same cast and crew. In July 2009, after this possibility had been exhausted, Weitz told Time.com that he thought the film's special effects ended up being its [...] "most successful element." ...|$|E
2500|$|I usually say, [...] "There are {{a number}} of things that you don't want me to know about, that you don't want to tell me. There are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> {{yourself}} that you don't want to discuss, therefore let's discuss those that you are willing to discuss." [...] She has blanket permission to withhold anything and everything. But she did come to discuss things. And therefore she starts discussing this, discussing that. And it's always [...] "Well, this is all right to talk about." [...] And before she's finished, she has mentioned everything. And each new item - [...] "Well, this really isn't so important that I have to withhold it. I can use the withholding permission for more important matters." [...] Simply a hypnotic technique. To make them respond to the idea of withholding, and to respond to the idea of communicating.|$|E

5000|$|The 10-item Self-Concealment Scale (SCS) {{measures}} {{the degree to}} which a person tends to conceal personal information perceived as negative or distressing. The SCS has proven to have excellent psychometric properties (internal consistency and test-retest reliability) and unidimensionality. Representative items include: [...] "I have an important secret that I haven't shared with anyone", [...] "There are <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> me that I keep to myself", [...] "Some of my secrets have really tormented me", [...] "When something bad happens to me, I tend to keep it to myself", and [...] "My secrets are too embarrassing to share with others".|$|R
2500|$|The filmmakers {{obscured}} the explicitly Biblical {{character of the}} Authority to avoid offending viewers. Weitz declared {{that he would not}} do the same for the planned sequels. [...] "Whereas The Golden Compass had to be introduced to the public carefully", he said, [...] "the religious themes {{in the second and third}} books can't be minimised without destroying the spirit of these books. ...I will not be involved with any 'watering down' of books two and three, since what I have been working towards the whole time in the first film is to be able to deliver on the second and third". In May 2006, Pullman said of a version of the script that [...] "all the important scenes are there and will have their full value"; in March 2008, he said of the finished film that [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> it were good.... Nothing can bring out all that's in the book. There are always compromises".|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, she closes her eyes. She's in a sacred space and you feel that. You can say a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Bonnie Tyler, but you cannot say she does not feel her music.|$|E

5000|$|Producer David Foster {{approached}} Roger Donaldson {{to direct}} in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no {{as he did}} not want to do a remake. Then he read the script [...] "and I really liked it," [...] said Donaldson. [...] "And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie." ...|$|R
