5|$|With the {{discovery}} and observation of planetary systems around stars {{other than the}} Sun, it is becoming possible to elaborate, revise or even replace this account. The level of metallicity—an astronomical term describing the abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than 2 (helium)—is now thought to determine the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> star will have planets. Hence, {{it is thought that}} a metal-rich population I star will likely have a more substantial planetary system than a metal-poor, population II star.|$|E
5|$|The Kokinshū, Tales of Ise and Tales of Yamato all {{describe}} Narihira leaving Kyoto {{to travel}} east through the Tōkaidō region and crossing the Sumida River, composing poems at famous places (see utamakura) along the way. The Tales of Ise implies this journey {{was the result}} of the scandalous affair between Narihira and Fujiwara no Takaiko. There are doubts as to whether this journey actually took place, from the point of view both that the number of surviving poems is quite small for having made such a trip and composing poems along the way, and in terms of the historical <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> courtier could have gone wandering to the other end of the country with only one or two friends keeping him company.|$|E

25|$|Behavior {{prediction}} is also derived from goals. Behavior {{prediction is}} {{to acknowledge the}} <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> habit will form, {{but in order to}} form that habit, a goal must have been initially present. The influence of goals on habits is what makes a habit different from other automatic processes in the mind.|$|E
25|$|Neuropeptide Y receptors {{have a great}} {{concentration}} in the amygdala, which {{is involved in the}} modulation of fear. Research where Neuropeptide Y was administered intracerebroventricularly showed that it was important in consolidation of memory because it increased immediate and long-term forgetting. The antagonizing of a subtype of receptor for Neuropeptide Y caused the opposite effects- it decreased the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> fearful memory would be forgotten.|$|E

It extends the existing literature by examining both the impact of the overall eBay feedback rating as well as feedback from shorter time periods. The results of this paper suggest that recent feedback, and in particular recent negative feedback, is of particular importance in explaining the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> auctioned item sells. Other feedback related factors included in this paper are measures for the source of feedback (i. e. buying or selling behavior) and whether negative feedback is product or seller related. ...|$|R

Reputation affects how many contracts are given to the player; less reputation leads to fewer, lower-quality contracts. Declining a contract will reduce the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> contract of the same type will appear later. Simultaneously, players must upgrade buildings in the space center to unlock new features such as improved tracking, higher spacecraft mass limit, larger part count limit, and increased available contracts.|$|E
25|$|Listeners' {{ratings in}} Barron-Lutzross's {{experiment}} of <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> speaker is a lesbian correlated with several different phonological variables. Lower median pitch, a wider pitch range, a lower second formant, and more use of creaky voice correlated positively with listeners perceiving a voice as lesbian-sounding. Despite this, Barron-Lutzross {{did not find}} any direct correlations between these phonetic variables and sexual orientation. She stated that this could mean that listeners were using additional features which were not tested for to make judgments about the speakers' sexuality.|$|E
25|$|The first {{evidence}} for parental selection of exaggerated, ornamental traits in offspring {{was found in}} American coots. Black American coot chicks have conspicuously orange-tipped ornamental plumes covering the front half of their body that are known as “chick ornaments” that eventually get bleached out after six days. This brightly colored, exaggerated trait makes coot chicks more susceptible to predation and does not aid in thermoregulation, but remains selected for by parental choice. These plumes are not necessary for chick viability, but increased chick ornamentation increases the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> chick will be chosen as a favorite by the parents. Experimental manipulation of chick ornamentation by clipping the bright plumes has shown that parents prefer ornamented chicks over non-ornamented ones.|$|E

In this research we explore these relationships and suggest <b>that</b> it is <b>a</b> complex interaction between SME resources, resource needs and environmental munificence <b>that</b> determines the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> SME will form an alliance. In specific we view the interaction between firm size and the level of national R&D intensity in determining the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> SME will form an R&D alliance. The study hypotheses are tested utilizing over 2000 completed surveys from SMEs in eight countries...|$|R

Using lateral attentional manipulation, this was supported.|$|R
25|$|In June 2006 Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) {{management}} {{announced that}} they have elected not to modify the Berkeley Hills Tunnel, which actually penetrates the Hayward Fault, arguing {{that it would be}} cheaper (and less disruptive to current operations) to rebore a misaligned portion after the fact than to protect riders (either by extensive modifications of the tunnel or by replacing it with a higher bore) against the small <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> train (or two) would crash into or be cut in two by a major slippage of the fault. Modified train scheduling to prevent multiple train exposure at faults has been determined by BART engineers to be impractical due to variations in train passage, but automated event-related realtime train operational response is considered practical (see below).|$|E
25|$|In general, wines {{with a low}} pH (such as Pinot Noir and Sangiovese) have {{a greater}} {{capability}} of aging. With red wines, {{a high level of}} flavor compounds, such as phenolics (most notably tannins), will increase the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> wine will be able to age. Wines with high levels of phenols include Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo and Syrah. The white wines with the longest aging potential tend to be those with a high amount of extract and acidity. The acidity in white wines, acting as a preservative, has a role similar to that of tannins in red wines. The process of making white wines, which includes little to no skin contact, means that white wines have a significantly lower amount of phenolic compounds, though barrel fermentation and oak aging can impart some phenols. Similarly, the minimal skin contact with rosé wine limits their aging potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} {{commonly}} used screening methods, physical examination of the breasts by a healthcare provider and mammography, can offer an approximate <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> lump is cancer, and may also detect some other lesions, such as a simple cyst. When these examinations are inconclusive, a healthcare provider can remove {{a sample of the}} fluid in the lump for microscopic analysis (a procedure known as fine needle aspiration, or fine needle aspiration and cytology—FNAC) to help establish the diagnosis. The needle aspiration may be performed in a healthcare provider's office or clinic using local anaesthetic if required. A finding of clear fluid makes the lump highly unlikely to be cancerous, but bloody fluid may be sent off for inspection under a microscope for cancerous cells. Together, physical examination of the breasts, mammography, and FNAC can be used to diagnose breast cancer with a good degree of accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Multi-factor {{authentication}} - Multi-factor authentication {{requires that}} the user uses a user id, password combined with {{any other form of}} authentication method as smartcard or biometric.

25|$|Evenness is the {{difference}} between the percentage of a minority in a particular part of a city, compared to the city as a whole. Exposure is the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> minority and a majority party will come in contact with one another. This dimension shows the exposure to other diversity groups while sharing the same neighborhoods. Clustering is the gathering of different minority groups into one certain space; clustering often leads to one big ghetto and the formation of hyperghettoization. Centralization is the number of people within a minority group that is located {{in the middle of an}} urban area, often looked at as a percentage of a minority group living in the middle of a city compared with the rest of their group living elsewhere. Concentration is the dimension that relates to the actual amount of land a minority lives on within its particular city. The higher segregation is within that particular area, the smaller the amount of land a minority group will control.|$|E
25|$|Serious local errors {{can arise}} in {{homology}} models where an insertion or deletion mutation or {{a gap in}} a solved structure result in a region of target sequence {{for which there is}} no corresponding template. This problem can be minimized by the use of multiple templates, but the method is complicated by the templates' differing local structures around the gap and by the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> missing region in one experimental structure is also missing in other structures of the same protein family. Missing regions are most common in loops where high local flexibility increases the difficulty of resolving the region by structure-determination methods. Although some guidance is provided even with a single template by the positioning of the ends of the missing region, the longer the gap, the more difficult it is to model. Loops of up to about 9 residues can be modeled with moderate accuracy in some cases if the local alignment is correct. Larger regions are often modeled individually using ab initio structure prediction techniques, although this approach has met with only isolated success.|$|E
25|$|Polanyi's PhD {{studies at}} Manchester University focused on {{measuring}} {{the strengths of}} chemical bonds using thermal dissociation, building on Warhurst's graduate studies using a sodium flame apparatus to determine the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> collision between a sodium atom and another molecule {{would lead to a}} chemical reaction. For the majority of his career, Polanyi's research has focused on chemical dynamics, attempting to determine the mechanics of a chemical reaction, and the properties of chemical species in the transition state. While at the National Research Council (NRC), Polanyi evaluated transition state theory for its predictive powers, coming {{to the conclusion that the}} theory was flawed, largely due to a lack of knowledge about the forces at play in the transition state. Near the end of his stay at NRC, Polanyi worked in Gerhard Herzberg's lab, using spectroscopy to examine vibrational and rotational excitation in iodine molecules. During Polanyi's time at Princeton University, he worked with Sir Hugh Taylor and his colleagues, Michael Boudart and David Garvin. He was influenced by studies conducted at Princeton looking at the vibrationally excited reaction products between atomic hydrogen and ozone.|$|E

40|$|Most {{models of}} {{voluntary}} self-regulatory actions designed to preempt environmental regulations assume certainty regarding {{the likelihood of}} the regulatory threat.

We find that increasing the uncertainty of either type can decrease or increase self-regulatory actions. The latter result calls into question conventional wisdom, which suggests <b>that</b> <b>a</b> strong and credible regulatory threat is needed to induce industry to take voluntary self-regulatory actions. ...|$|R
