In this paper, we value cultural ecosystem services in relation to <b>land-uses</b> and <b>management</b> regimes of urban {{green infrastructure}}. Through a survey among 198 beneficiaries of the largest urban park in Barcelona, Spain, we assessed cultural ecosystem services in monetary and non-monetary terms in relation to <b>land-uses</b> and <b>management</b> regimes. Results from our research suggest that monetary and non-monetary valuations capture complementary information, and show that values of cultural ecosystem services change across different green infrastructure assets and management regimes. For example, ‘environmental learning’ generates low monetary values but high non-monetary values. Stronger place values were related with low management intensity, while values for tourism increase with land-uses embedding cultural facilities. We discuss monetary and non-monetary values {{in the light of}} urban green infrastructure strategies and indicate potentials for urban planning and management to proactively alter the provision of cultural ecosystem services through specific configurations of <b>land-uses</b> and <b>management</b> intensity...|$|R

50|$|WEPP is {{applicable}} {{for a wide}} range of geographic and <b>land-use</b> and <b>management</b> conditions, and capable of predicting spatial and temporal distributions of soil detachment and deposition on an event or continuous basis at both small (hillslopes, roads, small parcels) and large (watershed) scales. Hillslope applications of the model can simulate a single profile having various distributions of soil, vegetation, and plant/management conditions. In WEPP watershed applications, multiple hillslopes, channels, and impoundments can be linked together, and runoff and sediment yield from the entire catchment predicted. The model has been parameterized for a large number of soils across the U.S. and model performance has been assessed under a wide variety of <b>land-use</b> and <b>management</b> conditions. In addition, WEPP can generate long-term daily climatic data with CLIGEN, an auxiliary stochastic climate generator. The CLIGEN database contains weather statistics from more than 2,600 weather stations in the United States. The WEPP climate database is supplemented by the PRISM database, which further refines the climatic data based on longitude, latitude, and elevation. WEPP can provide daily runoff, subsurface flow, and sediment output categorized into five particle-size classes: primary clay, primary silt, small aggregates, large aggregates, and primary sand, allowing calculation of selective sediment transport, and enrichment of the fine sediment sizes.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) was {{developed}} in the U. S. A. and {{has been used as a}} tool for assessing and quantifying changes in soil quality/health (SQ) induced by land uses and agricultural practices in that region and elsewhere throughout the world. An initial study using SMAF in Brazil was recently published, but additional research for a variety of soils and management systems is still needed. Our objective was to use data from five studies in southern Brazil to evaluate the potential of SMAF for assessing diverse <b>land-use</b> and <b>management</b> practices on SQ. The studies examined were: (i) horizontal and vertical distribution of soil properties in a long-term orange orchard; (ii) impacts of long-term land-use change from native vegetation to agricultural crops on soil properties; (iii) effects of short-term tillage on soil properties in a cassava production area; (iv) changes in soil properties due to mineral fertilizer and pig slurry application coupled with soil tillage practices; and (v) row and inter-row sowing effects on soil properties in a long-term no-tillage area. The soils were classified as Oxisols, with clay content ranging from 180 to 800 g kg- 1. Six SQ indicators [pH(H 2 O), P, K, bulk density, organic C, and microbial biomass] were individually scored using SMAF curves and integrated into an overall Soil Quality Index (SQI) focusing on chemical, physical, and biological sectors. The SMAF was sensitive for detecting SQ changes induced by different land uses and management practices within this wide textural range of Brazilian Oxisols. The SMAF scoring curve algorithms properly transformed the indicator values expressed in different units into unitless scores ranging from 0 - 1, thus enabling the individual indicators to be combined into an overall index for evaluating <b>land-use</b> and <b>management</b> effects on soil functions. Soil sector scores (i. e., chemical, physical, and biological) identify the principal soil limitations and can therefore be used to establish priorities for specific management actions. The SMAF can be used as a tool for assessing SQ in Brazilian soils, thus helping farmers, land managers, and politicians make better decisions regarding sustainable <b>land-use</b> and <b>management</b> practices...|$|R

Passive countermeasures involve sensible <b>land-use</b> <b>management,</b> avoiding conditions attracting flocks of birds to the area (e.g. landfills).

The main hypothesis is that conceptual model parameters, although not measur-able quantities, are representative of specific catchment at-tributes (e. g. geology, <b>land-use,</b> land <b>management,</b> topogra-phy). Hence, we assume that eventual trends in model pa-rameters are representative of catchment attributes that may have changed over time.

The toll of exurbanization on the landscape may seem insignificant; yet, unique landscapes are altered through these changes. This research project examines exurban landowner decision-making in the Adirondack Park and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Regression analyses of survey data showed that environmental ethics are a weak predictor of <b>land-use</b> and land <b>management</b> practices, while attitudes toward wildlife-friendly behavior were the most significant predictor of intent to engage in such activities.

50|$|Sensitivity and {{resilience}} are {{measures of the}} vulnerability of a landscape to degradation. These two factors combine to explain the degree of vulnerability. Sensitivity {{is the degree to}} which a land system undergoes change due to natural forces, human intervention or a combination of both. Resilience is the ability of a landscape to absorb change, without significantly altering the relationship between the relative importance and numbers of individuals and species that compose the community. It also refers to the ability of the region to return to its original state after being changed in some way. The resilience of a landscape can be increased or decreased through human interaction based upon different methods of <b>land-use</b> <b>management.</b> Land that is degraded becomes less resilient than undegraded land, which can lead to even further degradation through shocks to the landscape.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [54]- 56) Policies {{concerning the}} protection of agricultural land are made at the local level. In Illinois, expansion of the urban area into once rural lands has created a complex <b>land-use</b> <b>management</b> system. Competition among the local governments for land drive changes in policies, which in turn impact neighboring communities. Land-use policies are often developed without thought as to their impact outside the jurisdiction. The focus {{of this study is}} to assess the extent of the impact that does occur. Chapter 1 is an introduction into the present-day system of <b>land-use</b> <b>management</b> in Illinois. Background information is given on the land management hierarchy, along with a brief description of the study area, McHenry County, and the central questions to this study. The specific questions that will be addressed are: 1) do local land-use policies contribute to the urbanization process; 2) if local government policy decisions promote urban growth, do they impact neighboring jurisdictions, and 3) what conclusions concerning the design of future <b>land-use</b> <b>management</b> systems can be drawn from the information extracted from this study? Background information on the factors that influence the conversion of farmland is presented in Chapter 2. Each level of government has a different perspective on the loss of agricultural land. This perspective is driven by the factors that are most important to them. Discussion of the importance of these factors is essential to understanding how policies affect land development. In Chapter 3 the research methodology, analysis of the data, and the subsequent results of the study are presented. Simply stated, the research question is: if agricultural land is incorporated into a municipality, will its function change to some urban use? A temporal study of the annexation patterns, coupled with the <b>land-use</b> <b>management</b> policies and tools, are presented. Insight into a community?s land-use policy is gained through the study of the annexation activity. Application of the tools used to enforce the policy are seen in the annexation patterns.

One of the conclusions drawn from this study is that <b>land-use</b> <b>management</b> policies do have impact outside their jurisdictional boundaries. Based on this conclusion, to have an effective landuse management program requires planning to be done in a coordinated, subregional context.
