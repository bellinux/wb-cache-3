5000|$|Medical Treatment Vehicle (MTV): Replaces M577A3 Medical Vehicle. Requirements are for 4 {{crew and}} one <b>litter</b> <b>patient,</b> {{as well as}} medical {{equipment}} sets and environmental cooling. Tasks include serving as the forward aid station, main aid station, and the battalion aid station. [...] 216 planned.|$|E
50|$|In March 1943, {{with the}} {{creation}} of the liaison category of light observation aircraft (previous examples came from Taylorcraft Aircraft as the L-2, and from Aeronca as their L-3, along with the numerous Piper L-4) the designation for Stinson's new purpose-built military design was changed to the L-5. The primary purpose as a liaison aircraft was courier and communication work, artillery spotting and casualty evacuation. The fuselage of later models was redesigned so the aircraft could also be used as an air ambulance, or for cargo work. With a wider and deeper rear fuselage section and a large rear door that folded downward, a <b>litter</b> <b>patient</b> or 250 pounds of cargo could be quickly loaded aboard.|$|E
5000|$|Five {{versions}} of the Sentinel were produced for the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF); the L-5, L-5B, L-5C, L-5E and L-5G. There was no official L-5A variant as is often reported because the designation was intended for {{a version of the}} aircraft that was never built. Nonetheless, many people {{in and out of the}} military still refer to the standard [...] "observer" [...] version of the L-5 as an L-5A. Like the L-5A, the L-5D was a planned version that was not adopted. A single L-5F was an L-5B equipped with an experimental low-noise [...] "stealth" [...] propeller and exhaust system for research purposes. The L-5B through L-5G models were modified to carry a <b>litter</b> <b>patient</b> or light cargo, or a rear seat passenger sitting in the normal position. An L-5H version was on the drawing boards at Stinson when the war ended, and it never reached the prototype stage.|$|E
5000|$|Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEV): Replaces M113 AMEV. Requirements are for 3 {{crew and}} able to have either 6 {{ambulatory}} <b>patients,</b> 4 <b>litter</b> <b>patients,</b> or 3 ambulatory <b>patients</b> and 2 <b>litter</b> <b>patients.</b> It must also have medical equipment sets and environmental cooling. Tasks include conducting medical evacuation {{from the point of}} injury to an aid station and medical resupply replenishment. [...] 790 planned.|$|R
50|$|The first crude {{attempts}} at evacuating patients by air {{were made on}} biplanes in 1918. Shortly thereafter, JN-4s and DH-4 bombers were modified by the Army Air Service for carrying litters. In 1921 the Curtiss Eagle was developed, the first aircraft designed specifically for the transport of patients. It was followed in 1925 by the XA-1, which could carry 2 <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> and flight surgeon in a compartment behind the cockpit. Eventually Douglas C-1 transports were modified to carry up to 9 <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> and were used on an opportune basis in the US and Panama. This led to a directive that all future military transports be equipped with brackets for carrying litters.|$|R
50|$|After a {{short time}} in service, the Y1C-24s were adapted for use as {{aeromedical}} evacuation aircraft, carrying up to four <b>litter</b> <b>patients.</b> The aircraft were assigned to pilot training and pursuit aircraft airfields for use as crash rescue aircraft. Exploiting the Y1C-24's ability to take off and land {{in a relatively short}} distance, the Y1C-24s remained in service into the late 1930s when they were replaced by newer air ambulance aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Flew armed B-17F Flying Fortress's from February to May 1944 for {{the more}} {{hazardous}} missions that involved landing on fields that were under enemy attack. Took part in the first airborne operation in the Southwest Pacific, seizing enemy bases and cutting supply lines at Nadzab, New Guinea, on 5 September 1943. They made the first trip to Morotai Island on October 5, carrying supplies forward and returning with <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the RSOVs with their crew-served weapons, each Ranger battalion has two medical variants of the Defender known as a Medical Special Operations Vehicle (MEDSOV). Instead of the weapon mounts found on standard RSOVs, the MEDSOV variant has fold-down racks capable of carrying six <b>litter</b> <b>patients.</b> Along with its transported casualties, a typical MEDSOV crew would include a driver, a TC {{and two or three}} medics to treat the wounded.|$|R
50|$|There are {{at least}} 17 {{variants}} of the HMMWV in service with the U.S. military. HMMWVs serve as cargo/troop carriers, automatic weapons platforms, ambulances (four <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> or eight ambulatory patients), M220 TOW missile carriers, M119 howitzer prime movers, M1097 Avenger Pedestal Mounted Stinger platforms, MRQ-12 direct air support vehicles, S250 shelter carriers, and other roles. The HMMWV is capable of fording 2.5 ft (76 cm) normally, or 5 ft (1.5 m) with the deep-water fording kits installed.|$|R
2500|$|The Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar (Navy and Marine Corps {{designation}} R4Q) is an American military {{transport aircraft}} {{developed from the}} World War II-era Fairchild C-82 Packet, designed to carry cargo, personnel, <b>litter</b> <b>patients,</b> and mechanized equipment, and to drop cargo and troops by parachute. The first C-119 made its initial flight in November 1947, {{and by the time}} production ceased in 1955, more than 1,100 C-119s had been built. Its cargo-hauling ability and unusual twin-boom design earned it the nickname [...] "Flying Boxcar".|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} has responsive {{handling and}} can fly for 5 1/2 hours with external fuel tanks. The cockpit has extremely good visibility for a tandem pilot and co-pilot, {{provided by a}} wrap-around [...] "greenhouse" [...] that is wider than the fuselage. With the second seat removed, it can carry 3200 lb of cargo, five paratroopers or two <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> and an attendant. Empty weight is 3161 kg. Normal operating fueled weight with two crew is 4494 kg. Maximum takeoff weight is 14446 lb.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Navy {{followed}} suit in 1979, ordering {{a version of}} the Super King Air A200C (modified with a 52 inch by 52 inch cargo door from the Super King Air 200C), designating it the UC-12B, for logistics support between Naval and Marine Corps air stations, air facilities, and other activities, both in CONUS and overseas. The cabin can readily accommodate cargo, passengers or both. It is also equipped to accept <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> in medical evacuation missions. Through 1982, the Navy ordered 64 of these aircraft.|$|R
50|$|On D-Day most of {{the troops}} were not landed by LSTs, however 41,035 wounded were brought back on {{approximately}} 150 LSTs, which was twice their troop capacity. The sheer numbers overwhelmed the modest sick bay facilities on these craft which were staffed by one or two Pharmacist Mates. The troop berthings quickly filled to capacity with walking wounded and <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> laid on the tank deck. Further, the inclusion of refugees on LSTs created additional needs, such as an Italian woman who gave birth at sea.|$|R
50|$|Normally {{flown by}} {{a crew of}} five or more, the Mi-6 seats 65 armed troops and can {{alternatively}} carry 41 stretcher (<b>litter)</b> <b>patients</b> and two attendants, or {{a wide range of}} bulky loads, including vehicles, loaded through rear clamshell doors. In exercises, fleets of these aircraft have airlifted many kinds of weapons, including FROG-7 rockets on their PT-76 tracked chassis, as well as large radars and heavy artillery. All Soviet armoured personnel carriers, armoured cars and light mechanised infantry combat vehicles can be carried.|$|R
50|$|Powered by two Allison T56 {{turboprop}} engines, the C-2A {{can deliver}} up to 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) of cargo, passengers or both. It can also carry <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> in medical evacuation missions. A cage system or transport stand restrains cargo during carrier launch and landing. The large aft cargo ramp and {{door and a}} powered winch allow straight-in rear cargo loading and unloading for fast turnaround. The Greyhound's ability to airdrop supplies and personnel, fold its wings, and generate power for engine starting and other uses provide an operational versatility found in no other cargo aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The C-74 had {{a crew of}} five, {{including}} copilot, pilot, radio operator, navigator, {{and flight}} engineer. Crew rest quarters were included for long-duration missions. Passageways were provided in the wing to permit the flight engineer to perform servicing and repairs while in flight. It could carry 125 fully equipped troops, 115 <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> with their medical attendants, or up to 50000 lb of cargo. The cargo bay had twin hoists that could be moved on a rail {{up and down the}} bay. They could be used to drop a removable belly section to ease loading of cargoes, reducing the need for specialized cargo handling equipment.|$|R

50|$|Team members {{knowledge}} and skills include safety procedures, equipment capabilities, knots, rappelling, belaying, ascending, anchors and anchor systems, rigging for raising and lowering systems, <b>litter</b> handling, <b>patient</b> packaging, single victim rescue, self-rescue, and problem solving. The environments that the team can find itself include vertical, high angle, and low angle cliff-side rope rescue, swiftwater and flood rescue, and urban heavy rescue.|$|R
50|$|In 1954 the Air Force {{received}} its first dedicated AE platform the C-131 Samaritan which could carry 27 <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> {{and had a}} range of 1500 miles, it was later supplemented with the MC-118 and in 1968 by the C-9 Nightingale, {{a modified version of}} the DC-9 commercial airliner. A rapidly expanding system of regular air evacuation flights throughout the world was established and tactical evacuation from battlefield areas was improved by the addition of new transport aircraft such as the C-123 Provider and C-130 Hercules. The first Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard AE units were established in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Air Force entered the jet age in 1961 with the addition of the C-135 transport which was a military version of the 707 airliner; it could carry 44 litters and fly more than 30% faster than piston engine aircraft. Air Evac assets were used for humanitarian missions out of Lebanon and Hungary during the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|On 6 April 1971, the Secretary of the Air Force {{announced}} the re-designation {{of the unit}} to the 157th Tactical Airlift Group. After 10 years in the airlift business, the unit assumed a new role with its seventh type aircraft—the C-130A Hercules. The 157th was also transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC), with a mission to provide mobility and logistical support for ground forces in all types of operations. It {{was all part of}} a nationwide program involving one-third of the Air National Guard's flying units and inspired by Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird. The C-130A was the backbone of TAC's theater airlift fleet, a medium assault transport with long range (beyond 2,000 miles), high speed (220 to 300 miles per hour), and capable of landing or taking off from a shorter runway than any comparable aircraft. The turbo-prop aircraft with its five-man crew could carry nearly 20 tons of cargo or 92 fully equipped troops, 64 paratroops or 74 <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> and attendants.|$|R
5000|$|Douglas Aircraft {{developed}} the C-124 from 1947 to 1949, from a prototype they created from a World War II-design Douglas C-74 Globemaster, {{and based on}} lessons learned during the Berlin Airlift. The aircraft was powered by four large Pratt & Whitney R-4360 piston engines producing [...] each. The C-124's design featured two large clamshell doors and a hydraulically actuated ramp in the nose {{as well as a}} cargo elevator under the aft fuselage. The C-124 was capable of carrying 68500 lb of cargo, and the 77 ft cargo bay featured two overhead hoists, each capable of lifting 8000 lb. As a cargo hauler, it could carry tanks, guns, trucks and other heavy equipment, while in its passenger-carrying role it could carry 200 fully equipped troops on its double decks or 127 <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> and their attendants. It was the only aircraft of its time capable of transporting heavy equipment such as tanks and bulldozers without disassembly.|$|R
50|$|The 100th ARW {{provides}} aerial refuelling {{support to}} Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, {{as well as}} aircraft of allied nations. Its aircraft are also capable of transporting <b>litter</b> and ambulatory <b>patients</b> using patient support pallets during aeromedical evacuations.|$|R
50|$|Lockheed {{responded to}} the {{requirement}} with a unique design: the Lockheed Model 300, the first large jet designed from the start to carry freight. The Model 300 had a swept high-mounted wing with four 21000 lbf kN thrust TF33 turbofan engines pod-mounted below the wings. An important aspect was the cabin's floor height of only 50 in above the ground, allowing {{easy access to the}} cabin through the rear doors. The two rear side doors were designed to allow the aircraft to drop paratroops (in August 1965 the aircraft performed the first paratroop drop from a jet-powered aircraft). The rear cargo doors could be opened in flight for airborne cargo drops. The high-mounted wings gave internal clearance in the cargo compartment of 10 ft wide, 9 ft high and 70 ft long. The size enabled the Starlifter to carry, for example, a complete LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile in its container. The aircraft was capable of carrying a maximum of 70847 lb over short distances, and up to 92000 lb in the version configured to carry the Minuteman, which lacked other equipment. The aircraft could also carry up to 154 troops, 123 paratroops or 80 <b>litter</b> <b>patients.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first type to be {{produced}} on an experimental basis {{was to be a}} military aircraft to comply with United States Air Force specifications for a liaison aircraft. It was to carry a pilot and three fully equipped combat troops or 10 <b>litter</b> <b>patients.</b> Performance envisaged was 1,000 lb load, cruising at 150 knots or better over a five-hour cruise range. [...] In the event, Taylorcraft did not put the plans into action. A design had been prepared by early 1952 for a single-engined channel wing aircraft with the engine fitted in a single channel immediately behind the crew cabin. This aircraft was not built. Design numbers CCW-3 and CCW-4 were not used. Custer obtained some financial backing from various investors and proceeded with design of a larger five-person, twin-engined Custer CCW-5. The first example was built for Custer by the Baumann Corporation of Santa Barbara, California. It utilized an adapted fuselage and tail assembly of a Baumann Brigadier light twin-engined aircraft. Power was from two 225 hp engines and the CCW-5s first flight was made on 13 July 1953. The CCW-5 accommodated five persons and was claimed to be capable of flying at a sustained speed of 35 mph.|$|R

50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and beyond the call of duty. Pfc. Lauffer's squad, a part of Company C, was suddenly struck at close range by an intense machine gun crossfire from 2 concealed bunkers astride the squad's route. Pfc. Lauffer, the second man in the column, saw the lead man fall and noted that the remainder of the squad was unable to move. Two comrades, previously wounded and being carried on litters, were lying helpless in the beaten zone of the enemy fire. Reacting instinctively, Pfc. Lauffer quickly engaged both bunkers with fire from his rifle, but when the other squad members attempted to maneuver under his covering fire, the enemy fusillade increased in volume and thwarted every attempt to move. Seeing this and his wounded comrades helpless in the open, Pfc. Lauffer rose to his feet and charged the enemy machine gun positions, firing his weapon and drawing the enemy's attention. Keeping the enemy confused and off balance, his 1-man assault provided the crucial moments for the wounded point man to crawl to a covered position, the squad to move the exposed <b>litter</b> <b>patients</b> to safety, and his comrades to gain more advantageous positions. Pfc. Lauffer was fatally wounded during his selfless act of courage and devotion to his fellow soldiers. His gallantry at the cost of his life served as an inspiration to his comrades and saved the lives of an untold number of his companions. His actions are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.|$|R

6000|$|We hired a light wagon, for a {{passable}} trail {{led to the}} railroad, {{and perhaps}} because time was scanty, or the jolting of the wagon was more trying than the swing of the <b>litter,</b> our <b>patient</b> grew worse, and I was thankful at last to see him safe in a berth of the sleeper on the Pacific express. I had grown almost as impatient as Ormond, and I recollect nothing of the journey except that when the lights of Port Moody glittered across the forest-shrouded inlet he said: [...] "Lorimer, I've a stupid prejudice against a hospital.

The aircraft can perform tactical airlift and airdrop missions and can also transport <b>litters</b> and ambulatory <b>patients</b> during aeromedical evacuations when required.|$|R
50|$|The {{impetus for}} {{developing}} the Bell 429 came primarily from the emergency medical services (EMS) industry, which was looking for an updated helicopter. The Bell 427 was originally intended to address this market, but the 427's small cabin size would not adequately accommodate a <b>patient</b> <b>litter,</b> and the systems did not support instrument flight rules (IFR) certification. Bell's original concept for the 429 was a stretched model 427 (unveiled as the Bell 427s3i at the 2004 HAI helicopter show), but this still did not provide what Bell and its customer advisers were looking for.|$|R
