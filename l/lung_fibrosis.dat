25|$|<b>Lung</b> <b>fibrosis</b> is a {{recognized}} complication of rheumatoid arthritis.

25|$|Anti-Smith (Anti-Sm) {{antibodies}} are a {{very specific}} marker for SLE. Approximately 99% of individuals without SLE lack anti-Sm antibodies, but only 20% of people with SLE have the antibodies. They are associated with central nervous system involvement, kidney disease, <b>lung</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and pericarditis in SLE, {{but they are not}} associated with disease activity. The antigens of the anti-Sm antibodies are the core units of the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), termed A to G, and will bind to the U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs. Most commonly, the antibodies are specific for the B, B' and D units. Molecular and epidemiological studies suggest that anti-Sm antibodies may be induced by molecular mimicry because the protein shows some similarity to Epstein-Barr virus proteins.|$|E

25|$|Chronic {{lung disease}} {{develops}} {{in more than}} 25% of people with A-T. Three major types of lung disease can develop: (1) recurrent and chronic sinopulmonary infections; (2) lung disease caused by ineffective cough, swallowing dysfunction, and impaired airway clearance; and (3) restrictive interstitial lung disease. It is common for individuals with A-T {{to have more than}} one of these lung conditions. Chronic lung disease can occur because of recurrent lung infections due to immunodeficiency. Individuals with this problem are at risk of developing bronchiectasis, a condition in which bronchial tubes are permanently damaged, resulting in recurrent lower airway infections. Gamma globulin for people with antibody deficiency and/or chronic antibiotic treatment may reduce the problems of infection. Other individuals with A-T have difficulty with taking deep breaths and may have an ineffective cough, making it difficult to clear oral and bronchial secretions. This can lead to prolonged respiratory symptoms following common viral respiratory illnesses. Techniques that allow clearance of mucus can be helpful in some individuals during respiratory illnesses. Some people will develop swallowing problems as they age, increasing their risk of aspiration pneumonia. Recurrent injury to the lungs caused by chronic infections or aspiration may cause <b>lung</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and scarring. This process may be enhanced by inadequate tissue repair in ATM-deficient cells. A small number of individuals develop interstitial lung disease. They have decreased pulmonary reserve, trouble breathing, a need for supplemental oxygen and chronic cough in the absence of lung infections. They may respond to systemic steroid treatment or other drugs to reduce inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Acute lung injury (ALI), {{also called}} non-cardiogenic {{pulmonary}} edema, {{is characterized by}} the abrupt onset of significant hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the absence of cardiac failure. The core pathology is disruption of the capillary-endothelial interface: this actually refers to two separate barriers – the endothelium and the basement membrane of the alveolus. In the acute phase of ALI, there is increased permeability of this barrier and protein rich fluid leaks out of the capillaries. There are two types of alveolar epithelial cells – Type 1 pneumocytes represent 90% of the cell surface area, and are easily damaged. Type 2 pneumocytes are more resistant to damage, which is important as these cells produce surfactant, transport ions and proliferate and differentiate into Type 1 cells. The damage to the endothelium and the alveolar epithelium results in the creation of an open interface between the lung and the blood, facilitating the spread of micro-organisms from the lung systemically, stoking up a systemic inflammatory response. Moreover, the injury to epithelial cells handicaps the lung’s ability to pump fluid out of airspaces. Fluid filled airspaces, loss of surfactant, microvascular thrombosis and disorganized repair (which leads to fibrosis) reduces resting lung volumes (decreased compliance), increasing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, right to left shunt and the work of breathing. In addition, lymphatic drainage of lung units appears to be curtailed—stunned by the acute injury—which contributes to the build-up of extravascular fluid. Some patients rapidly recover from ALI and have no permanent sequelae. Prolonged inflammation and destruction of pneumocytes leads to fibroblastic proliferation, hyaline membrane formation, tracheal remodeling and <b>lung</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> This fibrosing alveolitis may become apparent as early as five days after the initial injury. Subsequent recovery may be characterized by reduced physiologic reserve, and increased susceptibility to further lung injuries. Extensive microvascular thrombosis may lead to pulmonary hypertension, myocardial dysfunction and systemic hypotension.|$|E

40|$|Within the <b>lungs,</b> <b>fibrosis</b> {{can affect}} both the {{parenchyma}} and the airways. Fibrosis is a hallmark pathological {{change in the}} parenchyma in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), whilst in asthma or {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) fibrosis is a component of the remodelling of the airways. In the past decade, significant advances have been made in understanding the disease behaviour and pathogenesis of parenchymal and airway fibrosis and as a result a variety of novel therapeutic targets for slowing or preventing progression of these fibrotic changes have been identified. This review highlights a number of these targets and discusses the potential for treating parenchymal or airway fibrosis through these mediators/pathways in the future...|$|R

40|$|A {{reduction}} in airway β-adrenoceptor density {{has been reported}} in cystic <b>fibrosis</b> <b>lung</b> but the mechanism underlying this defect remains unclear. In this study, we have investigated whether the decrease in β 2 -adrenoceptor associates with altered G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) levels. We assessed GRK activity by rhodopsin phosphorylation, and β 2 -adrenoceptor and GRK at the mRNA and protein levels by Northern and Western blotting in peripheral lung samples from normal donors and patients with cystic fibrosis. GRK activity was significantly increased in peripheral cystic <b>fibrosis</b> <b>lung</b> with parallel increases in GRK 2 / 5 mRNAs and protein expression. Functionally, isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was also diminished by 65 % in cystic <b>fibrosis</b> <b>lung</b> homogenates. These data suggest that the increase in GRK activity {{may be one of the}} mechanisms underlying alterations in the coupling between β 2 -adrenoceptor and adenylyl cyclase via G-protein and may thus contribute to the downregulation of β 2 -adrenoceptor in cystic <b>fibrosis</b> <b>lung.</b> © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Patients {{receiving}} thoracic radiation often develop pulmonary {{injury and}} fibrosis. Currently, {{there are no}} effective measures to prevent or treat these conditions. We tested whether blockade of the chemokine, CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 3, and its receptors, CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 1 and CCR 5, can prevent radiation-induced <b>lung</b> inflammation and <b>fibrosis.</b> C 57 BL/ 6 J mice received thoracic radiation, and the interaction of CCL 3 with CCR 1 or CCR 5 was blocked using genetic techniques, or by pharmacologic intervention. Lung inflammation was assessed by histochemical staining of lung tissue and by flow cytometry. Fibrosis was measured by hydroxyproline assays and collagen staining, and lung function was studied by invasive procedures. Irradiated mice lacking CCL 3 or its receptor, CCR 1, did not develop the <b>lung</b> inflammation, <b>fibrosis,</b> and decline in lung function seen in irradiated wild-type mice. Pharmacologic treatment of wild-type mice with a small molecule inhibitor of CCR 1 also prevented <b>lung</b> inflammation and <b>fibrosis.</b> By contrast, mice lacking CCR 5 were not protected from radiation-induced injury and fibrosis. The selective interaction of CCL 3 with its receptor, CCR 1, is critical for radiation-induced <b>lung</b> inflammation and <b>fibrosis,</b> and these conditions can be largely prevented by a small molecule inhibitor of CCR 1...|$|R
