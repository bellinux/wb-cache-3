5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too <b>literal</b> <b>and</b> explicit. He abandoned the theme of the crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{realizes that}} September's message was <b>literal,</b> <b>and</b> {{returns to his}} home, where he is knocked out by Jones' men. He is brought to the same {{facility}} as Olivia and tied up. As they prepare to torture him, Olivia begins to use her powers to activate the lights, {{not only on the}} box but within the facility, creating electrical sparks that kill one of Jones' men. As Jones and Nina retreat, Olivia frees Peter and they give chase, though Olivia suffers from a seizure, following excessive use of her powers. They catch up to Jones and Nina as they are crossing back to the parallel universe, but the two are able to escape. Peter contacts the authorities to bring medical help for Olivia. As they are waiting, Peter admits to Olivia that he fears what he has done to her memories, and has seen his original Olivia through the Observer's mind. He leaves her, believing that staying away from this Olivia would be for the best.|$|E
5|$|Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both <b>literal</b> <b>and</b> allegorical {{acceptance}} of myth, declaring roundly that myths {{have no place}} in philosophy. Cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like Varro, he is emphatic in his support for the state religion and its institutions. It is difficult to know how far down the social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish as to believe in the terrors of Hades or the existence of Scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. De Natura Deorum is the most comprehensive summary of Cicero's line of thought.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to STRIPS, the {{principle}} of the open world applies with ADL: everything not occurring in the conditions is unknown (Instead of being assumed false).

25|$|The Divine Comedy can be {{described}} simply as an allegory: each canto, and the episodes therein, can contain many alternative meanings. Dante's allegory, however, is more complex, and, in explaining how to read the poem– see the Letter to Cangrande – he outlines other levels of meaning besides the allegory: the historical, the moral, the <b>literal,</b> <b>and</b> the anagogical.|$|E

25|$|As Rome assimilated more cultures, it {{encountered}} peoples {{from two}} religions that viewed wine in generally positive terms—Judaism and Christianity. Grapes and wine make frequent <b>literal</b> <b>and</b> allegorical appearances {{in both the}} Hebrew and Christian Bibles. In the Torah, grapevines {{were among the first}} crops planted after the Great Flood, and in exploring Canaan following the Exodus from Egypt, one of the positive reports about the land was that grapevines were abundant. The Jews under Roman rule accepted wine as part of their daily life, but regarded negatively the excesses that they associated with Roman impurities.|$|E

Booklist gave it a starred review. It was noted in, among other places, The Boston Globe, Smithsonian, the American Book Review, World Literature Today, <b>Literal,</b> <b>and</b> NPR’s On Point with Tom Ashbrook. Erica Jong said “Ilan Stavans has spread a feast of Latino literature before us.” Cornel West called it ”an instant classic.” And Felipe Fernández-Armesto of University of Notre Dame stated: “Imaginatively conceived, painstakingly executed, stunningly broad, profoundly stirring, endlessly engaging, this book can change the way the world thinks about America and the way Americans think about themselves.” However, it was criticized for its subjective approach, including few authors born in Central America.|$|E

25|$|Influenced by Massey and Higgins, Alvin Boyd Kuhn (1880–1963) argued an Egyptian {{etymology}} to the Bible {{that the}} gospels were symbolic rather than historic and that church leaders started to misinterpret the New Testament {{in the third}} century. Author and ordained priest Tom Harpur dedicated his 2004 book The Pagan Christ to Kuhn, suggesting that Kuhn has not received the attention he deserves since many of his works were self-published. Building on Kuhn's work, Harpur listed similarities among the stories of Jesus, Horus, Mithras, Buddha and others. According to Harpur, in {{the second or third}} centuries the early church created the fictional impression of a <b>literal</b> <b>and</b> historic Jesus and then used forgery and violence to cover up the evidence. Harpur's book received a great deal of criticism, including a response book, Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea. Fellow mythicist Robert M. Price also wrote a negative review, saying that he did not agree that the Egyptian parallels were as forceful as Harpur thought. In 2007, Harpur published a sequel, Water Into Wine.|$|E
