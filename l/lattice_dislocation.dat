50|$|Despite much investigation, {{the origin}} of the blue colour of Blue John remains uncertain. Microscopic {{analysis}} has failed to find any impurities such as potassium permanganate or hydrocarbons which could produce a purple-blue colour.

The cause of these dislocations is unknown, but one possibility is that it is due to colloidal calcium, i.e. excess of calcium atoms needed to form fluorite. Blue John can be decolourised by heating it in an oven for a few hours, a phenomenon apparently caused by the heat realigning the lattice dislocations removing the colour. Irradiating the discoloured Blue John in a nuclear reactor can bring the colour back.|$|E

40|$|Using atomistic simulations, {{dislocation}} dynamics modeling, and continuum elastic-plastic stress-wave theory, {{we present}} a systematic investigation on shock-induced plasticity in semi-coherent CuNi multilayers. The features of stress wave evolutions in the multilayers, including wave-front stress attenuation and strong interfacial discontinuities, are revealed by atomistic simulations. Continuum models are proposed to explain the shockwave propagation features. The simulations provide insight into microplasticity behaviors including interactions between lattice and misfit dislocations. The formation of hybrid Lomer-Cottrell locks through the attraction and combination of lattice and misfit dislocations is a major mechanism for trapping gliding lattice dislocations at interfaces. The relationship between dislocation activity and dynamic stress wave evolution history is explored. The hybrid Lomer-Cottrell locks can dissociate under shock compression or reverse yielding. This dissociation facilitates slip transmission. The influence of coherent stress causes direction dependency in the slip transmission: a <b>lattice</b> <b>dislocation</b> is transmitted more smoothly across an interface from Ni to Cu than from Cu to Ni.

40|$|Abstract. The basic dynamic {{behavior}} of martensitic interfaces has been analyzed {{within the framework}} of <b>lattice</b> <b>dislocation</b> dynamics. Two limiting cases of the martensitic interface structure have been considered: (a) the case when the interface can be appropriately described in terms of an array of non-interacting (well-spaced) interfacial dislocations and; (b) the case when the interfacial dislocations are so closely spaced that the interface can be approximated by a continuous distribution of dislocations. In the first case, it was demonstrated that, after the inclusion of a “chemical ” driving force in the equation of motion, the dynamics of lattice dislocations can be directly applied to analyze the interfacial dynamics. In the second case, on the other hand, while the <b>lattice</b> <b>dislocation</b> dynamics is still quite relevant, several parameters in the equation of motion have to be redefined to reflect the fact that the interface now acts as a planar defect. For both of the cases of interfacial dislocation structure, we have analyzed the two basic modes of interfacial motion: (a) the continuous mode in which the motion is controlled by various energy-dissipative processes (e. g., phonon and electron drag) and; (b) the discontinuous or jerky mode in which the motion is controlled by the thermal activation of the interface/obstacle interactions...|$|E

40|$|Dislocation-particle {{interactions}} in three alloys systems, Al-Cu, Al-Mg-Sc, and Cu-Co {{have been investigated}} using in situ straining experiments inside the transmission electron microscope, post mortem analysis, and electron tomographic reconstructions. Specifically, diffraction-contrast electron tomography was developed {{during the course of}} this work as a 3 D imaging technique for crystalline systems such that the dislocation and defect arrangement could be fully characterized and spatially-resolved. Micrographs imaged using two-beam and kinematical bright-field and weak-beam dark-field conditions were acquired over an angular range then used to reconstruct the tomograms. Supplemental advances to the technique include: Visualization of dislocations in color based on Burgers vector or other relevant characteristics; determination of the specimen coordinate system in the tomogram; and overcoming the g ∙ b invisibility condition by dual-axes tomography. In the Al-Cu system, which contained Al 2 Cu plate-shaped particles residing on { 001 }Al habit planes, in situ straining experiments revealed glide of <b>lattice</b> <b>dislocations</b> in the coherent side of the particle-matrix interface. The confined dislocations escaped the interface by cross-slip after reaching one end of the Al 2 Cu plate or by shearing the particle, as observed during post mortem analysis. Dislocations bypassed the particles by shear at multiple locations along their length, suggesting that a shearing site becomes more unfavorable with each dislocation passage such that adjacent slip systems must be activated in order to continue shear. When highly deformed, the inter-particle region was shown by electron tomography to be populated with a complex configuration of <b>lattice</b> <b>dislocations</b> pinned at both ends on a particle interface as well as debris created from dislocation-dislocation interactions. In the Cu-Co system, semicoherent Co-rich octahedral particles normally unshearble by <b>lattice</b> <b>dislocations</b> were observed to be sheared by small twins emanating from the Cu matrix. This new deformation behavior was attributed to the high strain rates associated with twinning and a small increase in interfacial energy associated with shearing of Co particles, which has the same stacking as the Cu matrix. Interactions with <b>lattice</b> <b>dislocations,</b> on the other hand, exhibited similar behavior during in situ and post mortem observations as the Al-Mg-Sc system, which contained Al 3 Sc particles. In the semi-coherent regime, between 40 nm and up to around 200 nm for Al 3 Sc and 100 nm for Co, an initial elastic interaction from the misfit strain field gave way to a novel bypass mechanism involving the creation of half-loops attached on one side to the particle interface via bowing and cross-slip while locally pinned at on the particle interface. Bypass of such a particle also involved interfacial dislocations, which increased the complexity of the particle-matrix interface and impeded subsequent bypass of the same particle. In all cases, multiple interactions with <b>lattice</b> <b>dislocations</b> resulted in the evolution of defect structures around a particle over time and the interactions examined were more complex than single dislocation-single particle interactions depicted in classical theoretical models...|$|R

40|$|Deformation {{mechanisms}} {{and the role}} of interfaces in deformation twinning of a two-phase [TiAl({gamma}) /Ti{sub 3 }Al({alpha}{sub 2 }) ] lamellar alloy creep deformed at elevated temperatures have been investigated. Since the multiplication of <b>lattice</b> <b>dislocations</b> within both {gamma} and {alpha}{sub 2 } lamellae is very limited at a low stress level due to a refined lamellar microstructure, the glide of interfacial dislocations on both {gamma}/{alpha}{sub 2 } and {gamma}/{gamma} interfaces (i. e interface sliding) becomes an important deformation mode. Obstacles such as impinged <b>lattice</b> <b>dislocations</b> can impede the movement of interfacial dislocations, which glide in a cooperative fashion along the lamellar interfaces. The impediment of dislocation motion subsequently causes a dislocation pile-up in front of obstacles as creep strain accumulates. When the crystals deform at high stress level, deformation twinning becomes a predominant deformation mode. Deformation twins are found to nucleate from the interfaces {{as a result of a}} local stress concentration generated from dislocation pile-ups.

Most previous research work focuses on either the characterization of individual scale topography, or the optical performance of optical microstructures. There {{is a lack of}} surface characterization methods which are capable of characterizing the surface generation in terms of the form errors and the lattice relationships in the small scale topography of optical microstructures with sub-micrometer accuracy. This paper presents a pattern and feature parametric analysis method (PFPAM) for the characterization of the surface generation of optical microstructures. The method includes data acquisition, data processing and pattern analysis, exploration of and analysis of feature parameters, etc. Digital image processing technology has been employed and a series of <b>lattice</b> <b>dislocation</b> parameters have been developed to characterize the features of the distribution and the dislocation of optical microstructures. To verify the PFPAM, a prototype surface characterization system has been built.
