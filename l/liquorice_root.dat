40|$|Introduction & Objective: The {{side effects}} of drug {{consumption}} and also HSV resistance to drugs have been the factors attracting the researchers to herbal drugs. The major aim of the present research was in vitro assessment of possible anti-herpetic activity of glycyrrhiza gla-bra (<b>liquorices</b> <b>root)</b> methanolic extract in more details by performing Tissue Culture Infec-tive Dose fifty percent (TCID 50) method. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study Vero cells were incubated with different con-centrations of methanolic extracts of glycyrrhiza glabra. Neutral red assay was performed in order to consider the appropriate concentration of the extract. Pre-treatment of Vero cells with glycyrrhiza glabra extract before viral infection, incubation of HSV- 1 with glycyrrhiza glabra extract and treatment of vero cells with extract 1, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after viral in-fection, were exerted. TCID 50 was performed {{in order to assess}} the antiviral activity of the extract. The results were analyzed after performing the experiments at least three times. Results: Pre-treatment of Vero cells with methanolic extract for two hours and incubation of virus with extract for one and two hours prior to viral infection resulted in remarkable drop in TCID 50 amount by significant difference (P < 0. 001). Treatment of Vero cells with extract 1, 8 and 12 hours post-infection demonstrated significant changes in TCID 50. We observed significant fluctuations and different efficacy of the extract between different incubation time at 1 h & 4 h, 1 h & 24 h, 4 h & 8 h, 4 h & 12 h, 8 h & 24 h, 12 h & 24 h. Conclusion: The current study resulted in more novel findings of anti herpetic activity of gly-cyrrhiza glabra extract. Time course of extract treatment with virus- infected cells was an ef-ficient factor. In addition, the pretreatment of virus and also Vero cells with glycyrrhiza gla-bra extract in our experiment had important effects on the anti-viral activity of the extract.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} salt-sensitive signaling molecules on ionic fluxes and gene expression related to K+/Na+ homeostasis in a perennial herb, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, during short-term NaCl stress (100 mM, 24 h). Salt treatment caused more pronounced Na+ accumulation in root cells than in leaf cells. Na+ ions were mostly compartmentalized in vacuoles. Roots exposed to NaCl showed increased levels of extracellular ATP (eATP), cytosolic Ca 2 +, H 2 O 2, and NO. Steady-state flux recordings revealed that these salt-sensitive signaling molecules enhanced NaCl-responsive Na+ efflux, due to the activated Na+/H+ antiport system in the plasma membrane (PM). Moreover, salt-elicited K+ efflux, which was mediated by depolarization-activated cation channels, was reduced {{with the addition of}} Ca 2 +, H 2 O 2, NO, and eATP. The salt-adaptive effects of these molecules (Na+ extrusion and K+ maintenance) were reduced by pharmacological agents, including LaCl 3 (a PM Ca 2 + channel inhibitor), DMTU (a reactive oxygen species scavenger), cPTIO (an NO scavenger), or PPADS (an antagonist of animal PM purine P 2 receptors). RT-qPCR data showed that the activation of the PM Na+/H+ antiport system in salinized roots most likely resulted from the upregulation of two genes, GuSOS 1 and GuAHA, which encoded the PM Na+/H+ antiporter, salt overly sensitive 1 (SOS 1), and H+-ATPase, respectively. Clear interactions occurred between these salt-sensitive agonists to accelerate transcription of salt-responsive signaling pathway genes in G. uralensis roots. For example, Ca 2 +, H 2 O 2, NO, and eATP promoted transcription of GuSOS 3 (salt overly sensitive 3) and/or GuCIPK (CBL-interacting protein kinase) to activate the predominant Ca 2 +-SOS signaling pathway in salinized <b>liquorice</b> <b>roots.</b> eATP, a novel player in the salt response of G. uralensis, increased the transcription of GuSOS 3, GuCIPK, GuRbohD (respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein D), GuNIR (nitrate reductase), GuMAPK 3, and GuMAPK 6 (the mitogen-activated protein kinases 3 and 6). Moreover, GuMAPK 3 and GuMAPK 6 expression levels were enhanced by H 2 O 2 in NaCl-stressed G. uralensis roots. Our results indicated that eATP triggered downstream components and interacted with Ca 2 +, H 2 O 2, and NO signaling to maintain K+/Na+ homeostasis. We propose that a multiple signaling network regulated K+/Na+ homeostasis in NaCl-stressed G. uralensis roots...|$|R

Da die Therapie mit pflanzlichen Extrakten einen hohen Stellenwert hat, wurden die antioxidativen Wirkungen des Phytotherapeutikums STW 5 und seinen Einzelkomponenten sowohl in einem rein chemischen Testsystem (H 2 O 2 / Zymosan- Reaktion) als auch in zellulären Modellen (Histamin-stimulierte Darmwand, Zymosan-stimulierte Mastzellen), die Entzündungsreaktionen simulieren, untersucht. Die Ergebnisse der Zymosan Reaktion zeigten, dass die einzelnen Extrakte und STW 5 konzentrationsabhängig aber in unterschiedlichem Ausmaß antioxidativ wirkten. In den zellulären Modellen wurde nachgewiesen, dass STW 5 und alle seinen Komponenten die Radikalproduktion der Ileumpräparate dosis- abhängig hemmen konnten. Weiterhin wurde untersucht, ob in einem Mehrkomponentenpräparat wie STW 5 Synergien zwischen den Einzelextrakten auftreten und so zur Gesamtwirkung beitragen. Es zeigte sich, dass im chemischen Modell die Wirkungen der Einzelkomponenten additiv zur Gesamtwirkung beitrugen, in den zellulären Modellen die Wirkungen sich supraadditiv verhielten.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to evaluate potential effects of a mixed phytogenic feed additive (FRESTAR F) and two further components (fenugreek seeds and <b>liquorice</b> <b>roots)</b> on a porcine enteropathogenic Eschericha coli-strain. Furthermore, potential effects on the intestinal microbiota and the immune system of weaned piglets were validated. To establish possible anti-adhesive effects of the phytogenic additives to an enteropathogenic E. coli-strain, porcine jejunal epithelial cells (IPEC-J 2) marked by fluorescent dye were examed in a flow cytometry. Additionally the bond capacity of the phytogenic additives towards the E. coli–strain was detected by measuring bacterial growth rate. Antimicrobial influences were investigated by incubating the bacteria with the test materials at different concentrations and measuring the bacterial growth rate. After the in vitro investigations a feeding trial with 48 male castrated piglets was performed for 28 days. The piglets were divided into four groups, which all received a standard piglet diet covering the piglets`needs. For control group A no additive was applicated, the diet for group B was supplemented with 0. 04 % FRESTAR F, in diet C 0. 2 % FRESTAR F was added and the diet for group D was supplemented with 0. 15 % fenugreek seeds. The piglets were vaccinated with a live vaccine against Salmonella Typhimurium (SALMOPORCR, IDT) to investigate the influence on development of specific antibody titers. Blood and tissue samples of the proximal jejunum were taken and the digesta of the duodenum, proximal and distal jejunum, ileum, caecum and colon were collected. Beside zootechnical parameters the apparent digestibility of crude protein, the pH-value and dry matter content of the digesta were measured. The digesta samples were also tested {{for the impact of}} FRESTAR F and fenugreek seeds on the intestinal bacterial metabolites such as lactate and short chain fatty acids. For immunomodulatory investigations, flow cytometric analyses were realised to characterise various immune cell populations in the blood and in the lamina epithelialis of the proximal jejunum. The phagocytic activity of isolated monocytes and granulocytes was analysed by PhagotestR. The proliferation behaviour of peripherial blood lymphocytes was measured after stimulation with pokeweed mitogen, Concanavalin A and Phythaemagglutinin M. Serum concentrations of haptoglobin and Salmonella antibody titers were determined with the help of enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The in vitro investigations could demonstrate potential anti-adhesive effects of the phytogenic feed additives on the enteropathogenic E. coli-strain. As a result of this the relative fluorescence intensity of adhered bacteria to the epithelial cells (IPEC-J 2) was reduced. Inclusion of FRESTAR F resulted in a reduction of 52. 7 %, whereas the addition of fenugreek seeds led to a reduction of 57. 6 %. No antimicrobial effects for the utilised phytogenic products could be proved. Health status and zootechnical parameters of the piglets were not affected by the feed additives in the feeding trials. The pH-values in the distal jejunum, ileum, caecum and colon were significantly reduced by the phytogenics compared to the control group (p< 0. 05). The addition of 0. 2 % FRESTAR F led to an increase of the acetate concentration in the ileum (p< 0. 05). In contrast fenugreek seeds reduced the acetate concentration in the ileum significantly (p< 0. 05) but simultaneously increased slightly the concentrations of propionate, butyrate and valerian acid. The phytogenics did not affect the lactate concentration in the intestine significantly. The addition of fenugreek seeds increased the relative amount of the γδ-T-cell population (TCR 1 +CD 8 α-) in the blood with simultaneuos reduction of antigenpresenting cells (MHCII+CD 5 -) (p< 0. 05). Additional immunological parameters were not affected by the additives. The results assume that the phytogenic additives used in this study have anti-adhesive effects towards an enteropathogenic E. coli-strain. The phytogenic additives also have an impact on a few immune cell populations in the blood and on metabolites of the intestinal microbiota of piglets. Further investigations should be performed to validate the anti-adhesive potentials in animal and to verify the relevance of the observed outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Dear colleagues, {{continuing}} {{the rubric of}} the journal about the treatment of infectious diseases by medicinal plants, we want to present the methods of using medicinal plants as an additional therapy for treatment of viral hepatitis {{in addition to the}} main treatment according to the generally clinical standards of antiviral therapy. Viral hepatitis compiles a large group of human infectious diseases characterized by a predominant liver damage. “Currently, viral hepatitis is recognized as a major public health problem requiring urgent action”, said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General (WHO Global hepatitis report, 2017). Treatment of viral hepatitis is a complex task and involves the use of generally clinical recommendations or standards. There are criteria for determining the need for pharmacotherapy and the most rational scheme for antiviral treatment in every case of viral hepatitis. The purpose of antiviral therapy is to achieve a stable virologic response, to prevent the progression of the disease, the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, at the present stage a stable virologic response in the general population of patients can be achieved in approximately 60 % of cases. In addition, standard antiviral drugs have side effects, are of high cost and are contraindicated in a number of clinical situations, for example, with a {{decrease in the number of}} blood elements (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia), at the stage of decompensated liver cirrhosis. Probably, all this induces to use alternative methods of therapy, which remain popular both among general practitioners and patients with this infection. The question of the treatment of viral hepatitis with medicinal herbs has been studied for a long time. According to some authors, there is no scientific evidence that hepatitis C can be cured by herbs. The only scientifically proven method of fighting the virus is antiviral therapy. However, there are other points of view on this issue. A review of the results of randomized trials on the effectiveness of drugs containing herbs in the treatment of hepatitis C and the advisability of their use in this category of patients found that in 2001 a review was published on the analysis of the efficacy and safety of hepatitis C treatment with drugs based on medicinal herbs (Yarnell E., Abascal K. and others). The authors turned to the register of controlled studies of the hepatobiliary Cochrane group, the Cochrane libraries, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, and also to Chinese and Japanese databases. For the analysis, randomized clinical trials were selected comparing the results of using medicinal herbs (one herb or herb collection) with placebo or no treatment, or with general nonspecific treatment, other methods of phytotherapy or with interferon α (IFN-α) and/or ribavirin. Analysis of randomized clinical trials has shown a proven positive role in the treatment of viral hepatitis following such medicinal herbs as: traditional Chinese herbs, Sophora Japanese (Milk thistle, Silybum marianum), Licorice (<b>Liquorice,</b> sweetwood, licorice <b>root),</b> Andrographis paniculata, St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), Chinese Schisandra chinensis (wu wei zi), Astragalus membranaceus root (huang qi), dandelion root (Taraxacum officinale), root of the great burdock (Arctium lappa), Curcuma longa, root of the red sage (or danshen, Salvia miltiorrhiza), etc. The authors of this article based on available literature data recommend the plant groups used in the treatment of viral hepatitis, principles, as well as prescription of plant collections, the method of preparation and recommendations for the application of the prepared preparations with indication of the dose, the frequency of administration and the duration of phytotherapy for this group of patients. It is indicated at which stage of the disease and which herbs can be added to the collection, depending on the general state and complains of the patient, the causative agent of viral hepatitis and laboratory examination data. For the therapy of viral hepatitis, it was recommended to use medicinal herbs only as an addition to the main treatment with antiviral drugs according to clinical recommendations or standards for the treatment of viral hepatitis...|$|R
