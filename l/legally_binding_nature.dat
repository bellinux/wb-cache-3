50|$|The {{purpose of}} the ritual was to {{establish}} the consummation of the marriage, either factually (with the couple having their first sexual intercourse) or only symbolically, without which the union could in some jurisdictions be annulled. It symbolised the community's involvement in the marriage {{and especially in the}} couple's sexual intimacy, but also their marital fidelity. The <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>nature</b> of the ceremony varied greatly from place to place and through time.|$|E
50|$|As {{rooted in}} idea of {{creating}} open and non-discriminatory energy markets for energy trade, {{a form of}} international accountability for breaching these conditions was necessary to put in place. The treaty is responsible for protection of direct foreign investments.

2500|$|On June 27, 2001, the ICJ, rejecting {{all of the}} United States' arguments, {{ruled in}} favor of Germany. The ICJ held that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 24 April 1963 (Vienna Convention) [...] granted rights to {{individuals}} {{on the basis of its}} plain meaning, and that domestic laws could not limit the rights of the accused under the convention, but only specify the means by which those rights were to be exercised. The ICJ also found that its own provisional measures were <b>legally</b> <b>binding.</b> The <b>nature</b> of provisional measures has been a subject of great dispute in international law; the English text of the Statute of the International Court of Justice implies they are not binding, while the French text implies that they are. Faced with a contradiction between two equally authentic texts of the statute, the court considered which interpretation better served the objects and purposes of the statute, and hence found that they are binding. This was the first time in the court's history it had ruled as such.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} bedding ceremony was to establish the consummation of the marriage, without which the union could be annulled. The <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>nature</b> of the ritual was unclear to many, particularly to lower classes. One marriage in Britain was annulled on the pretext that the bride had run away within 15 minutes of the ritual, and in another case, a clandestine marriage was made public when the pregnant wife shared her husband's deathbed. Public bedding in 18th-century Britain was widely believed to give additional legitimacy to the marriage. In Scotland, although marriage was formed by simple consent and required no formalities or consummation, the bedding rituals were widespread but unstructured; a couple simply wanted someone {{to see them in}} bed together. A couple could also be pressured into marriage in this way: a person stumbling upon an unmarried couple in bed could pronounce them man and wife on the spot.|$|E

40|$|My {{research}} {{introduces the}} issue of the Israeli military detention policies towards Palestinian children in the West Bank (WB) and illustrates how these violate international humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law (IHRL), despite their <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>nature</b> and despite Israel’s obligation to protect Palestinian civilians as protected persons under occupation. My research shows that Israel fails to uphold {{the best interest of the}} child resorting to the detention of Palestinian minors in an “intentional, widespread and systematic manner” (UNICEF, 2013 : 13) and not as a measure of last resort. My research also shows that intentionally targeting Palestinian children is one of several tools Israel adopts to enforce the occupation in the WB. Ultimately, Israeli detention policies are a form of persecution and deny children their right to self-determination. My research applies two methods: legal analysis and interviews. Chapter two discusses Israel’s obligations under IHRL with special reference to the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989 (CRC), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966 (ICCPR) and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of 1984 (CAT) and under IHL with special reference to the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1948 (IV GC). The legal analysis focuses mainly on IHRL and only partially draws on IHL. Finally, chapter three presents the findings from interviews to a number of human rights advocates from Palestinian and international NGOs. The interviews, conducted between March 18 th and May 28 th, 2015, corroborate the legal arguments...|$|E
40|$|YesThe Ad Hoc Group (AHG) of the States Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) {{have touched}} {{from time to}} time on the {{question}} of the organisation needed to implement the <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> instrument being negotiated to strengthen the BTWC.

40|$|A {{global health}} treaty, a Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH) –grounded {{in the right}} to health, with the central goal of {{reducing}} immense domestic and global health inequities–could serve as a robust global governance instrument to underpin the United Nations post- 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It would ensure for all people the three essential conditions for a healthy life–public health, health care, and the positive social determinants of health–while advancing good governance, responding to drivers of health disadvantages for marginalized populations, elevating health in other legal regimes, and enhancing people 2 ̆ 7 s ability to claim their rights. The <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>nature</b> of the FCGH would enhance accountability and compliance through rigorous monitoring and reporting, domestic human rights litigation, and international incentives. It would overcome the collection action problem of global health financing through a health financing framework with clear domestic and international obligations. Stakeholders have made thoughtful critiques of the FCGH, such as the opportunities costs of advocacy, the time and expense of treaty negotiations, and reporting burdens. Nevertheless, these costs could be turned into opportunities through civil society participation in negotiations, {{by taking advantage of}} extensive reporting and monitoring requirements to expand accountability around and strengthen strategies to respond to health inequities, and through non-binding frameworks on the way towards the treaty. The greatest challenge in achieving an FCGH is the political obstacles it will face. Social justice movements united behind an FCGH, to secure the treaty and to ensure its implementation, are vital to the success of an FCGH–and the right to health. With its aim of securing this right, the FCGH could unite disparate health-related movements, all of which should contribute to developing the treaty and taking ownership of its realization...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the age of}} enlightenment, state constructions {{pay tribute}} to the values the (new) {{political}} regime wants to highlight. Next to the solemn preamble that positions the state in general, mostly historical terms, a particular section of the Constitution is devoted to a more detailed enumeration of rights and freedoms, reflecting the quintessence of the political system. Given the <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>nature</b> of constitutional texts, comments mainly originated from the lawyers' side. Ethical-theological reflections hardly interfere at this level, since the principles of Western liberal democracies are deemed to be of a political nature and, moreover, are in most cases generally accepted. The discussion starts when those rights, e. g. on a qualitative life, on the freedom of expression or on social integration, have to be applied in operational terms. Until recently, the EU was only indirectly involved in these debates, since it focused its attention on market integration and international trade issues. The Treaty on European Union (1992), however, triggered by the radical regime change in Central- and Eastern-Europe, has initiated a novel process of self-definition, ending up in a quasi-constitutional set of values and principles to be integrated in the Reform Treaty (2007). Although these principles are shared by all member states, their innovative formulation is primarily taking place at the EU level. Moreover, they are not only perceived as potential political-legal guidelines, but as a system of values. The first and crucial condition for joining the EU, indeed, is the respect for its values and the commitment to promoting them together (Constitutional Treaty, art. 1. 2). Whatever the outcome may be of the negotiation of a revised Constitutional Treaty, {{it is clear that the}} EU has developed into a Community of Values, some of them being formulated in much more operational terms than the traditional constitutions mentioned above. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{patchwork}} of international bodies and treaties manage ocean resources and human activity in areas beyond any state's national jurisdiction. However, these governance bodies vary greatly {{in terms of}} their mandate, which determines their geographic scope, their objective, the <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>nature</b> of decisions they adopt, and whether they regulate one or several activities. Their jurisdictions often overlap, but virtually no mechanisms exist to coordinate across geographic areas and sectors. Too often, this piecemeal governance approach leads to the degradation of the environment and its resources, and makes deploying management and conservation tools such as environmental impact assessments and marine protected areas (MPAs), including marine reserves, challenging both legally and logistically. At the 2010 meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity, States committed to conserve 10 percent of marine environments, a target reaffirmed in the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A 2016 study found that in order to successfully conserve healthy ecosystems and help degraded ones recover, 30 percent of the world's ocean needs protection through MPAs, including reserves. In spite of this global need for marine conservation, less than 1 percent of the high seas are fully protected. States have responded to these governance and conservation gaps by committing to develop an "international legally binding instrument  on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction" through the United Nations. In March 2016, the process began with the first of four meetings in which governments will begin developing an agreement to protect the high seas. With sustained momentum, the United Nations General Assembly could fully adopt a treaty by 2020. The following maps help to illustrate the current governance gaps on the high seas and emphasize the critical need for this treaty. For governance organizations to effectively manage and conserve life on the high seas, three key elements are necessary: regulatory authority, a mandate to conserve the ecosystem as a whole, and the ability to manage across multiple sectors. Although some organizations have two of these three elements, they all lack comprehensive mandates to effectively manage and conserve ecosystems on the high seas...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the nature, content and legal {{implications of the}} constitutional right to development and investigates its (non-) realization by inquiring how development and human rights are being pursued in Ethiopia. In addressing these issues, this study analytically situates the conception {{of the right to}} development as enshrined in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE) Constitution {{within the context of the}} general human rights and development debates, the normative framework of the right to development as established by the United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development (UNDRD) and the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (ACHPR). Thus, it discusses the theoretical and moral basis for linking development and human rights and conceptualizing the claim for development as a distinct human right. It further explores the evolution of the right to development into an international human rights norm and addresses its attendant controversies. It subsequently analyses the nature and content of the right to development as established under the UNDRD and ACHPR before engaging with the issues relating to the FDRE Constitution. This research has employed doctrinal and comparative legal research methodologies and also involved critical analysis of policy documents and data from secondary sources. This research finds that the right to development as enshrined in the FDRE Constitution is enunciated in ambiguous terms and asserts that it needs to be understood within the broader constitutional context of Ethiopia which, in conformity with UNDRD and ACHPR, considers development and human rights to be interdependent and mutually reinforcing projects which can only be realized through such interdependence and mutuality. It further submits that the constitutional right to development generally provides a legally binding normative framework within which development processes in Ethiopia should be pursued and puts a constitutional limit on the power of the State as it relates to development undertakings. It, however, identifies that, despite its <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>nature,</b> the observance of this right is not provided with effective guarantee (enforcement mechanism) as the Ethiopian courts are excluded from enforcing constitutional human rights. This study also claims that the realization of the constitutional right to development has been impeded by the governing ideologies of revolutionary democracy and developmental state which undermine the basic conditions necessary for undertaking development and human rights as interdependent and mutually reinforcing goals of the Constitution. Its review of Ethiopia’s successive development policies reveals the marginal importance given to human rights in general and the two fundamental aspects of the constitutional right to development – the right to active, free and meaningful participation in development and the right to fair distribution of the benefits of development – in particular. Its assessment of Ethiopia’s balance sheet of socio-economic development and human rights in the last decade also attests that development and human rights have been practically disentangled and signals the need for taking the constitutional right to development seriously. ...|$|E
