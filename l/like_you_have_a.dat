Livemusic interviewed Williams on the evening and made a subsequent film, produced by artist Alex Templeton-Ward. When Williams was asked what the point of poetry was, he said: [...] "I'm making this up, I have no idea but here we go. I {{think that it would}} be to express, to share, to relieve, to explore. For me, poetry offers some what of a cathartic experience. I am able to move through emotions and emotional experience particularly, you know, break-ups, difficulties in all the things that I may face, whether that is with an industry or a loved one or whomever, there needs to be an infiltration process, <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> window open over there. That is the purpose of poetry: it is the window that opens, that allows some air in, some other insight, some other possibility so we can explore all that we feel, all that we think but with the space to see more than what we know, because there is so much more than we know. If I didn't open myself to the possibilities of the unknown, then I would be lost." ...|$|E
5000|$|Her newest monograph, Cruel Optimism, was {{published}} in October, 2011, by Duke University Press. This book works across the U.S. and Europe to assess the level of contemporary crisis as neoliberalism wears away the fantasies of upward mobility associated with the liberal state. [...] Cruel optimism manifests as a relational dynamic which individuals create attachment as “clusters of promises” towards desired object-ideas even when they inhibit the conditions for flourishing and fulfilling such promises. Maintaining attachments that sustain the good life fantasy, no matter how injurious or cruel these attachments may be, allows people {{to make it through}} day-to-day life when the day-to-day has become unlivable. Elaborating on the specific dynamics of cruel optimism, Lauren Berlant emphasizes and maintains {{that it is not the}} object itself, but rather the relationship: [...] "A relation of cruel optimism is a double-bind in which your attachment to an object sustains you in life at the same time as that object is actually a threat to your flourishing. So you can’t say that there are objects that have the quality of cruelty or not cruelty, it’s how you have the relationship to them. Like it might be that being in a couple is not a relation of cruel optimism for you, because being in a couple actually makes you feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> grounding in the world, whereas for other people, being in a couple might be, on the one hand, a relief from loneliness, and on the other hand, the overpresence of one person who has to bear the burden of satisfying all your needs. So it’s not the object that’s the problem, but how we learn to be in relation." ...|$|E

Therefore, the district requested that the models be adapted to specifically and explicitly address the needs of English learners. From the TLs’ comments during interviews, it appeared that some teacher complaints about the new curriculum were fueled by a sense that the curriculum was difficult to teach, especially to ELs, because of its emphasis on language-rich text. Joy noted, “because it’s <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> word problem with every page and they don’t understand these things.” Teachers were also not certain of the relevance of the curriculum to their student population.

40|$|Have {{you thought}} of why you get tired or why you get hungry? Something in your body keeps track of time. It is almost <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> clock that tells you all those things. And indeed, in the suparachiasmatic region of our {{hypothalamus}} reside cells which each act like an oscillator, and together form a coherent circadian rhythm to help our body keep track of time. In fact, such circadian clocks {{are not limited to}} mammals but can be found in many organisms including single-cell, reptiles and birds. The study of such rhythms constitutes a field of biology, chronobiology, and forms the background for my research and this thesis. Pioneers of chronobiology, Pittendrigh and Aschoff, studied biological clocks from an input-output view, across a range of organisms by observing and analyzing their overt activity in response to stimulus such as light. Their study was made without recourse to knowledge of the biological underpinnings of the circadian pacemaker. The advent of the new biology has now made it possible to "break open the box" and identify biological feedback systems comprised of gene transcription and protein translation as the core mechanism of a biological clock. My research has focused on a simple transcription-translation clock model which nevertheless possesses many of the features of a circadian pacemaker including its entrainability by light. This model consists of two nonlinear coupled and delayed differential equations. Light pulses can reset the phase of this clock, whereas constant light of different intensity can speed it up or slow it down. This latter property is a signature property of circadian clocks and is referred to in chronobiology as "Aschoff's rule". The discussion in this thesis focus on develop a connection and also a understanding of how constant light effect this clock model...|$|E
40|$|Hey, {{there it}} is. An idea. A {{question}}. Finding {{an answer to}} that question would be really useful, wouldn’t it? I’ll bet that other people would find the answer useful too, since they probably have asked themselves that very same question. Has anyone else made an attempt to answer that question in the literature? Nope. Hmmm [...] . you’ve found a gap in theliterature on an idea that you have identified and in which you are interested. Looks <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> research project on your hands. It is at this point that many people become intimidated. The thought of designing a study, collecting and interpreting data and maybe even publishing the results can be daunting, whether you are familiar with research methods or not. Where do you begin? How do you determine the study design? How do you narrow down your idea to a manageable hypothesis? What statistical tests should you utilize? In other words, help! Even the most seasoned researchers don’t do it all on their own. They, just like new researchers, consult guides and textbooks and enlist the help of statisticians and coders. A research project is a huge undertaking, but it is more manageable than you might think. In this issue of Evidence Based Library and Information Practice you will find a Feature section on research. The articles in this section are designed to act as guides for those new to research or for those needing a refresher. Diane Lorenzetti and Lisa Given {{take a close look at}} qualitative and quantitative research design in their articles. Both these articles will help you choose the most appropriate study design based on your question type. Research can be costly and therefore, funding is often sought. Lynne Langille and Theresa Mackenzie provide valuable and practical advice on how to write a successful grant application. In her two articles, Lisa Goddard identifies a wealth of data that is available to you in web server logs and specific library applications. The possibilities of using such data for research are endless. Once you have all your data collected, Gillian Byrne has some tips on statistical analysis to make sense of your information. The expert advice in these Feature articles will prove to be useful to you time and time again in planning your project. Good luck! While the Feature articles provide guidance, information and advice, also useful in helping you to design a research study are the articles and Evidence Summaries in this (and every other) issue of EBLIP. As critical appraisals of original research articles, the Evidence Summaries describe and identify issues related to methodology, analysis and conclusions. The insight that they provide in terms of how well a study is designed and carried out is invaluable and can be inferred when planning your own study. The same, of course, applies to the original research articles: it is helpful and prudent to find a research article that addresses a question type similar to yours. While your project is likely not exactly the same, you will undoubtedly obtain ideas and inspiration on how to design your own. Perhaps one of the most useful resources, however, is your colleagues. Colleagues will provide different views, point out things that you hadn’t thought of or previously noticed, identify gaps or redundancies, and most importantly, provide support and encouragement. Evidence Summaries in this issue of EBLIP will take you to public libraries in Norway, African American graduate students with library anxiety, and interlibrary lending departments feeling the effects of electronic journals. Articles will examine movement and progress in evidence based library and information practice over the last several years and the eblip research‐practice gap.
