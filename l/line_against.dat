5|$|After {{directing}} {{and writing}} for the stage in New York, Rossen moved to Hollywood in 1937. There {{he worked as a}} screenwriter for Warner Bros. until 1941, and then interrupted his career to serve until 1944 as the chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to organize writers for the effort in World War II. In 1945 he joined a picket <b>line</b> <b>against</b> Warner Bros. After making one film for Hal Wallis's newly formed production company, Rossen made one for Columbia Pictures, another for Wallis and most of his later films for his own companies, usually in collaboration with Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift {{over time}} in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a more {{cautious}} foreign policy. He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard <b>line</b> <b>against</b> Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did state in a 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into the}} game against Mike Bellotti's Oregon Ducks, Oklahoma {{defensive}} coordinator Brent Venables made some major changes to the defensive depth chart after giving up four long running plays {{through the heart of}} the defensive <b>line</b> <b>against</b> Washington. The starters at defensive tackle, cornerback, and strong safety were all demoted, opening opportunities for some freshmen to step up. D.J. Wolfe was replaced by Marcus Walker at cornerback while senior Jason Carter started in place of Keenan Clayton at strong safety. Carter replaced Clayton in the game against Washington after a missed tackle by the freshman led to a Husky touchdown on their first offensive play. Even though all four players at defensive tackle had almost the same number of plays, Steven Coleman was moved {{off the top of the}} depth chart as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Rossen {{joined a}} picket <b>line</b> <b>against</b> Warner Bros, making {{an enemy of}} Jack Warner. Rossen signed a {{contract}} with an independent production company formed by Hal Wallis, who had previously been Warner Bros.' head of production. However Rossen wrote only two full scripts for this company, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers in 1946 and Desert Fury in 1947. In The Strange Love of Martha Ivers Rossen used a short story by John Patrick to introduce the main plot, which was set fifteen years later and which Rossen wrote himself. The relationship between Rossen and Wallis broke down when Rossen received offers from other production companies.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May, Churchill {{ordered the}} BEF to attack southward in {{co-ordination}} with the French First Army under General Georges Blanchard {{to reconnect with}} {{the remainder of the}} French forces. This proposed action was dubbed the Weygand Plan after General Maxime Weygand, appointed Supreme Commander after Gamelin's dismissal on 18 May. On 25 May, Gort had to abandon any hope of achieving this objective and withdrew on his own initiative, along with Blanchard's forces behind the Lys Canal, part of a canal system that reached the sea at Gravelines. Sluice gates had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal <b>Line)</b> <b>against</b> the German advance.|$|E
40|$|Protection {{of medium}} voltage (MV) {{overhead}} <b>lines</b> <b>against</b> the indirect effects of lightning {{is an important}} issue in Malaysia and other tropical countries. Protection of these <b>lines</b> <b>against</b> the indirect effects of lightning is a major concern and can be improved by several ways. The choice of insulator to be used for instance, between the glass, ceramic or polymer, can help to improve the line performance from the perspective of increasing the breakdown strength. In this paper, the electrical performance of a 10 kV polymer insulator under different conditions for impulse, weather and insulator angle with respect to a cross-arm were studied (both experimental and modelling) and the results were discussed accordingly. Results show that the weather and insulator angle (with respect to the cross-arm) are surprisingly influenced the values of breakdown voltage and leakage current for both negative and positive impulses. Therefore, in order to select a proper protection system for MV <b>lines</b> <b>against</b> lightning induced voltage, consideration of the local information concerning the weather and also the insulator angles with respect to the cross-arm are very useful for line stability and performance...|$|R

5|$|Stirling {{still held}} the <b>line</b> <b>against</b> Grant on the American right, to the west. He held on for four hours, still {{unaware of the}} British {{flanking}} maneuver, {{and some of his}} own troops thought that they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant was reinforced by 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling's center by 11:00, and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back, but British troops were coming at him from the rear, south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer's millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, {{on the other side of}} Brooklyn Heights.|$|E
5|$|The 45th Infantry Division, {{along with}} the 7th Infantry Division, fought off {{repeated}} Chinese attacks all along the front line throughout 1952, and Chinese forces frequently attacked Old Baldy Hill into the fall of that year. Around that time, the 45th Infantry Division relinquished command of Old Baldy Hill to the 2nd Infantry Division. Almost immediately the Chinese launched a concentrated attack on the hill, overrunning the U.S. forces. Heavy rainstorms prevented the divisions from retaking the hill for around a month, {{and when it was}} finally retaken it was heavily fortified to prevent further attacks. The 245th Tank Battalion was sent to assault Chinese positions throughout late 1952, but most of the division held a stationary defensive <b>line</b> <b>against</b> the Chinese.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian {{government}} attacked JNA garrisons {{and arms}} depots {{throughout the country}} on 14 September– an offensive dubbed the Battle of the Barracks. Vukovar's JNA barracks {{was one of those}} attacked that day, but the JNA managed to defend it. In retaliation, Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar from the direction of Negoslavci, forcing about 2,000 people to flee. There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from depots captured elsewhere, enabling them to hold the <b>line</b> <b>against</b> JNA attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{fight at}} Masan {{remained}} a bitter stalemate {{during the entire}} six weeks of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter. Each side attempted several offensives on the other {{in an attempt to}} force a withdrawal, but the North Koreans were unable to pierce the UN perimeter, and the UN troops were unable to overwhelm the North Koreans to the point they were forced to withdraw. The battle itself was a tactical tie, since neither side could decisively defeat the other, however the UN units achieved their strategic goal of preventing the North Koreans from advancing further east and threatening Pusan. Instead, they were able to hold the <b>line</b> <b>against</b> repeated attacks until the Inchon attack, and were thus successful in defeating the North Korean army in subsequent engagements.|$|E
5|$|The ship saw {{significant}} service {{during the}} First Balkan War of 1912–13. At {{the start of}} the war, Asar-i Tevfik was suffering from boiler trouble, which necessitated repairs that lasted until 9 November. She was then sent to support the Ottoman troops defending the Çatalca <b>Line</b> <b>against</b> Bulgarian troops. She took up a position off Tekirdağ to provide gunfire support. After the Bulgarians occupied the town, she bombarded their positions, but the attack had little effect. The ship was then moved to Büyükçekmece, where she joined the rest of the fleet. They had no contact with Bulgarian forces during this period.|$|E

5|$|The {{usefulness}} of the Great Wall as a defence <b>line</b> <b>against</b> northern nomads became questionable under the Qing dynasty, since their territory encompassed vast areas {{inside and outside the}} wall: China proper, Manchuria, and Mongolia were all under Qing control. So instead, the Great Wall became the means to limit Han Chinese movement into the steppes. In the case of Manchuria, considered to be the sacred homeland by the ruling Manchu elites, some parts of the Ming Liaodong Wall were repaired so it could serve to control Han Chinese movement into Manchuria alongside the newly erected Willow Palisade.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Ngô Đình Nhu {{was known}} to favor an even harder <b>line</b> <b>against</b> the Buddhists.

Nhu had made statements calling for {{the suppression of the}} protests through his English-language newspaper, the Times of Vietnam. There were persistent reports that Nhu was seeking to usurp power from his elder brother and to attack the Buddhists. Nick Turner of Reuters approached Nhu and interviewed him about these rumors. Nhu said that if the Buddhist crisis were not resolved, he would stage a coup, demolish Xá Lợi in two hours, and head a new anti-Buddhist government. The news was promptly published, which the American embassy largely disregarded, purportedly unconvinced as to Nhu's seriousness.|$|E
5|$|By 1675 the Swedish fleet was numerically {{superior}} to its Danish counterpart (18 ships of the <b>line</b> <b>against</b> 16, 21 frigates against 11), but the Swedish ships were generally older and of poorer quality than the Danish, which had replaced {{a larger proportion of}} its vessels with more modern warships. The Swedish side also had problems with routine maintenance, and both rigging and sails were generally in poor condition. Swedish crews lacked the level of professionalism of Danish and Norwegian sailors, who often had experience from service in the Dutch merchant navy, and the Swedish Navy lacked a core of professional officers while the Danish had seasoned veterans like Cort Adeler and Nils Juel. The Danish fleet was reinforced with Dutch units under Philip van Almonde and Cornelis Tromp, the latter an experienced officer who had served under Michiel de Ruyter.|$|E

5|$|General Dean, the divisional commander, was {{angered by}} the poor {{performance}} of the 34th Infantry Regiment during the battle. He allegedly was upset that the regiment retreated so quickly without attempting to further delay the North Koreans. He considered ordering the regiment back north immediately but {{did not do so}} for fear of ambush. Dean replaced the commander of the 34th Infantry, Colonel Lovless, and ordered the 3rd Battalion back north, but when it encountered North Korean resistance it immediately became disorganized and was forced to withdraw. The engagement at Pyongtaek had caused a significant decline in morale among American forces fighting on the peninsula, and this would continue until victories at Inchon and the Pusan Perimeter allowed them to go on the offensive. Dean took the blame for the defeat himself, and historians consider him at least partially at fault for expecting one inexperienced battalion to hold the <b>line</b> <b>against</b> a numerically superior enemy who was well-trained.|$|E

5|$|In Britain the {{campaign}} emphasised the important lesson previously {{demonstrated in the}} Trafalgar campaign of the year before, that it was immensely difficult in {{the vastness of the}} Atlantic Ocean to detect and intercept French squadrons at sea: only off their own harbours and in the confined waters of the Caribbean were they vulnerable to detection and attack by British squadrons. The inadequate size and power of convoy escorts and the expense in resources employed in chasing French squadrons at sea meant that British trade was placed at risk by the depredations of independent French squadrons, and the maintenance of a tight blockade was essential. The British grip on French maritime travel was a constant source of irritation to Napoleon, who instigated a massive shipbuilding program with the intention of breaking the blockade: by 1808 he was able to muster over 80 ships of the <b>line</b> <b>against</b> the British blockade squadrons.|$|E
