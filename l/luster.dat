40|$|Two {{test bed}} {{concentrators}} (TBCs) {{were designed to}} provide high-performance test beds for advanced solar receivers and converters. However, the second-surface silvered-glass mirror facets on the TBCs, which were originally manufactured by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, have experienced severe silver corrosion. To restore reflectance, TBC- 2 was refurbished with a <b>lustering</b> technique developed at Sandia National Laboratories. In the <b>lustering</b> technique, second-surface silvered thin-glass mirrors were applied over the corroded facets, thereby increasing the dish reflectivity and raising the available power of TBC- 2 from approximately 70 to 78 kW{sub t}. Degradation of the original optical accuracy of the TBC facets {{was determined to be}} minimal. <b>Lustering</b> was chosen over facet replacement because of the lower cost, the anticipated improvement in corrosion resistance, and the shorter project duration.
