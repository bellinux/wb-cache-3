5|$|As {{a result}} of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now {{comprises}} at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The latter are quarried for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. The Mendips were considerably higher and steeper 200 to 300million years ago, and subsequent erosion has resulted in a range of surface features including gorges, dry valleys, screes, swallets and others typical of karst landscapes. These are complemented underground by a large number of caves both beneath the plateau and {{at the base of the}} southern escarpment. Wookey Hole is one example of the caves of the area. There are also areas of <b>limestone</b> <b>pavement</b> and other karst features. Dissolution of the limestone produced many of the gorges including Cheddar Gorge and Burrington Combe. Springs are a common feature of the eastern part of the hills, a number of which have associated tufa deposits.|$|E

Features of this are the many rare species found; prehistory sites such as Gettlinge and Eketorp; numerous old wooden windmills left standing, some of which date to the 17th century; and the special geological alvar landscape.|$|E

25|$|In more upland areas, drier {{habitats}} include calcareous grassland, {{which is}} very rare in a Northern Ireland context covering only 0.1% of the total land area, and which in only ten years, between 1990–2000, underwent a 7% decrease in coverage. Calcareous grassland is species rich, typified by blue moor-grass, wild-mountain thyme, lady's bedstraw, fairy flax and lady's-mantle as well as fescue grasses, sweet vernal grass, bent grass, crested dog's-tail grass, carnation sedge Cyperaceae and devil's-bit scabious on the thin layer of soil which covers the limestone rock. Within this type of habitat, <b>limestone</b> <b>pavement</b> can also often be found, which can promote an even greater diversity of species.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dominant}} environmental {{feature of}} the island is the Stora Alvaret, a <b>limestone</b> <b>pavement</b> which is the habitat of numerous rare and endangered species. [...] The first known scientific study of the biota of the Stora Alvaret occurred in the year 1741 with the visit of Linnaeus.|$|E
2500|$|The area of Boho {{is replete}} with karst {{features}} such as potholes, <b>limestone</b> <b>pavement,</b> dry valleys due to the [...] predominant limestone bedrock [...] which gives it significance at a national level. The specific types of bedrock take their names from local townlands such as Carn Limestone, Knockmore Limestone and Knockmore Sandstone.|$|E
50|$|Conditions for <b>limestone</b> <b>pavements</b> {{are created}} when an {{advancing}} glacier scrapes away overburden and exposes horizontally bedded limestone, with subsequent glacial retreat {{leaving behind a}} flat, bare surface. Limestone is slightly soluble in water and especially in acid rain, so corrosive drainage along joints and cracks in the limestone can produce slabs called clints isolated by deep fissures called grikes or grykes (terms derived from a northern English dialect). If the grykes are fairly straight and the clints are uniform in size, the resemblance to man-made paving stones is striking, but often they are less regular. <b>Limestone</b> <b>pavements</b> that develop beneath a mantle of topsoil usually exhibit more rounded forms.|$|R
50|$|The medium {{valley of}} the Miera River, that mostly coincides with the {{municipality}} of Miera, is trapped between the abrupt karstic <b>limestone</b> <b>pavements</b> of Porracolina to the East, and Las Enguizas to the West, both belonging to the Urgonian Complex.|$|R
50|$|Its {{headquarters}} {{are near}} Kendal {{and at the}} edge of the Lake District National Park, but most of the reserves are outside the National Park.

2500|$|Some relict {{species from}} the glacial age {{are among the}} flora palette of the Stora Alvaret. [...] A wide variety of wildflowers and other plants are found on the <b>limestone</b> <b>pavement</b> ecosystem. [...] Some of the species found include stonecrop, dropwort, Artemisia Öelandica (endemic to Öland), and kidney vetch.

2500|$|North of Gargrave the Pennine Way ascends Airedale {{and enters}} the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It follows field paths, through the small villages of Airton and Hanlith to the larger village of Malham. It then climbs steps {{on the west side}} of Malham Cove, {{traverses}} the <b>limestone</b> <b>pavement</b> at the top of the cove, and continues north to Malham Tarn. The trail then crosses a shoulder of Fountains Fell, crosses the head of Silverdale and ascends the nose of Pen-y-Ghent in a very steep section. From the summit of Pen-y-Ghent the Pennine Way descends to the village of Horton in Ribblesdale (on the Settle–Carlisle Railway).|$|E
2500|$|The yew {{woodland}} in {{the park}} is known as Reenadinna Wood. It is about [...] in size and is located on low-lying karst <b>limestone</b> <b>pavement</b> between Muckross Lake and Lough Leane on Muckross Peninsula. Yew woodland is the rarest habitat type {{in the park}}. Yew woodlands {{are one of the}} rarest types of woodland in Europe, mostly restricted to western Ireland and southern England. It has priority habitat status under Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive. Reenadinna Wood {{is also one of the}} largest woods that are dominated by common yew (Taxus baccata L.) in the UK and Ireland. It is the only significant area of yew woodland in Ireland and is one of just three pure yew woodlands in Europe. It is of considerable ecological and conservation interest, as yew is rarely a woodland dominant. The western limit of the wood lies along the geological boundary with Devonian Old Red Sandstone. The wood is bounded to the east by parkland where the limestone no longer outcrops. Muckross bog, a raised bog [...] in area, is in the southern part of the wood. There are hollows between the limestone outcrops. Deep rendzina soils have developed in some of the hollows. It is estimated that the wood developed 3,000–5,000 years ago.|$|E
50|$|The {{mountain}} {{is located in}} a limestone karst region, with the Križ Plateau (Kriški podi) below it being a typical example. The area has been heavily shaped by erosion, caused by glaciation, rivers, and precipitation; as a result, it has many caves, sinkholes, and <b>limestone</b> <b>pavements.</b>|$|R

50|$|Limestone is {{partially}} soluble, especially in acid, and therefore forms many erosional landforms. These include <b>limestone</b> <b>pavements,</b> pot holes, cenotes, caves and gorges.

It is therefore usually associated with hills and downland, and occurs in regions with other sedimentary rocks, typically clays.|$|R
