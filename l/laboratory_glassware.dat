25|$|A {{condenser}} is a {{piece of}} apparatus or equipment {{that can be used to}} condense, that is, to change the physical state of a substance from its gaseous to its liquid state; in the laboratory, it is generally used in procedures done with organic liquids brought into gaseous state through heating or application of vacuum (lowered pressure), though processes often involve at least trace amounts of the common inorganic component water, and can involve other inorganic substances as well. Condensers can be applied at various scales, from micro-scale (very few microliters) to process-scale (many liters), using <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> and occasionally metalware that accomplishes the cooling of the vapor generated by boiling (through heating or application of vacuum).|$|E

25|$|Gunther is an Australian of German and Scots ancestry, born in Melbourne on 15 August 1950. He {{attended}} Preston East Primary School from 1955 to 1956, and Balwyn North Primary School from 1956 until 1962. For his tenth birthday, Gunther {{received a}} copy of the now famous book entitled The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments from an older cousin. Inspired by the book, he started working on various experiments, making use of various chemicals that could be found around in his house. After he spilled some potassium permanganate solution on his bedroom carpet his mother confined him to an alcove in the garage which he turned into a small laboratory, replete with industrial chemicals and second-hand <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware.</b> Gunther was interested in finding out how things like detergents and oils were composed by cracking them in his fractionating column. He took particular interest in mixing paints for his art classes, as well as his chemistry classes in Balwyn High School. His father, being the Superintendent of Melbourne's electrical power station, borrowed an organic chemistry text from the chemists in the quality control laboratory. This ultimately led to an intense interest in synthesizing Azo dyes. At around age 14, Gunther attempted to predict the color of azo dyes based on the chromophore-auxochrome combination. Apart from drawing up empirical tables, this effort was largely unsuccessful due to his lack of knowledge of quantum theory.|$|E

Beginning in the 1960 s and continuing into the 1980 s, BNL disposed of <b>laboratory</b> waste (<b>glassware,</b> chemicals and animal carcasses) in numerous shallow pits. The drivers for remediating the pits are; historical records that indicate hazardous materials may have been disposed of in the pits; ground water contamination down gradient of the pits; a test excavation of one of the glass holes that unearthed laboratory glass bottles with unidentified liquids still contained; and the fact that BNL rests atop an EPA designated sole-source aquifer. The specific site chosen for this demonstration was pit G- 11. The requirements that lead to choosing this pit were; a well characterized pit and a relatively isolated pit where our construction operations would not impact on adjacent pits. The glass holes area, including pit G- 11, was comprehensively surveyed using a suite of geophysical techniques (e. g., EM- 31, EM- 61, GPR). Prior to stabilizing the waste form a subsurface barrier was constructed to contain the entire waste pit. The pit contents were then stabilized using a cement grout applied via jet grouting. The stabilization was performed to make removal of the waste from the pit easier and safer in terms of worker exposure. The grouting process would mix and masticate the waste and grout and form a single monolithic waste form.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityObjectives The objective of this dissertation is to understand factors that affect the adoption of chemical management policies in academic laboratories ranging from reduction of wastes through chemical surplus sharing (CSS), provision of health and safety information through web-based sources and creation of safety cultures in response to accidents. The findings of these papers provide information for academic environmental health and safety (EHS) professionals, chemical managers and policy makers that can improve chemical management and health and safety in academic laboratories. Design/Methods Three research projects were conducted for this dissertation. The first paper is an investigation of CSS conducted using a survey with statistical analysis. Information was collected from EHS personnel at {{institutions of higher education}} where CSS programs have been in place. Respondents at many of these institutions considered their CSS programs successful. This investigation derived criteria for evaluating the success of a CSS program and identified elements critical for program success. The second paper examines the utility of chemical information for laboratory personnel which consisted of a multi-pronged web-based exercise. The study used interviews, hypothetical problem sets and observations to document subjects' experience with and reactions to chemical information presented on several websites to determine the embeddedness of the information. Both technically trained (graduate students) and nontechnically trained personnel (custodians, <b>laboratory</b> technicians and <b>glassware</b> washers) who come into contact with chemicals at two major research universities in Massachusetts were recruited to participate in this exercise. The third project was a case study conducted using qualitative analysis to investigate the relationship between laboratory accidents and safety culture. Interviews with stakeholders, including EHS directors, staff, regulators and students, who have key roles in minimizing laboratory risks, were conducted at three institutions where laboratory accidents have occurred. The goal was to determine whether changes made by the institutions resulting from the accidents addressed the causes of the accidents and were sufficient to promote a strong safety culture. Setting The setting for this dissertation was academic institutions; particularly environmental health and safety departments and chemistry laboratories at those institutions. Main Outcome Communication, information, and culture play critical roles in university laboratories. Exchange of information facilitates best practices such as waste minimization, assessment of hazards and promotes safety culture. The research discovered how information can modify and improve the way ongoing activities such as purchasing, hazard identification, and training are undertaken, and how information can impact chemical management policies, worker/student understanding of risk, and overall safety culture. The research suggests that management commitment to safety is a prerequisite for the successful adoption of these practices and policies. Results Paper 1 research documents that the use of CSS programs exist at many universities in North America. These programs have the potential to minimize hazardous waste and reduce costs associated with waste disposal to the university by reducing the amount of chemicals purchased and later disposed of as hazardous waste. This investigation derived criteria for evaluating the success of a CSS program and identified elements critical for program success. The key factors associated with success included communication in the form of advertising, and information in the forms of chemical inventory and website access played critical roles in successful CSS programs. The goal of Paper 2 was to investigate whether access to alternative sources of chemical information can increase the awareness and understanding of chemical hazards and improve the effectiveness of chemical management in university research laboratories. The research provided insight into the benefits and characteristics of enhanced chemical safety information for students and lab workers. The research found that for web-based information to be useful and actionable, it must be embedded in the search routines of lab personnel. That is the information must be in the right place, in the right format, at the right time. Subjects valued sites significantly differently based on their perceptions of embeddedness. Their ratings affected their stated desire to return to the sites in the future with the exception of Google. The research also found that Google dominates searches for web-based information and that for alternative sources to be found, they must rank high in Google searches. Purveyors of web-based information should consider this when designing sites. Paper 3 examined three academic laboratory accidents and the changes that came about {{as a result of the}} accidents at each institution and their impact on safety culture there and elsewhere. Regulatory structures intended to oversee university laboratories and their precautionary effectiveness were also assessed. This investigation confirmed that accidents are catalysts for changes in safety practice. In each case studied, the accident ushered in improvements in EHS practice at that institution. Because of the accessibility of news and communication avenues these accidents have an impact on other academic institutions as well. Safety culture was found to consist of procedural elements and behavioral elements. The procedural elements were found to be in the safety climate category and the behavioral elements were in the safety culture category. Communication was found to be a tool that is integral to the safety culture and safety practice at any institution. Internal communication represents a ready-made vehicle for promoting transparency, waste minimization, hazard and emergency planning. Conclusion Staff and students in academic laboratories face a host of risks arising from exposures to chemicals they are using. Effective efforts to reduce these risks require policies and practices that provide them with information on relevant techniques, on chemical hazards, and on procedures that reduce chemical waste and the likelihood of accidents. Equally, they require a strong safety culture that promotes communication among students and staff and is built on management commitment to safety and adoption of best practices...|$|R
