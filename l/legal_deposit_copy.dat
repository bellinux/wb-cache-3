40|$|This article {{describes}} the present status of China National Bibliography and bibliograhic control in China. In China, there isn’t any <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> law, {{but there are some}} regulations promulgated by the State Council and the General Administration of Press and Publications (GAPP, 新闻出版总署) under the State Council. According to these regulations, <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> of books, journals, newspapers and A/V materials should be sent to the GAPP (1 copy), the National Depository Library (NDL, 中国版本图书馆) under GAPP (1 copy) and the National Library of China (NLC, 中国国家 图书馆) (3 copies). Sometimes, however, these regulations are not very effective. Because NLC is not responsible for the ISBN registration and there is no <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> law, NLC is very hard to acquire all the new publications of China. Publishers give their top priority to the <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> to GAPP and then to NLC. Acquisitions librarians have to contact publishers every year to remind them to send <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> and prepare reports to GAPP, so that GAPP can {{pay more attention to the}} NLC <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> issues in their management of publications. The <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> rate is about 70 %, not including children’s books, juvenile books, school textbooks and teacher’s manuals. To make the collection and the bibliographical databases as complete as possible, NLC has to pay extra money to purchase books without <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>copies.</b> In recent years, NLC discusses the <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> issues regularly with GAPP to ask them to implement related regulations more strictly.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the issues {{surrounding}} the implementation, monitoring and management of <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> in South Africa. <b>Legal</b> <b>deposit</b> is a statutory obligation which requires that a producer of any type of publication which is available to the public, be it a commercial, public or private organisation or an individual, deposit one or more copies of the publication with a recognised national institution. The <b>Legal</b> <b>Deposit</b> Act of 1997 governs the deposit of publications in South Africa. Section 8 of the <b>Legal</b> <b>Deposit</b> Act makes provision for the constitution of a <b>Legal</b> <b>Deposit</b> Committee to oversee the implementation of the Act. This Committee, which consists of a broad spectrum of role players, expressed a need for an investigation into the many issues and questions relating to the provision of publications subject to <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> as required by the <b>Legal</b> <b>Deposit</b> Act. Although the <b>Legal</b> <b>Deposit</b> Act, at the time of its promulgation in 1998, was one of the first in the world to make provision for the deposit of electronic publications, this study focuses mainly on the <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> of books as this was identified by the Committee as an area of immediate and critical concern. The study begins with a comprehensive literature study to obtain sufficient theoretical information on <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> and of the problems and issues surrounding the subject internationally and in South Africa. - An overview of elements and issues covered in <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> legislation provides the background against which the investigation into the state of <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> and its implementation is undertaken. With the aim of contextualising South African legislative issues, a comparative study of legislation in the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia and South Africa is also undertaken. -A discussion of the stages and activities involved in <b>legal</b> <b>deposit,</b> the need for monitoring and enforcement procedures and the external and internal factors that influence the way in which <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> is implemented in a country, provides an overall understanding of the <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> process -The implementation of <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> also depends on the committed participation of various role players. The individual roles and needs of these stakeholders in the <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> process are identified. The empirical investigation was conducted in two stages. The first phase of the study involved a survey to explore the attitudes, opinions and actions of publishers and <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> libraries, as the two main role players, to determine how these factors affect the successful implementation of <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> in South Africa. This forms the bulk of the study. The second phase of the study consisted of a feasibility study to determine the state of compliance with <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> in the country The outcomes of the empirical study were used to identify gaps and weaknesses in the current <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> system. This formed the basis to make recommendations for the improvement of procedures, methods and services. Areas critical to the successful implementation of a <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> system are highlighted. The study concludes with a view to the future. The importance of implementing a sustainable system of <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> on which the development of an effective system for the <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> of electronic publications can be built, is stressed.
