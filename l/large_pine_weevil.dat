50|$|Hylobius abietis or the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> is a beetle {{belonging}} to Curculionidae family. This species {{is widely regarded}} as the most important pest of most commercially important coniferous trees in European plantations. Seedlings planted or arising from natural regeneration (germinated seed-fall) after clear felling operations are especially at risk. The adult weevils cause damage by eating the bark of seedlings around the 'collar' of the stem, thus 'ring-barking' the tree seedling which usually results in its demise.|$|E
50|$|Beetles, moths and weevils {{can also}} damage trees, but the {{majority}} do not cause serious harm. Notable exceptions include the <b>Large</b> <b>Pine</b> <b>Weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis), which can kill young conifers, the Spruce Bark Beetle (Ips typographus) which can kill spruces, and the Cockchafer (Melolontha melolontha) which eats young tree roots and can kill in a dry season. Rabbits, squirrels, voles, field mice, deer, and farm animals can pose a significant threat to trees. Air pollution, acid rain, and wildfire represent the main environmental hazards.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to being an efficient disperser, P. pinaster is known to produce oleoresins, such as oily terpenes or fatty acids, which can inhibit other species within the community from growing. These resins are produced as a defense mechanism against insect predators, such as the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> According to an experiment done in Spain, the resin canal density was twice as high in the P. pinaster seedlings attacked by the weevils compared to the unattacked seedlings. Since P. pinaster {{has the ability to}} regulate their production of defense mechanisms, it can protect itself from predatory in an energy-efficient manner. The resins make the P. pinaster less vulnerable to damage from insects, but they are only produced in high concentrations when P. pinaster is under attack. In other words, P. pinaster does not waste energy producing resins in safe conditions, so the conserved energy can be used for growth or reproduction. These characteristics enhance the ability of P. pinaster survive and flourish in the areas it invades. Both the traits of P. pinaster and the habitat in South Africa are conducive to the success of P. pinaster in this region of the world.|$|E
50|$|The <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> have a {{tendency}} to attack artificially fertilized trees, especially those fertilized with phosphorus which causes greater nutritional quality of phloem for the weevils or make faster more attractive plants for the weevils due to faster growing.|$|R
50|$|Adults can {{be found}} all year long {{although}} they usually hibernate during the cold winter months.The reproduction ready images are attracted to freshly cut stumps of conifers. Eggs are deposited singly (one or two per day) under the ground into stamp thick roots or in the soil in their vicinity. <b>Large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> can locate spots {{on the ground to}} dig into in a great precision using olfactory cues. Mating also usually takes place in the soil.To get maturation, adults feed on the bark and phloem of seedlings and young conifers, but sometimes also deciduous trees, causing severe growth loss, stem deformities sand increased mortality. Thus, in the years following the clearing of plots and planting of new seedlings, adults that hatch in large numbers may cause a plague.|$|R
40|$|Damage {{caused by}} the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil,</b> Hylobius abietis (L) feeding on conifer {{seedlings}} {{is a major problem}} in reforested areas in many parts of Europe. The adult weevil feeds on the stem-bark of young seedlings, frequently killing a large proportion of newly planted seedlings. The aims of the studies underlying this thesis were to investigate whether additional food supplies could decrease the damage caused by <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> to seedlings, and to determine whether access to extra food might explain why seedlings beneath shelter trees receive less damage from <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> compared to seedlings planted in a clear-cutting. A survey was conducted to study what effect removing shelter trees has on the level of damage <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> cause to seedlings. Finally, the influence of factors including fertilization, establishment and soil scarification on the growth and tolerance of Norway spruce seedlings to <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding was studied. <b>Pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage to seedlings was significantly reduced when extra food (fresh branches of Scots pine) was regularly provided nearby. Feeding by <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> in the crowns of large trees occurred during a limited period following their migratory flight but {{did not seem to be}} sufficient enough to explain the lower feeding pressure observed on seedlings in shelterwoods over the entire season. During the first year after cutting, roots in the humus layer seemed to be an important food source but were utilized to similar extent in both clear-cuts and shelterwoods. Thus, findings reported provided valuable knowledge about <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding on seedlings and other food sources but could not fully explain why seedlings planted beneath shelter trees receive less <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage compared to seedlings planted on an open clear-cutting. Before the removal of shelter trees, Norway spruce and Scots pine seedlings need to have reached diameters of 10 - 12 mm in order to avoid lethal levels of damage from <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> attack. Loading Norway spruce seedlings with nutrients in the autumn before plantation did not lead to more feeding from <b>pine</b> <b>weevils.</b> Treatments that postpone the start of <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding enhanced the ability of seedlings to sustain <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage later on, probably as a result of reduced stress allowing a more rapid establishment of seedlings...|$|R
40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are pathogens {{which require}} an insect host to fulfil their life cycle and {{are commonly used}} as biocontrol agents. Studies have shown {{that a combination of}} EPN and EPF can result in greater insect mortality when compared to the agents applied alone. This interaction could possibly reduce the cost and quantities of single dose applications, inferring a synergistic effect. However, combinations of these pathogens may also result in additive or antagonistic interactions which would be of no benefit to growers. Hylobius abietis (<b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil)</b> and Otiorhynchus sulcatus (black vine weevil) cause economic damage to forestry and horticultural crops, respectively. <b>Large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae develop in the tree stumps, emerge as adults and feed on the bark of newly planted saplings, causing extensive mortality. Black vine weevil larvae kill plants by feeding on the roots and adults cause cosmetic damage. In this investigation, laboratory and field trials were conducted against <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae to determine whether interactions occur if EPN and EPF were applied simultaneously. EPN and EPF have already been shown to interact synergistically against the vine weevil in laboratory conditions. These experiments were repeated to investigate if synergistic interactions could be reproduced. Synergistic interactions were found with EPN and EPF against the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> in some laboratory experiments. However, antagonism and additivity were also recorded and synergism could not be predictably achieved. The field trial against the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> resulted in additivity. This indicates that the combined application of EPN and EPF would not be a better option than single applications. Initial interaction experiments against the black vine weevil did not show similar results to previous publications. However, larvae used in previous publications were younger than in this investigation which may indicate that interactions are dependent on larval age...|$|E

The adult <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> feeds on the stem bark of young seedlings, frequently killing a large proportion of newly planted seedlings. Planting beneath a shelterwood has proved to reduce <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage on conifer seedlings, but the reasons for this are not yet fully understood. One suggestion that has been put forward is that the shelterwood provides alternative food sources, which are not present in clearcuts, for the weevils. The aims of the studies underlying this thesis were to investigate the possibility that additional food supplies could decrease damage to seedlings, to quantify <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding on roots in the humus layer and to examine the possibility that increased feeding on roots in the shelterwood could explain the observed difference in feeding damage to planted seedlings. The effect of removing shelter trees on <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage to seedlings was examined in a survey study. <b>Pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage on seedlings was significantly reduced when extra food (fresh branches of Scots pine) was regularly provided close to the seedling. The above ground part of natural field vegetation, mainly bilberry, did not reduce the damage to the same extent. Roots in the humus layer comprised an important food resource for the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> and during the first year after cutting it was utilised to similar extents in both clearcuts and shelterwoods. Roots from other species, like bilberry, were less abundant but were also utilised by the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> After final cutting of shelter trees the area was invaded by immigrating <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> in the spring, which damaged the seedlings.

Weevils feeding on the stem bark of newly planted seedlings often cause high mortality {{in the first three}} to five years after planting following clear-cutting. The aims of the work underlying this thesis were to obtain more knowledge about the effects of selected regeneration methods (scarification, shelterwoods, and feeding barriers) that can reduce <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage to enable more effective counter-measures to be designed.

This genetic pattern tends to confirm the high dispersal ability of the weevil and the influence of human-mediated expansion of its range through conifer plantations across Europe since the 19 th century.

However, host-race formation is not observed in H. abietis; we discuss this result in the light of our current knowledge of this insect's biology.

We investigated the factors affecting the efficacy of entomopathogenic nematodes in {{the control of the}} <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> spanning 10 years of field experiments, by means of a meta-analysis of published studies and previously unpublished data. We investigated two species with different foraging strategies, the âambusherâ Steinernema carpocapsae, the species most often used at an operational level, and the âcruiserâ Heterorhabditis downesi. Efficacy was measured both by percentage reduction in numbers of adults emerging relative to untreated controls and by percentage parasitism of developing weevils in the stump. Both measures were significantly higher with H. downesi compared to S. carpocapsae. General linear models were constructed for each nematode species separately, using substrate type (peat versus mineral soil) and tree species (pine versus spruce) as fixed factors, weevil abundance (from the mean of untreated stumps) as a covariate and percentage reduction or percentage parasitism as the response variable. For both nematode species, the most significant and parsimonious models showed that substrate type was consistently, but not always, the most significant variable, whether replicates were at a site or stump level, and that peaty soils significantly promote the efficacy of both species.

40|$|The <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis; Coleoptera: Curculionidae) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} damaging pests in forestry across Northern Europe. Its larvae develop in coniferous tree stumps on clearfell sites and adult weevils feed on seedlings that are replanted on these sites, causing substantial mortality. As the drive towards achieving the sustainable management of natural resources increases, biological control agents are being considered as an alternative to chemical pesticides. Though such agents have great potential for contributing towards a reduction in the ecological impact of pest insect control, they must also be investigated for any potentially damaging effects they may have in whichever context they are being employed. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN; Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis downesi) are currently being inundatively applied to tree stumps on coniferous clearfell sites in the UK and Ireland as biological control agents against the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> The aim of the laboratory and field-based experiments and field sampling of clearfell sites that were carried out for this thesis was to investigate the risks associated with this use of EPN in this setting.

40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} odour {{responses}} of insect olfactory (or odorant) receptor neurons (ORN) of blowfly (Calliphora vicina), mosquito (Aedes communis), fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis) and <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis). A power-law dependence (similar to Stevens' law in psychophysics) was obtained for the action potential rate of ORN responses vs. odour concentration in measurements with metal microelectrodes from blowfly ORNs and an analysis system was developed for the extracellularily recorded action potentials (or nerve pulses). Odour exposure sequences were used to study action potential rates quantitatively as a function of odour concentration in air exposure. For an odour exposure sequence, a known initial amount of the odour compound in a filter paper inside a Pasteur pipette at the beginning of repeated exposures caused a gradual dilution of the odour concentration in the exposure sequence. The concentration at each exposure was calculated according to the discrete multiple headspace extraction and dilution (DMHED) method. The estimated odour concentration was assumed to obey in the method an exponential law with respect to the exposure number in the sequence. Despite that many uncontrollable parameters remain for measuring quantitatively the characteristics of the ORNs, the results obtained, e. g., sensitivity, specificity, adaptability, and the power-law realation are both biologically and technically very interesting. A time-to-voltage converter (TVC) was utilized for the response analysis in determining action potential intervals originating from a single ORN. A precision analysis of TVC was also performed. With the mosquito (Aedes communis), fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis) and <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis) antennae were tested for inhibitory and excitatory effects to find out repellents and attractants.

For the following years the wax machine is more profitable than manual methods already at a production capacity of 500 000 treated seedlings per season...|$|R

Traps with solely odour or solely visual stimuli catch significantly more weevils than stimulus-free traps, and traps with the combination of odour and visual stimuli catch more weevils than traps with odour or visual stimuli alone. There is essentially an additive effect between odour and visual stimuli. The reactions to odour and visual stimuli are similar for three phases of the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil's</b> life cycle associated with three ages of clear-cuttings (i. e. sites where all trees have been harvested).

40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) are globally important inundative {{biological control}} agents. Their widespread use makes {{environmental risk assessment}} important, but very few comprehensive post-application risk assessments have been conducted for EPN. We apply a rigorous risk analysis procedure {{to the use of}} EPN applied in a forest ecosystem to suppress the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis). In this synthesis, we provide a quantitative evaluation of five risk categories: (a) establishment, (b) dispersal, (c) host range, (d) direct non-target effects and (e) indirect non-target effects. A low level of risk was identified (35 â 51 out of a possible total of 125). Species exotic to the clear-fell forest ecosystem (Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis downesi) were accorded a lower overall risk status than native species and strains (Steinernema feltiae), {{largely as a result of}} their shorter persistence in the target environment. We conclude that EPN are a low risk viable alternative control for pine weevil compared to the higher risk conventional control using pyrethroid or neonicotinoid insecticides. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.

40|$|Pine weevils cause major {{damage to}} newly planted conifer {{seedlings}} in reforestation areas. However, recent {{findings indicate that}} small (âminiâ) seedlings, planted {{at the age of}} 7 - 10 weeks, are gnawed less by pine weevils than the larger, conventionally planted seedlings. Thus, it has been proposed that planting young conifer seedlings in clear-cut areas may reduce the damage caused by pine weevils. In attempts to determine why mini seedlings appear to be less damaged by pine weevils than âconventionalâ seedlings, the volatiles released by Norway spruce and Scots pine mini seedlings were investigated, since such chemicals are of great importance in herbivore-plant communication, inter alia acting as repellents, attractants or antifeedants. Volatiles from the seedlings were collected, separated and identified by solid phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results show that there are high levels of chemodiversity among both spruce and pine seedlings. Between-tissue and age-related variations in their emissions were also found. Norway spruce clones infested by mites were also examined to assess genotype- and pest-specific stress reactions of Norway spruce. Finally, the effects of certain spruce defense compounds on the behavior of the <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> Hylobius abietis were examined. QC 2010081...|$|E
40|$|The <b>large</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil,</b> Hylobius abietis, is {{a serious}} threat to {{reforestation}} in Europe that necessitates routine use of chemical insecticides. Application of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) to the coniferous tree stumps in which weevils breed has the potential to reduce the use of chemical pesticides. During field trials to assess the efficacy of nematodes against pine weevil, non-target beetles were also identified and quantified on 10 sites (14 trials). Nematodes were applied to stumps between June and July. Emergence traps captured beetles exiting from nematode-treated and untreated control stumps. Four trials were monitored in the months immediately following nematode application and ten were monitored the year after nematode application. A total of 65 species of non-target beetles were recovered, including 11 saproxylic species. We found no evidence of an effect of applied EPN on non-target beetle species richness, abundance, species richness per individual collected, or Shannonâs entropy (Hâ) either immediately or a year after nematode application, when more wood-specialists were recorded. As expected, there were marked differences between sites and/or tree species in the populations of non-target beetles recovered. These results indicate that when EPN are applied in a forest ecosystem to suppress H. abietis populations, the risk to non-target coleopteran populations must be considered negligible...|$|E
40|$|The <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis L.) {{is one of}} the two topmost {{economically}} important {{insect pests}} in Swedish conifer forests. The damage increase in areas were the silvicultural practice is to use clear cuttings were the insects gather and breed. During egglaying the female protects her offspring by creating a cave in roots and stumps were she puts her egg and covers it with frass, a mixture of weevil feces and chewed bark. Adult <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> have been observed to feed {{on the other side of}} the egg laying site and antifeedant substance has been discovered in the feces of the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> We think it is possible that microorganisms present in the frass contribute with antifeedant/repellent substances. Little is known about the <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> associated bacteria community and their symbiotic functions. In this thesis the bacterial community is characterized in gut and frass both from <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> in different populations across Europe as well as after a 28 day long diet regime on Scots pine, silver birch or bilberry. Volatile substances produced by isolated bacteria as well as from a consortium of microorganisms were collected with solid phase micro extraction (SPME) and analyzed with GC-MS. The main volatiles were tested against <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> using a two-choice test. Wolbachia, Rahnella aquatilis, Serratia and Pseudomonas syringae was commonly associated with the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> 2 -Methoxyphenol, 2 -phenylethanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol were found in the headspace from Rahnella aquatilis when grown in substrate containing pine bark. 2 -Methoxyphenol and 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, phenol and methyl salicylate were found in pine feces. Birch and bilberry feces emitted mainly linalool oxides and bilberry emitted also small amounts of 2 -phenylethanol. A second part of the thesis discusses the role of fungi in forest insect interactions and the production of oxygenated monoterpenes as possible antifeedants. Spruce bark beetles (Ips typhographus L.) aggregate with the help of pheromones and with collected forces they kill weakened adult trees as a result of associated fungi growth and larval development. A fungi associated with the bark beetle, Grosmannia europhoides, was shown to produce de novo 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol, the major component of the spruce bark beetle aggregation pheromone. Chemical defense responses against Endoconidiophora polonica and Heterobasidion parviporum were investigated using four clones of Norway spruce with different susceptibility to Heterobasidion sp. Clone specific differences were found in induced mono-, sesqui and diterpenes. A number of oxygenated monoterpenes which are known antifeedants for the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> were produced in the infested areas. QC 20160601 </p...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in using introduced species in Swedish forestry {{in response to}} climate change, {{but it is important}} to assess their resistance to native pests. Thus, we compared the extent of <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding on two dominant native conifers, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), the non-host deciduous broadleaf hybrid aspen (Populus x wettsteinii Hamet-Ahti) and four introduced conifers: Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), hybrid larch (Larix x marschlinsii Coaz), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carriere) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon). The extent of feeding damage on seedlings and its effect on their vitality were examined in a field study in south-central Sweden and a laboratory experiment, which gave largely consistent results. Generally, the species most heavily attacked by the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil,</b> in both experiments, were Douglas fir and Sitka spruce. In the field experiment <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> killed or severely damaged significantly higher proportions of Douglas fir and Sitka spruce seedlings (60 %) than any other species except Norway spruce (49 %). Among conifer seedlings the proportions of killed or severely damaged seedlings were lowest for Scots pine and hybrid larch (27 %) and Lodgepole pine (36 %). The results indicate that most conifer species planted on young clear-cuttings in Sweden need some kind of <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> protection, and the possibility that introducing new tree species might increase damage caused by pests must be considered. For instance, widespread use of hybrid aspen could reduce damage by <b>pine</b> <b>weevils,</b> but increase damage by other, untested pests or pathogens...|$|R
40|$|The <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis), a major pest of conifer forests {{throughout}} Europe, {{feeds on}} the bark and cambium, tissues rich in terpenoid resins that are toxic to many insect herbivores. Here we report {{the ability of}} the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> gut microbiota to degrade the diterpene acids of Norway spruce. The diterpene acid levels present in ingested bark were substantially reduced on passage through the <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> gut. This reduction was significantly less upon antibiotic treatment, and supplementing the diet with gut suspensions from untreated insects restored the ability to degrade diterpenes. In addition, cultured bacteria isolated from <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> guts were shown to degrade a Norway spruce diterpene acid. In a metagenomic survey of the insectâ²s bacterial community, we were able to annotate several genes of a previously described diterpene degradation (dit) gene cluster. Antibiotic treatment disrupted the core bacterial community of H. abietis guts and eliminated nearly all dit-genes concordant with its reduction of diterpene degradation. <b>Pine</b> <b>weevils</b> reared on an artificial diet spiked with diterpenes, but without antibiotics, were found to lay more eggs with a higher hatching rate than weevils raised on diets with antibiotics or without diterpenes. These results suggest that gut symbionts contribute towards host fitness, but not by detoxification of diterpenes, since these compounds do not show toxic effects with or without antibiotics. Rather the ability to thrive in a terpene rich environment appears to allow gut microbes to benefit the weevil in other ways, such as increasing the nutritional properties of their diet...|$|R
