40|$|Etch rate, edge profile, surface roughness, and {{electrical}} damage have been determined for {{reactive ion etching}} (RIE) of GaAs in chlorine using a system with a <b>loadlock.</b> Smooth surfaces and vertical edge profiles were obtained at low pres-sures ( 5 min). GaAs surface damage induced by RIE was characterized by I-V and C-V measurements and by photoluminescence. The different methods of measurement were compared and correlated well. Chlorine etching in a <b>loadlock</b> RIE system was found to cause relatively little damage compared to argon etching. Reactive ion etching is a technique of pattern transfer extensively used for silicon and GaAs devices because {{of its ability to}} etch a material selectively and uniformly leav-ing a smooth surface and vertical sidewalls. RIE of III-V compound semiconductors has become of interest in the integration of optoeleetronic and high-speed electronic circuits. For example, the fabrication of trenches and via holes requires a high etch rate with little undercut, neces...|$|E

The unit incorporates facilities for heat cleaning, activating and measuring the quantum efficiency of photocathodes. A tray of up to four photocathodes can be exchanged without bringing the activation unit or gun up to atmosphere. Low voltage quantum efficiencies of 20 % have been obtained for bulk GaAs at 633 nm and 6 % for a 0. 3 micron GaAs layer at 755 mu.

40|$|Proceedings of FEL 2010, Malm√∂, SwedenThe Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Beam Physics Laboratory, Niowave, Inc., and The Boeing Company have {{completed}} {{construction of a}} superconducting 500 MHz quarter-wave gun and photocathode drive laser system. This prototype gun went from conception to initial operation in just under one calendar year. Such rapid progress {{is due in part}} to the decision to develop the gun as a prototype, deliberately omitting some features, such as tuners and a cathode <b>loadlock,</b> desired for a linac beam source. This will enable validation of the basic concept for the gun, including high-charge bunch dynamics, as rapidly as possible, with lessons learned applied to the next generation gun. This paper presents results from initial testing of the gun, technical challenges of the prototype design, and improvements that would enhance capabilities in future versions of this novel design...|$|E
40|$|An RF {{polarized}} {{electron gun}} utilizing the unique features of an integrated, plane-wave-transformer (PWT) photoelectron injector [1] {{is being developed}} by DULY Research Inc. in collaboration with SLAC. Modifications to a DULY S-band device [2] include: a re-design of the photocathode/RF backplane interface to accommodate a GaAs cathode; change {{in the design of}} the vacuum ports to provide 10 - 11 Torr operation; the inclusion of a <b>loadlock</b> photocathode replacement system to allow for reactivation and cesiation of the GaAs photocathode in a vacuum; and alteration of the magnet field coils to make room for the load-lock. The use of a stainless steel outer tank and cooling rods without copper plating may also provide better vacuum performance at the expense of diminished Q-factor. The effectiveness of both the standard cooling rods and synthetic diamond heat sinks for disk cooling is investigated for future linear collider applications operating at a rep rate of 180 Hz and a bunch charge of 2 nC...|$|E
40|$|Photoluminescence scans over CI 2 - and Ar:Cl 2 -etched {{surfaces}} qualitatively correlated {{the electrical}} results (Fig. 5). Mixing argon into chlorine {{lead to a}} decrease of the luminescence output compared {{to the case of}} pure C 12 -etched surfaces. This implies that the surface recombina-tion rate of Ar:C 12 -etched surfaces was faster than the C 12 etch and is consistent with more damage induced (11). Photoluminescence may be a useful analysis tool with the advantage of being nondestructive. Conclusion Smooth surfaces and vertical edge profiles were ob-tained for GaAs etched at low pressures and low power densities in our chlorine <b>loadlock</b> RIE system. C-V and I-V measurements of Schottky contacts fabricated on the vari-ous etched surfaces howed that argon etching created a damaged region at the GaAs surface while the pure chlo-rine-induced amage was less and confined to the very near surface region. Photoluminescence measurements correlated with the electrical measurements and proved to be a valuable nondestructive qualitative indication of sur-face damage.
