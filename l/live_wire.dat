5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the <b>live</b> <b>wire</b> in the family.|$|E
5|$|At Ballast Point, the {{pavilion}} and bathhouse {{were destroyed by}} the storm. Nearby, the Tampa Yacht and Country Club suffered severe damage. Many cars along the waterfront were severely damaged and nearly all flat railroad cars were submerged. The Malloy Line dock was also left under several feet of water. A number of waterfront warehouses were also damaged by floodwaters. After the Tampa Electrical Company power house experienced water damage, the electricity was shutoff. Additionally, the company's cable station was flooded under several feet of water. Winds downed hundreds of trees and sign across roadways and tore-up awnings. At least 50 awnings were ripped from a bank building on Franklin Street alone. Falling trees also damaged {{the post office and}} the YMCA. Almost 500 dwellings in the neighborhood of Ybor City were demolished. Five people were killed in the city, three from people coming into contact with a <b>live</b> <b>wire</b> and the other two from drowning. Only minor damage occurred in Plant City. Throughout Hillsborough County, many county roads were impassible due to downed telegraph poles and other debris, especially between Tampa and Plant City.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of RCDs that need a power supply, a {{dangerous}} condition can arise if the neutral wire is broken or switched off {{on the supply side}} of the RCD, while the corresponding <b>live</b> <b>wire</b> remains uninterrupted. The tripping circuit needs power to work and does not trip when the power supply fails. Connected equipment will not work without a neutral, but the RCD cannot protect people from contact with the energized wire. For this reason circuit breakers must be installed in a way that ensures that the neutral wire cannot be switched off unless the <b>live</b> <b>wire</b> is also switched off at the same time. Where there is a requirement for switching off the neutral wire, two-pole breakers (or four-pole for 3-phase) must be used. To provide some protection with an interrupted neutral, some RCDs and RCBOs are equipped with an auxiliary connection wire that must be connected to the earth busbar of the distribution board. This either enables the device to detect the missing neutral of the supply, causing the device to trip, or provides an alternative supply path for the tripping circuitry, enabling it to continue to function normally {{in the absence of the}} supply neutral.|$|E

Lightning Lad was renamed <b>Live</b> <b>Wire,</b> and after the group's founding, {{a large number of}} heroes were added to the roster very quickly. Several members from the previous continuity were given new codenames, and some new heroes were added, including XS (the granddaughter of Barry Allen, the second Flash), Kinetix, and Gates.|$|E
25|$|Two- and four-pole {{breakers}} {{are used}} {{when there is}} a need to disconnect multiple phase AC, or to disconnect the neutral wire to ensure that no current flows through the neutral wire from other loads connected to the same network when workers may touch the wires during maintenance. Separate circuit breakers must never be used for live and neutral, because if the neutral is disconnected while the live conductor stays connected, a dangerous condition arises: the circuit appears de-energized (appliances don't work), but wires remain live and some residual-current devices (RCDs) may not trip if someone touches the <b>live</b> <b>wire</b> (because some RCDs need power to trip). This is why only common trip breakers must be used when neutral wire switching is needed.|$|E

500|$|Although Hiki {{was a small}} {{tropical}} cyclone and bypassed Hawaii, heavy rainfall and strong winds were observed throughout the islands. At the Kanalohuluhulu Ranger Station on Kauai, [...] of precipitation was observed, which was the highest total associated with a {{tropical cyclone}} on record in the United States, until surpassed by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 which dumped a maximum of [...] in Texas. The Waimea River overflowed, causing more than 200residents to flee their homes. Many streets and several hundred acres of sugar cane fields were flooded. About $200,000 (1950USD) in damage was reported due to flooding {{in the city of}} Waimea. In Kekaha, the powerhouse suffered severe damage. Throughout the islands, winds de-roofed several homes and downed power lines; one fatality occurred after a person came in contact with a <b>live</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
500|$|Hiki {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclones to approach the Hawaiian Islands in at least 45years and officially the first hurricane in the region. As Hiki approached, a United States Coast Guard station with 14people in French Frigate Shoals was alerted. In addition, ships in the area were also advised to take caution. Hiki caused high waves on some of the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaii remained on the southern semicircle of Hiki, and as a result, light wind damage occurred. The highest reported winds from Hiki was at the Kilauea Lighthouse on Kauai, where gusts up to [...] were observed. The islands of Niihau and Lanai also experienced tropical storm force winds, reaching 48 and 50mph (77 and 80km/h), respectively. As a result, several houses throughout the Hawaiian Islands lost their roof. In addition, a farmer in Kohala on Hawaii died after coming into contact with a <b>live</b> <b>wire</b> that was blown down from high winds.|$|E
500|$|The storm brought {{strong winds}} to the Swan Islands, {{including}} hurricane-force winds {{on the main}} island. Heavy rains fell in Cuba, particularly in Pinar del Río Province, but only minor damage occurred. In Florida, storm surge and abnormally high tides caused damage along much of the state's west coast from Pasco County southward. Several neighborhoods and sections of Tampa were inundated, especially in Ballast Point, DeSoto Park, Edgewater Park, Hyde Park, Palmetto Beach, and other areas {{in the vicinity of}} Bayshore Boulevard. Strong winds also damaged hundreds of trees, signs, buildings, and homes. Four deaths occurred in Tampa, three from drownings and another after a man touched a <b>live</b> <b>wire.</b> The storm left two additional fatalities in St. Petersburg. A number of streets in Tarpon Springs were littered with masses of debris, with many structures and trees suffering extensive damage. Strong winds occurred as far east as the Atlantic coast of the state, though wind damage east of the Tampa Bay area was generally limited to downed trees and power lines, resulting in power outages, particularly in Orlando. Agriculture throughout the state experienced significant impact as well, including over $2million (equivalent to $million in [...] ) in damage and the loss of at least 800,000boxes of citrus crops alone. Overall, the hurricane left at least eight deaths and about $10million (equivalent to $million in [...] ) in damage.|$|E

In the film she played a woman [...] "hardened by life's cruelties and a grief that will not fade." [...] It also co-starred a young Joanne Woodward {{in one of her}} early roles. In an article he wrote for Life magazine Williams discussed why he chose her for the part:"Anna and I had both cherished the dream that her appearance in the part I created for her in The Fugitive Kind would be her greatest triumph to date...

60|$|The {{first thing}} for any honest Englishman to send {{across the sea}} is this; that the English have not {{the shadow of a}} notion of what they are up against in America. They have never even heard of the {{batteries}} of almost brutal energy, of which I had thus touched a <b>live</b> <b>wire</b> even before I landed. People talk about the hypocrisy of England in dealing with a small nationality. What strikes me is the stupidity of England in supposing that she is dealing with a small nationality; when she is really dealing with a very large nationality. She is dealing with a nationality that often threatens, even numerically, to dominate all the other nationalities of the United States. The Irish are not decaying; they are not unpractical; they are scarcely even scattered; they are not even poor.

40|$|Abstract We {{propose a}} chaos time-domain {{reflectometry}} (CTDR) for locat-ing faults on <b>live</b> <b>wires.</b> This method uses a chaotic output of an improved Colpitts oscillator as probe signal, and detects wire faults by correlating a du-plicate with {{the echo of}} the probe signal. Benefiting from the anti-jamming of the correlation function of the wideband chaos, fault location on <b>live</b> <b>wires</b> can be achieved. We experimentally demonstrate the detection for <b>live</b> <b>wires</b> in a digital communication system, in which a type of digital signal named high density bipolar of order 3 (HDB 3) is transmitted. The effects of the chaotic probe signal on the bit error rate (BER) of the transmitted HDB 3 at different rates are analyzed. Meanwhile, the influences of the backward HDB 3 reflected by wiring faults on the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) of CTDR measurement are examined experimentally. The results show that fault detection on <b>live</b> <b>wires</b> is achieved when {{the power of the}} chaotic probe signal is about from- 24. 8 dB to- 13. 5 dB lower than that of the transmitted digital signal. In this case, the BER is kept less than 3 E- 10, and the SNR of CTDR is higher than 3 dB. Besides, the auto-correlation properties of the improved Colpitts oscillator at different states are investigated experimentally to explore the suitable chaotic states for the CTDR...|$|R

60|$|Now that {{is where}} the American is {{fundamentally}} different. To him the enthusiasm itself is meritorious. To him the excitement itself is dignified. He counts it a part of his manhood to fast or fight or rise from a bed of sickness for something, or possibly for anything. His ideal is not to be a lock that only a worthy key can open, but a 'live wire' that anything can touch or anybody can use. In a word, there is a difference in the very definition of virility and therefore of virtue. A <b>live</b> <b>wire</b> is not only active, it is also sensitive. Thus sensibility becomes actually a part of virility. Something more is involved than the vulgar simplification of the American as the irresistible force and the Englishman as the immovable post. As a fact, those who speak of such things nowadays generally mean by something irresistible something simply immovable, or at least something unalterable, motionless even in motion, like a cannon ball; for a cannon ball is as dead as a cannon. Prussian militarism was praised in that way--until it met a French force of about half its size {{on the banks of the}} Marne. But that is not what an American means by energy; that sort of Prussian energy is only monotony without repose. American energy is not a soulless machine; for it is the whole point that he puts his soul into it. It is a very small box for so big a thing; but it is not an empty box. But the point is that he is not only proud of his energy, he is proud of his excitement. He is not ashamed of his emotion, of the fire or even the tear in his manly eye, when he tells you that the great wheel of his machine breaks four billion butterflies an hour.|$|E
60|$|It is only {{by trying}} to get some notion of all this that an Englishman can enjoy the final crown and fruit of all {{international}} friendship; which is really liking an American to be American. If we only think that parts of him are excellent because parts of him are English, it would be far more sensible to stop at home and possibly enjoy the society of a whole complete Englishman. But anybody who does understand this can take the same pleasure in an American being American that he does in a thunderbolt being swift and a barometer being sensitive. He can see that a vivid sensibility and vigilance really radiate outwards through all the ramifications of machinery and even of materialism. He can see that the American uses his great practical powers upon very small provocation; but he can also see that {{there is a kind of}} sense of honour, like that of a duellist, in his readiness to be provoked. Indeed, there is some parallel between the American man of action, however vulgar his aims, and the old feudal idea of the gentleman with a sword at his side. The gentleman may have been proud of being strong or sturdy; he may too often have been proud of being thick-headed; but he was not proud of being thick-skinned. On the contrary, he was proud of being thin-skinned. He also seriously thought that sensitiveness was a part of masculinity. It may be very absurd to read of two Irish gentlemen trying to kill each other for trifles, or of two Irish-American millionaires trying to ruin each other for trash. But the very pettiness of the pretext and even the purpose illustrates the same conception; which may be called the virtue of excitability. And it is really this, and not any rubbish about iron will-power and masterful mentality, that redeems with romance their clockwork cosmos and its industrial ideals. Being a <b>live</b> <b>wire</b> does not mean that the nerves should be like wires; but rather that the very wires should be like nerves.|$|E
