The necessity of realization of structural optimization of the investigated machine is reasonable. Methodology. The statement of the optimization problem is executed: the beam cross-section square is taken as the objective function; the allowable stresses criterion is taken as the constraint in this problem statement. Findings. The simplified FE-model of structure of machine is worked out. The optimization problem of double-T cross-section is considered as a test case. For this problem we can obtain the analytical and numeral solutions. Originality. The rational designs for the bearing structure of the investigated machine are brought with the increased consumption of material with preservation of durability characteristics. Practical value. The optimization investigation is executed for bearing structure of the ballast <b>leveling</b> <b>machine</b> SPZ- 5 /UA {{by the use of}} the numerical structural optimization procedure. The obtained rational structural projects are compared to the structural projects with standard double-T cross-sections. It is shown that the use of structural projects with standard cross-sections makes it impossible to obtain the better structure as compared to the rational project. As a result the rational structural project of the ballast <b>leveling</b> <b>machine</b> is obtained, which have the sufficient safety factor. The cross-section of the main longitudinal beam of the bearing structure of <b>leveling</b> <b>machine</b> is decreased on 73 %...|$|E
40|$|Current {{requirements}} {{in mechanical engineering}} require more accurate operations and more efficient technologies. The aim of this thesis is {{the analysis of the}} leveling of square rods. The main problem is the setting of the <b>leveling</b> <b>machine</b> for the specified material and geometric data so that the initially curved material, which passes through alternatively positioned offset rollers, is leveled as much as possible. The main factor in the leveling process is the plastification of the material used for the redistribution of the residual stress. Based on existing theo-retical knowledge in this field, programs are set up to simulate the passing of the rod through the <b>leveling</b> <b>machine.</b> Further, modifications leading to the improvement of the whole process are presented. Finally, there is a verification of the results which is made independently of the submitted solution and processed by the finite element method...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{improvement}} of design technique of track machines bodies bearing structures. The review and analysis of state-of-the-art of the mathematical programming theory and the optimal designing are done. The numerical optimization procedure for track machines bodies bearing structures is proposed. The approbation of the proposed procedure is taken on structural optimization problems. Mathematical aspects of proposed procedure implementation are investigated, particularly the algorithm convergence and the sensitivity analysis of initial designs. Deflected mode of the ballast <b>leveling</b> <b>machine</b> SPZ- 5 /UA body bearing structure was investigated analytically (FEM study) and experimentally (trial running inspection on durability). The necessity of optimization implementation for bodies bearing structures is substantiated. The rational design of track machine SPZ- 5 /UA bearing structure was obtained with the numerical optimization procedure proposed in the paper. The deflected mode of the body rational bearing structure was investigated...|$|E
30|$|Since DCMS and PP {{decisions}} are interrelated {{and may not}} be handled sequentially (Safaei and Tavakkoli-Moghaddam 2009; Defersha and Chen 2008 b), some of the PP attributes such as inventories holding and outsourcing of parts are incorporated to the extended model. The effects of incorporated design features on improving the performance of a DCMS have been also illustrated by (Kia 2014). For example, regarding the number of formed cells as decision variable can considerably improve the performance of a CMS by reducing forming cell cost. Furthermore, machine depot can be effective in improving the performance of a DCMS by reducing machine overhead cost and configuring cells more usefully because of removing idle machines from cells. Additionally, production planning decisions have been shown as improving strategies by satisfying high-volume demands because of <b>leveling</b> <b>machine</b> utilization in different periods. It is worth mentioning, because of the dynamic nature of PP problems, the integration of the CMS and PP makes the problem very complex and computationally hard.|$|E
