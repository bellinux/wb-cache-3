40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} changes in intraocular pressure (IOP), pupil size (PS), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and ECG variables (Pms wave PmV, PR interval, QRS complex, RMV wave and QT intervals) over time during the instillation of 0. 5 % timolol, 0. 5 % <b>levobunolol</b> and 0. 5 % apraclonidine in clinically normal dogs. Ten adult beagles were used. Baseline values were measured at 8 a. m., 2 p. m. and 8 p. m., for three consecutive days. A waiting period of 10 days between the administrations of each drug was established. For 15 consecutive days, the drug being tested was instilled in one eye of each dog twice a day (7 a. m. and 7 p. m.). The parameters were evaluated at the aforementioned times on days 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15. Data were statistically compared using the Bonferroni test and one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (P< 0. 05). The Pearson test was used to evaluate any correlation between QT interval, HR and BP. The tested drugs did not find a decrease in IOP. A significant decreased in PS was observed in almost all dogs following <b>levobunolol</b> administration, relative to the control eye. A significant decrease in HR was observed on day 3 following <b>levobunolol</b> treatment, while apraclonidine induced an increase on day 15.

The lowest concentration at which the inhibitory effect was observed was 109 [mu]M and 0 [middle dot] 8 mM, respectively, for epinephrine and pilocarpine. Dipivefrin hydrochloride (26 - 260 [mu]M), timolol maleate (116 - 1160 [mu]M), and <b>levobunolol</b> hydrochloride (150 - 1500 [mu]M) were also added to the cells for 3 days. These drugs caused a reduction in cell density, respectively, at concentrations higher than 103, 460, and 616 [mu]M.

Experimental data recently demonstrated unequivocally that the analgesic effect of paracetamol is due to its indirect action on cannabinoid receptors. The question then arises as to whether paracetamol can reduce intraocular pressure via its effect on intraocular cannabinoid receptors. Methods: A 2 -week, prospective, randomized, controlled, single-center, parallel-group pilot study was carried out to determine the efficacy and safety of paracetamol 1 g orally administered every 6 hours in adult patients with primary or secondary open angle glaucoma as compared with topical <b>levobunolol</b> 0. 5 % twice a day. Patient well-being was closely monitored throughout the study and focused on hepatic safety in accordance with Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network criteria. The in vitro diffusion kinetics of acetaminophen in a phosphate-buffered solution in rabbit and human corneas was also investigated, with the view to a topical application. Results: Eighteen adult patients {{were enrolled in the}} study, with nine in the topical <b>levobunolol</b> group and nine in the oral paracetamol group. In the <b>levobunolol</b> group, the mean reduction in intraocular pressure at day 7 was 7. 5 mmHg (P &lt; 0. 008) and at day 14 was 9. 1 mmHg (P &lt; 0. 005), from a mean baseline intraocular pressure of 29. 6 mmHg. The corresponding figures for the paracetamol group were 8. 8 mmHg (P &lt; 0. 0004) at day 7 and 6. 5 mmHg (P &lt; 0. 004) at day 14, from a mean baseline intraocular pressure of 29. 4 mmHg. Both study regimens were well tolerated. No serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in either of the treatment groups. Liver function tests, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, or heart rate remained unchanged in both groups during the 2 weeks of the study. In the laboratory study, paracetamol 1 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7. 4) showed acceptable flux rates. Steady-state levels were achieved within 12 hours, thus confirming that paracetamol penetrates the cornea well.

METHODS [...] In 100 eyes, the intraocular pressure was measured before as well as 2 - 4, 5 - 7, and 22 - 24 hours after phacoemulsification and posterior chamber lens implantation. Each of 25 patients received either 1 % topical apraclonidine, 0. 5 % topical <b>levobunolol,</b> 500 mg oral acetazolamide, or placebo. Forty four eyes were operated with sclerocorneal sutureless tunnel and 56 eyes with corneoscleral incision and suture. Sixty three operations were performed by experienced surgeons (more than 300 intraocular operations) and 37 by inexperienced surgeons (less than 200 intraocular operations). RESULTS [...] The pressure increase from baseline to the maximum 5 - 7 hours after surgery {{did not differ significantly}} (p = 0. 8499) for apraclonidine (9. 5 mm Hg), <b>levobunolol</b> (7. 2 mm Hg), acetazolamide (7. 8 mm Hg), and placebo (8. 6 mm Hg).

40|$|Betaxolol, a β 1 -adrenoceptor {{antagonist}} {{used for}} the treatment of glaucoma, is known to be neuroprotective in paradigms of ischaemia/excitotoxicity. In this study, we examined whether betaxolol and other β-adrenoceptor antagonists interact directly with neurotoxin binding to sites 1 and 2 of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Na+ channel) in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes. Betaxolol inhibited specific [3 H]-batrachotoxinin-A 20 -α-benzoate ([3 H]-BTX-B) binding to neurotoxin site 2 in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC 50 value of 9. 8 [*]μM. Comparison of all the β-adrenoceptor antagonists tested revealed a potency order of propranolol>betaxolol≈levobetaxolol>levobunolol≈carteolol⩾timolol>atenolol. None of the drugs caused a significant inhibition of [3 H]-saxitoxin binding to neurotoxin receptor site 1, even at concentrations as high as 250 [*]μM. Saturation experiments showed that betaxolol increased the KD of [3 H]-BTX-B binding but had no effect on the Bmax. The association kinetics of [3 H]-BTX-B were unaffected by betaxolol, but the drug significantly accelerated the dissociation rate of the radioligand. These findings argue for a competitive, indirect, allosteric mode of inhibition of [3 H]-BTX-B binding by betaxolol. Betaxolol inhibited veratridine-stimulated Na+ influx in rat cortical synaptosomes with an IC 50 value of 28. 3 [*]μM. Carteolol, <b>levobunolol,</b> timolol and atenolol were significantly less effective than betaxolol at reducing veratridine-evoked Na+ influx. The ability of betaxolol to interact with neurotoxin site 2 of the Na+ channel and inhibit Na+ influx may have a role in its neuroprotective action in paradigms of excitotoxicity/ischaemia and in its therapeutic effect in glaucoma...|$|E
40|$|Fullerene (C 60) {{derivatives}} {{have been}} extensively studied {{for a variety}} of medical applications, which include neuroprotective agents, HIV- 1 protease inhibitors, photodynamic cancer therapeutics, medical contrast agents and radiotracers, slow release systems for aerosol liposome delivery, immunotherapy agents, and transfection vectors. The first part of this work is dedicated {{to the study of the}} in-vivo safety and efficacy of an orally-dosed bone-vectored C 60 -bisphosphonated compound as a therapeutic agent to prevent and treat osteoporosis. Hydrophilic bisphosphonate groups are known to possess high affinity for the main bone mineral hydroxyapatite. Thus, functionalization of C 60 with bisphosphonate groups should lead to bone-vectored, water-soluble C 60 derivatives. Previously developed C 60 [C(PO 3 H 2) 2] 2 was administered orally in a rat model of osteoporosis for eight weeks in two separate Experiments at doses of 1 mg/kg and 2. 5 mg/kg, respectively. These studies demonstrated that C 60 [C(PO 3 H 2) 2] 2 is safe in the rat model: no significant behavior changes occurred, weight gains were normal, and no significant pathology was noted in either the kidney, the liver or the esophagus of the animals. Micro-CT and DXA studies showed significant and positive changes in the bone architecture of the treated ovariectomized animals which proved, for the first time, that Cho-derivatives can be absorbed by the digestive tract and therefore that C 60 -based scaffolds can be used for oral drug delivery. Just as significantly, the studies also showed that C 60 [C(PO 3 H 2) 2] 2 effectively targets bone, making the compound the first example of an in-vivo tissue- targeted C 60 -based drug. The second part of this work is dedicated to the synthesis and characterization of a beta-blocker conjugate of C 60 [C(PO 3 H 2) 2] 2 as a new targeted therapy for osteoporosis. The sympathetic nervous system of mice mediates bone resorption through beta 2 -adrenergic receptors on bone cells. Thus, the blockage of these receptors could prevent or treat osteoporosis. A non-selective beta-blocker, <b>levobunolol,</b> has been successfully linked to a malonate through a hydrazone formation and then coupled to a C 60 via Bingel chemistry. Finally, the beta-blocker malonate compound has been also successfully coupled to C 60 [C(PO 3 H 2) 2] 2 to form the final target compound, a C 60 -Bisphosphonate-Beta-blocker conjugate as a new targeted therapy for osteoporosis...|$|E
