500|$|In February 2010, {{however, the}} British Olympic Minister stated that West Ham {{would not get}} the stadium, and it would instead be used for track and field. On 17 May 2010, West Ham and Newham London Borough Council {{submitted}} a formal plan to the Olympic Park Legacy Company {{for the use of}} the Olympic Stadium following the 2012 Summer Olympics. The proposal was for a stadium with a capacity of 60,000 which would retain a competition athletics track. The proposal was welcomed by the chairman of UK athletics, Ed Warner, who said, [...] "I think it will feel great as a football stadium and I speak as a football fan as well the chairman of UK Athletics. I think you'd find West Ham would cover the track in the winter season so it wouldn't look <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a track between you and the pitch." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Carey {{announced}} a world tour in April 2003. , [...] "" [...] was her most extensive tour, lasting over eight months and performing sixty-nine shows in venues worldwide. Before tickets {{went on sale}} in the US, venues were switched from large arenas to smaller, more intimate theater shows. According to Carey, the change was made {{in order to give}} fans a more intimate show, and something more Broadway-influenced. She said, [...] "It's much more intimate so you'll feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> an experience. You experience a night with me." [...] However, while smaller productions were booked for the US leg of the tour, Carey performed at stadia and arenas in Asia and Europe, and performed for a crowd of over 35,000 in Manila, 50,000 in Malaysia, and to over 70,000 people in China. In the UK, it was Carey's first tour to feature shows outside London; she performed in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester.|$|E
500|$|The Gunnerkrigg Court webcomic is told in {{a series}} of episodic {{chapters}} such that each, while forming part of the overall storyline, also functions individually as a stand-alone story arc."Each of the chapters individually is sort of a self-contained thing, so if you were to just read one of them it wouldn't be <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> no idea what was going on." [...] The themes and topics of the chapters vary widely: as one reviewer describes, [...] "You are also not subjected to 400-plus pages of intricate plot movement. While there is an overall story arc, there are also lighter chapters that focus on unusual classes ... or small moments that build the main characters." [...] Each chapter begins with a title page and ends with one or more [...] "bonus pages," [...] which are not integral to the main storyline but often offer ancillary details about the world of Gunnerkrigg Court or about minor characters. [...] The chapters have varied in length from four pages to more than eighty. [...] Each page is drawn in traditional (A4; 210 × 297mm) page format and divided arbitrarily into frames. At the bottom of the most recent page is a link to a comments thread for that page, in which readers may comment on and discuss that day's comic.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} will be a good plan, lad. The caravans from here are composed, for the most part, of very hard characters, the sort of men who would shoot you for your horse if they took a fancy to it; I would by no means advise you to ally {{yourself}} with such men. I can, I think, put you {{in the way of a}} better plan than that. I find that a great number of caravans from the West are going by a northern route which crosses the Missouri at a point called Omaha. I have been thinking that this will become an important place, and have made up my mind to freight four or five flats with flour, bacon, and other goods of all sorts, and a frame store, and to go up there and open a business. I shall want a handy man with me at first; I shall take up a storekeeper to leave there in charge, but at first he will want help. If you like to go up in charge of one of the scows, and to stay to help put up the store and set things running, I will give you a hundred dollars, and you can have your passage up for your horse, which I should advise you to buy here. You will get one that will carry you, though of course not much to look at, for about fifty dollars; I know several horse-dealers here, and will get one for you if you <b>like.</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> also better get a stout pony to carry your traps and provisions; that will cost about forty dollars. Then you must have a rifle and a Colt. These are absolutely necessary for such a journey, for I hear that the Indians are very troublesome on the plains. These, however, I myself shall have much pleasure in presenting you with, in testimony of the obligation I feel I owe you for saving my boat and goods. The hundred dollars that are due to you, and the hundred that you will further earn at Omaha, will be sufficient for your horses and outfit, which will leave this money which you placed in my hands untouched. You will find that very useful, for you will want to buy a tent and provisions and tools out there, and money to keep you till you hit upon gold. Well, what do you think of my offer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ever since {{receiving}} {{and reading}} your elegant volume of short tales--the arrival of which from you was affecting and delightful to me--I've meant {{to write to}} you, but the wish has struggled in vain with the daily distractions of a tolerably busy summer. I should blush, however, if the season were to melt away without my greeting and thanking you. I read your book with joy and found in it recalls from far far away--stray echoes and scents as from another, the American, the prehistoric existence. The thing that most took me was that entitled A Difficult Case, which I found beautiful and admirable, ever so true and ever so done. But I fear I more, almost, than anything else, lost myself in mere envy of your freedom to do, and, speaking vulgarly, to place, things of that particular and so agreeable dimension--I mean the dimension {{of most of the}} stories in the volume. It is sternly enjoined upon one here (where an agent-man does what he can for me) that everything--every hundred--above 6 or 7 thousand words is fatal to [...] "placing"; so that I do them of that length, with great care, art and time (much reboiling,) and then, even then, can scarcely get them worked off--published even when they've been accepted.... So that (though I don't know why I inflict on you these sordid groans--except that I haven't any one else to inflict them on--and the mere affront--of being unused so inordinately long--is almost intolerable) I don't feel incited in that direction. Fortunately, however, I am otherwise immersed. I lately finished a tolerably long novel, and I've written a third of another--with still another begun and two or three more subjects awaiting me thereafter like carriages drawn up at the door and horses champing their bits. And àpropos of the first named of these, which {{is in the hands of}} the Harpers, I have it on my conscience to let you know that the idea of the fiction in question had its earliest origin in a circumstance mentioned to me--years ago--in respect to no less a person than yourself. At Torquay, once, our young friend Jon. Sturges came down to spend some days near me, and, lately from Paris, repeated to me five words you had said to him one day on his meeting you during a call at Whistler's. I thought the words charming--you have probably quite forgotten them; and the whole incident suggestive--so far as it was an incident; and, more than this, they presently caused me to see in them the faint vague germ, the mere point of the start, of a subject. I noted them, to that end, as I note everything; and years afterwards (that is three or four) the subject sprang at me, one day, out of my notebook. I don't know if it be good; at any rate it has been treated, now, for whatever it is; and my point is that it had long before--it had in the very act of striking me as a germ--got away from you or from anything <b>like</b> <b>you!</b> <b>had</b> become impersonal and independent. Nevertheless your initials figure in my little note; and if you hadn't said the five words to Jonathan he wouldn't have had them (most sympathetically and interestingly) to relate, and I shouldn't have had them to work in my imagination. The moral is that you are responsible for the whole business. But I've had it, since the book was finished, much at heart to tell you so. May you carry the burden bravely!--I hope you are on some thymy promontory and that the winds of heaven blow upon you all--perhaps in that simplified scene that you wrote to me from, with so gleaming a New England evocation, last year. The summer has been wondrous again in these islands--four or five months, from April 1st, of almost merciless fine weather--a rainlessness absolute and without precedent. It has made my hermitage, as a retreat, a blessing, and I have been able, thank goodness, to work without breaks--other than those of prospective readers' hearts.--It almost broke mine, the other day, by the way, to go down into the New Forest (where he has taken a house) to see Godkin, dear old stricken friend. He gave me, in a manner, news of you--told me he had seen you lately.... I am lone here just now with my sweet niece Peggy, but my brother and his wife are presently to be with me again for fifteen days before sailing (31st) for the U.S. He is immensely better in health, but he must take in sail hand over hand at home to remain so. Stia bene, caro amico, anche Lei (my Lei is my joke!) Tell Mrs. Howells and Mildred that I yearn toward them tenderly.|$|E
