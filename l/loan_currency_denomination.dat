40|$|We {{examine the}} firm- and country-level {{determinants}} of foreign currency borrowing by small firms, using {{information on the}} most recent loan extended to 3101 firms in 25 transition countries between 2002 and 2005. Our results suggest that foreign currency borrowing is much stronger related to firm-level foreign currency revenues {{than it is to}} country-level interest rate differentials. Supporting the conclusion that carry-trade behavior is not the key driver of foreign currency borrowing in our sample we find no evidence that firm-level indicators of distress costs or financial transparency affect <b>loan</b> <b>currency</b> <b>denomination.</b> Overall, our findings suggest that retail clients which do take foreign currency loans are better equipped to bear the corresponding currency risks than is commonly thought. Policy makers should therefore {{take a closer look at}} the characteristics of borrowers before implementing regulations which are aimed at curbing foreign currency loans.

Foreign Currency Borrowing by Small Firms We examine the firm- and country-level determinants of the <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> of small business loans. We first model the choice of <b>loan</b> <b>currency</b> in a framework which features a trade-off between lower cost of debt and the risk of firm-level distress costs, and also incorporates the impact of information asymmetry between banks and firms. When foreign currency funds come at a lower interest rate, all foreign currency earners as well as those local currency earners with high revenues and low distress costs choose foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans.</b> When the banks have imperfect information on the currency and level of firm revenues, even more local earners switch to foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans,</b> as they do not bea...|$|R

When foreign currency funds come at a lower interest rate, all foreign currency earners as well as those local currency earners with high revenues and low distress costs choose foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans.</b> When the banks have imperfect information on the currency and level of firms revenues, even more local earners switch to foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans,</b> as they do not bear the full cost of the corresponding credit risk. We then test the implications of our model by using a 2005 survey with responses from 9, 655 firms in 26 transition countries. The survey contains details on 3, 105 recent bank loans. At the firm level, our findings suggest that firms with foreign currency income and assets are more likely to borrow in a foreign currency. In contrast, firm-level distress costs and financial transparency affect the <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> only weakly. At the country level, the interest rate advantages of foreign currency funds and the exchange rate volatility do not explain the foreign currency borrowing in our sample. However, foreign bank presence, weak corporate governance and the absence of capital controls encourage foreign currency borrowing. All in all, we cannot confirm that "carry-trade behavior" is the key driver of foreign currency borrowing by small firms in transition economies. Our results do, however, support the conjecture that banking-sector structures and institutions that aggravate information asymmetries may facilitate foreign currency borrowing. foreign currency borrowing, competition, banking sector, market structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of inflationary trends, {{which has been}} a macroeconomic concern in Nigeria over the last decade, is considered to be very hazardous to the aggregate economic activity of any country. In order to determine the practical effect of higher currency note introduction on the Nigerian economy, an empirical investigation on the casualty between inflation, <b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> fiscal deficit and broad money supply was carried out using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model (Forecast Variance and Impulse Response) model.

The Cholesky ordering (<b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> inflation, fiscal deficit and broad money supply) is used in the VAR estimates, which indicates that the shocks in <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> affect the other variables and result to inflation. It is therefore recommended that the Nigerian government should implement inflation management policies and also ensure that lower currency notes in circulation are more than higher currency notes in circulation...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores how {{international}} money markets reflected {{credit and}} liquidity risks during {{the global financial}} crisis. After matching the <b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> we investigate how the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) was synchronized with the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) denominated in the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Regardless of the <b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> TIBOR was highly synchronized with LIBOR in tranquil periods. However, the interbank rates showed substantial deviations in turbulent periods. We find remarkable asymmetric responses in reflecting market-specific and currency-specific risks during the crisis. The regression results suggest that counter-party credit risk increased the difference across the markets, while liquidity risk caused the difference across the <b>currency</b> <b>denominations.</b> They also {{support the view that}} a shortage of US dollar as liquidity distorted the international money markets during the crisis.
