2500|$|As for {{the types}} of pollinators, reptile pollinators are known, but they form a {{minority}} in most ecological situations. They are most frequent and most ecologically significant in island systems, where insect and sometimes also bird populations may be unstable and less species-rich. Adaptation {{to a lack of}} animal food and of predation pressure, might therefore favour reptiles becoming more herbivorous and more inclined to feed on pollen and nectar. Most species of lizards in the families that seem to be significant in pollination seem to carry pollen only incidentally, especially the larger species such as Varanidae [...] and Iguanidae, but especially several species of the Gekkonidae are active pollinators, and so is at least one species of the <b>Lacertidae,</b> Podarcis lilfordi, which pollinates various species, but in particular is the major pollinator of Euphorbia dendroides on various Mediterranean islands.|$|E
