5|$|God of War III {{was first}} {{released}} in North America on March 16, 2010, for the PlayStation 3. Reigniting the Great War, Kratos is soon {{abandoned by the}} Titans, who were only using him to exact their own revenge. Helped by the spirit of Athena who was elevated to a new <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding,</b> she instructs him to seek the Flame of Olympus in order to defeat Zeus. Kratos engages the gods and the Titans in an epic series of battles across the Underworld and Olympus and learns that Pandora's Box is within the Flame. He discovers that Pandora herself {{is the key to}} pacifying the Flame and allowing him to open the Box. After finally killing Zeus, he refuses to help Athena assume the role of new patron of mankind and disappears.|$|E
5|$|Athena was the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' {{mentor and}} ally {{throughout}} the Greek {{era in the}} series. In Chains of Olympus, Athena initially tasked Kratos to find Helios as {{in the absence of}} light, the god Morpheus had caused many of the gods to fall into a deep slumber. In God of War, she gave Kratos the mission of killing Ares, as Zeus had forbidden divine involvement, and was instrumental in allowing Kratos to become the new God of War. Although she begged Kratos to stop his second quest for the Ambrosia of Asclepius in the God of War comic series and lied to him about his brother Deimos in Ghost of Sparta, Athena was still sympathetic towards Kratos even after he renounced the gods and was betrayed by Zeus in God of War II. Athena died trying to protect Zeus from Kratos, and was resurrected and elevated to a new <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> in God of War III. With ulterior motives, Athena became Kratos' ally once more and guided him to the Flame of Olympus surrounding Pandora's Box, which allowed Kratos to kill Zeus and end the reign of Mount Olympus.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliography. This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} impact of a geometry course on pre-service teachers' <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> geometry. It is located within the Van Hiele model of geometric development which provides a conceptual framework to assess and analyse the progress of students. The study was conducted at a College of Education which prepares teachers for primary school teaching. It involved 26 second year, pre-service teachers over a 9 week period in a geometry course. The students were assessed for their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> before and after the course using a diagnostic instrument developed by Mayberry (1981) to assess the Van Hiele <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> pre-service teachers. An in-depth investigation of 8 students provided further insight into students' <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> through course work and assignments. The overall findings of the study revealed that the majority of students had low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> geometry before and after the course. However, those who had taken high school mathematics performed better than those without, although few managed to reach the higher levels. The results highlight the need for teachers to develop higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> before being able to teach and design activities that are appropriate for learners. Little improvement in performance of learners on national and international competitions will occur while teachers continue to register low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding.</b> It is crucial that time, resources and training are provided to all teachers if effective change is to occur in the mathematics classroom...|$|R

25|$|Second, the {{psychology}} of cognitive development involves understanding how cognitive change takes place and recognizing the factors and processes which enable cognitive competence to develop. Education also capitalizes on cognitive change, because the construction of knowledge presupposes effective teaching methods that would move the student from a lower to a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding.</b> Mechanisms such as reflection on actual or mental actions vis-à-vis alternative solutions to problems, tagging new concepts or solutions to symbols that help one recall and mentally manipulate them {{are just a few}} examples of how mechanisms of cognitive development may be used to facilitate learning.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [136]- 137) Algebra {{was created}} as an abstraction of arithmetic. The transition between arithmetic and Algebra is {{facilitated by the}} introduction of the concept of variable. Research suggests that students have a definite lack <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> numerical variables which may account for difficulties with Algebra. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine students’ <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> numerical variables and the relationship between their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>understanding</b> and performance in an algebraic context. In order to investigate the relationship between students’ <b>level</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>understanding</b> and their performance in an algebraic context, 248 students were randomly selected to take two tests. The two evaluation instruments were the Chelsea Diagnostic Mathematics Test for Algebra, developed by the Social Science Research Council during 1974 to 1979, and the Algebra Performance Test. The purpose of the Chelsea Diagnostic Mathematics Test was to determine students’ <b>level</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>understanding.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> the Algebra Performance Test was to evaluate students’ performance on specific algebraic tasks which involve variables in the contexts of expressions, equations, tables, functions and graphs. The percentage of students operating at each <b>level</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>understanding</b> was determined and students’ responses on the Algebra Performance Test were classified as low, medium or high. A Chi-Square analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between the students’ <b>level</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>understanding</b> and their performance on the Algebra Performance Test. Another Chi-Square analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between seven mathematics class <b>levels</b> and <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>understanding.</b> Classification <b>of</b> incorrect responses was made to determine misconceptions. The significant results of this study include that students’ <b>level</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>understanding</b> is highly related to their achievement on the Algebra Performance Test. The majority of students who scored low on the Algebra Performance Test were operating at a low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>understanding</b> and the majority of students who scored high on the Algebra Performance Test were operating at a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>understanding.</b> The majority <b>of</b> students in this study were operating at a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>understanding</b> where they could use letters as specific unknowns. There existed no significant relationship between students’ <b>level</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>understanding</b> and their mathematics class. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|Examination greatly {{influences}} course {{structure and}} student study strategies. Three courses {{for students in}} the Civil and Environmental Engineering programs at Luleå University of Technology were reconstructed with the aims of making the assessment part of the learning process and to facilitate deep learning. Several different types of assessment were tested. Assessment {{in the form of}} a large project and field- and laboratory work was shown to be successful when applied to a course in snow engineering for university students with various backgrounds. A course in hydrology and hydraulics was reconstructed with the aim <b>of</b> assessing increasing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding.</b> A simple written test was designed to assess lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> (definitions, concepts etc.). Laboratory work, fieldwork and extensive assignments (calculation tasks) were intended to assess medium <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> (apply, use and combine algorithms etc). A final oral group exam that was used to assess high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> (compare/contrast, explain causes, analyse, relate) concluded the course. A course in International Sanitary Engineering was assessed with cross-group presentations and literature seminars. Teaching and assessing features known to encourage deep learning approaches were adopted. Different types of peer assessment were tested with varying degree of success. For all three courses both the students and the teachers reported increased learning with these course structures and assessment strategies than from courses with a final written exams.
