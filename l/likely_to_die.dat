5|$|A {{cohort study}} {{suggested}} that treatment of FH with statins {{leads to a}} 48% reduction in death from coronary heart disease {{to a point where}} people are no more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> of coronary heart disease than the general population. However, if the person already had coronary heart disease the reduction was 25%. The results emphasize the importance of early identification of FH and treatment with statins.|$|E
5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> soon of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|Acute cholangitis {{carries a}} {{significant}} risk of death, {{the leading cause}} being irreversible shock with multiple organ failure (a possible complication of severe infections). Improvements in diagnosis and treatment {{have led to a}} reduction in mortality: before 1980, the mortality rate was greater than 50%, but after 1980 it was 10–30%. Patients with signs of multiple organ failure are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> unless they undergo early biliary drainage and treatment with systemic antibiotics. Other causes of death following severe cholangitis include heart failure and pneumonia.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of these new agents are still uncertain, because {{they are based on}} the results of a relatively small studies. However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E
5|$|Truck drivers {{spend up to}} 11hours a day driving, and up to 14hours a day {{engaged in}} various duties (including driving time) such as fueling, filling out paperwork, obtaining vehicle repairs, and {{conducting}} mandatory vehicle inspections. Long-haul drivers often spend weeks away from home, spending their time off and sleeping at truck stops or rest areas. Driving is relatively dangerous work, as truck drivers account for 12 percent and the highest total number of all work-related deaths, and are five times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> on the job than the average worker. Smoking, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating habits, and work-related injuries {{also contribute to the}} driver's generally risk-prone lifestyle. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found 67 percent of long-haul drivers were smokers or had quit smoking.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was only}} when the woman’s paterfamilias died that she became sui iuris.

Primarily this served the natal family, allowing her property to stay in the father’s possession.|$|R
40|$|Does {{taxation}} {{affect the}} timing of death? This is an interesting example of how behavior might be affected by economic incentives. We study how two changes in Swedish inheritance taxation 2003 / 04 and 2004 / 05 have affected mortality during the turns of the years. Our first main result is that deceased with estates taxable for legal heirs were 10 percentage points more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>died</b> on New Year' Day 2005, from when the inheritance tax was repealed, rather than on New Year's Eve 2004, compared to deceased without taxable estates for legal heirs. The second main result is that deceased with estates taxable for a married spouse were 12 percentage points more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>died</b> on New Year's Day 2004, from when the inheritance tax between spouses was repealed, rather than on New Year's Eve 2003, compared to deceased without taxable estates for a married spouse...|$|R

Sullivan bonds with his son and discovers from the ledgers that Connor has been embezzling from his father for years, using the names of dead men. As the Sullivans depart, they give the couple much of the stolen money. Sullivan confronts Rooney with the {{information}} while they attend Mass. Rooney already knew about the embezzlement and that Connor was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> if not by Sullivan's hand then by the Chicago Outfit once Rooney dies. He still refuses {{to give up his}} son. He encourages Sullivan to leave with his son.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests that women who have young children are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. Also, {{this study was conducted}} in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a more global perspective on the double burden.|$|E
5|$|Larvae of Sirex {{woodwasp}} develop through arrhenotoky: male larvae develop {{only from}} unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are produced per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The larvae hatch after eight {{days at the}} earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain in the egg for several months. At the optimal temperature of around 25°C (77°F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the larvae hatch at 30°C (86°F) {{two to three days}} earlier, they are 20% more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> Such extreme temperatures result in slower development, and below 6.2°C (43°F), the larvae die. A sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the woodwasp is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from drying out. Without these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the boreholes with resin or halts the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols.|$|E
25|$|For goats {{infected}} with this disease, the most apparent sign of having {{it is their}} bodies wasting away, even with a sufficient diet.

Herds should be tested {{once or twice a}} year to maintain the health and keep out the disease.|$|R
25|$|The breast implant has no {{clinical}} bearing upon lumpectomy breast-conservation {{surgery for}} women who developed breast cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the breast implant interfere with external beam radiation treatments (XRT); moreover, the post-treatment incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular contracture. The study Breast Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies, reported a significant delay in the diagnoses of women who developed breast cancer after undergoing breast augmentation, when compared to breast cancer patients who had not undergone breast augmentation. The metadata study Breast Implants following Mastectomy in Women with Early-stage Breast Cancer: Prevalence and Impact on Survival (2005) reported that breast augmentation patients were statistically <b>likelier</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> from breast cancer. Although the use of implants for breast reconstruction after breast cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of cancer-related death, women who underwent a mastectomy procedure tend <b>to</b> <b>die</b> earlier than women who underwent a lumpectomy procedure, with like diagnoses.|$|R

5|$|Miss Rosa meets new {{prison inmate}} Piper and offers her some advice. She reveals {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from cancer and undergoing chemotherapy. Miss Rosa is told that she needs an operation to improve her chances of survival. However the DOC refuse to fund the operation and she is told {{that she needs to}} keep having chemotherapy. The outcome of which means she is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> She then reminisces about her past as bank robber in which all the men she kissed during heists ended up dead. She details her life to a fellow cancer patient Yusef and they bond. He decides to help her regain the adrenaline rush felt from robbery and they steal a nurse's purse. Miss Rosa is delighted to learn that Yusef has gone into remission but is sad to say goodbye. She returns to her cell and informs good friend Anita DeMarco (Lin Tucci) that she is dying before smelling the money she stole from the nurse.|$|E

40|$|African-Americans in North Carolina {{are more}} <b>likely</b> than whites <b>to</b> <b>die</b> of most cancers and more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> get and <b>die</b> of diabetes, doctors said Thursday during a panel {{discussion}} about health disparities. African-American babies {{are also more likely}} that white infants <b>to</b> <b>die</b> in their first year of birth, an advocate for lowering infant mortality rates said. "We see this as an issue of social justice," said Debbie Mason of the Forsyth County Infant Mortality Reduction Coalition. The health disparities forum was part of a daylong event focusing on improving health for blacks in Forsyth put on by the Winston-Salem Urban League. Mason said mortality rates for African-American babies are three times as high as the rates for white babies in Forsyth, the largest gap in the state. She said mortality rates for African-American infants are also higher in Forsyth than in any of the other urban counties in North Carolina...|$|R

25|$|In the past, {{mortality}} rates for females in child-bearing age groups {{were higher than}} for males at the same age. This {{is no longer the}} case, and female human life expectancy is considerably higher than that of males. The reasons for this are not entirely certain. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol and drugs than women in most societies, and are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Men are also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational, war or car accidents) or intentional (suicide). Men are also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include: cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease. These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer.|$|E
25|$|However, {{other studies}} have not found such a correlation. A study using the populations of Denmark and Austria (a total of 2,052,680 deaths over the time period) found that {{although}} people's life span tended to correlate with their month of birth, there was no consistent birthday effect, and people born in autumn or winter were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> in the months further from their birthday. A study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009 {{found no evidence of}} a birthday effect, although it did find a related Christmas effect. A small study by Leonard Zusne found birthday effects among both male and female cohorts, where women were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> immediately before a birthday and men more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> immediately after, but that when averaged together there was no birthday effect among the population as a whole. The same was found for a study of mortality data in England and Wales, where there was a statistically significant birthday effect among each subgroup (men and women; never married, married, divorced and widowed) but it was not seen in the population as a whole.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} a {{secondary}} analysis of existing data from the 2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey data. Of the 2097 live births recorded in Affar, Somali, Benishangul-Gumuz, and Gambela regions of Ethiopia between 2006 and 2011, 366 deaths {{before the age of}} five years were reported. The univariable and multivariable Cox proportional regression models were fitted to select the factors affecting under-five mortality in these regions. The model revealed that under-five mortality significantly associated with preceding birth interval, family size, birth type, breastfeeding status, source of drinking water, and income of mother. Children born after a preceding birth interval of 2 - 3 years and 3 years and above were significantly less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>died</b> before their fifth birthday than those born within two years. Children who were breastfed, for any period, were 25. 5 % (HR 1. 255, 1. 005 – 1. 567, p = 0. 045) less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>died</b> before their fifth birthday than those who were not breastfed. Increased birth interval time corresponds to a low probability of child mortality. Thus, mothers should be encouraged to wait for a sufficient number of months after a birth to conceive another child. Furthermore, breastfeeding was of paramount importance in the fight against child mortality...|$|R
50|$|Consequently, it {{is vital}} that {{everyone}} surviving an avalanche is used in an immediate search and rescue operation, rather than waiting for help to arrive. Additional help can be called once it can be determined if anyone is seriously injured or still remains unaccountable after the immediate search (i.e., after at least 30 minutes of searching). Even in a well equipped country such as France, it typically takes 45 minutes for a helicopter rescue team to arrive, by which time most of the victims are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>died.</b>|$|R
