To ensure safe working with the fire, for melting and working metals (bronze, iron), special refractory materials were needed to enable the handling of liquid or hot metals [...] To {{meet the needs of}} the wide-ranging applications, a large number of shaped, dense materials (refractory bricks, chamotte), shaped heat-insulating materials (<b>lightweight</b> <b>refractory</b> bricks) and unshaped refractory materials (heavy- and lightweight ramming mixes) have been developed, which are used for special high temperature applications. For decades, however, other manmade materials have been used for thermal insulation, glass wool and rock wool being used in the low-temperature range (around 200 °C to maximum 500 °C).|$|E

40|$|High-strength, <b>lightweight</b> {{castable}} <b>refractories</b> {{based on}} spinel were prepared by introducing porous corundum-spinel aggregate and appropriate microsilica. The effects of microsilica content on microstructure and properties of <b>lightweight</b> castable <b>refractories</b> were investigated using SEM, XRD, mercury porosimetry measurements and FactSage thermochemical software. It's found that microsilica was almost dissolved into a liquid phase at high temperature, which promoted liquid sintering. With increasing microsilica content, the matrices became denser and {{average pore size}} of matrices increased, then apparent porosity decreased, crushing strength increased and content of liquid phase in castables at 1600 °C increased. The appropriate microsilica content is 0. 65 to 1. 95 wt%, which reaches to a compromise among apparent porosity (33 - 38 %), crushing strength (82 - 125 MPa) and liquid content (1. 80 ~ 4. 97 wt%) ...|$|R
40|$|Refractories {{are a key}} {{component}} for cost effective and energetic sustainable processes. Depending on the operation temperature of industrial furnace thermal characteristics of porous refractory linings have to be adjusted. There {{are a lot of}} possible porosity adjusting methods, e. g. placeholder, replica and gas injection/development approaches. Now, the freeze-foaming as direct foaming technique shall be introduced as an environmentally friendly way to refractories. In this presented work an aqueous ceramic mullite suspension is foamed within minutes just by the reduction of the ambient pressure in a freeze drying device. The foam structure suddenly freezes when the suspension temperature, related to the vacuum pressure, reaches the liquid-solid equilibrium line (p, T-diagram o f water). The porous structure is then dried by sublimating the frozen water. The resulting bricklike <b>lightweight</b> <b>refractories</b> exhibit a high amount of open porosity and dense struts. Just 5 - 10 mass-% organic additives, required for a stable foaming, minimize the effect of crack formation during the sintering step and provide an environmentally friendly processing route to the final product. The pore morphology is being determined by X-ray computed tomographic images and mercury porosimetry. Measurements of the thermal conductivity, compressive strength and creep have been carried out to evaluate the freeze-foaming process as a promising approach for manufacturing refractories...|$|R

A successful example for an industrial relevant foaming technology is the replica technique that allows the production of several million foam parts per year.

There, the focus is often upon scientific questions regarding the foam stability and upon exotic techniques producing foams in any possible way.

Lightweight aggregate Liaver was chosen for present application which in combination with chamotte aggregate represents the filler of composite. The following observations were focused on partial replacement of binding components with brick dust and its influence on the mechanical properties of the composite. After design process, test composite specimens were produced to determine hardened properties at standard age. At the age of 28 day were all produced mixtures exposed to elevated temperature: 105, 600 and 1000 °C.

40|$|Objective was {{to develop}} a <b>lightweight,</b> high alumina <b>refractory</b> {{aggregate}} for use in various high performance insulating (low thermal conductivity) refractory applications (e. g., in the aluminium, glass, cement, and iron and steel industries). A new aggregate process was developed through bench and pilot-scale experiments involving extrusion of a blend of calcined and activated alumina powders and organic extrusion aids and binders. The aggregate, with a bulk density approaching 2. 5 g/cc, exhibited reduced thermal conductivity and adequate fired strength compared to dense tabular aggregate. Refractory manufacturers were moderately enthusiastic over the results. Alcoa prepared an economic analysis for producing lightweight aggregate, based on a retrofit of this process into existing Alcoa production facilities. However, a new, competing lightweight aggregate material was developed by another company; this material (Plasmal{trademark}) had a significantly more favorable cost base than the Alcoa/DOE material, due to cheap raw materials and fewer processing steps. In late 1995, Alcoa became a distributor of Plasmal. Alcoa estimated that {ge} 75 % of the market originally envisioned for the Alcoa/DOE aggregate would be taken by Plasmal. Hence, it was decided to terminate the contract without the full- scale demonstration...|$|R

40|$|Production of porous {{anorthite}} ceramics from {{mixtures of}} paper processing residues and three different clays are investigated. Suitability {{of three different}} clays such as enriched clay, commercial clay and fireclay for manufacturing of anorthite based <b>lightweight</b> <b>refractory</b> bricks was studied. Porous character to the ceramic was provided by addition of paper processing residues (PPR). Samples with 30 - 40 wt% PPR fired at 1200 - 1400 °C contained anorthite (CaO·Al 2 O 3 · 2 SiO 2) as major phase and some minor secondary phases such as mullite (3 Al 2 O 3 · 2 SiO 2) or gehlenite (2 CaO·Al 2 O 3 ·SiO 2), depending on the calcite to clay ratio. Anorthite formation for all clay types was quite successful in samples with 30 - 40 wt% of paper residues fired at 1300 °C. A higher firing temperature of 1400 °C was needed for the fireclay added samples to produce a well sintered product with large pores. Gehlenite phase occurred mostly at lower temperatures and in samples containing higher amount of calcium (50 wt% PPR). Compressive strength of compacted and fired pellets consisting of mainly anorthite ranged from 8 to 43 MPa. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
