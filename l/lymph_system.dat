25|$|The {{contents}} of these micelles (but not the bile salts) enter the enterocytes (epithelial cells lining the small intestine) {{where they are}} resynthesized into triglycerides, and packaged into chylomicrons which are released into the lacteals (the capillaries of the <b>lymph</b> <b>system</b> of the intestines). These lacteals drain into the thoracic duct which empties into the venous blood at the junction of the left jugular and left subclavian veins on the lower left hand side of the neck. This means that the fat soluble products of digestion are discharged directly into the general circulation, without first passing through the liver, as all other digestion products do. The reason for this peculiarity is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|The Lymphatic {{system is}} part of the circulatory system and {{a vital part of the}} immune system, {{comprising}} a network of lymphatic vessels that carry a clear fluid called [...] lymph (from Latin, lympha meaning [...] "water") directionally towards the heart. The lymphatic system was first described in the seventeenth century independently by Olaus Rudbeck and Thomas Bartholin. Unlike the circulatory system, the lymphatic system is not a closed system. The human circulatory system processes an average of 20 liters of blood per day through capillary filtration, which removes plasma while leaving the blood cells. Roughly 17 litres of the filtered plasma are reabsorbed directly into the blood vessels, while the remaining three litres remain in the interstitial fluid. [...] One of the main functions of the <b>lymph</b> <b>system</b> is to provide an accessory return route to the blood for the surplus three litres.|$|E

30|$|Cancer is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a disease in which abnormal cells divide without control {{and are able to}} invade other tissues. Cancer cells can spread {{to other parts of the}} body through blood and <b>lymph</b> <b>systems.</b> The main categories of cancer include carcinoma, sarcoma, leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma [1 – 3]. Cancer is known as the leading cause of deaths in the world, and research has shown that new cases of cancer are on the rise. For instance, in 2008, there were estimated 12, 667, 500 new cases of cancer worldwide, with Eastern Asia having most of the cases (3, 720, 000). It has also been observed that one eighth of deaths in the world is due to cancer. In fact, it causes more deaths than AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined [4 – 7].|$|R

50|$|T. p. pallidum is a motile spirochaete that is {{generally}} acquired by close sexual contact, entering the host via breaches in squamous or columnar epithelium. The organism {{can also be}} transmitted to a fetus by transplacental passage during the later stages of pregnancy, giving rise to congenital syphilis. The helical structure of T. p. pallidum allows it to move in a corkscrew motion through mucous membranes or enter minuscule breaks in the skin. In women the initial lesion is usually on the labia, {{the walls of the}} vagina, or the cervix; in men it is on the shaft or glans of the penis. It gains access to the host's blood and <b>lymph</b> <b>systems</b> through tissue and mucous membranes. Also in more severe cases, it may gain access to the host by infecting the skeletal bones and central nervous system of the body.|$|R
40|$|We {{have decided}} to raise {{questions}} rather than provide answers, realizing that the thoracic circulations have very complex interconnecting control system relationships. For example, parts of the 6 th vascular arch embryologically form the pulmonary circulation, which in turn interface with the developing airways, themselves a derivative of the foregut. This alone begs the question of expectations with respect to control systems common to gut, and the pulmonary, bronchial and lung <b>lymph</b> <b>systems.</b> Since the 6 th arch system joins with evaginations from the folding vascular tube destined to be the heart, would the enveloping innervation also affect the control of cardiac function? And finally, both the coronary and the bronchial vessels do constitute some sort of vasa vasorum to the myocardium and indeed, the major pulmonary vessels, {{as well as in}} the case of the bronchial vessels, to the airways, with secretory mechanisms driven in part by non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|In anatomy, lymphatic vessels (or lymph vessels or lymphatics) are thin-walled, valved {{structures}} that carry lymph. As {{part of the}} lymphatic <b>system,</b> <b>lymph</b> vessels are complementary to the cardiovascular <b>system.</b> <b>Lymph</b> vessels are lined by endothelial cells, and have {{a thin layer of}} smooth muscles, and adventitia that bind the lymph vessels to the surrounding tissue. Lymph vessels are devoted to the propulsion of the lymph from the lymph capillaries, which are mainly concerned with absorption of interstitial fluid from the tissues. Lymph capillaries are slightly larger than their counterpart capillaries of the vascular <b>system.</b> <b>Lymph</b> vessels that carry lymph to a lymph node are called the afferent lymph vessel, and one that carries it from a lymph node is called the efferent lymph vessel, from where the lymph may travel to another lymph node, may be returned to a vein, or may travel to a larger lymph duct. Lymph ducts drain the lymph into one of the subclavian veins and thus return it to general circulation.|$|R

50|$|For {{over ten}} years, Fisher and his {{research}} team carried out “a multitude of investigations regarding {{the biology of}} tumor metastasis.” Their findings caused them to question the very theories upon which Halsted's approach had been based, and led them to formulate an alternative hypothesis. This was “that breast cancer was a systemic disease in that tumor cells were {{likely to have been}} disseminated throughout the body by the time of diagnosis and that more expensive locoregional therapy was unlikely to improve survival.” In other words, they believed that cancer cells was spread through the blood and <b>lymph</b> <b>systems</b> and that it entered these systems at an earlier stage than had previously been thought. This meant {{that the best way to}} fight breast cancer was not to perform an extensive excision of local tissue. Instead, a lumpectomy, in which only the tumor itself and a small amount of surrounding tissue are excised, would likely be just as effective and would have the added advantage of not causing disfigurement.|$|R

Inocula of 10, 100, 500 and 5000 oocysts were used. The total population of myenteric neurons and the most metabolically active subpopulation (NADH-diaphorase positive – NADH-dp) exhibited a decrease proportional to the dose of T. gondii. There was also a quantitative increase in the subpopulation of NADPH-diaphorase-positive (NADPH-dp) myenteric neurons, indicating greater expression of the NOS enzyme. Neuronal atrophy was observed, and morphological and morphometric alterations such as jejunal atrophy were found in the infected groups. Hypertrophy of the external muscle with the presence of inflammatory foci was observed in the group infected with 5000 oocysts.

Since CTCs are rare, comprising about one tumor cell among billions of normal blood cells in advanced cancer patients, their detection and enumeration is a difficult task. We exploit the presence of pigment in most melanoma cells to generate photoacoustic, or laser induced ultrasonic waves in a custom flow cytometer for detection of circulating melanoma cells (CMCs) 4, 5. This process entails separating a whole blood sample using centrifugation and obtaining the white blood cell layer. If present in whole blood, CMCs will separate with the white blood cells due to similar density. These cells are resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and introduced into the flowmeter. Rather than a continuous flow of the blood cell suspension, we induced two phase flow in order to capture these cells for further study.
