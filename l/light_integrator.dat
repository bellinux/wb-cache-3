40|$|A system {{exists for}} the {{exposure}} of large pieces of sensitized material. The strips are exposed, processed, and viewed by transmitted light. This procedure is used to gauge {{the quality of the}} film coating process. There are three problems with the existing system: uneven illumination, the timers do not take into account light decay, and finally, the operators, on occasion, set up the wrong conditions for an exposure. The purpose of this thesis is to modify an existing process for the automated exposure of wide stock strips. These modifications are to replace the system 2 ̆ 7 s components with state of the art, commercially available equipment. The equipment was modified to perform the desired output as necessary. The equipment is then to be interfaced with a suitable computer and software generated to automate the system. Existing lights and timing circuits have been replaced with lighting arrangements that approximate actual end use of the products tested. Exposure control is provided by an 2 ̆ 2 off the shelf 2 ̆ 2 <b>light</b> <b>integrator.</b> An existing computer, (DEC 11 / 34), adapted for automation purposes was then interfaced with the new equipment to operate the system. Software is planned which will take over partial responsibility for operating the system...|$|E
40|$|Dark {{reaction}} {{is a condition}} in which the plate acts as if it is exposed to a low level of active light, even though it is being stored in the dark. The Stouffer scale or the sensitivity guide is used to measure this dark reaction which takes place also as a result of high temperature and relative humidity. If there is much dark reaction taking place, more solid steps will show up on a negative working plate. For the purpose of this experiment diazo and photopolymer presensitised, negative working, lithographic plates were chosen. These plates were cut into small sections to eliminate plate variables. They were then subjected to different levels of temperature and relative humidity in a temperature controllable oven. The relative humidity being controlled by using various super- saturated salt solutions. A <b>light</b> <b>integrator</b> was used to expose the plates to the same amount of light energy, with a sensitivity guide. The plates were then developed by hand and the critical or solid step determined visually to measure the dark reaction undergone by the plates due to variations in temperature, relative humidity, and time. With the results obtained curves were drawn to study the relationship between dark reaction and temperature, dark reaction and relative humidity, and dark reaction and time. The curves show an increase in dark reaction with an increase in temperature, relative humidity, and time in the case of diazo plates. The photopolymer plates, on the other hand, seemed to be more stable at higher temperatures, but a high relative humidity destroys the plate coating. A statistical analyses was done on the results and the percentage dependence of dark reaction on temperature, relative humidity, and time were determined. It is concluded that dark reaction does occur in diazo and photopolymer presensitized plates. And that these plates would last longer if stored under the optimum temperature and relative humidity as suggested by analyzing the data. The results obtained disprove the assumption that photopolymer presensitized plates are not influenced by temperature and relative humidity...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{relationship}} between ground vegetation and light intensity under a 60 to 65 -year-old Douglas-fir forest was investigated. Biomass and height of ground vegetation were measured and cover was estimated on small sample units (30 centimeters in diameter) on permanent research plots, one-acre in size, on the George T. Gerlinger Experimental Forest at Black Rock, Oregon. Three thinning intensities, from light to heavy, have been maintained {{on the research}} plots over approximately 20 years. Light intensity was measured with photosensitive paper as a <b>light</b> <b>integrator</b> for {{one day in the}} summer. Also basal area of the trees and taller shrubs surrounding the sample units of ground vegetation were measured. These variables were assumed to represent root competition between ground and overstory vegetation. The results show that with increased thinning intensity the average light intensity near the ground, the average cover and height of ground vegetation all increased. But {{no significant differences were found}} in the biomass of ground vegetation between different thinning intensities, because of the great variation in biomass within each research plot. However, no meaningful correlation was found between either biomass, cover, or height of ground vegetation and light intensity on the small sample units. A multiple linear regression analysis with the additional variables of the basal areas of the surrounding trees and shrubs also revealed no meaningful correlation. The most important species on the research plots were Oregon grape (Berberis nervosa), bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), and a few herbaceous species such as Trientalis latifolia. There was too much inexplicable variation in the data also when examining the response of the most important species to light separately, although the variation was smaller. The regime of light intensity measured (1 to 30 percent of full sunlight) seemed to be sufficient for growth of these shade tolerant species of ground vegetation. The results show clearly that, under the conditions of the Douglas-fir stand studied, the light intensity as measured on the sample units does not relate to the amount and composition of ground vegetation on these sites. Other unknown factors seem to have more influence on the distribution and quantity of ground vegetation in this Douglas-fir stand...|$|E

While the appropriate material is highly dependent on the specifics of the application, plastic integrators offer measurable advantages in certain situations. Key design considerations include weight, performance, cost, birefringence, and temperature resistance. This paper explores each of these design considerations, and presents some guidelines to aid optical engineers in material selection. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>integrators</b> with {{a linear}} {{response}} are {{not suitable for}} measuring the light climates of plants because plants are not linear integrators. It {{should be possible to}} make a quantitative allowance for this nonlinearity by using the CO 2 uptake curve of the plant. To test this, we have subjected white clover plants to different levels of constant light, comparing the rate of increase of total dry matter with the net rate of uptake of CO 2 per day. Temperature, humidity, daylength and nutrient supply were kept constant. The growth rate calculated from CO 2 uptake agreed well with the observed rate over the light levels tested (3. 7 - 88 w·m− 2, 0. 4 - 0. 7 micron: 1 w·m− 2 = 103 erg · sec− 1 cm− 2). All plants put on weight over the few days of the experiment, even those placed at light levels below their compensation point. The plants adapted their respiration rates to be a constant proportion of their growth rates. Most of the adaptation occurred within 24 hours of the light change. The adaptation of respiration has implications for models of light/growth relations in plant communities, almost all of which assume that respiration is proportional to leaf area and independent of growth rate or light level. The only model which does not is that of de Wit, and this gave good agreement with our results...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Clearcutting {{is a sound}} {{silvicultural}} practice when {{exercised in}} the proper environmental location. Foresters have learned through bitter experience that clearcutting Douglas-fir forests, located on droughty south-facing slopes, often leaves uncorrectable regeneration problems. Thousands of acres of unproductive grass and brush throughout the Douglas-fir region are unavoidable reminders of inappropriate sites for clearcutting. Underplanting, as demonstrated in this study, is an alternative to regeneration problems commonly associated with clearcutting in arid portions of the Douglas-fir region. This technique of planting Douglas-fir seedlings under the overstory of a mature Douglas-fir forest before removal of the entire canopy, was tested in the dry, arid portion of the interior Coast Range near Corvallis, Oregon. On a typically droughty south-slope, consisting of an old growth stand, a recently thinned Douglas-fir stand, and an old unsuccessfully regenerated clearcut, 1200 seedlings were planted. An {{attempt was made to}} evaluate survival as a function of three parameters: light, moisture stress, and vegetative competition. Ozalid <b>light</b> <b>integrators</b> measured <b>light</b> at each seedling on the forest floor. Seedling moisture stress was evaluated with a pressure bomb, while a measure of vegetative cover surrounding each tree indicated competition. Contrary to generally recognized supposition, this study indicates that Douglas-fir seedlings can survive, become established, and grow {{in the shade of a}} mature forest. After one growing season, survival, was highest in the old growth stand with 614 percent, and lowest in the clearcut with 38 percent. In addition, Douglas-fir does not require full sunlight for survival Less than 30 percent of full sunlight provides the best survival conditions. Further experiments will be conducted to investigate survival at the end of two growing seasons and ultimately test seedling response when the overstory is removed...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{organization}} of chromatin can {{be subject to}} extensive remodeling in plant somatic cells in response to developmental and environmental signals. However, the mechanisms controlling these dynamic changes and their functional impact on nuclear activity are poorly understood. Here, we determined that light perception triggers a switch between two different nuclear architectural schemes during Arabidopsis postembryonic development. Whereas progressive nucleus expansion and heterochromatin rearrangements in cotyledon cells are achieved similarly under light and dark conditions during germination, the later steps that lead to mature nuclear phenotypes are intimately associated with the photomorphogenic transition in an organ-specific manner. The <b>light</b> signaling <b>integrators</b> DE-ETIOLATED 1 and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 maintain heterochromatin in a decondensed state in etiolated cotyledons. In contrast, under light conditions cryptochrome-mediated photoperception releases nuclear expansion and heterochromatin compaction within conspicuous chromocenters. For all tested loci, chromatin condensation during photomorphogenesis does not detectably rely on DNA methylation-based processes. Notwithstanding, the efficiency of transcriptional gene silencing may be impacted during the transition, as based on the reactivation of transposable element-driven reporter genes. Finally, we report that global engagement of RNA polymerase II in transcription is highly increased under light conditions, suggesting that cotyledon photomorphogenesis involves a transition from globally quiescent to more active transcriptional states. Given these findings, we propose that light-triggered changes in nuclear architecture underlie interplays between heterochromatin reorganization and transcriptional reprogramming associated {{with the establishment of}} photosynthesis...|$|R
