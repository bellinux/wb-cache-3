40|$|The Rotterdam Rules {{were created}} to provide uniformity, modernise the law {{governing}} <b>the</b> international carriage <b>of</b> goods wholly or party by sea and answer the industry’s needs. As international carriage of goods by sea no longer simply involves <b>the</b> <b>shipper</b> and <b>the</b> carrier, the Rotterdam Rules furthermore focus on the other actors involved in the carriage process either by the carrier, such as maritime performing parties, or <b>the</b> <b>shipper</b> such as <b>the</b> consignee. In addition to regulating the rights, obligations and <b>liabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carrier and <b>the</b> <b>shipper,</b> <b>the</b> Rotterdam Rules also contain provisions related to <b>the</b> obligations and <b>liabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maritime performing parties, and the rights, obligations and <b>liabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> documentary <b>shipper</b> and <b>the</b> consignee. Therefore <b>the</b> binding character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Convention will be broader and if it enters into force <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> identification will arise regarding to the parties included its scope. For <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> this thesis, <b>the</b> word “parties” refers to the carrier (Article 1 (5)), maritime performing party (Article 1 (7)), shipper/documentary shipper (Articles 1 (8) - 1 (9)) and consignee (Article 1 (11). And, <b>the</b> main objective <b>of</b> this thesis is to analyse how these parties will be identified under the Rotterdam Rules when the applicable law is English law. The Convention includes provisions on <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> these parties and provides specific provisions related to identification {{of some of these}} parties. To shed some light on <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties, the thesis comprehensively examines these provisions with <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> applicable law...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{subject matter}} <b>of</b> this thesis is <b>the</b> <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea carrier in <b>the</b> {{international}} carriage <b>of</b> goods by sea. Chapter One: discuses <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea carrier under the Hague/Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules. The Hague/Visby Rules define the term “Carrier” as including the owner or the charterer who enters into contract <b>of</b> carriage with <b>the</b> <b>shipper,</b> while Hamburg Rules widen the definition to include any person by whom or on whose name {{contract of carriage}} of goods by sea has been concluded with a <b>shipper.</b> <b>The</b> Hague/Visby scheme <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> is built on specific obligations by which the carrier is bound, i. e. the obligation to issue a bill of lading, obligation to exercise due diligence, to provide a seaworthy ship and <b>the</b> obligation <b>of</b> care <b>of</b> cargo. <b>The</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carrier in <b>the</b> fulfillment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obligations will expose him to cargo claims by shippers or cargo owners in cases of loss or damage to cargo. He will be held as liable for damages unless he proves that he is exempted form <b>liability</b> by virtue <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventeen exceptions provided for in Article IV. <b>The</b> most significant <b>of</b> them are: fire; perils <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea; force majeure, nautical fault; acts and omissions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipper.</b> Hamburg Rules introduce a relatively simple scheme <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> based on <b>the</b> “presumed fault” by the carrier his agents or servants. Thus in cases of loss or damage to cargo the carrier is held to be liable unless he proves that he, his servants and agents were not at fault. Chapter Two: considers <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> under <b>the</b> Hague/Visby Rules. They cover bills of lading which are issued in contracting state or which incorporate the Rules by paramount clause. They cover the international outward carriage only. While under Hamburg Rules it is immaterial {{whether or not a}} bill of lading has been issued. The Rules cover contract of carriage concluded in a contracting state or if <b>the</b> port <b>of</b> loading or port of discharge is in a contracting state. Moreover if <b>the</b> optional port <b>of</b> discharge is in a contracting state. Similarly, it can be incorporated by paramount clause in <b>the</b> bill <b>of</b> lading. Hamburg Rules cover the inward and outward international carriage. <b>The</b> period <b>of</b> application under <b>the</b> Hague/Visby Rules is limited from <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> loading till <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> discharge, i. e. “tackle to tackle” period, while Hamburg Rules cover the entire voyage until the goods are handed over or put in disposal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cargo owner. The Hague/Visby Rules do not provide for <b>liability</b> in cases <b>of</b> delay in delivery. They exclude the live animals and deck cargo from <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> goods. While Hamburg Rules provide for <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> carrier in cases of delay in delivery. They bring all cargoes under their umbrella. Thus they provide for <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carrier in cases of live animals and deck cargo. Both conventions provide for <b>liability</b> for shipment <b>of</b> dangerous cargoes. <b>The</b> well known doctrine <b>of</b> deviation under <b>the</b> common law is still in use under the Hague/Visby Rules. It operates to hold the carrier as in a fundamental breach of contract unless he proves that he deviates to save life or property at sea. Hamburg Rules do not recognize <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> deviation. Chapter Three: considers <b>the</b> limits <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> and limits <b>of</b> actions. <b>The</b> same system <b>of</b> calculating <b>the</b> limit <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> is valid under both conventions, i. e. <b>the</b> dual system <b>of</b> per package, per kilo. The former is for goods with high value compared to their weight, while the latter is suitable for bulk cargoes. Although the Hague/Visby Rules introduce a provision for calculating limit <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> in containerized goods, i. e. according to the items enumerated on <b>the</b> bill <b>of</b> lading, <b>the</b> position is still ambiguous. <b>The</b> unit <b>of</b> account is Poincare franc which is replaced by the additional Protocol ١٩٧٩ by the Special Drawing Right (SDR) and so forth under Hamburg Rules. The limits should be broken when the carrier is in default of negligence, recklessness or intentional acts. Moreover, the carrier cannot be benefited by <b>the</b> limits <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> under <b>the</b> Hague/Visby Rules if he is in default i. e. in cases of fundamental breach of contract such as deviations or stowage on deck without shippers consent...|$|R

30|$|The {{remaining}} four pre-defined {{practices are}} {{described in more detail}} from <b>the</b> <b>shipper</b> side than from the LSP side.

The pattern that emerges is the opposite from the one described for the first six practices: <b>the</b> <b>shippers</b> appear as more specific as they describe features relating to their system, which in turn creates the demands.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. The state-of-practice in commercial vehicle modelling often neglects the sophisticated behaviour found between stakeholders in a supply chain and the impact thereof on the ultimate vehicle flow. The state-of-the-art in commercial vehicle modelling needs to capture this behaviour to accurately predict <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> changes in <b>the</b> supply chain. In this paper, we discuss how changes in <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receiver influence <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipper</b> and carrier, while focussing on a supply chain in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry. Retailers in the FMCG industry typically order in large quantities with high stock turnover rates. Utilising an order policy, they place orders with suppliers, either replenishing stock to a predetermined level every certain number of days or once a certain re-order point is reached. <b>The</b> supplier (<b>the</b> <b>shipper</b> and carrier) utilises route optimisation and scheduling of deliveries to cater for <b>the</b> demand <b>of</b> its customers. We show how <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> these stakeholders can be captured in an agent-based modelling environment and how <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipper</b> and carrier is sensitive for changes in <b>the</b> order policies <b>of</b> its customers.
