40|$|Metazoan {{embryonic}} development {{requires a}} complex interplay of morphological processes coordinated with self-renewal and differentiation to correctly specify and maintain body cell {{types in the}} correct <b>location.</b> <b>Notch</b> signalling is a metazoan specific arbiter of cell fate decision processes, known to control lateral inhibition and asymmetric cell division processes throughout the metazoa and {{in the development of}} all metazoan organs. In this thesis, we study the effects of Notch signalling on early embryonic development using mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells as an in vitro model system. We determine that Notch signalling is able to crosstalk with hypoxic signalling on the transcriptome level though the majority of gene regulation by either pathway is independent of the other. Secondly, we show that Notch signalling is required for temporal activation of CyclinD 1 expression at day 3 of ES cell neural differentiation. Finally we show that Notch signalling is required for specification of Radial Glial Cell (RGC) types ES cell derived neural rosettes and that the maintenance of RGCs is required for neural epithelial polarity. These data corroborate that canonical Notch signalling is not required in mouse for embryonic processes prior to neural epithelial formation but that it is required for structural morphology in the nervous system...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of notched composite laminates {{is determined to}} find its worthiness for the intended application and it is affected by various factors, such as, application of fatigue loading, notch <b>location,</b> <b>notch</b> shape and size, etc. In the present work, an attempt {{has been made to}} study the effects of fatigue loading and notch location on the {{reliability of}} notched composite laminates. The reliability values of notched laminates are calculated by using the following parameters: the stress developed in the laminate due to external loading and the strength of the corresponding un-notched laminates. Since composite laminates exhibit stochastic variations in material properties, Stochastic Finite Element Analysis (SFEA) is used to calculate the stresses developed in the laminate. The ultimate strengths of the un-notched laminates are found out experimentally. Tests are conducted on specimens made of NCT 301 graphite/epoxy material to determine the material properties that are required for the SFEA. The material properties are modeled using Markov model based on the test data by two dimensional stochastic processes. Tests are also conducted on center-notched laminates subjected to fatigue loading conditions, Edge-notched laminates and un-notched laminates to determine their ultimate strength values. In practical applications, it is difficult to achieve a perfect circular profile during the drilling operation of notched composite laminates and {{there is a possibility that}} the drilled hole is offset from the desired location. These imperfections affect the reliability of the notched laminate. In the present work the perturbation in the circular profile of the hole is modeled using a hypotrochoid variation and the location of the hole center is modeled using a Gaussian random variable. The ultimate strength values of center-notched laminates subjected to fatigue loading conditions, Edge-notched laminates and un-notched laminates, obtained from experiments are used to determine the sets of characteristic length values for both the point stress criterion and average stress criterion. The distributions of the strength and characteristic length of laminates are determined. Stochastic simulations are performed on the laminates by subjecting them to tensile load. Probabilistic moments of the point stress and average stress parameters are found out for controlled hole and un-controlled hole laminates. The reliability values are calculated for the center-notched laminates subjected to fatigue loading conditions and Edge-notched laminates using point stress criterion and average stress criterion by combining the SFEA and experimental results...|$|E

A campaign was undertaken to study the creep crack growth behaviour of modified 9 Cr- 1 Mo weld joints. Creep crack growth (CCG) tests were carried out on compact tension (CT) specimens machined from P 91 weld joints prepared using multipass shielded manual metal arc welding procedure. Specimens with two <b>notch</b> <b>locations</b> have been employed, (i) within the weld metal, between the centreline and the fusion line and (ii) in the heat affected zone. Constant load CCG tests were carried out at different applied loads at 798 and 898 K.

The difference increases at lower C* levels which correspond to long term behaviour.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} observations {{made for}} a set of experiments conducted using the physical model of the Sandy River and Marmot Dam constructed for Portland General Electric (PGE). The experiments focused on the location of the cofferdam notch {{and its impact on the}} immediate sediment remobilization, knickpoint location and trajectory, volume of removal, and location of stranded sediment. The motivation for the study was to provide insights on how and if the position of a cofferdam notch will have an impact on how the site fails and how the reservoir sediments are remobilized. Based on early experiments with the model, PGE expressed concern that some failure scenarios resulted in abandonment of large terraces of sediment near the dam site, posing potential public safety issues. One goal of these experiments was to determine if cofferdam <b>notch</b> <b>location</b> could be positioned to minimize the volume of sediment stranded in terraces. Eight model scenarios were completed for this study. Seven of the scenarios examined a failure discharge of 2500 cfs (cubic feet per second), the minimum failure design discharge. Within these seven scenarios, we examined three notch positions; river right (north bank of river), center, and river left (south bank of river). In an eighth scenario we examined a river right <b>notch</b> <b>location</b> and failure at a high discharge of 5500 cfs. Sediment mixtures used in the model were scaled to sediment core data of the Sandy River reservoir sediment. The data and observations indicate that at the minimum design failure discharge of 2500 cfs, notch position does impact the location of cofferdam failure as well as the location of the first major knickpoint and its trajectory. The data suggest that a river left notch position minimizes the extent of stranded sediment terraces and a river right notch tends to result in larger terraces. A center notch position yielded similar results to the river right notch. At a discharge of 5500 cfs, results suggest that notch position is less important than at lower discharge rates, as the knickpoint is more or less bank to bank and is able to mobilize sediment more effectively.

Because of the unknown effect of end notches, the design calculations have been empirically based upon the net shear area[2].

40|$|AbstractBackground and purposeTo {{minimize}} notching problem {{associated with}} reversed prostheses, inferior positioning of base plate is recommended. This {{reduces the risk}} of notching, but does not eliminate it completely. Both polyethylene/PE-induced osteolysis and implant-to-bone or implant-to-implant contact may still occur, contributing to the risk of screw-breakage and resulting long-term failure. Therefore, the stability and integration of a newly developed base plate without inferior screw and inversion of bearing materials was investigated. Patients and methodsBiomechanical assessment of primary stability of the two types of glenoid baseplate (1 - and 2 -pegged) was carried out according to ASTM F- 2028 - 02  (American Society for Testing and Materials). Patients with a follow-up period of at least 2  years were clinically (n= 78) and for most of them radiologically (n= 61) examined. The X-rays were evaluated for loosening and scapular notching. ResultsThe mean values of micromotions after 100, 000  cycles showed no relevant differences between the 2 -peg and the 1 -peg base plates (47 μm for the 2 -peg design and 43 μm for the 1 -peg design), i. e. both were below the borderline for secure Osseointegration of 150 μm. Radiologically, no signs of loosening or radiolucent lines/RLL were found for both base plates. The mean incidence of inferior scapular notching was 23. 6 % (42 mm glenoid sphere: 15. 8 %). Only grade  1 and grade  2 notching was observed. Additionally as result of absence of PE-induced osteolysis shape, size, borderline and <b>location</b> of <b>notching</b> differed from those observed with conventional reverse total shoulder arthroplasty bearing materials. ConclusionIn combination with modified inferior operating technique, the newly designed implant has the potential to reduce the incidence of scapular notching and to avoid both PE-induced osteolysis and metal-screw contact. The new design did not compromise stability of the base plate in any way during the investigation period, as demonstrated both by the data from the biomechanical investigation and also by the radiological follow-up.

40|$|Abstract: Passive fluid mounts {{have been}} in use {{for the purpose of}} cabin noise and {{vibration}} reduction in the automotive and the aerospace industry for many years. Cabin noise and vibration isolation are provided at a frequency coined “notch frequency”. The design <b>location</b> of the <b>notch</b> frequency depends on the application, but in most applications, it is designed to coincide with the longest period of constant speed. To obtain the greatest reduction in cabin noise and vibration at any desired frequency, the notch frequency needs to be as close to that desired frequency as possible. Unfortunately, the conventional passive fluid mounts have some limitations. Firstly, due to tolerances on all the fluid mount dimensions, elastomer material property variations, and variation in elastomer molding processes, the notch frequency never ends up at the right location on the first manufacturing pass. To reduce the fluid mount notch frequency tuning cycle time, a new fluid mount design is proposed. This new design consists of a conventional single-pumper fluid mount and a 3 -layer piezoelectric cantilever beam as a component that provides us a variable bottom chamber volumetric stiffness and in consequence a fluid mount with a tunable notch frequency.

The fact {{can be used}} inversely to predict the crack parameters (crack depth and its location) from measurement {{of the changes in}} the modal parameters, once a functional relationship between them has been established. The machine components like turbine blade can be treated as a cantilever beam. Vibration analysis of cantilever beam can be extended successfully to develop online crack detection methodology in turbine blade. In the present work, finite element model of a cantilever beam for flexural vibrations has been considered by including two transverse open U-notches. The modal analysis has been carried out on cantilever beam with two U-notches and observed the influence of one U-notch on the other for natural frequencies and mode shapes. It is found that a certain frequency may correspond to different crack depths and locations. Later, by using a central difference approximation, curvature mode shapes were then calculated from the displacement mode shapes. The location and depth corresponding to any peak on this curve becomes a possible <b>notch</b> <b>location</b> and depth. The identification procedure presented in this study is a useful tool for detection of multiple cracks in a turbine blade...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{frequency}} optimization {{is important}} to avoid the coincidence of excitation frequency and natural frequency which causes resonance phenomenon. In this study, the natural frequencies of a beam, with different boundary conditions, are enhanced by stamping V-notches on its surface. These notches alter the local stiffness in the beam while keeping the mass the same. This method is cost-effective in comparison with other Structural Dynamics Modification methods (SDM) {{because it is a}} one-step manufacturing method and because it enhances the dynamic behavior of beam structures without additional weight or additional joints. The natural frequencies of notched beam are calculated by finite element method. In particular, ANSYS package is used in building the notched beam models for modal analysis. The effect of <b>notch</b> <b>location</b> and size on the beam fundamental frequency is investigated. The simulation results indicated that creating notches on free-free beam decreases its fundamental frequency, while creating notches on clamped beam may increase its fundamental frequency. The optimal designs of notched beams are presented. The proposed method couples a finite element method for the modal analysis with an optimization technique based on Genetic Algorithm (GA). Three examples are presented to show the optimal design of free-free and clamped notched beams. The optimization results show that V-notch stamping technique is an effective technique to optimize the natural frequencies...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is on the control of random cracking in concrete paving by using sawcut <b>notch</b> <b>locations</b> {{in the early stages of}} construction. This is a major concern in concrete pavement construction. This research also addresses a probabilistic approach to determine the optimum time and depth of sawcutting for newly constructed portland cement concrete pavements. Variability in climate conditions and material characteristics during the hardening process affects the potential of cracking at any sawcut depth. Several factors affecting the probability of crack initiation are material strength parameters, method and quality of curing, slab/subbase stiffness, the amount and depth of steel reinforcement, friction between the slab and the subbase, and concrete shrinkage. Other factors relevant to concrete mixture characteristics such as cement content and type of coarse aggregate affect development of early aged stresses caused by shrinkage and thermally induced contraction. A probabilistic analysis of the factors that affect crack control using sawcut notches is presented in relation to different weather conditions (concrete placement temperature) at the time of construction, and concrete mixture characteristics such as fly ash replacement (FA) and cement factor (CF). Both of these significantly affect sawcut timing and depth requirement. The determination of crack initiation is based on fracture mechanics. Estimation of the time of cracking is based on predicted tensile strength and stress in the concrete at the bottom of the sawcut notch to assess the feasibility of crack control in the early stages of construction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{well-known}} that hydrogen would accumulate at internal defects of pressure vessels during shutdown and hydrogen embrittlement occurred. However {{it has not}} been clear that the effect of hydrogen gas environment for 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo-V steel (22 V) weld metal. For this reason, the purpose of this work is to identify and understand the potential for embrittlement of the 22 V steel by hydrogen charge and high pressure hydrogen gas environment. Therefore, rising load test was carried out in this study to examine the effect of dissolved hydrogen by high temperature, high pressure hydrogen exposure and high pressure hydrogen gas environment on hydrogen embrittlement at room temperature (R. T.) and 150 ̊C. 22 V forged steel base metal was used and welding was conducted by submerged arc welding (SAW) process. High and low toughness weld metals were prepared by changing PWHT condition and <b>notch</b> <b>location</b> in order to consider variation of product's weld metal. From rising load test results, hydrogen gas environment had effect on the embrittlement of the 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo-V steel weld metal. In contrast, dissolved hydrogen had little effect on the embrittlement. Moreover, KIH value of high toughness weld metal (KIH value is about 90 MPa√m) was higher than that of low toughness (KIH value is about 70 MPa√m) at RT. However, KIH value of low toughness weld metal was the similar level (KIH value is about 110 MPa√m) of high toughness weld metal at 150 ̊C...|$|R
