5|$|After {{graduating from}} Leeds, Armstrong taught French in East Ham, Greater London for several years; she had {{success in this}} line of work, and was well {{on her way to}} {{becoming}} headmistress by the time she <b>left</b> <b>this</b> position in 1918. While she was Senior Assistant Mistress, she began studying phonetics in the evenings part-time at the University College Phonetics Department in order to improve her teaching of French pronunciation. In 1917, Armstrong received a Diploma with Distinction in French Phonetics; she got a Diploma with Distinction in English phonetics the following year.|$|E

5|$|However, not all inhibitors {{are based}} on the {{structures}} of substrates. For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir is shown on the <b>left.</b> <b>This</b> molecule is not based on a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate. These non-peptide inhibitors can be more stable than inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because they will not be substrates for peptidases and {{are less likely to be}} degraded.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} <b>left.</b> <b>This</b> is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|The sperm whale's unique body is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is located very close {{to the front of the}} head and shifted to the whale's <b>left.</b> <b>This</b> gives rise to a distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.|$|E

5|$|Air Commodore Peter Frank Raw, DSO, DFC, AFC (5 June 1922– 14 July 1988) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{pilot and}} officer. He joined the RAAF in 1941, {{and served as}} a flight instructor, bomber pilot and the {{commander}} of a communications unit during World War II. After the war he became a specialist navigator. Raw was appointed the commander of No. 2 Squadron in January 1953, but temporarily <b>left</b> <b>this</b> position for part of the year to participate in the 1953 London to Christchurch air race, in which he placed second. He returned to lead No. 2 Squadron at the end of 1953 and held this position until 1955.|$|E
5|$|Chapman left Portland in 1853 for Fort Umpqua in Southern Oregon. There he {{engaged in}} cattle {{ranching}} while keeping his Portland law practice. He {{served as a}} lieutenant colonel in the militia during the Rogue River War that was fought from 1855 to 1856 against the Native Americans in Southern Oregon. After the war he returned to Corvallis in 1856 before moving to Eugene in 1857. Chapman was appointed as surveyor general of Oregon and served from 1857 to 1861 {{when he returned to}} Portland. He <b>left</b> <b>this</b> federal government position due to his opposition to the election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President. Oregon entered the Union as the 33rd state in 1859.|$|E
5|$|Clement XIII died {{suddenly}} on 2 February 1769, {{a day before}} {{the date of the}} consistory that he had convoked to examine the demands for the general suppression of the Society of Jesus. The various courts under the House of Bourbon and the Kingdom of Portugal (under the House of Braganza) had exerted strong pressure on the Holy See to suppress this order through almost the whole of his pontificate. In 1759 Jesuits were expelled from Portugal, in 1762 from the Kingdom of France, in 1767 from Spain and in 1768 from the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sicily and the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. Clement XIII strongly defended the Society (e.g. in the bull Apostolicum pascendi in 1765), but without success. In January 1769 France and Naples seized the papal territories around Avignon, Benevento and Pontecorvo to force the pope to issue a decree for the suppression of the order. The sudden death of 75-year-old Clement XIII <b>left</b> <b>this</b> difficult decision to his successor.|$|E

5|$|From September 1895 to June 1896 Bruce {{worked at}} the Ben Nevis summit {{meteorological}} station, where he gained further experience in scientific procedures and with meteorological instruments. In June 1896, again {{on the recommendation of}} Mill, he <b>left</b> <b>this</b> post to join the Jackson–Harmsworth Expedition, then in its third year in the Arctic on Franz Josef Land. This expedition, led by Frederick George Jackson and financed by newspaper magnate Alfred Harmsworth, had left London in 1894. It was engaged in a detailed survey of the Franz Josef archipelago, which had been discovered, though not properly mapped, during an Austrian expedition 20years earlier. Jackson's party was based at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. It was supplied through regular visits from its expedition ship Windward, on which Bruce sailed from London on 9 June 1896.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is between 0.5 and 8 , its core will become {{sufficiently}} hot to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen via the triple-alpha process, but it will never become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon into neon. Near {{the end of the}} period in which it undergoes fusion reactions, such a star will have a carbon–oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions, surrounded by an inner helium-burning shell and an outer hydrogen-burning shell. On the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, it will be found on the asymptotic giant branch. It will then expel most of its outer material, creating a planetary nebula, until only the carbon–oxygen core is <b>left.</b> <b>This</b> process is responsible for the carbon–oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the {{geometry}} of spacetime is {{described in terms of}} a certain vacuum solution of Einstein's equation called anti-de Sitter space. In very elementary terms, anti-de Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points (the metric) is different from the notion of distance in ordinary Euclidean geometry. It is closely related to hyperbolic space, which {{can be viewed as a}} disk as illustrated on the <b>left.</b> <b>This</b> image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.|$|E

5|$|Late in the fourth, Mark Ingram lost {{a fumble}} {{for the first}} time in his collegiate career, giving Tennessee {{possession}} at the Alabama 43 with 3:29 remaining in the game. The Vols drove the ball 43 yards in 2:10, culminating with an 11-yard Crompton touchdown pass to Gerald Jones to cut the gap to 12–10. The Vols followed with a successful onside kick attempt and regained possession of the ball at their own 41-yard line. After Tennessee was penalized five yards for a false start, Crompton completed a pass to Luke Stocker for 23 yards, to the Bama 27-yard line. With the clock ticking off the final seconds and Tennessee out of time outs, Crompton spiked the ball to stop the clock with four seconds <b>left.</b> <b>This</b> set up Lincoln for a 45-yard field goal attempt to win the game. However, Terrence Cody knocked his blocker over and broke through the line. He blocked Lincoln's field goal as time expired, preserving Alabama's 12–10 victory and perfect season. For their performances, Cody was named the SEC Defensive Lineman of the Week and Tiffin was named the SEC Special Teams Player of the Week.|$|E
5|$|Ritual {{scarification}} in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi {{of which there are}} two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, the carved line ran {{from the center of the}} forehead down to the chin. A second line ran across the face, from the right cheek to the <b>left.</b> <b>This</b> was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate the rays of the sun. In the Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri; the mbùríchi. The scarification's were Nri's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} of the Upanishad opens as a {{conversation}} between Brihaspati and Yajnavalkya, where Brihaspati asks Yajnavalkya {{for information about the}} place where the seat of all beings, the Brahman, lives. Yajnavalkya states that true Brahman-seat of all beings, or Kurukshetra, is Avimuktam – a place that Shiva never <b>left.</b> <b>This</b> Avimuktam is a part of Varanasi (Banaras). All renouncers, after having wandered places, should stay at this Avimuktam. This is the place, asserts the Upanishad, where Rudra imparts the moksha knowledge just when the last vital breaths of the dying are departing, leading one to videhamukti (salvation after death). This place is holy, a place to revere and not leave.|$|E

5|$|This {{was to be}} {{the last}} {{military}} engagement of Nansouty's long career. On 8 March, {{on the eve of the}} Battle of Laon, Nansouty was at Chavignon, nine kilometres from Laon, where the Emperor was also present and, although the circumstances of Nansouty's departure are unclear, it is certain that he <b>left</b> <b>this</b> village, and his command, that very day. Two days later, Napoleon wrote to his War Minister to inform him that General Nansouty's health did not allow him to exercise his military duties and that he was authorised to take sick leave in Paris. General Belliard had taken interim command of the Guard cavalry during the battle of Laon, with General Sébastiani subsequently given permanent command.|$|E
5|$|While an undergraduate, she {{did some}} {{practice}} {{teaching at the}} Chinese high school in town shortly before graduating in 1952.

She had a job at a music store but <b>left</b> <b>this</b> for a better one at the Central Bank. Straight from the Central Bank, she hurried to the University every day. After a few lessons, Adoracion was convinced Imelda had talent and persuaded her to enroll at the College of Music and Fine Arts at PWU, under a special arrangement that would put her on register while Adoracion would continue to give her free lessons.|$|E
5|$|Indeed, a {{thorough}} reading of historical newspaper articles and historical government reports {{reveals that the}} whole history of wild Murray cod between the mid–1800s and the mid–1900s was one of citizen agitation, government inaction, and ongoing stock decline. For decade after decade, riverside residents, commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, local fisheries inspectors, fish retailers, and others agitated in newspapers and other fora about the evidently, continuously declining Murray cod stocks, to be met in turn either with government denials, or conversely, with various ineffective inquiries into Murray cod stocks and fisheries, and various ineffective control measures. For decade after decade, debate about excessive fishing pressure, number of fishermen, number of nets, net mesh size, bag limits, minimum size limits and take of small cod, closed seasons and the taking of spawning cod full of eggs during spring, and other sundry issues, raged on and on without proper resolution, with fishing regulations either not amended, or amended and largely unenforced and completely ignored, and with heavy commercial, recreational and illegal fishing pressure continuing unrelenting and unabated. The end result was a Murray cod population, initially unimaginably abundant, continually fished down and down and down without pause, until in the early to mid 20th century a number of other factors such as river regulation (listed below) emerged to drive the species even further into decline. All of these drivers of decline have <b>left</b> <b>this</b> iconic Australian fish in a perilous situation. There are now grave concerns for the long-term survival of wild Murray cod populations.|$|E
