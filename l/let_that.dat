25|$|In 1996, Ungdomshuset was {{ravaged by}} fire {{destroying}} {{much of the}} interior. The city council used this opportunity {{as an excuse for}} closing down the house claiming that the building were no longer fit for human use. But the users were not going to <b>let</b> <b>that</b> happen. They started renovating the house themselves and after six months the house was reopened for the public. The city counsel protested about this but after the city building inspectors had inspected the house they found the house in an even better state of repair than before the fire. The city counsel then had to withdraw their protest.|$|E

25|$|During {{the climb}} of the Col de Marie-Blanque, Dessel and Mercado again {{proved to be}} the strongest with Dessel coming through first as he had done on the two earlier climbs already: the polka dot jersey was his. Landaluze came closest to coming back as he was about 50 meters behind {{at some point during the}} descent, but the two leaders worked {{together}} not to <b>let</b> <b>that</b> happen. However, about 15 kilometres before the finish line, Mercado was hoping to make a deal with Dessel: since Dessel was going to be winning the yellow and polka dot jersey, he was hoping to be getting the stage win from Dessel in return for helping him. However Dessel wanted it all, so Mercado stopped helping and Dessel had to maintain the lead by himself to prevent Landaluze from coming back. In the end, Mercado sprinted past Dessel about 300 metres from the finish and won the stage. Landaluze finished third about a minute behind. Moreni, Rinero, Isasi and Vasseur also managed to stay in front of the pelont, the others were caught.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{services}} in Norway use mostly blue lighting. If a blue flashing light {{is seen in}} either traffic or the sea, other vehicles must yield to <b>let</b> <b>that</b> vehicle pass. Blue flashing lights are used by police, military police, customs, fire departments, rescue services, and ambulances. Government, VIP, and embassy vehicles may also use blue if accompanied by local police. Any vehicle equipped with a blue flashing light must have a permission issued by the DMV. The operator of such vehicle must be a qualified emergency vehicle operator and have a ‘code 160’ endorsement on their driver's license. Blue lights can be used alone or with an additional siren. The siren {{may not be used}} alone. The operator of an emergency vehicle may disregard speed limits and traffic lights with caution. Amber lights, however, are not regulated, but are used for any vehicle that need special attention, such as tow-trucks, snow plows, and parking enforcement. Red flashing lights are no longer in use, and were last used in the early 1960s.|$|E

I simply cannot <b>let</b> <b>that</b> happen. Patton is indispensable to the war effort– one of the guarantors of our victory." [...] Still, following the capture of Messina in August 1943, Patton did not command a force in combat for 11 months.|$|E

Like the monkey seeking fruits in the forest, he leaps from life to life (tasting the fruits of his kamma)." [...] The Samyutta Nikaya (12.61, tr.

He later testified, [...] "I waited 11years to go to it. I wasn't going to <b>let</b> <b>that</b> get in my way." [...] He left the dance early due to pain. During the trial, Barker testified that his face was badly swollen after the attack and that he suffered a loss of vision in one eye for three weeks.

500|$|Chandler's {{budget was}} limited, so {{in an effort}} to reduce {{expenditures}} he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: [...] "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up doing what they really wanted to do. I was not going to <b>let</b> <b>that</b> happen with Jimi." [...] When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding's bass parts.|$|E

Lopez wore a shiny gold catsuite for the performance, {{which did not}} go as planned when halfway through the performance her microphone failed. She continued performing for 20 seconds, before realising that she had lost sound. According to lifestyle website Female First, Lopez proceeded to dance, and urged the audience to sing along. At {{the end of the}} performance, Lopez addressed the crowd straight after the performance, saying [...] "We ain't gonna <b>let</b> <b>that</b> get us down, right? Nobody keeps mama down."

[...] Then living in Daytona Beach, Florida, {{he was later}} hurt in an automobile accident, which aggravated a lower-back injury. Spivey's son, Cashton, said that [...] "He never made a full recovery from that. It affected his posture, and he had chronic pain from that."

500|$|When Usher {{planned to}} make a new record after his third album, 8701 (2001), he decided to not branch out much with {{collaborators}} and continue building music with his previous producers. Usher again enlisted record-producer Jermaine Dupri, who had collaborated on his two previous albums, along with The Neptunes and R. Kelly, among others, to work on his fourth studio album, Confessions (2004). Dupri contacted his frequent collaborator Bryan-Michael Cox, who had also made hits like the 2001 single [...] "U Got It Bad" [...] for Usher. During an early session for the album, Dupri and Cox talked about a situation which later became [...] "Burn". At that time, Usher's two-year relationship with TLC's Chilli was flaming out. They said, [...] "Yo, you gotta <b>let</b> <b>that</b> burn... That's a song right there", and started writing.|$|E

500|$|Rossen {{was already}} ill {{when he started}} on his final film, Lilith (1964), and it was poorly {{received}} in the United States. After it Rossen lost interest in directing, reportedly because of conflicts with the film's star, Warren Beatty. The filmmaker said, [...] "It isn't worth that kind of grief. I won't take it any more. I {{have nothing to say}} on the screen right now. Even if I never make another picture, I've got The Hustler on my record. I'm content to <b>let</b> <b>that</b> one stand for me." [...] However, {{at the time of his}} death Rossen was planning Cocoa Beach, a script he conceived in 1962, showing the hopes and struggles of transients in a local community and contrasting this with nearby Cape Canaveral, which Neve described as a [...] "symbol of America's imperial reach".|$|E
500|$|On September 11, 1970, Hendrix {{gave his}} final {{interview}} in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even <b>let</b> <b>that</b> bother me. Because they {{say a lot of}} things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." [...] Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which he laughed and replied: [...] "A mad scientist approach...

During this time, guitarist Ed O'Brien kept an online diary of the band's progress, and wrote in January 2000: [...] " [...] has been kicking around for about four years now and each time we approached it we {{seemed to be going}} down the same old paths. It actually sounds like the start of something exciting now." [...] One month later, he wrote: [...] "This is something like approach number 561 but it is a great song. It's simply {{trying to find a way}} of doing it which excites us. And we may have found a way, at the very least we've found a new approach … It may of course be utter crap and we have so lost the plot on this song. Please don't <b>let</b> <b>that</b> be the case."
