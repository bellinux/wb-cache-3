The three WPH products had a relatively high degree of hydrolysis (DH range: 23 – 48  %), however, the High DH supplement was especially rich in di- and tri-peptides (35  %, 175 – 375  kDa) {{as compared to the}} Medium and <b>Low</b> <b>DH</b> supplements (11 and 15  %, respectively). Studies in human subjects, which comprise perfusion of a segment of the small intestine have shown, that dipeptides are usually absorbed faster than a corresponding mixture of the same amino acids provided in free form (Adibi 1971). This may be attributed to the very high capacity of the highly specific di- and tripeptide transporter PEPT 1 that resides in the apical membrane of enterocytes (Daniel 2004). We expected that the high content of di- and tripeptides in the High DH supplement would favour a faster rate of plasma appearance than for the Medium and <b>Low</b> <b>DH</b> proteins.

30|$|The {{biological}} {{value of the}} proteins was measured to assess bioavailability of the proteins (i.e. the amount of protein that was retained in the rats, and thus not excreted in urine and faeces). The true digestibility only shows if the protein can be absorbed from the intestines and not if it is retained and utilized in the rat. Dairy protein processing procedures such as heat and alkaline treatments of the protein {{have been reported to}} produce compounds such as d-amino acids and lysinoalanine that have a considerably impaired digestibility (Desrosiers and Savoie 1991; Friedman 1999). Racemization of amino acids may not affect the absorption of a given protein, but the bioavailability of the protein may be considerably impaired (Sarwar Gilani et al. 2012). The score provided by the PDCAAS method has been criticized for not accounting for the bioavailability of proteins (Sarwar Gilani et al. 2012). Furthermore, it can be questioned if the protein bioavailability assessed in rats can be compared to bioavailability in humans. Rats have a higher need for the sulphur containing amino acid methionine and cysteine than humans to maintain the condition of the fur. The four protein products contained more EAAs than required by the rats, except for the methionine and cysteine amino acids. Growing rats need 6.5  g of methionine + cysteine/ 100  g total protein (Council 1995), however, the high, medium, <b>low</b> <b>DH</b> and casein supplements contained 2.8, 3.9, 4.3, and 3.2  g of methionine + cysteine/ 100  g of total protein. In the present study, the {{biological value}} of the protein fractions was found to decrease considerably with increasing degree of hydrolysis and decreasing content of methionine + cysteine/g total protein. Therefore, the lower biological value associated with higher DH (High DH ~ 33  % lower than <b>Low</b> <b>DH</b> and Medium DH ~ 10  % lower than <b>Low</b> <b>DH)</b> presumably relates to the insufficient amounts of methionine and cysteine that did not meet the requirements of rats. Since rats have higher requirements for methionine and cysteine than humans the biological value assessed in rats may not be completely transferable to humans. Moreover, all four protein supplements more than fulfilled the EAA requirements for EAA of pre-school children of all EAA.|$|R

30|$|Whey {{protein is}} {{generally}} {{found to be}} faster digested and to promote faster and higher increases in plasma amino acid concentrations during the immediate ~ 60  min following protein ingestion compared to casein. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare three different whey protein hydrolysates with varying degrees of hydrolysis (DH, % cleaved peptide bonds) to evaluate if the degree of whey protein hydrolysis influences the rate of amino acid plasma appearance in humans. A casein protein was included as reference. The three differentially hydrolysed whey proteins investigated were: High degree of hydrolysis (DH, DH =  48  %), Medium DH (DH =  27  %), and <b>Low</b> <b>DH</b> (DH =  23  %). The casein protein was intact. Additionally, since manufacturing of protein products may render some amino acids unavailable for utilisation in the body the digestibility and the biological value of all four protein fractions were evaluated in a rat study. A two-compartment model for the description of the postprandial plasma amino acid kinetics was applied to investigate the rate of postprandial total amino acid plasma appearance of the four protein products. The plasma amino acid appearance rates of the three whey protein hydrolysates (WPH) were all significantly higher than for the casein protein, however, the degree of hydrolysis of the WPH products did not influence plasma total amino acid appearance rate (estimates of DH and 95  % confidence intervals [CI] (mol L− 1  min− 1): High DH 0.0585 [0.0454, 0.0754], Medium DH 0.0594 [0.0495, 0.0768], <b>Low</b> <b>DH</b> 0.0560 [0.0429, 0.0732], Casein 0.0194 [0.0129, 0.0291]). The four protein products were all highly digestible, while the biological value decreased with increasing degree of hydrolysis. In conclusion, the current study does not provide evidence that the degree of whey protein hydrolysis is a strong determinant for plasma amino acid appearance rate within the studied range of hydrolysis and protein dose.|$|R
30|$|Degree of {{hydrolysis}} (DH) of all samples varied (Table  2). DH is {{the measure}} of the extent of cleavage of peptide linkages. DH close to 100  % means that all proteins in the sample are completely hydrolyzed to free amino acids (Panyam and Kilara 1996). DH of the samples was from 12.68 to 20.76  %. DH was in agreement with formal nitrogen content and amino nitrogen content. S 6 (Kapi Songkhla 1) and S 8 (Kapi Samut Sakorn) showed the highest DH (20.76  %) and S 10 (Kapi Chachoengsao) and S 11 (Kapi Samut Songkram) had the <b>lowest</b> <b>DH</b> (12.68 and 12.81  %, respectively). Due to different raw materials, processing condition and time of fermentation as well as different types or levels of proteolytic enzymes, varying degrees of cleavage were presumed.

Dry fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) powders having short, medium and high degrees of hydrolysis (DH of approximately 8 %, 11 % and 16 % respectively) were produced and analysed for their molecular weight distribution, using size exclusion chromatography. Almost complete protein solubilisation (75 g soluble protein per kg hydrolysis solution) could be achieved within an hour, at 40 oC, at 1 % enzyme/substrate ratio (w/w) with papain and bromelain.

Two batches of hydrolysates were prepared enzymatically by mincing the backbones and digesting them with the endo-protease Protamex for either 20 or 50 minutes at 50 °C. A moderate increase in degree of hydrolysis and yield was observed by increasing the time of hydrolysis from 20 to 50 minutes.

40|$|In this {{contribution}} we {{have determined}} {{the effect of}} limited enzymatic hydrolysis on the interfacial (dynamics of adsorption and surface dilatational properties) and foaming (foam formation and stabilization) characteristics of a soy globulin (glycinin, fraction 11 S). The degree of hydrolysis (DH= 0 %, 2 %, and 6 %), the pH of the aqueous solution (pH= 5 and 7), and the protein concentration in solution (at 0. 1, 0. 5 and 1 wt%) were the variables studied. The temperature and the ionic strength were maintained constant at 20 °C and 0. 05 M, respectively. The rate of adsorption and surface dilatational properties (surface dilatational modulus, E, and loss angle) of glycinin at the air–water interface depend on the pH and DH. The adsorption decreased drastically at pH 5. 0, close to the isoelectric point of glycinin, because {{of the existence of}} a lag period and a low rate of diffusion. The interfacial characteristics of glycinin are much improved by enzymatic treatment, {{especially in the case of}} acidic aqueous solutions. Hydrolysates with a <b>low</b> <b>DH</b> have improved functional properties (mainly foaming capacity and foam stability), especially at pH close to the isoelectric point (pI), because the native protein is more difficult to convert into a film at fluid interfaces at pH≈pI. The foam capacity depends on the rate of diffusion of protein to the interface and is much improved by the enzymatic treatment. Foam stability correlates with surface pressure and, to a minor extent, with surface dilatational modulus at long-term adsorption with few exceptions.

40|$|Egg yolk {{lecithin}} (EYL) is a {{good source}} of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and it is different from soy lecithin (SL) in both fatty acid and phospholipid class composition. These factors may lead to different behavior in oxidative stability and emulsification properties in food systems. Therefore, these characteristics were investigated in this study. Emulsification properties were evaluated at two oil-to-water ratios, two emulsifier concentrations, two pHs, and with the addition of xanthan gum. The results showed that low concentration of EYL (2. 5 % in oil) gave poorer emulsion stability than did 5. 0 %, whereas emulsions with oil-to-water ratio of 50 : 50 were more stable than with a 20 : 80 ratio. Under neutral pH, EYL gave poorer emulsion stability than SL at both oil-to-water ratios and emulsifier concentrations. However, under acidic condition, EYL created a more stable emulsion than did SL. Adding xanthan (0. 05 %) increased stability of EYL emulsions and minimized stability differences caused by lecithin concentrations. Oxidative stability of egg yolk was determined in bulk and in emulsion. EYL showed better oxidative stability in both bulk and emulsion systems than did SL. Cupric ion did not accelerate oxidation of EYL in an emulsion system, but it did accelerate oxidation of SL.;Delipidated egg yolk protein (EYP) is produced as a co-product of egg yolk lecithin extraction. This EYP showed poor functionality possibly because of protein denaturation caused by ethanol treatment during lecithin extraction. Two food grade endo-proteases were used to produce EYP hydrolysates (EYPh) with two degrees of hydrolysis (DH), 3 % and 6 %. Protein solubility improved as DH increased, and both solubility profiles for EYP and EYPh were relatively less pH-dependent compared to soy protein.

This can be achieved for each operating point by employing an optimal combination of radiator circuit supply temperature and circulation flow rate. The control algorithm gradually modifies the control curve for the radiator circuit, enabling it consistently to provide an optimal cooling of the DH water. Since the heat exchanger is dimensioned for very low outdoor temperatures, it is oversized for smaller heat loads. In addition, radiator systems are often oversized due to safety margins. Such facts render it possible to reduce the DH return temperature. The objective {{of the present study}} was to develop a control algorithm and to test it in practice. A description is here given of the algorithm, and, additionally, of field tests that were undertaken to practically verify it. The adaptive control method could be implemented in any modern radiator circuit control logics, and the achieved improvement was an added 2 degrees C district heating water cooling, resulting in a 3. 5 per cent reduction in average district heating flow.

The basin is located in the north-central State of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The analyses were done with the software Spring 5. 2 and ArcGIS 10 using the 90 resolution digital elevation model of the study area obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) The parameters measured were: total number of channels, total number of channels in order, total length of the drainage network (km), total length of channels in order (km), average length of the channel order (km), basin area (km²), basin perimeter (km), length of the main river (km), bifurcation ratio, sinuosity index (%), ratio of the average length of each channel orders (km), basin order, basin form factor, river density, drainage density (km/km²), altimetric amplitude (m), relief ratio (m /km), roughness index, asymmetric factor, coefficient of compactness, and circularity index.

When infected animals were skin tested with 30 mug of a water-soluble extract of sonically disrupted Listeria, {{both males and females}} had uniformly detectable levels of delayed hypersensitivity (DH) 4 days after infection. In males, cutaneous hypersensitivity to Listeria antigens reached a peak on day 5 or 6 of infection, and high levels of DH persisted through the 7 th week. In females, DH reached a peak on day 6 or 7, remained at this level through the 4 th week, and then dropped sharply.

40|$|Heat load variations, daily {{as well as}} seasonal, are {{constraining}} co-generation of high-value {{energy products}} as well as excess heat utilisation. Integration of heat-driven absorption cooling (AC) technology in a district heating and cooling (DHC) system raises the district heat (DH) demand during low-demand periods and may thus contribute to a more efficient resource utilisation. In Sweden, AC expansion is a potentially interesting option since the cooling demand is rapidly increasing, albeit from <b>low</b> levels, and <b>DH</b> systems cover most of the areas with potential cooling demand. This study aims to assess the potential for cost and CO 2 emission reduction due to expansion of DH-driven AC instead of electricity-driven compression cooling in the DHC system of Göteborg, characterised by a high share of low-cost excess heat sources. The DHC production is simulated on an hourly basis using the least-cost model MARTES. Despite recent advances of compression chillers, the results show potential for cost-effective CO 2 emission reduction by AC expansion, which is robust {{with regards to the}} different scenarios applied of energy market prices and policies. While the effects on annual DHC system results are minor, the study illustrates that an increased cooling demand may be met by generation associated with low or even negative net CO 2 emissions – {{as long as there is}} high availability of industrial excess heat in the DHC system, or if e. g. new biomass-based combined heat and power capacity is installed, due to the avoided and replaced marginal power generation...|$|R
40|$|Comfort cooling {{demand is}} {{increasing}} also in temperate countries. There, the cooling demand is characterised by strong seasonal {{as well as}} daily demand variations. The utilisation of heat-driven absorption chillers instead of conventional electricity-driven compression chillers is decreasing the power used for cooling but this option is mainly of interest where there is low-cost heat available. Thus, within district-heating (DH) systems with large excess heat supplies {{this might be a}} particularly attractive solution. In other DH systems this may instead provide the basis for expanded combined heat and power operation. In Sweden, this is a potentially interesting option since cooling demand is rapidly increasing, albeit from <b>low</b> levels, and <b>DH</b> systems cover most of the areas with potential cooling demand. The aim of the study is to analyse the potential CO 2 reduction due to increased substitution of compression chillers by DH-driven absorption chillers. The study is a case study using the district heating and cooling (DHC) system of Göteborg, characterised by a high share of industrial and municipal solid waste incineration excess heat. The DHC production is simulated with a detailed time slice division using the least-cost DH supply model MARTES. The heat needed in the absorption chillers is assumed to be supplied by marginally produced DH. The results show that an increased share of absorption cooling capacity can lead to cost-effective CO 2 emissions reduction. The simulation results show that the heat used in the absorption chillers mainly is low-cost industrial excess heat. As long as this is available, or if e. g. new biomass-based CHP is installed within the DHC system, an increased cooling demand can be met by generation associated with low net CO 2 emissions due to the avoided and replaced marginal power generation...|$|R
40|$|Plasmids {{have become}} very {{important}} as pharmaceutical gene vectors {{in the fields of}} gene therapy and genetic vaccination in the last years. In this study, we present a dynamic model to simulate the ColE 1 -like plasmid replication control, once for a DH 5 α-strain carrying a <b>low</b> copy plasmid (<b>DH</b> 5 α-pSUP 201 - 3) and once for a DH 5 α-strain carrying a high copy plasmid (DH 5 α-pCMV-lacZ) by using ordinary differential equations (ODE) and the MATLAB software. The model includes the plasmid replication control by two regulatory RNA molecules (RNAI and RNAII) as well as the replication control by uncharged tRNA molecules. To validate the model, experimental data like RNAI- and RNAII concentration, plasmid copy number (PCN), and growth rate for three different time points in the exponential phase were determined. Depending on the sampled time point, the measured RNAI and RNAII concentrations for DH 5 α-pSUP 201 - 3 reside between 6 ± 0. 7 to 34 ± 7 RNAI molecules per cell and 0. 44 ± 0. 1 to 3 ± 0. 9 RNAII molecules per cell. The determined plasmid copy numbers (PCN) averaged between 46 ± 26 to 48 ± 30 plasmids per cell. The experimentally determined data for DH 5 α-pCMV-lacZ reside between 345 ± 203 to 1086 ± 298 RNAI molecules per cell and 22 ± 2 to 75 ± 10 RNAII molecules per cell with an averaged PCN of 1514 ± 1301 to 5806 ± 4828 depending on the measured time point. As the model was shown to be consistent with the experimentally determined data, measured at three different time points within the growth of the same strain, we performed predictive simulations concerning the effect of uncharged tRNA molecules on the ColE 1 -like plasmid replication control. The hypothesis is that these tRNA molecules would have an enhancing effect on the plasmid production. The in silico analysis predicts that uncharged tRNA molecules would indeed increase the pDNA production...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the inheritance of adrenal hyperplasia, caused by 17 a-hydroxylase deficiency, and its association with female to male sex reversal in common carp. Inbred strains used in this experiment were E 4 (XX, female, normal), E 5 (XX, male, adrenal hyperplasia) and E 7 (XX, male, adrenal hyperplasia). F 1 females (E 4 E 5 : XX, normal) were crossed to E 5 and E 7 males to produce backcross progeny (BC 5 and BC 7), or reproduced by gynogenesis to produce doubled haploid progeny (DH). Fish (age 6 months) were subjected to a net confinement stressor and sacrificed to collect blood plasma for analysis of cortisol and corticosterone, and to determine sex. Values for plasma corticosterone showed a clear segregation pattern, consistent with a single recessive gene model. There was a highly significant difference between high and low corticosterone responders in BC and DH progeny groups. Mean corticosterone values for high corticosterone responders in the three groups BC 5, BC 7 and DH were, respectively: 1706, 1760 and 1366 ng/ml. For low corticosterone responders values were 1. 5, 1. 1 and 0. 6 ng/ml. High corticosterone responders had on average low levels of cortisol: 21. 3, 24 and 17. 3 ng/ml for BC 5, BC 7 and <b>DH.</b> <b>Low</b> corticosterone responders had normal levels (66. 7, 105. 1 and 65. 2 ng/ml for BC 5, BC 7 and DH, respectively). Sex ratios were significantly different between high and low corticosterone responders. High corticosterone responders were predominantly male, while low corticosterone responders were female or intersex. High corticosterone responders had well developed testis and were fertile indicating that in the gonads, 17 a-hydroxylase is not impaired. The observed effect on sex shows that 17 a-hydroxylase deficiency most likely augments sex reversal in common carp, either directly through high levels of plasma corticosterone, or through paracrine effects of elevated ACTH production...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract To {{understand}} partitioning {{of hydrogen}} between hydrous basaltic and andesitic liquids and coexisting clinopyroxene and garnet, experiments using a midocean ridge basalt (MORB) + 6 wt. % H 2 O were conducted at 3 GPa and 1, 150 – 1, 325 °C. These included both isothermal and controlled cooling rate crystallization experiments, as crystals {{from the former}} were too small for ion microprobe (SIMS) analyses. Three runs at lower bulk water content are also reported. H 2 O was measured in minerals by SIMS and in glasses by SIMS, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and from oxide totals of electron microprobe (EMP) analyses. At 3 GPa, the liquidus for MORB with 6 wt. % H 2 O is between 1, 300 and 1, 325 C. In the temperature interval investigated, the melt proportion varies from 100 to 45 % and the modes of garnet and clinopyroxene are nearly equal. Liquid composition varies from basaltic to andesitic. The crystallization experiments starting from above the liquidus failed to nucleate garnets, but those starting from below the liquidus crystallized both garnet and clinopyroxene. SIMS analyses of glasses with [7 wt. % H 2 O yield spuriously low concentrations, perhaps owing to hydrogen degassing in the ultra-high vacuum of the ion microprobe sample chamber. FTIR and EMP analyses show that the glasses have 3. 4 to 11. 9 wt. % water, whilst SIMS analyses indicate that clinopyroxenes have 1, 340 – 2, 330 ppm and garnets have 98 – 209 ppm H 2 O. DH cpx-gt is 11 ± 3, DH cpx-melt is 0. 023 ± 0. 005 and DH gt-melt is 0. 0018 ± 0. 0006. Most garnet/melt pairs have <b>low</b> values of <b>DH</b> gt-melt, but DH gt-melt increases with TiO 2 in the garnet. As also found by previous studies, values of DH cpx-melt increase with Al 2 O 3 of the crystal. For garnet pyroxenite, estimated values of DH pyroxenite-melt decrease from 0. 015 at 2. 5 GPa to 0. 0089 at 5 GPa. Hydration will increase the depth interval between pyroxenite and peridotite solidi for mantle upwelling beneath ridges or oceanic islands. This is partly because the greater pyroxene/olivine ratio in pyroxenite will tend to enhance the H 2 O concentration of pyroxenite, assuming that neighboring pyroxenite and peridotite bodies have similar H 2 O in their pyroxenes...|$|R
