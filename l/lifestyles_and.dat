5|$|Schizophrenia {{has great}} human and {{economic}} costs. It {{results in a}} decreased life expectancy by 10–25years. This is primarily because of its association with obesity, poor diet, sedentary <b>lifestyles,</b> <b>and</b> smoking, with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role. Antipsychotic medications may also increase the risk. These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{reproduction}} is complex, reflecting {{the differences in}} <b>lifestyles</b> <b>and</b> genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms. It is estimated {{that a third of}} all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within the life cycle of a species, the teleomorph and the anamorph. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures for sexual or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing propagules.|$|E

5|$|Moving towards {{sustainability}} is also {{a social}} challenge that entails international and national law, urban planning and transport, local and individual <b>lifestyles</b> <b>and</b> ethical consumerism. Ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities and sustainable cities), reappraising economic sectors (permaculture, green building, sustainable agriculture), or work practices (sustainable architecture), using science to develop new technologies (green technologies, renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power), or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner, and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources.|$|E
5|$|Sibu Gateway is a {{landmark}} {{at the downtown}} area which includes an illuminated fountain, a garden, and a Swan statue surrounded by 12 Chinese zodiac signs. Rajang Esplanade {{is one of the}} 22 community parks in Sibu, mostly donated by Chinese clan associations. Rajang Esplanade has a walkway along the Rajang riverfront from Sibu wharf terminal to Kingwood Hotel with Hii's association playground along the way. It offers a scene of muddy river with timber barges, express boats, and fishing boats commuting on the river. Several mural paintings depicting historical <b>lifestyles</b> <b>and</b> local cuisines are found at various locations in Sibu.|$|E

Major elements of this campaign include more dependence on locally grown food; traditional culture and arts; and activities to increase citizens’ participation in their community. In addition to slow food, Gifu also hopes to include slow industry (traditional crafts), slow education (studying quality of life), and slow tourism (represented by cormorant fishing).|$|E

5|$|The modern post-industrial era in {{advertising}} {{was one of}} reaffirming widely held social values, such as heterosexuality and the middle-class, while neglecting alternative values or lifestyles. The advertising industry was conservative and did not deviate from images that were socially acceptable. Some countries, such as Japan, continue to present the family stereotypically, especially in their television advertisements. In the past decade, however, many advertising agencies have begun to more accurately capture reality and the diversity of <b>lifestyles</b> <b>and</b> family types of consumers.|$|E
5|$|Toyota {{researchers}} {{visited the}} U.S. in May 1985 to conduct {{focus groups and}} market research on luxury consumers. During that time, several F1 designers rented a home in Laguna Beach, California to observe the <b>lifestyles</b> <b>and</b> tastes of American upper class consumers. Meanwhile, F1 engineering teams conducted prototype testing on locations ranging from the German autobahn to U.S. roads. Toyota’s market research concluded that a separate brand and sales channel were needed to present its new sedan, and plans were made {{to develop a new}} network of dealerships in the U.S. market.|$|E
5|$|Following a brief {{interlude}} by From Hell artist Eddie Campbell, the series' direction {{was taken}} over by Paul Jenkins in 1995. He had been former editor of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and other Mirage Studios lines. He had pitched to several comic houses, having tired of editing, and eventually managed to gain stewardship of Hellblazer, the first largely untested writer to achieve this. Jenkins' run is more traditionally English in its themes, with Albion, Arthurian legend, and old English battles all featuring, and even an appearance by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and a speculative explanation of the writing of Kubla Khan, and what the interruption of the 'man from Porlock' may have been. He also returns to Jamie Delano's coverage of anarchist <b>lifestyles,</b> <b>and</b> the effects of the Criminal Justice Act of 1994, a controversial law which restricted the ability of the public to throw raves and large demonstrations.|$|E

5|$|In Madame Satan (1930), {{adultery}} {{is explicitly}} condoned {{and used as}} a sign for a wife {{that she needs to}} act in a more enticing way to maintain her husband's interest. In Secrets (1933), a husband admits to serial adultery, only this time he repents and the marriage is saved. The films took aim at what was already a damaged institution. During the Great Depression, relations between spouses often deteriorated due to financial strain, marriages lessened, and husbands abandoned their families in increased numbers. Marriage rates continually declined in the early 1930s, finally rising in 1934, the final year of the pre-Code era, and although divorce rates lowered, this is likely because desertion became a more common method of separation. Consequently, female characters, such as Ruth Chatterton's in Female, live promiscuous bachelorette <b>lifestyles,</b> <b>and</b> control their own financial destiny (Chatterton supervises an auto factory) without regret.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, {{priests of}} {{different}} religious orders {{set out to}} evangelize the Americas, bringing Christianity to indigenous communities. Two of these missionary orders were the Franciscans and the Jesuits, both of which eventually arrived in the frontier town of Santa Cruz de la Sierra {{and then in the}} Chiquitania. The missionaries employed the strategy of gathering the often nomadic indigenous populations in larger communities called reductions in order to more effectively Christianize them. This policy sprang from the colonial legal view of the “Indian” as a minor, who had to be protected and guided by European missionaries so as not to succumb to sin. Reductions generally were construed as instruments to enable the natives adopt European <b>lifestyles</b> <b>and</b> values; {{this was not the case}} in the Jesuit reductions, however, where the Jesuits allowed the inhabitants to retain many pre-colonial cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic {{species are}} mostly {{external}} parasites of fish or crustaceans and feed on blood. The larvae of the Gnathiidae family and adult cymothoidids have {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts and clawed limbs adapted for clinging onto their hosts. In general, isopod parasites have diverse <b>lifestyles</b> <b>and</b> include Cancricepon elegans, found in the gill chambers of crabs; Athelges tenuicaudis, attached to the abdomen of hermit crabs; Crinoniscus equitans living inside the barnacle Balanus perforatus; cyproniscids, living inside ostracods and free-living isopods; bopyrids, living in the gill chambers or on the carapace of shrimps and crabs and causing a characteristic bulge which is even recognisable in some fossil crustaceans; and entoniscidae living inside some species of crab and shrimp. Cymothoa exigua is a parasite of the spotted rose snapper Lutjanus guttatus in the Gulf of California; it causes the tongue of the fish to atrophy and takes its place in what {{is believed to be}} the first instance discovered of a parasite functionally replacing a host structure in animals.|$|E

5|$|The 30-bed Mid-Valley Hospital {{provides}} medical services, {{including a}} 24-hour emergency medical service, ambulance service, nursing care, a birthing center, and a trauma center. The facility employs 10 physicians and dentists, 20 registered nurses and two licensed practical nurses. Established in July 2000, Okanogan Behavioral Healthcare serves {{the city as}} an alternative medical facility. Numerous nursing homes, including Rosegarden Care Center, New <b>LifeStyles</b> <b>and</b> The Source for Seniors, operate in Omak. The city's clinic was constructed in 1996 using $4,800,000 of local funds. The City of Omak measures residents' drinking water use and provides storm drains, solid waste, and garbage services since 1984. Residents under 60 are charged a 10 percent utility tax on purchases. Electricity is supplied by Okanogan County Public Utility District, and natural gas by Amerigas. Other utility companies serving Omak include AT (telephone); and Comcast (telephone, Internet, and cable television).|$|E
5|$|The Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is a congressionally chartered, federally {{supported}} non-profit {{corporation that}} serves as the official civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force (USAF). CAP is a volunteer organization with an aviation-minded membership that includes people from all backgrounds, <b>lifestyles,</b> <b>and</b> occupations. It performs three congressionally assigned key missions: emergency services, which includes search and rescue (by air and ground) and disaster relief operations; aerospace education for youth and the general public; and cadet programs for teenage youth. In addition, CAP has recently been tasked with homeland security and courier service missions. CAP also performs non-auxiliary missions for various governmental and private agencies, such as local law enforcement and the American Red Cross. The program is established as an organization by Title 10 of the United States Code and its purposes defined by Title 36.|$|E
5|$|The Erie Art Museum is the city's main art gallery, {{located in}} the Old Customshouse on State Street. Its {{collection}} has an emphasis on folk art and modern art and it hosts a popular blues and jazz concert series. The Erie Art Museum also works on public art projects {{in an effort to}} revitalize and improve the city. In 2000, the Erie Art Museum created a project entitled GoFish, similar to CowParade. 95 fiberglass fish were decorated by Erie artists and placed throughout the city. Patrons paid $3,000 for a fish and the proceeds went to Gannon University's Scholarship Fund and the Erie Public Art Endowment Fund. The Erie Art Museum created a similar public art project in 2004 that involved frogs rather than fish. In 2012, the Erie Art Museum began a project to create forty artistic and functional bike racks, designed and created by local artists. The museum's intentions are to add color and interest to downtown Erie and to promote bicycling, encouraging healthy <b>lifestyles</b> <b>and</b> environmental awareness.|$|E
