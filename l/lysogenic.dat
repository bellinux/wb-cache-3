5|$|The first temperature-sensitive RNA element was {{reported}} in 1989. Prior to this research, mutations upstream from the transcription start site in a lambda (λ) phage cIII mRNA were found to affect the level of translation of the cIII protein. This protein is involved in selection of either a lytic or <b>lysogenic</b> life cycle in λ phage, with high concentrations of cIII promoting lysogeny. Further study of this upstream RNA region identified two alternative secondary structures; experimental study found the structures to be interchangeable, and dependent on both magnesium ion concentration and temperature. This RNA thermometer is now thought to encourage entry to a lytic cycle under heat stress {{in order for the}} bacteriophage to rapidly replicate and escape the host cell.|$|E
25|$|The <b>lysogenic</b> {{lifecycle}} begins {{once the}} cII protein reaches a high enough concentration to activate its promoters, after {{a small number}} of infections.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{bacteriophage}} known to follow the <b>lysogenic</b> cycle and the lytic cycle is the phage lambda of E. coli.|$|E
25|$|The viral eukaryogenesis (VE) theory {{proposes that}} {{eukaryotic}} cells arose {{from a combination}} of a <b>lysogenic</b> virus, an archaeon and a bacterium. This model suggests that the nucleus originated when the <b>lysogenic</b> virus incorporated genetic material from the archaeon and the bacterium and took over the role of information storage for the amalgam. The archaeal host transferred much of its functional genome to the virus during the evolution of cytoplasm but retained the function of gene translation and general metabolism. The bacterium transferred most of its functional genome to the virus as it transitioned into a mitochondrion.|$|E
25|$|Lysogeny is {{maintained}} solely by cI. cI represses transcription from PL and PR while upregulating and controlling its own expression from PRM. It is therefore the only protein expressed by <b>lysogenic</b> phage.|$|E
25|$|For these transformations {{to lead to}} the {{eukaryotic}} cell cycle, the VE hypothesis specifies a pox-like virus as the <b>lysogenic</b> virus. A pox-like virus is a likely ancestor because of its fundamental similarities with eukaryotic nuclei. These include a double stranded DNA genome, a linear chromosome with short telomeric repeats, a complex membrane bound capsid, the ability to produce capped mRNA, and the ability to export the capped mRNA across the viral membrane into the cytoplasm. The presence of a <b>lysogenic</b> pox-like virus ancestor explains the development of meiotic division, an essential component of sexual reproduction.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the <b>lysogenic</b> cycle {{does not}} result in {{immediate}} lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo lysogeny are known as temperate phages. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it relatively harmlessly, or may even become established as a plasmid. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate, perhaps due to depletion of nutrients; then, the endogenous phages (known as prophages) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the <b>lysogenic</b> cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is replicated {{in all of the}} cell’s offspring.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of lambda phages is {{controlled}} by cI and Cro proteins. The lambda phage {{will remain in the}} <b>lysogenic</b> state if cI proteins predominate, but will be transformed into the lytic cycle if cro proteins predominate.|$|E
25|$|On initial infection, the {{stability}} of cII determines the lifestyle of the phage; stable cII {{will lead to the}} <b>lysogenic</b> pathway, whereas if cII is degraded the phage will go into the lytic pathway. Low temperature, starvation of the cells and high multiplicity of infection (MOI) are known to favor lysogeny (see later discussion).|$|E
25|$|Viral {{replication}} is nuclear, and is <b>lysogenic.</b> Entry {{into the}} host cell {{is achieved by}} attachment of the viral glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the dsDNA bidirectional replication model. DNA templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by leaky scanning. The virus exits the host cell by , and budding.|$|E
25|$|Phages may be {{released}} via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, {{in a few}} cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called endolysin, which attacks and breaks down the cell wall peptidoglycan. An altogether different phage type, the filamentous phages, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain Mycoplasma phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a <b>lysogenic</b> cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as prophage.|$|E
25|$|Meiotic {{division}} in the VE hypothesis arose because of the evolutionary pressures placed on the <b>lysogenic</b> virus {{as a result of}} its inability to enter into the lytic cycle. This selective pressure resulted in the development of processes allowing the viruses to spread horizontally throughout the population. The outcome of this selection was cell-to-cell fusion. (This is distinct from the conjugation methods used by bacterial plasmids under evolutionary pressure, with important consequences.) The possibility of this kind of fusion is supported by the presence of fusion proteins in the envelopes of the pox viruses that allow them to fuse with host membranes. These proteins could have been transferred to the cell membrane during viral reproduction, enabling cell-to-cell fusion between the virus host and an uninfected cell. The theory proposes meiosis originated from the fusion between two cells infected with related but different viruses which recognised each other as uninfected. After the fusion of the two cells, incompatibilities between the two viruses result in a meiotic-like cell division.|$|E
500|$|Release – Viruses can be {{released}} from the host cell by lysis, a process that kills the cell by bursting its membrane and cell wall if present: This is a feature of many bacterial and some animal viruses. Some viruses undergo a <b>lysogenic</b> cycle where the viral genome is incorporated by genetic recombination into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a [...] "provirus" [...] or, {{in the case of}} bacteriophages a [...] "prophage". Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. However, at some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to active virus, which may lyse the host cells. Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by budding. During this process the virus acquires its envelope, which is a modified piece of the host's plasma or other, internal membrane.|$|E
2500|$|Survival of UV-irradiated phage λ is {{increased}} when the E. coli host is <b>lysogenic</b> for an homologous prophage, a phenomenon termed prophage reactivation. [...] Prophage reactivation in phage λ appears to occur by a recombinational repair process {{similar to that}} of MR.|$|E
2500|$|The 'late early' {{transcripts}} continue being written, including xis, int, Q and {{genes for}} replication of the lambda genome (OP). Cro dominates the repressor site (see [...] "Repressor" [...] section), repressing synthesis from the PRM promoter [...] (which is a promoter of the <b>lysogenic</b> cycle).|$|E
2500|$|Normally RecA* binds LexA (a {{transcription}} repressor), activating LexA auto-protease activity, which destroys LexA repressor, allowing {{production of}} DNA repair proteins. In <b>lysogenic</b> cells, this response is hijacked, and RecA* stimulates [...] cI autocleavage. This is because cI mimics {{the structure of}} LexA at the autocleavage site.|$|E
2500|$|All {{clinical}} isolates of E. coli O157:H7 {{possess the}} plasmid pO157. [...] The periplasmic catalase is encoded on pO157 and may enhance the virulence of the bacterium by providing additional oxidative protection when infecting the host. E. coli O157:H7 non-hemorrhagic strains are converted to hemorrhagic strains by <b>lysogenic</b> conversion after a bacteriophage infection to non-hemorrhagic cells.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes prophages {{may provide}} {{benefits}} to the host bacterium while they are dormant by adding new functions to the bacterial genome in a phenomenon called <b>lysogenic</b> conversion. Examples are the conversion of harmless strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae or Vibrio cholerae by [...] bacteriophages to highly virulent ones, which cause diphtheria or cholera, respectively. [...] Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these toxin-encoding prophages have been proposed.|$|E
2500|$|Some methods prompt {{production}} with UV radiation, Mitomycin C, or heat shock. [...] UV {{radiation and}} Mitomycin C are used because the DNA damage they produce stimulates the SOS response. [...] Cross streaking {{may be substituted}} for lawns. [...] Similarly, production in broth may be followed by dripping the broth on a nascent bacterial lawn, or even filtering it. [...] Precipitation (ammonium sulfate) and some purification (e.g. column or HPLC) may help exclude <b>lysogenic</b> and lytic phage from the assay.|$|E
2500|$|Bacteriophages {{may have}} a lytic cycle or a <b>lysogenic</b> cycle, and a few viruses are capable of {{carrying}} out both. With lytic phages such as the T4 phage, bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion. [...] As soon as the cell is destroyed, the phage progeny can find new hosts to infect. Lytic phages {{are more suitable for}} phage therapy. Some lytic phages undergo a phenomenon known as lysis inhibition, where completed phage progeny will not immediately lyse out of the cell if extracellular phage concentrations are high. This mechanism is not identical to that of temperate phage going dormant and is usually temporary.|$|E
2500|$|In {{cells with}} {{sufficient}} nutrients, protease activity is high, which breaks down cII. This {{leads to the}} lytic lifestyle. In cells with limited nutrients, protease activity is low, making cII stable. This leads to the <b>lysogenic</b> lifestyle. cIII appears to stabilize cII, both directly and by acting as a competitive inhibitor to the relevant proteases. This means that a cell [...] "in trouble", i.e. lacking in nutrients and in a more dormant state, {{is more likely to}} lysogenise. This would be selected for because the phage can now lie dormant in the bacterium until it falls on better times, and so the phage can create more copies of itself with the additional resources available and with the more likely proximity of further infectable cells.|$|E
2500|$|The phage {{particle}} {{consists of}} a head (also known as a capsid), a tail, and tail fibers (see image of virus below). The head contains the phage's double-strand linear DNA genome. During infection, the phage particle recognizes and binds to its host, E. coli, causing DNA in {{the head of the}} phage to be ejected through the tail into the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell. Usually, a [...] "lytic cycle" [...] ensues, where the lambda DNA is replicated and new phage particles are produced within the cell. This is followed by cell lysis, releasing the cell contents, including virions that have been assembled, into the environment. However, under certain conditions, the phage DNA may integrate itself into the host cell chromosome in the <b>lysogenic</b> pathway. In this state, the λ DNA is called a prophage and stays resident within the host's genome without apparent harm to the host. The host is [...] termed a lysogen when a prophage is present. This prophage may enter the lytic cycle when the lysogen enters a stressed condition.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>lysogenic</b> and lytic cycles {{is that the}} spread of the viral DNA occurs through the usual prokaryotic reproduction, while the lytic phage is spread through the production of thousands of individual phages capable of surviving and infecting other cells. The key difference between the lytic cycle and the <b>lysogenic</b> cycle is that the <b>lysogenic</b> cycle does not lyse the host cell. Phages that replicate only via the lytic cycle are known as virulent phages while phages that replicate using both lytic and <b>lysogenic</b> cycles are known as temperate phages.|$|E

50|$|Non-virulent {{bacteria}} {{have also}} been shown to transform into highly virulent pathogens through <b>lysogenic</b> conversion with the virulence factors carried on the <b>lysogenic</b> prophage. Virulence genes carried within prophages as discrete autonomous genetic elements, known as morons, confer an advantage to the bacteria that indirectly benefits the virus through enhanced lysogen survival.|$|E

5000|$|The lytic cycle ( [...] ), {{is one of}} the two {{cycles of}} viral reproduction, the other being the <b>lysogenic</b> cycle. The lytic cycle results in the {{destruction}} of the infected cell and its membrane. A key difference between the lytic and <b>lysogenic</b> phage cycles is that in the lytic phage, the viral DNA exists as a separate molecule within the bacterial cell, and replicates separately from the host bacterial DNA. The location of viral DNA in the <b>lysogenic</b> phage cycle is within the host DNA, therefore in both cases the virus/phage replicates using the host DNA machinery, but in the lytic phage cycle, the phage is a free floating separate molecule to the host DNA.|$|E
