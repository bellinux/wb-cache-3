Ranavalona's older sister, Rasendranoro, whose son Rakatomena and daughter Razafinandriamanitra <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mother at the Rova, was also a close companion. An American journalist who visited her palace reported that Ranavalona spent much of her leisure time flying kites or playing lotto, a parlor game, with her relatives and other ladies at court.
