40|$|ABSTRACT: Using 1 H {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we quantitatively evaluated correlation representing linear relationship between the metabolite peak area ratios associated with poor shimming conditions. The inadequate shimming due to <b>linear</b> <b>shim</b> offsets directly affected overall MR spectral quality as well as peak area for each metabolite. Three major peaks such as N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho) were used as a reference for data analysis. Despite considerable variations of metabolite peak area, a significant correlation between the metabolite peak area ratios relative to Cr was established while {{the correlation between the}} peak area ratios relative to Cho and NAA was not. The present study suggested that metabolite peak area ratios based on the metabolite of Cr could be an acceptable quantification method even under the poor shimming in clinical MRS examination. INTRUDUCTION The use of proton {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy (1 H MRS) in quantitative analysis of the brain metabolite {{stems from the fact that}} the peak area (or peak intensity) is directly proportional to the number of spins contributing to the peak. Thus, unde...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Cardiac 1 H MR-spectroscopy (MRS) is a {{promising}} tool for investigating heart disease. However, addressing cardiac and respiratory motion {{as well as}} B 0 inhomogeneity compensation is crucial {{in order to obtain}} good spectral quality. This work presents the combination of image-based B 0 -shimming 1, ECG-triggering and navigator-gating 2 along with retrospective frequency-alignment and phase-correction of metabolite-cycled (MC) 3, non-water-suppressed MRS 4 data for obtaining high quality MRS data. Methods Measurements were performed at a 3 T Achieva whole body system with a six channel cardiac coil (Philips Healthcare, Best, NL). For initial validation of the method, spectra were obtained from the hearts of two healthy volunteers. Navigator-gated bSSFP cine images were used for positioning the spectroscopy voxel (9. 2 x 6. 1 x 18. 7 mm 3) in the interventricular septum and establishing the trigger delay. Prior to any spectroscopy acquisition, a <b>linear</b> <b>shim</b> for the heart was calculated using an image-based Shimtool 1. The 1 H PRESS sequence (min. TR=min 3 heart beats, TE= 32 ms, 512 averages) was ECG-triggered to end systole and the navigator position was recorded. In addition, a previously implemented 5 inner volume saturation 6 scheme was used to mitigate spectral contamination from outside the VOI. MRecon (Gyrotools, Zurich, CH) was used to get access to each FID of the measurement. Navigator data was used to dismiss FIDs which were recorded during inspiration (gating window 5 mm). Afterwards FIDs were zero filled to twice the original size, phase corrected, frequency-aligned and truncated and zero filled after 100 ms. Resulting spectra were fitted with LCModel 7. Results Figure 1 demonstrates the effect of phase correction and frequency alignment. The spectrum and fit are displayed in figure 2. Intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) and extramyocellular lipids (EMCL) around 1. 3 ppm can be resolved separately {{for the first time with}} CRLB of 2 and 15, respectively. Additionally, unsaturated fatty acids, TMA, Taurine can be detected with CRLBs < 15. Conclusions It was demonstrated that the introduced technique for cardiac 1 H MRS allows for very high spectral data quality, which enables the separate analysis of IMCL and EMCL, as well as Taurin and unsaturated fatty acids for the first time...|$|E
40|$|Purpose/Introduction: Cardiac 1 H MR-spectroscopy (MRS) is a {{promising}} tool for investigating human heart disease 1. Previous MRS measurements localized {{in the human}} skeletal muscle allow a separation of intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) 2 and extramyocellular lipids (EMCL) 2 and it was shown that IMCL levels are related to insulin sensitivity (for a review 3). In contrast, EMCL signal can change dramatically depending on the localization of the voxel e. g. due to inclusion of fascia, which might compromise the reproducibility of the measurement 3. Therefore, for cardiac MRS an independent quantification of IMCL and EMCL would be ideal. However, spectral quality of cardiac MRS can be severely impaired by cardiac and respiratory motion, {{as well as by}} static field inhomogeneities making the separation difficult. This work presents the combination of imagebased B 0 -shimming 4, ECG-triggering and navigator-gating along with retrospective frequency-alignment and phase-correction of metabolite-cycled (MC) 5, non-water-suppressed MRS 6, 7 data, and demonstrates the feasibility for obtaining high quality spectroscopic information from the heart. Subjects and Methods: Measurements were performed at a 3 T Achieva system with a 32 channel cardiac coil (Philips Healthcare, Best, NL) in 8 healthy female volunteers. Navigator-gated bSSFP cine images were used for positioning the spectroscopy voxel (9. 2 9 6. 1 9 18. 7 mm 3) (Fig. 1) in the interventricular septum. Fig. 1 Measurement position in the human heart A <b>linear</b> <b>shim</b> for the heart was calculated using an image-based Shimtool 8. The inner-volume saturated 9 MC PRESS sequence 6 (min. TR = min 3 heart beats, TE = 32 ms, C 512 averages) was ECGtriggered to end systole and the navigator position was recorded. MRecon (Gyrotools, Zurich, CH) was used to get access to raw data and for SVD coil combination. FIDs were zero filled to twice the original size, phase corrected, frequency-aligned and truncated and zero filled after 100 ms (Fig. 2). Resulting spectra were fitted with LCModel 12. Results: Quantification results and an exemplary spectrum and fit are displayed in Fig. 3. The SNR of all measurements is 25 ± 11 and the line width is 21 ± 5 Hz (FWHM).

40|$|In this x-ray∕MR {{hybrid system}} an x-ray flat panel {{detector}} is {{placed under the}} patient cradle, close to the MR volume of interest (VOI), where the magnetic field strength is ∼ 0. 5 T. Immersed in this strong field, several electronic components inside the detector become magnetized and create an additional magnetic field that is superimposed on the original field of the MR scanner. Even after <b>linear</b> <b>shimming,</b> the field homogeneity of the MR scanner remains disrupted by the detector. The authors characterize the field due to the detector with the field of two magnetic dipoles and further show that two sets of permanent magnets (NdFeB) can withstand the main magnetic field and compensate for the nonlinear components of the additional field. The ideal number of magnets and their locations are calculated based on a field map measured with the detector in place. Experimental results demonstrate great promise for this technique, which {{may be useful in}} many settings where devices with magnetic components need to be placed inside or close to an MR scanner...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally the {{improvement}} of static magnetic field homogeneity of the magnet in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is performed manually, which has many limitations. However, in recent years a number of automated shimming techniques based on Fourier Imaging Technique have been proposed. Existing 3 D automated shimming methods require special, Pulsed Field Gradient (PFG) hardware, which is not available on majority of high-resolution NMR spectrometers. The modified technique, presented in this thesis uses the normal NMR hardware provided {{with the majority of}} high-resolution NMR spectrometers. The 3 D shimming technique described was optimised for use with Varian UNITY INOVA spectrometers and successfully tested with both protonated and deuterated solvents. A method for calibrating <b>linear</b> transverse <b>shim</b> field gradients and correcting any non-orthogonality and imbalance of strengths is proposed. The effect of thermal convection on field mapping was observed and is reported here for the first time. Comment: 162 page...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the need}} for rapid imaging for dynamic studies and {{excellent}} fat suppression, MRI mammographic image quality is often limited by Bo inhomogeneities. A common, but inefficient, solution is to perform sequential unilateral studies. To address this problem we developed a bilateral shimming technique which allows disjoint region of interests (ROIs) for localized shimming. In-vivo data were acquired, and homogeneity was evaluated using <b>linear</b> and nonlinear <b>shim</b> terms. Improved performance could also be acheived by allowing different center frequency terms for each breast, which can be readily accomodated by spectral-spatial fat-sat pulses and appropriate reconstruction algorithms. Prominent air-tissue interface and complex geometry of the breast and chest wall makes obtaining an uniform magneti...|$|R
40|$|Purpose/Introduction: The {{application}} of ultra-high {{static magnetic field}} strengths to functional MRI (fMRI) yields important advantages, such as higher SNR and stronger BOLD-contrast. However, the increasing field strengths come along with problems, e. g. B 0 and B 1 inhomogeneities, as well. To address the B 0 inhomogeneity dynamic shim updating (DSU) with an excellent eddy-current compensation (ECC) {{proved to be a}} promising approach [1]. This work presents the {{application of}} 3 rd order DSU with full ECC to echo planar imaging (EPI), which is the basis for BOLD-contrast fMRI. Subjects and Methods: All measurements were performed on a 7 T Philips Achieva whole-body system (Philips Healthcare,Cleveland,USA), equipped with a full set of 3 rd order shim coils. A DSU LoadGo Unit (ResonanceR esearchInc.,Billerica,USA) was connected directly to the higher order shim amplifiers. The <b>linear</b> <b>shim</b> terms are driven by the gradient amplifiers, which could not be directly assessed by the LoadGo Unit. Therefore an in-house build gradient driver box has been constructed, which sums up the voltages from the LoadGo Unit and the driving voltages for the gradient amplifiers. As fast switching of the shims induces eddy-currents in the shim coils and the surrounding conductive structures, which lead to severe long-lasting B 0 field distortions, a careful pre-emphasis calibration of the system is necessary. This has been performed using a spatio-temporal field-monitoring approach, as described previously [2]. In order to actively compensate for eddy-currents, the LoadGo unit overshoots the nominal driving voltage on a short timescale. To maintain the systems functionality, the shim strengths of the 2 nd and 3 rd order shims therefore had to be reduced to 73 to 90 and 43 to 53 of their maximum values, respectively. Results: In vivo multi-slice EPIs of the brain (TE/TR= 28 ms/ 3000 ms,EPI factor= 99) have been acquired in two healthy volunteers (fig. (2)), once using a static global shim, determined by a vendor pre-implemented routine closely related to FASTESTMAP, and once using DSU where the shim is updated 5 ms before the excitation of each slice (fig. (1)). Discussion/Conclusion: The setup and calibration used enabled for very fast switching of shims, with a settling of residual eddy-currents within less than 2 ms. Therefore, switching of the shims within a running sequence only 5 ms before the excitation was possible, contrary to more than 60 ms as reported in earlier publications [3, 4], allowing for slice-wise dynamic updated shimmed EPIs and a significant gain in image quality, without the cost of prolonged scan time...|$|E
40|$|High {{magnetic}} fields increase the sensitivity and dispersion in MR spectroscopy. Due to stronger susceptibility-induced effects, strategies for optimal shimming are of increasing importance at higher field. The problem of shim requirements which exceeded the active shim capabilities {{of our system}} by far was overcome by combined passive and active shimming. Optimal shimming enabled 1 H MR spectroscopy in the primary visual cortex V 1 of the macaque monkey brain. Methods: Measurements were done on a 7 T/ 60 cm Bruker Biospec system, temporarily equipped with a Siemens AC 44 gradient insert. MR setup and anesthesia were described previously [1]. Based on the shim field requirements as determined via FASTMAP field mapping, small pieces of μ-metal sheet were mounted on a plastic tube (length 34 cm, diameter 25 cm). Accuracy and reproducibility was achieved by a well defined positioning of the passive shims {{with respect to the}} magnet iso-center and the monkey head (Fig. 1 / 2). After crude adjustment of all second order shim terms by passive shimming, the remaining shim requirements were within the dynamic range of the active shim device for the regarded brain region. Optimal shimming of all first and second order terms was done with FASTMAP on a 1 cm 3 cube volume in visual cortex, before the <b>linear</b> <b>shim</b> terms were refined locally for the MR spectroscopy voxel (yellow box, Fig. 3) [2]. Results: Depending on the monkey anatomy and head rotation, required shim fields of the two critical second order shims Z 2 and X 2 -Y 2 were found to (1000 ± 200) and (600 ± 300) of the available shim fields. By passive shimming it was possible to cancel the major field distortions and to reduce the shim requirements to the dynamic range of the active shims. Passive shimming was reproducible between experiment days and no further modifiactions were needed. No eddy current effects nor heating was observed in any of the MR spectroscopy or imaging experiments. With combined shimming, linewidths of 11. 5 - 12. 5 Hz for water and 10 - 11 Hz for the Cr+PCr resonance at 3 ppm were reproducibly achieved in 5 x 1. 6 x 5 mm 3 MR spectroscopy voxels in V 1 (Fig. 3 / 4). The spectral separation of creatine and phosphocreatine was possible and 10 + metabolites were quantified. Discussion: Even strong limitations of the active shim power can be overcome by combined passive and active shimming. This might be of high practical relevance for high field MR setups of limited shim power and/or shimming of body regions which require high shim fields...|$|E
