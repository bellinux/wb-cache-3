50|$|The Model 28 {{printing}} units {{contain a}} sequential selector, {{known as the}} Stunt Box, which monitors the received line and the keyboard signals for receipt of single characters and sequences of characters. Forty-two functional control positions are provided, some of which as used for functions such as carriage return, line feed, figures shift, <b>letters</b> <b>shift,</b> unshift-on-space and the signal bell. The removable Electrical Service Unit (LESU) is an integrated chassis housing the line fuse, convenience receptacle, terminal blocks for wiring options and mounting facilities for optional sub-assemblies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{alphabet}} {{used in the}} ARQ-M protocol {{is based}} on the CCITT Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 more commonly known as Baudot. [...] This alphabet has five bits, and therefore has 25 or 32 different possible symbols. It uses <b>letters</b> <b>shift</b> and figures shifts to select different sets of characters similar to a typewriter. The ARQ-M alphabet being synchronous always has to send data and does not have gaps between characters. It does not include start and stop bits that would be used in asynchronous transmissions and so saves on those two bits per character. In asynchronous transmissions a steady stop signal indicates that there is nothing to send. A prolonged start signal can be used for signalling, for example to select a destination for a telex connection.|$|E
5000|$|The cells {{marked as}} {{reserved}} for extensions (using the LS code {{again from the}} <b>letters</b> <b>shift</b> page, just after a first LS code to shift from the figures page) has been defined to shift into a new mode: in this new mode, the letters page are containing lowercase letters only, but a third page of codes is still accessible for the uppercase letters, either temporarily for a single letter (encode LS before that letter), may be locked (with FS+LS) for an unlimited number of capital letters or digits and then unlocked to return to lowercase mode (with a single LS). The cell marked as [...] "Reserved" [...] is also usable (using the FS code from the figures shift page) to switch the page of figures (which normally contains digits and national lowercase letters or symbols) to a fourth page (where national letters are uppercased and other symbols may be encoded).|$|E

500|$|Also by 1867, {{codes for}} Q (...) and Z (...) {{were added to}} the one-needle code, but not, apparently, for J. [...] However, codes for Q (...) , Z (...) , and J (...) are marked on the plates of later needle telegraphs, {{together}} with six-unit codes for number <b>shift</b> (...) and <b>letter</b> <b>shift</b> (...) [...] [...] Numerous compound codes were added for operator controls such as wait and repeat. [...] These compounds are similar to the prosigns found in Morse code where the two characters are run together without a character gap. [...] The two-needle number <b>shift</b> and <b>letter</b> <b>shift</b> codes are also compounds, which is the reason they have been written with an overbar.|$|R
2500|$|In addition, {{there are}} ten {{patterns}} {{that are based}} on the first two <b>letters</b> (...) <b>shifted</b> to the right; these were assigned to non-French letters (ì ä ò [...] ), or serve non-letter functions: [...] (superscript; in English the accent mark), [...] (currency prefix), [...] (capital, in English the decimal point), [...] (number sign), [...] (emphasis mark), [...] (symbol prefix).|$|R
5000|$|The code {{position}} {{assigned to}} Null {{was in fact}} used only for the idle state of teleprinters. During long periods of idle time, the impulse rate was not synchronized between both devices (which could even be powered off or not permanently interconnected on commuted phone lines). To start a message it was first necessary to calibrate the impulse rate a sequence of regularly timed [...] "mark" [...] pulses (1) by group of five pulses, which could also be detected by simple passive electronic devices {{to turn on the}} teleprinter; this series of pulse was generating series of Erasure/Delete and also initializing the receiver state to the <b>Letters</b> <b>shift</b> mode, however the first pulse could be lost, so this power on procedure could then be terminated by a single Null immediately followed by an Erasure/Delete character. To preserve the synchronization between devices, the Null code could not be used arbitrarily in the middle of messages (this was an improvement to the initial Baudot system where spaces were not explicitly differentiated, so it was difficult to maintain the pulse counters for repeating spaces on teleprinters). But it was then possible to resynchronize devices at any time by sending a Null {{in the middle of a}} message (immediately followed by an Erasure/Delete/LS control if followed by a letter, or by a FS control if followed by a figure). Sending Null controls also did not cause the paper band to advance to the next row (as nothing was punched), so this saved precious lengths of punchable paper band. On the opposite the Erasure/Delete/LS control code was always punched and always shifted to the (initial) letters mode. According to some sources, the Null code point was reserved for country-internal usage only.|$|E
40|$|Language {{acquisition}} {{starts from}} {{the ability of}} listening basic letter(iktisab al-ashwat) since child age. The letter of a language is limited in number, and sometimes there is similarity of letters among languages. The similarity of letters in two languages {{make it easy to}} learn the language. On the contrary, the obstacle of language learning can be caused by different letters between two languages (mother tongue and second/foreign language). The problem may be caused by minimal pairs (tsunaiyat al-shughro). This research aims at finding out the error of minimal pair acquisition, with the subject of Indonesian students in Jami’ah Malik Saud Saudi Arabia, with the method of error analysis. The study concludes that in iktisab al-ashwat of minimal pairs, the error is around 3, 3 %- 58, 3 %.

The remaining 26 code points are used for characters in the letters and figures sets. Consequently, ITA2 can represent 52 (2*26) additional characters.|$|R

So they would type 55M88 to represent a full stop. Such doubling of characters was very helpful for the statistical cryptanalysis used at Bletchley Park. After encipherment, shift characters had no special meaning.|$|R

40|$|A new {{instrumental}} variables based {{identification procedure}} is introduced to estimate linear and nonlinear continuous time models using a shifted Chebyshev {{basis in the}} presence of noise.

Howard Bergerson, writing under a pseudonym, christened QUACK a shiftgram of MUSIC in 2 ̆ 2 Sea-Changed Words 2 ̆ 2 in the February 1969 Word Ways. Multiple shiftgrams are possible; however, the theoretical maximum of 26 shiftgrams of a word is impossible to achieve for words of four or fewer letters because of the paucity of vowels, and equally impossible for words of five or more letters because of the sparseness of words.
