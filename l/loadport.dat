40|$|Litho cells, are {{the most}} {{expensive}} equipment in a wafer fab. To support decision-making on this equipment, accurate simulation models for throughput and cycle time are helpful. The simulation models that are typically developed incorporate various shopfloor details. To properly model these details, they should be quantified, which is difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, a lumped parameter model is proposed for the litho cell. The model consists of two parts: a detailed representation of the processing inside the track and scanner, and an aggregate representation of the factory floor feeding the <b>loadport.</b> The track-scanner is modeled as a tandem flow line with blocking. The shop floor is represented by a delay distribution that incorporates all contributions outside the machine. Simulation {{results show that the}} suggested method provides a simple, yetaccurate approximation of the litho cell...|$|E
40|$|Building on {{the lessons}} learned from the 150 -mm-to 200 mm {{transition}} in semiconductor manufacturing, much work has gone into the planning and development of 300 -mm fabs. Examples of this include the work produced by SEMI, International SEMATECH’s I 300 I and Japan’s J 300 programs. This work includes various standards and guidelines regarding the architecture and interfaces of <b>loadports,</b> equipment and software components. However, despite these efforts, {{there are a number of}} significant 300 -mm risks that remain. Some of these risks involve specific fab operational methodologies, which may vary depending upon the type of fab involved. Additionally, there are many other risks associated with the development and implementation of a robust 300 -mm logistics system. The purpose of this paper is to: • Define some of the key risks associated with the development and implementation of a fully integrated 300 -mm logistics system. • Show how simulation can be used in conjunction with a risk management approach, i. e. Boehm spiral model, to play a key role in the mitigation of those risks. ...|$|R
