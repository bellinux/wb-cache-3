It was a big {{load off}} me when, as I took him his mixture one morning, he <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> 'Who the devil are you poisoning?' says he, quite sensible, an' like himself again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The coast {{was clear}} {{by the time}} I went back, and I 'ad just stepped outside with my back up agin the gate-post to 'ave a pipe, when I see a boy coming along with a bag. Good-looking lad of about fifteen 'e was, nicely dressed in a serge suit, and he no sooner gets up to me than 'e puts down the bag and <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a timid sort o' little smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Next {{night but}} one he slings {{himself up in}} my cabin, and I does so. Nothing loth, off he starts. There was about half-a-dozen of us {{stretched}} round, and the cat was sitting before the fire fussing itself up. Before Bill had got fairly under weigh, she stops washing and <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> puzzled like, as much as to say, [...] "What have we got here, a missionary?" [...] I signalled to her to keep quiet, and Bill went on with his yarn. When {{he got to the}} part about the sharks, she turned deliberately round and looked at him. I tell you there was an expression of disgust on that cat's face as might have made a travelling Cheap Jack feel ashamed of himself. It was that human, I give you my word, sir, I forgot for the moment as the poor animal couldn't speak. I could see the words that were on its lips: [...] "Why don't you tell us you swallowed the anchor?" [...] and I sat on tenter-hooks, fearing each instant that she would say them aloud. It was a relief to me when she turned her back on Bill.|$|E
60|$|She {{dropped her}} sewing {{in her lap}} and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> quickly.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> defensively and for {{a moment}} neither of us spoke.|$|R
60|$|Then he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again, {{and swore}} {{one of his}} great oaths.|$|R
6000|$|... "He gave me {{a letter}} {{addressed}} to the Commissary-general. 'Take that,' says he, 'to the sergeant of the guard at once, {{and tell him to}} be sure that it is forwarded to the Commissary-General first thing in the morning.' I went out at once, and on the lawn in the quadrangle I saw a man lying on his back on the grass and another man kneeling beside him. I ran across to them. It was a bright, moonlight night--bright as day it was, and you could see quite clear. The gentleman that was kneeling <b>looks</b> <b>up,</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and I sees it was Captain Tremayne, sir. 'What's this, Captain dear?' says I. 'It's Count Samoval, and he's kilt,' says he, 'for God's sake, go and fetch somebody.' So I ran back to tell Sir Terence, and Sir Terence he came out with me, and mighty startled he was at what he found there. 'What's happened?'says he, and the captain answers him just as he had answered me: 'It's Count Samoval, and he's kilt. 'But how did it happen?' says Sir Terence. 'Sure and that's just what I want to know,' says the captain; 'I found him here.' And then Sir Terence turns to me, and 'Mullins,' says he, 'just fetch the guard,' and of course, I went at once." ...|$|E

You see I built on Lettie,"—he {{looked up at me}} shamefacedly, then {{continued}} tearing the shavings—"you must found your castles on something, and I founded mine on Lettie. You see, I'm like plenty of folks, I have nothing definite to shape my life to. I put brick upon brick, as they come, and if the whole topples down in the end, it does. But you see, you and Lettie have made me conscious, and now I'm at a dead loss. I have looked to marriage to set me busy on my house of life, something whole and complete, of which it will supply the design. I must marry or be in a lost lane. There are two people I could marry—and Lettie's gone. I love Meg just as well, as far as love goes. I'm not sure I don't feel better pleased at the idea of marrying her. You know I should always have been second to Lettie, and the best part of love is being made much of, being first and foremost in the whole world for somebody. And Meg's easy and lovely. I can have her without trembling, she's full of soothing and comfort. I can stroke her hair and pet her, and she <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> full of trust and lovingness, and there is no flaw, all restfulness in one another——" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'How dreadful ill {{and weak}} she do look, don't she?' says Emmy. Before I could say {{as much as}} 'Yes,' she stares up at us, and asks in a wild voice, though it wasn't very loud either, if we can tell her the way to Bangbury workhouse. Having pretty sharp eyes of our own, we both of us knew that a workhouse was no fit place for her. Her gown was very dusty, {{and one of her}} boots was burst, and her hair was draggled all over her face, and her eyes was sunk in her head, like; but we saw somehow that she was a lady--or, if she wasn't exactly a lady, that no workhouse was proper for her, at any rate. I stooped down to speak to her; but her baby was crying so dreadful she could hardly hear me. 'Is the poor thing ill?' says I. 'Starving,' says she, in such a desperate, fierce way, that it gave me a turn. 'Is that your child?' says I, a bit frightened about how she'd answer me. 'Yes,' she says in quite a new voice, very soft and sorrowful, and bending her face away from me over the child. 'Then why don't you suckle it?' says I. She <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and then at Jenny and shakes her head, and says nothing. I give my baby to Jemmy to hold, and went and sat down by her. He walked away a little; and I whispered to her again, 'Why don't you suckle it?' and she whispered to me, 'My milk's all dried up. I couldn't wait to hear no more till I'd got her baby at my own breast.|$|E
60|$|Here the dark-faced Freydisa <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{then dropped}} her eyes again, and stood listening.|$|R
60|$|She {{broke the}} seal, {{went to the}} table, and read. Then she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} a very {{diminutive}} palm and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a beaming smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had to go}} {{over and}} tell Henry Pollack he was dying. Everybody else was afraid to tell him. They {{expected}} he'd take on turrible, for he's been dreadful determined to live, and been making no end of plans for the fall. His wife thought he oughter be told and that I'd be the best one to break it to him that he couldn't get better. Henry and me are old cronies--we sailed in the Gray Gull for years together. Well, I went over and sat down by Henry's bed and I says to him, says I, jest right out plain and simple, for if a thing's got to be told it may as well be told first as last, says I, 'Mate, I reckon you've got your sailing orders this time,' I was sorter quaking inside, for it's an awful thing to have to tell a man who hain't any idea he's dying that he is. But lo and behold, Mistress Blythe, Henry <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> with those bright old black eyes of his in his wizened face and says, says he, 'Tell me something I don't know, Jim Boyd, if you want to give me information. I've known THAT for a week.' I was too astonished to speak, and Henry, he chuckled. 'To see you coming in here,' says he, 'with your face as solemn as a tombstone and sitting down there with your hands clasped over your stomach, and passing me out a blue-mouldy old item of news like that! It'd make a cat laugh, Jim Boyd,' says he. 'Who told you?' says I, stupid like. 'Nobody,' says he. 'A week ago Tuesday night I was lying here awake--and I jest knew. I'd suspicioned it before, but then I KNEW. I've been keeping up for the wife's sake. And I'd LIKE to have got that barn built, for Eben'll never get it right. But anyhow, now that you've eased your mind, Jim, put on a smile and tell me something interesting,' Well, there it was. They'd been so scared to tell him and he knew it all the time. Strange how nature looks out for us, ain't it, and lets us know what we should know when the time comes? Did I never tell you the yarn about Henry getting the fish hook in his nose, Mistress Blythe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yet {{it was not}} {{a sudden}} impulse. His grey-headed mate, a first-rate sailor and a nice old chap with strangers, but in his {{relations}} with his commander the surliest chief officer I've ever seen, would tell the story with tears in his eyes. It appears that when he came on deck in the morning Brierly had been writing in the chart-room. [...] "It was ten minutes to four," [...] he said, [...] "and the middle watch was not relieved yet of course. He heard my voice on the bridge speaking to the second mate, and called me in. I was loth to go, and that's the truth, Captain Marlow--I couldn't stand poor Captain Brierly, I tell you with shame; we never know what a man is made of. He had been promoted over too many heads, not counting my own, and he had a damnable trick of making you feel small, nothing but by the way he said 'Good morning.' I never addressed him, sir, but on matters of duty, and then it was as much as I could do to keep a civil tongue in my head." [...] (He flattered himself there. I often wondered how Brierly could put up with his manners {{for more than half a}} voyage.) [...] "I've a wife and children," [...] he went on, [...] "and I had been ten years in the Company, always expecting the next command--more fool I. Says he, just like this: 'Come in here, Mr. Jones,' in that swagger voice of his--'Come in here, Mr. Jones.' In I went. 'We'll lay down her position,' says he, stooping over the chart, a pair of dividers in hand. By the standing orders, the officer going off duty would have done that at the end of his watch. However, I said nothing, and looked on while he marked off the ship's position with a tiny cross and wrote the date and the time. I can see him this moment writing his neat figures: seventeen, eight, four A.M. The year would be written in red ink at the top of the chart. He never used his charts more than a year, Captain Brierly didn't. I've the chart now. When he had done he stands looking down at the mark he had made and smiling to himself, then <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> 'Thirty-two miles more as she goes,' says he, 'and then we shall be clear, and you may alter the course twenty degrees to the southward.' ...|$|E
5000|$|After a near fatal {{car crash}} {{during one of}} his races, his drag racing career floundered before he finally gave it up for good to pursue a career in {{organized}} crime. Roy DeMeo, who was at the near fatal race in the stands, said about the horrifying incident, [...] "I went to watch Freddy once and he crashed. He climbs {{out of the car and}} he's on fire. He looks like an astronaut who has crash landed. The firemen are hosing him down, but he <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in the stands and begins to smile and wave like some kids were squirting him by the pool. Don't tell me Freddy is crazy. I know he is fucking nuts." ...|$|E
60|$|Gilbert <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> quickly, {{as though}} a new thing had come into his mind.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated again, {{gripping}} the window strap, putting his face forward and <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> appealingly.|$|R
60|$|In {{surprise}} she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and then}} down at the pearls upon her satin slippers.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} asking for {{confirmation}} of her views. I shook my head.|$|R
60|$|The Duke looked thoughtfully {{for several}} moments at the table before him. Then he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. Lord Cheisford {{turned again}} to his notes. Then he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|I set {{more food}} before the famished child and kissed her. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{wondering}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|Bes {{squatted down}} upon the floor and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a strange smile on his ugly face.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{a little}} smile. I think she must have {{forgotten}} {{the pain in her}} foot.|$|R
60|$|He turned with an oath, and {{followed}} his brother into the wood. Naomi's bright eyes <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> flashing with indignation.|$|R
60|$|I came {{slowly back}} to the table, and stood facing her across it. She <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with very piteous eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{was leaning}} back in her chair, her hands behind her head, a posture she often assumed. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> amusedly.|$|R
60|$|He said nothing, but hid {{his face}} in his arms over the rail of the bower. <b>At</b> length he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> fiercely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Harold did," [...] said she, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> triumphantly; [...] "he beat all the boys, {{and had to}} {{come back}} again to Boola Boola." ...|$|R
60|$|A faint blush {{came over}} her cheeks, {{and a smile}} broke out on her lips; she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a pretty reproachful air.|$|R
60|$|Between me and Gussie, {{who was now}} {{pointing}} in an offensive manner, {{there was nothing but}} a sea of interested faces <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes--And {{what does}} she say--Eliza? We know her name's Eliza, that's another thing.' She grimaced a little, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a mocking laugh.|$|R
60|$|The men stopped {{their game}} and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{but there was}} no sign of suspicion. Similarly they looked at Woola, {{growling}} at my heel.|$|R
60|$|Later, I sought her out. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> amusedly {{from the}} window-seat in our living-room, {{where she had}} been talking to the Scherer girls.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, not farewell," [...] {{she whispered}} back, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{eyes that were}} full of tears, though what she meant I did not know.|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} there was silence. Ajor <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> a hurt and {{questioning}} expression on her face. [...] "Whose she is this?" [...] repeated Al-tan.|$|R
