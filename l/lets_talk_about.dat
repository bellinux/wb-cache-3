The state agent give me a ticket to here, & on the car i thought more of what you said to me, but didn't make up my mind. When we got to Chicago on the cars from there to here, I pulled off an old woman's leather; (ROBBED HER OF HER POCKETBOOK) i hadn't no more than got it off when i wished i hadn't done it, for awhile before that {{i made up my mind}} to be a square bloke, for months on your word, but forgot it when i saw the leather was a grip (EASY TO GET)--but i kept clos to her & when she got out of the cars at a way place i said, marm have you lost anything. & she tumbled (DISCOVERED) her leather was off (GONE)--is this it says i, giving it to her--well if you aint honest, says she, but i hadn't got cheak enough to stand that sort of talk, so i left her in a hurry. When i got here i had $1 and 25 cents left & i didn't get no work for 3 days as i aint strong enough for roust about on a steam bote (FOR A DECK HAND)--The afternoon of the 3rd day I spent my last 10 cts for moons (LARGE, ROUND SEA-BISCUIT) & cheese & i felt pretty rough & was thinking i would have to go on the dipe (PICKING POCKETS) again, when i thought of what you once said about a fellows calling on the Lord when he was in hard luck, & i thought i would try it once anyhow, but when i tryed it i got stuck on the start, & all i could get off wos, Lord give a poor fellow a chance to square it for 3 months for Christ's sake, amen; & i kept a thinking, of it over and over as i went along--about an hour after that i was in 4th St. & this is what happened & is the cause of my being where i am now & about which i will tell you before i get done writing. As i was walking along herd a big noise & saw a horse running away with a carriage with 2 children in it, & I grabed up a peace of box cover from the side walk & run in the middle of the street, & when the horse came up i smashed him over the head as hard as i could drive--the bord split to peces & the horse checked up a little & I grabbed the reigns & pulled his head down until he stopped--the gentleman what owned him came running up & soon as he saw the children were all rite, he shook hands with me and gave me a $50 green back, & my asking the Lord to help me come into my head, & i was so thunderstruck i couldn't drop the reigns nor say nothing--he saw something was up, & coming back to me said, my boy are you hurt? & the thought come into my head just then to ask him for work; & i asked him to take back the bill and give me a job--says he, jump in here & <b>lets</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it, but keep the money--he asked me if i could take care of horses & i said yes, for i used to hang round livery stables & often would help clean & drive horses, he told me he wanted a man for that work, & would give me $16 a month & bord me. You bet i took that chance at once. that nite in my little room over the stable i sat a long time thinking over my past life & of what had just happened & i just got down on my nees & thanked the Lord for the job & to help me to square it, & to bless you for putting me up to it, & the next morning i done it again & got me some new togs (CLOTHES) & a bible for i made up my mind after what the Lord had done for me i would read the bible every nite and morning, & ask him to keep an eye on me. When I had been there about a week Mr. Brown (that's his name) came in my room one nite and saw me reading the bible--he asked me if i was a Christian & i told him no--he asked me how it was i read the bible instead of papers & books--Well Charlie i thought i had better give him a square deal in the start, so i told him all about my being in prison & about you, & how i had almost done give up looking for work & how the Lord got me the job when I asked him; & the only way i had to pay him back was to read the bible & square it, & i asked him to give me a chance for 3 months--he talked to me like a father for a long time, & told me i could stay & then i felt better than ever i had done in my life, for i had given Mr. Brown a fair start with me & now i didn't fear no one giving me a back cap (EXPOSING HIS PAST LIFE) & running me off the job--the next morning he called me into the library & gave me another square talk, & advised me to study some every day, & he would help me one or 2 hours every nite, & he gave me a Arithmetic, a spelling book, a Geography & a writing book, & he hers me every nite--he lets me come into the house to prayers every morning, & got me put in a bible class in the Sunday School which i likes very much for it helps me to understand my bible better.|$|E

40|$|Beeswax {{candles and}} creams Cue: Livestock such as cattle provide {{a wide range}} of products: meat, milk, hides, manure and labour. Bees may be a much smaller animal, but they also provide an {{impressive}} range of products. The most obvious is honey, but there are several others, including beeswax and Royal Jelly. Bees produce the beeswax in order to construct the honeycomb. Once a bee-keeper has extracted the honey from the comb, this can be melted into a lump of wax, which has many potential uses. As such, beeswax may be a useful source of extra income for bee-keepers. In The Gambia the National Beekeepers? Association {{is at the heart of}} the country?s bee-keeping activities. Beekeepers bring their honey and other bee products to the Association for them to be sold, or used in making value added products. Ismaila Senghore recently visited the Association?s headquarters, located on a busy road in the capital Banjul, to find out more about the value of these bee by-products. IN:		?I am right here at the National ? OUT:		?to you. Thank you very much. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 37 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And that was Ismaila Senghore reporting from Banjul in The Gambia. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Senghore	I am right here at the National Beekeepers? Association of The Gambia, right in their warehouse where they have the activities of processing of honey going on. And of course we have other by-products also from honey production, that is the wax, like candles, body creams and a lot more. But I have with me here Mr Ebrima Sanyang who is the processing officer of the National Beekeepers? Association of The Gambia. Mr Sanyang is going to tell me exactly how they manage to get the wax in the first place, and what they make out of this wax as by-products which are also meant for the market. Sanyang	Thank you Mr Senghore I am here to give you the view points of the by-products that we have in office here. After extracting out of the honey you put it in a container whereby you can melt it and then produce the wax alone with the bad elements out of it. Then from there you reprocess it again for it to be more clean than before, refining it with coke which will make it cleaner than before. Then you can start to make what you are going to make out of it. Senghore	Now what are the kinds of commodities that you get out of the wax in that form? Sanyang	You can make candles, body cream, wood polish, soap, cosmetics possibly. Senghore	Alright now let?s say if you look at the products that you make, like the ones on display here, the body creams, how do you go about making the body cream for example? Can you explain briefly? Sanyang	Yes ok making body cream you have a certain measurement of the products you are going to use. For the wax itself there is a measurement which is one tea cup full of wax and then you can buy your oil, this vegetable oil, two cups measured in it, put it in the wax, melt it with other products like mentholator or this Karit‚ cream, you add there too to make it soft. Senghore	Ok now <b>let?s</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the candles, how do you go about making the candles? Sanyang	You are going to break the wax into pieces or into particles, whereby you melt it. And then the other chemical you are going to put inside for it to absorb fire easily is paraffin, which is not available in time. But what we do is we buy these candles from the shops, break it into pieces, melt it together with the wax so that the paraffin inside that candle can be mixed up with the wax to absorb fire easily. Senghore	Now do you make enough for the market, in other words is the demand very high? Sanyang	Well the demand is not so high because we Africans we are not adopting this type of system of candles. But let?s say the whites who always come, sometimes they make a lot of demand, whereby I make it for them, then sell it to them for their own use. Senghore	Finally Mr Sanyang would you say this kind of activity, processing of commodities from wax honey by-products, can be something that can be sustainable amongst your members, like for example they can go and do it on their own even if you are not around? Sanyang	Yes, some of them they do make it because when I am away, sometimes I meet up with others who are making it, and then some comes to my centre to buy wax for making body creams and the likes. Senghore	Therefore what advice would you give to anybody who is planning to go into the processing of such by-products? What kind of advice do you think will be useful to them so they will make successful enterprises like this? Sanyang	Yes, I thought that before you start on the process you have to find all your necessary equipments whereby your work will be easy without any other problem. Senghore	Thank you very much Mr Ebrima Sanyang. That was Mr Ebrima Sanyang talking to me about the processing of wax into commodities that are useable by the local markets and of course by tourists coming here in The Gambia. Mr Sanyang is the Processing Officer of the National Beekeeper?s Association of the Gambia. Mr Sanyang it has been a great pleasure talking to you. Thank you very much.

40|$|Urban {{farming and}} food Cue: Urban {{agriculture}} - the {{growing of crops}} and keeping of livestock in cities ? is increasingly popular {{in many parts of}} Africa, both as a means for generating income, and as a way for urban households to supplement their diets. However, one challenge facing urban farming is how to access water for irrigation. While some families may harvest rainwater from their rooftops, many urban farmers depend on less clean sources of water, including polluted rivers and drainage channels. This creates a danger to health, both for the farmers themselves, who risk catching infections from the water, and for consumers who buy their produce. So how can consumers protect themselves, {{and what can be done}} to ensure that produce grown in urban areas is as safe as possible? To find out, Eric Kadenge went to a restaurant owned by food safety expert Mr Ham Onsando. Apart from his restaurant business, Mr Onsando also works for Global Food Safety, an organisation which helps restaurants and food processors to improve their safety standards. He began by explaining the risk to food safety from the use of contaminated irrigation water. IN:		?There is a very interesting situation ? OUT:		? Thank you very much. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 35 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Ham Onsando, of the organisation Global Food Safety, talking to Eric Kadenge. Transcript Onsando	There is a very interesting situation that we find ourselves, especially in Nairobi and the urban setting. You have got your domestic shambas (gardens), you have got people who grow food by riversides, by drainage systems. A lot of these obviously have an element of risk. More so when we know that a lot of the effluent that leaves our houses finds its way into these rivers, into the drainage system on the way out. If you go into the industrial area, a lot of organizations there are pumping chemicals into these same scenarios that then end up possibly contaminating the produce that we get from these farmers. Kadenge	It is actually quite scary especially during the days when it?s very rainy because you will find that the sewage water and all the other rain water gets mixed up. Onsando	I have got a classic example of one. On my way home I always drive by him, he?s got a little sukuma wiki (kales) patch, and I know he gets his water from the drainage that runs by the little patch. There are issues in terms of what contaminants he is actually transferring on to the produce. The produce looks good, but you have then got to be aware of ? because of where it is grown - there is a risk and because of that risk there are ways you have got to address it. So you have got to cook it thoroughly, make sure you wash it thoroughly etc. So the steps to actually secure your own safety in terms of the consumer are easy to achieve. It is just washing thoroughly and then cooking thoroughly. That would normally get rid of the kind of contaminants we are dealing with in the urban area. But in that backdrop as well, we have got a mushrooming up of more informal eating areas as well. Nowadays you walk down the street and you can buy fruit salad ready to eat. You don?t know where the fruits have been washed, you don?t know whether the guy washed his hands before peeling the fruit, before chopping; we know so little about the food we are eating. Kadenge	And how do you think then that some of these risks could be minimized or prevented especially from the farmer?s perspective? Onsando	One of the biggest things we need is legislation. Legislation in the sense that farmers who draw water from rivers or from bore-holes have a right to know what kind of pollutants could have gotten into that water. Now legislation on industries, big industry players, we need legislation that will control what they can spew out into rivers. We need legislation that controls what pesticides farmers can use and in what quantities. Kadenge	<b>Let?s</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the consumer. How should I as a consumer get to know about these risks? Onsando	Education on food risks when you are eating is very key. But from my perspective any time you eat in a restaurant ? even if you have the slightest discomfort, four hours, three hours after eating, complain. Go back to that restaurant and complain. Say they caused you to have a sleepless night, they caused you to have diarrhea ? complain. Consumers have to be aware of their rights and I think the media has a role to play in that and maybe we should be running more consumer awareness programs and inviting people to tell the consumer what is his right as a consumer. Kadenge	And lastly then, what word would you have in regards to the contamination of water that is used for irrigation in urban settings like Nairobi? Onsando	Other than touting a lot for legislation, I would also like to ask the industry players, the guys who are actually spewing out a lot of waste water into our ecosystem. They should actually take it upon themselves and they should ask themselves ?Is what I am doing good for the environment?? Because ultimately, they might think that they will drive home in their big cars and go into their posh neighbourhoods and it will not affect them. But ultimately whatever we do to the environment affects us. Nature has got a nasty way of coming right round back and hitting at us. Kadenge	Okay thank you very much for taking your time to talk to us. Is this my cup of tea? Onsando	Yes, enjoy your cup of tea, it is very safe - purified water! Kadenge	Thank you very much.

40|$|Caring for chicks Cue: When rearing chickens, {{either for}} eggs or meat, most poultry farmers buy young chicks, often called ?day old chicks?, from a hatchery. These young birds are very vulnerable, {{and must be}} {{protected}} by the farmer against cold and disease. In particular, the chicks must be kept completely separate from adult birds on the farm, and if possible, people working with the adult birds should not enter the chicks? ?brooder house?. This will help {{to ensure that no}} diseases are transmitted to the chicks. Farmers must also pay attention to vaccination, feed and water requirements, so that the young birds grow strong and healthy. Bob Akinwumi is a poultry farmer who keeps layer hens on his farm in Nigeria. Tunde Fatunde spoke to him about how he cares for his day old chicks IN:		?For the day old chick ? OUT:		?. we do not mix. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Bob Akinwumi was talking to Tunde Fatunde. Transcript Akinwumi	For the day old chick you have to carve out a space that is well protected against cold. So that you put in your day old chick here with some heat source to give them the warmth for two weeks. If you go to acquire, which most of us do, from the hatchery, some hatcheries may be as far as a thousand kilometres away because some of the day old chicks come from Europe, from France for example. You assume that these birds have been put under certain stress so immediately after their arrival they are treated against stress by giving them a solution of sugar and water. Fatunde	What next? Akinwumi	Now the next day what we do by experience is we do not start the day old chick with the chicken feed. We crush some maize and give this to them because we realise from experience the day old chick are very susceptible to constipation when they are introduced to the new feed immediately. So you keep them on maize only. Fatunde	For how long? Akinwumi	Just for a day. Fatunde	And then what next? Akinwumi	On the third day you introduce your normal feed, the starter feed. The starter feed is different from the growing feed because they are richer in protein. And when you have the adequate formula you can put this together yourself. Fatunde	So what do you do yourself? Akinwumi	You go to the market to buy the ingredients like maize which is about 60 % of your feed mixture. You get the Soya bean cake, cotton seed cake, these are to boost the protein content. You add some fishmeal, which you also get from the market. You add some pulverised seashells or animal bone, crushed animal bone to improve the calcium content of your feed. You add some salt for the mineral and then you put in some additives which are already premixed from the pharmacy shop, from the veterinary shop. Fatunde	Now you do that for what space of time? Akinwumi	The starter feed is for {{just a couple of weeks}} between the second day to about two weeks after. Two weeks after they are removed from this special room where they are kept warm and put in your normal rearing deep litter shed and then you can start them off with your growers feed. Fatunde	What do you mean by grower feeds? Akinwumi	Grower feed is the feed they feed on to develop before they start laying which is also a little different in formulation to the starter. Fatunde	Yes what is the difference and what is grower feed?????. Akinwumi	The difference is that the birds can now tolerate? [...] Fatunde	They can easily digest? Akinwumi	They can digest easily the cotton seed which you do not put in a larger quantity for the day old chick. Fatunde	Now <b>lets</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> diseases. These day old chicks, are they susceptible to diseases? Akinwumi	Yes poultry is very very susceptible to diseases and there are many kinds of diseases. Fatunde	Yes and what are these diseases? Akinwumi	The common diseases around here are the Gumboro, the Newcastle, the Infectious Bronchitis which is the infection of the breathing system. There is the coccidiosis which is easily transmitted from one bird to the other through their droppings and the fowl pox. Fatunde	Do you have to wait for these diseases to manifest themselves or you go ahead and do preventive? Akinwumi	Usually a poultry farmer should prevent his birds [getting sick] from day one. Fatunde	Ok now what are these??? [...] Akinwumi	As soon as the day old chicks come in from the second day onwards there is a table to be followed, a table that tells you the kind of vaccine that should be used periodically for your birds to prevent them from contracting these common diseases. Fatunde	Yes and is it you who applies these vaccines and drugs or do you do it with the help of?? [...] Akinwumi	Yes, yes they are easily applied because most of these vaccines are - some of them are injectable - but you can also go for liquid that you can push into their drinking water and makes it very easy. Fatunde	Do you also boost the immunity or you boost the energy of these day old chicks with vitamins? Akinwumi	Yes what you usually do in poultry, since you are subjecting your birds to all kinds of vaccines it is assumed that these vaccines are another source of stress for the birds. So to help the animal to overcome this stress every time you introduce a vaccine you cover it up by giving them vitamins. Fatunde	Have you had any cause to mix old and new birds together? Akinwumi	No this is never done. Fatunde	Why? Akinwumi	We avoid doing this in my farm because usually you find out that the old birds have the tendency of claiming the landlordship of the area where they are and therefore the tendency is to attack the new birds. That?s the first thing. The second thing will be, it will not be advisable if even if they are tolerable because you risk transferring of infection from the old birds to the smaller birds, or to the new birds. Fatunde	So you don?t do it? Akinwumi	We do not mix. End of track. Bob Akinwumi, who keeps layer hens, describes the feeding and disease control methods he uses in raising day old chicks...|$|E
40|$|Cross-breeding European and African goats Cue: For {{livestock}} keepers {{who only}} {{have access to}} small amounts of land for grazing or feed production, rearing the fittest and healthiest animals that will earn the highest price possible in the marketplace is vital. One way of doing this is through careful breeding. For example, by only allowing the strongest male animals to mate with the females, farmers improve the chances that the offspring will also be strong and healthy. This is known as breeding by selection. Another way of breeding better quality animals is cross-breeding ? that is using a male animal from a different breed. In Kenya, for example, the NGO Farm-Africa {{has been working with}} goat farmers {{to improve the quality of}} their animals by cross-breeding with a European breed of goat, the British Toggenburg. This is a type of goat developed in Europe for its high milk production. By cross-breeding female African goats with the male Toggenburg buck farmers can achieve a cross-bred animal which combines the high milk production of the European goat with the hardiness of the African goat. To be successful however, cross-breeding must be very carefully organised. To find out more about the systems that the Kenyan farmers are using, Eric Kadenge spoke to Camillus Ahuya, Farm-Africa?s breeding adviser in East Africa. He first asked Camillus to explain the background to animal breeding. IN:		?Breeding is simply the way the farmers ? OUT:		? help the small scale poor farmers. ? DUR?N		 6 ? 18 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Camillus Ahuya of the NGO Farm-Africa, emphasising the importance of goat development programmes in areas where land-holdings are decreasing in size. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Ahuya	Breeding is simply the way the farmers can select which animals they want to be the parents of the future generation. This is done mainly on the farm, it is a slow process but it is worth taking. At the moment we also use one of the quickest ways of improvement and that is cross breeding. Cross breeding simply means mating animals of the same species but different breeds so that the resultant offspring is an improved one, can perform better than the local one. Kadenge	So one of the reasons for breeding then is to improve the quality of the animal. What are the other reasons that make breeding important? Ahuya	Apart from improving the quality of the animals you also improve the productivity and this is what is most important because you want the farmer to keep few but high quality animals, that they can be able to get more products out of it. The products in terms of milk, the products in terms of the growth rates - these animals grow very fast and therefore they can reach the market age at an early age and therefore the farmers can easily get more money quickly. Kadenge	Now <b>let?s</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the breeding itself, what does it take - what do you need to do during cross breeding? Ahuya	First of all I should emphasize that the kind of breeding that we are promoting here is what we call community based breeding program. That means that farmers themselves organize, supervise and carry out their breeding activities and the set up is such that we have a buck station where the farmers maintain one pure bred male goat for the local people to bring in the indigenous animals for mating. What comes out there are the cross breds and these are the improved animals. And another component that is very important is for the farmers to maintain another breeding unit which is mainly to produce the pure improver breeds that they will be using in expanding the programme. With that kind of arrangement where you have the buck station for cross breeding and the breeding unit for the production of the pure breds makes sure that the breeding programme is sustainable and can go on for a long time without any problems of in-breeding. Kadenge	So what are the details, what do the farmers do as they go about breeding goats? Ahuya	First of all to maintain this buck in a proper condition. That means that it has to be fed very well, it must be housed very well, it must be taken care of in terms of health ? veterinary services must be provided so that the animal remains healthy. Also they must keep records, particularly what happens, how many animals are bred, how many animals are brought each day, how long it can stay there, because they buck is allowed only to stay there for a maximum of 18 months. This is because within that 18 months, its offspring particularly the female ones will be mature enough to be mated and you don?t want the offspring to be mated back to their father. So the farmers organize to rotate or to move this buck to the next buck station to avoid in-breeding. They have also organized themselves so that they work through farmer groups. So each group will nominate one of them who takes care of this male goat. They will also nominate another person who takes care of the breeding unit whose main purpose is to produce the pure breds that are used in expanding the programme. Kadenge	And the little kids, just take us through a little bit of what happens from the time that they are born. Ahuya	When the kids are born the first step is to weigh them. You will also ensure that when they are born they get colostrum ? colostrum is the first milk that the animal produces after delivery and this is important because it is the milk that helps the young kid to establish immunity in the new world that it has just joined. After that you make sure that this animal is identified; normally identification is very important particularly in a breeding program because if you do not identify the animal you might not be able to know what kind of animal you are dealing with, particularly when you are trying to evaluate them. After identification, you will always make sure that this animal gets enough milk. Once that one is done, we monitor the progress of this kid and normally weaning ? that is when you separate it completely from the mother and actually stop it from getting the milk ? this happens at 120 days. I think at 120 days you also need to weigh that animal so that you know the weaning weight. The weaning weight and the birth weight, these are weights that can help you now to even estimate or find out at what rate this animal was growing. This is important because you could use that information to select which of the sires have got kids that grow very fast. Kadenge	And is there anything else that you would like to add regarding breeding of goats? Ahuya	The dairy goat is the only alternative source of milk for the small scale farmers. This is because our land sizes as you know decreasing with every generation inheriting land following subdivision. What that means is that most of the small scale farmers in the near future will not be able to keep large ruminants so I would really urge particularly the livestock production experts and the government to ensure that there is a well defined, a well supported goat development programme in the country that can help the small scale poor farmers.
