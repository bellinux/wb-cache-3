5|$|Phase one of {{training}} for the third group of astronauts began in 1964 in lecture halls. Lectures in several fields were supplemented with trips to locations with geological significance so the astronauts gained hands-on experience. In addition to piloting the spacecraft, the astronauts would also perform scientific experiments and measurements on the Moon.

30|$|Hodson (2008) and McComas (2004) {{distinguish}} learning {{science and}} <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> science. <b>Learning</b> science means that students and people learn scientific theories, principles and laws while <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> science means <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> what science is, {{how it affects}} society, human life, how it has been developed.

40|$|An {{important}} empirical {{and theoretical}} {{issue in the}} study of learning is the manner in which one’s <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> one cue affects <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> another cue. In most cases, one’s <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> one cue competes with <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> other cues (i. e., overshadowing or blocking), and these cue competition effects have inspired and guided some of the most influential ideas about the mechanisms of learning (see, e. g., Rescorla & Wagner, 1972). In other cases, the presence of one cue can facilitate <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> a second cue. For example, taste cues have been found to facilitate <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> odor cues in food aversion learning (e. g., Rusiniak, Palmerino, Rice, Forthman, & Garcia, 1982). Most studies of interactions among cues (i. e., cue com-petition or cue facilitation) have been done with the use of stimuli available in conditioning chambers. Recently, how...|$|R

5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero when he called the office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. When she could, Kapp also followed the two men to try to see what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that she worked at the embassy, including all that she felt that she could <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> Cicero.|$|E

5|$|In {{the public}} school system of Baltimore city, music {{education}} is a part of each grade level to high school, at which point it becomes optional.

They also begin to <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> different musical instruments and distinguish between different kinds of sounds and types of songs. As students progress through the grades, teachers go into more detail and require more proficiency in elementary musical techniques. Students perform rounds in second grade, for example, while movement (i.e. dance) enters the curriculum in third grade. Beginning in middle school in the sixth grade, students are taught to make mature aesthetic judgements, and to understand and respond to a variety of forms of music. In high school, students may choose to take courses in instrumentation or singing, and may be exposed to music {{in other areas of the}} curriculum, such as in theater or drama classes.|$|E
