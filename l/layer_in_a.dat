5|$|Trees {{are either}} evergreen, having foliage that {{persists}} and remains green throughout the year, or deciduous, shedding their leaves {{at the end}} of the growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage. Most conifers are evergreens but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis. The crown is a name for the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves, while the uppermost <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the canopy. A sapling is a young tree.|$|E

25|$|Babbitt, {{also called}} Babbitt metal or bearing metal, is any of several alloys {{characterized}} by its resistance to galling. Babbitt is {{most commonly used}} as a thin surface <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> complex, multi-metal structure, but its original use was as a cast-in-place bulk bearing material. Babbitt metal was invented in 1839 for use in steam engines by American goldsmith Isaac Babbitt in Taunton, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of superposition states that a sedimentary rock <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tectonically undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it.

This principle allows sedimentary layers {{to be viewed as}} a form of vertical time line, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed.|$|E

25|$|AAV {{is capable}} of transducing {{multiple}} cell types within the retina. AAV serotype 2, the most well-studied type of AAV, is commonly administered {{in one of two}} routes: intravitreal or subretinal. Using the intravitreal route, AAV is injected in the vitreous humor of the eye. Using the subretinal route, AAV is injected underneath the retina, taking advantage of the potential space between the photoreceptors and RPE <b>layer,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> short surgical procedure. Although this is more invasive than the intravitreal route, the fluid is absorbed by the RPE and the retina flattens in less than 14 hours without complications. Intravitreal AAV targets retinal ganglion cells and a few Muller glial cells. Subretinal AAV efficiently targets photoreceptors and RPE cells.|$|E
25|$|Since modern {{thyristors}} {{can switch}} {{power on the}} scale of megawatts, thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) conversion either to or from alternating current. In the realm of this and other very high-power applications, both electrically triggered (ETT) and light-triggered (LTT) thyristors are still the primary choice. The valves are arranged in stacks usually suspended from the ceiling of a transmission building called a valve hall. Thyristors are arranged into a diode bridge circuit and to reduce harmonics are connected in series to form a 12-pulse converter. Each thyristor is cooled with deionized water, and the entire arrangement becomes one of multiple identical modules forming a <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> multilayer valve stack called a quadruple valve. Three such stacks are typically mounted on the floor or hung from the ceiling of the valve hall of a long-distance transmission facility.|$|E
500|$|Cores show visible layers, which {{correspond}} to annual snowfall {{at the core}} site. [...] If a pair of pits is dug in fresh snow with a thin wall between them {{and one of the}} pits is roofed over, an observer in the roofed pit will see the layers revealed by sunlight shining through. [...] A six-foot pit may show anything from less than a year of snow to several years of snow, depending on the location. [...] Poles left in the snow from year to year show the amount of accumulated snow each year, and this can be used to verify that the visible <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> snow pit corresponds to a single year's snowfall.|$|E

2500|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} contains rebar {{and other}} metallic reinforcements, which are removed with magnets and recycled elsewhere. The remaining aggregate chunks are sorted by size. Larger chunks may {{go through the}} crusher again. Smaller pieces of concrete are used as gravel for new construction projects. Aggregate base gravel is laid down as the lowest <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> road, with fresh concrete or asphalt placed over it. Crushed recycled concrete can sometimes {{be used as the}} dry aggregate for brand new concrete if it is free of contaminants, though the use of recycled concrete limits strength and is not allowed in many jurisdictions. On 3 March 1983, a government-funded research team (the VIRL research.codep) estimated that almost 17% of worldwide landfill was by-products of concrete based waste.|$|E
2500|$|During the Second Empire, Paris {{had five}} main cemeteries: Père Lachaise, Montparnasse, Montmartre, Saint-Ouen, and Ivry-sur-Seine. In addition, {{there were several}} smaller {{communal}} cemeteries. [...] Funeral parlors offered seven different styles of burial, ranging in price from 18 francs to more than 7,000 francs for an elaborate individual monument. [...] Two thirds of Parisians, however, were buried in collective graves {{in a corner of}} the cemeteries, with the cost paid by the city. [...] Before Napoleon III, the corpses of indigents were simply piled into trenches in seven layers, each covered with a thin layer of earth and lime. Napoleon III had the process made somewhat more dignified, with the corpses laid side by side in a single <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> trench. The city would pay for a priest who, if requested, would provide a short service and scatter holy water on the trench. Indigents who died in hospitals and those whose bodies had been dissected in medical schools continued to be buried in the more crowded trenches. [...] For all indigent burials, the bodies remained in the trenches only long enough for them to decompose, no longer than five years. After that time, all remains were dug up and transferred to an ossuary, so that the space could be used for new burials.|$|E
