Instead, the cause was found to be a series of changes to speed, power and flap angle settings which were not in accordance with the airline's operating procedures and which took place in the last [...] of the approach. At 0128, the aircraft picked up the ILS <b>localiser</b> <b>beam,</b> and the flaps were lowered in three stages as the aircraft's speed reduced. Soon afterwards, as it approached the ILS glideslope beam, its height and speed were reduced further and the undercarriage was extended. Then the Captain saw a light which he mistook for one {{at the far end of}} the runway—it was actually on a hill beyond the airport—and the [...] "stabiliser out of trim" [...] warning light came on. This had been faulty earlier in the flight, and the Captain disengaged the autopilot and the automatic glideslope tracker. At 0133, the flap angle was increased; the aircraft then began to fall below the approach slope and was travelling faster than the crew thought. Only when it reached a height of [...] was an attempt made to gain height, but this happened too late.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} plasma wakefield {{accelerator}} experiments at SLAC, {{the energy of}} the particles in the tail of the 42 GeV electron beam were doubled in less than one meter [1]. Simulations suggest that the acceleration length was limited by a new phenomenon – <b>beam</b> <b>head</b> erosion in self-ionized plasmas. In vacuum, a particle beam expands transversely in a distance given by � *. In the blowout regime of a plasma wakefield [2], the majority of the beam is focused by the ion channel, while the <b>beam</b> <b>head</b> slowly spreads since it takes a finite time for the ion channel to form. It is observed that in self-ionized plasmas, the head spreading is exacerbated compared to that in pre-ionized plasmas, causing the ionization front to move backward (erode). A simple theoretical model is used to estimate the upper limit of the erosion rate for a bi-gaussian beam by assuming free expansion of the <b>beam</b> <b>head</b> before the ionization front. Comparison with simulations suggests that half this maximum value can serve as an estimate for the erosion rate. Critical parameters to the erosion rate are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStrategies for {{mitigating}} ionization-induced <b>beam</b> <b>head</b> erosion in an electron-beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) are explored {{when the}} plasma and the wake are both {{formed by the}} transverse electric field of the <b>beam</b> itself. <b>Beam</b> <b>head</b> erosion can occur in a preformed plasma {{because of a lack}} of focusing force from the wake at the rising edge (<b>head)</b> of the <b>beam</b> due to the finite inertia of the electrons. When the plasma is produced by field ionization from the space charge field of the <b>beam,</b> the <b>head</b> erosion is significantly exacerbated due to the gradual recession (in the beam frame) of the 100 % ionization contour. Beam particles in front of the ionization front cannot be focused (guided) causing them to expand as in vacuum. When they expand, the location of the ionization front recedes such that even more beam particles are completely unguided. Eventually this process terminates the wake formation prematurely, i. e., well before the beam is depleted of its energy. Ionization-induced head erosion can be mitigated by controlling the beam parameters (emittance, charge, and energy) and/or the plasma conditions. In this paper we explore how the latter can be optimized so as to extend the beam propagation distance and thereby increase the energy gain. In particular we show that, by using a combination of the alkali atoms of the lowest practical ionization potential (Cs) for plasma formation and a precursor laser pulse to generate a narrow plasma filament in front of the <b>beam,</b> the <b>head</b> erosion rate can be dramatically reduced. Simulation results show that in the upcoming ''two-bunch PWFA experiments'' on the FACET facility at SLAC national accelerator laboratory the energy gain of the trailing beam can be up to 10 times larger for the given parameters when employing these techniques. Comparison of the effect of <b>beam</b> <b>head</b> erosion in preformed and ionization produced plasmas is also presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} instability has potentially disastrous {{effects on the}} ion beams used for heavy ion driven inertial confinement fusion. This instability is a {open_quotes}resistive wall{close_quotes} instability with the impedance coining from the induction modules in the accelerator used as a driver. This instability can greatly amplify perturbations launched from the <b>beam</b> <b>head</b> and can prevent focusing of the beam onto the small spot necessary for fusion. This instability has been studied using the WARPrz particle-in-cell code. WARPrz is a 2 1 / 2 dimensional electrostatic axisymmetric code. This code includes {{a model for the}} impedance of the induction modules. Simulations with resistances similar to that expected in a driver show moderate amounts of growth from the instability as a perturbation travels from <b>beam</b> <b>head</b> to tail as predicted by cold beam fluid theory.

This reduction in the growth rate is seen in both cold beam fluid theory and in simulations with WARPrz. Instability growth rates for warm beams measured from WARPrz are lower than cold beam fluid theory predicts. Longitudinal thermal spread cannot account for this decrease in the growth rate. A mechanism for coupling the transverse thermal spread to decay of the longitudinal waves is presented. The longitudinal instability is no longer a threat to the heavy ion fusion program. The simulations in this thesis have shown that the growth rate for this instability will not be as large as earlier calculations predicted...|$|R

A model is presented for the analysis of guided wave propagation and instability along a cylindrical waveguide that is partially filled with a cold drifting electron beam. The beam is assumed to be fully neutralized by a positive ion background of infinite mass that is drifting at the same velocity as the electron beam [...] thereby removing streaming instabil-ities from consideration. 4 Under these conditions, the electron-ion beam is found to be stable for both zero and infinite applied longitudinal magnetic fields, except for w = 0 waves satisfying certain axial boundary conditions first derived by Pierce in 1944. 2 It is demonstrated for pulsed beams, whose downstream boundary is just the <b>beam</b> <b>head,</b> that the excited waves never catch the <b>beam</b> <b>head</b> and hence cannot induce the Pierce instability.
