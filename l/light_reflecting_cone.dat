40|$|We present {{evidence}} for the wavelength dependence of the directionality of <b>light</b> <b>reflected</b> from <b>cone</b> receptor cells (optical StilesCrawford effect) : Blue light is more directional than red. According to the waveguide-scattering model of Marcos J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 15, 2012 (1998), directionality {{is the sum of}} a waveguide component and a scattering component. The latter is proportional to 1 over wavelength squared, and it is related to the row-to-row spacing of the cone lattice. Our results allow a firm confirmation of Marcos s theory. For a 1. 9 -deg foveal area, group mean (n= 18) cone spacing was 3. 42 m, in good agreement with anatomical data. Group mean waveguide directionality was 0. 077 mm...|$|R
40|$|Usually {{wave and}} {{geometric}} (ray) models and equivalent light guide schemes {{are used for}} the descriptions of processes in lasers [1]. The geometric model based on binomial distribution is proposed in [2] for the description of light propagation in a multilobe mirror laser. Multilobe mirrors were proposed in [3] and consist on many semi-conducting planes slightly inclined to the laser axis and rotated symmetrically around the axis. <b>Light</b> <b>reflects</b> conically (hole <b>cones)</b> from this mirror. We consider the mirror is thin. In the plane (two-dimensional) case one ray bifurcates after the reflection from our mirror. In [4, 5] we investigated the branching system of rays consisted on units of breaking trajectories, we considered the Fibonacci type rows to describe this system. In the present work we describe our light guide system more precisely. We show the correspondence of ray groups and binomial coefficients. We show the correspondence of ray distribution and integers arranged in a three-dimensional table – non-linear pyramid [6]. We examine two types of non-linear arithmetic triangles. We describe different types of integer’s partitions. We hope this investigation help to examine the processes in lasers more precisely...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{instrument}} that uses a novel technique to render topographical maps of microscopic reflecting surfaces in which depth resolution can be an order or magnitude or more better than the lateral resolution of the confocal microscope. In a confocal scanning reflected-light microscope, the illumination light {{coming out of the}} objective is a cone of light with its axis parallel to the optical axis and focused into a diffraction-limited spot. If the specimen is smooth within the size of the spot, then the laws of reflection apply. When the reflecting surface is perpendicular to the optical axis, the <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> is a <b>cone</b> that coincides with the illumination <b>light.</b> If the <b>reflecting</b> surface is not perpendicular to the optical axis, the axis of the <b>reflected</b> <b>cone</b> of <b>light</b> is at an angle with respect to the optical axis equal to twice the tilt angle of the surface and oriented {{in the direction of the}} surface tilt.

40|$|Explicit {{forms of}} the Green's {{functions}} (which are {{to be regarded as}} distributions in the sense of Schwartz) for the multi‐mass Klein‐Gordon operator in n‐dimensional spaces are presented. The homogeneous Green's functions GN(x) and GN 1 (x), defined in the usual way by independent paths of integration in the k 0 plane, are investigated in the neighborhood of the light cone. The parameter N indicates the total number of masses involved. The singularities on the <b>light</b> <b>cone</b> <b>reflect</b> the well‐known difference between even‐ and odd‐dimensional wave propagation. It is found that GN(x; odd n) contains a finite jump on the light cone as well as a linear combination of derivatives up to order ☒(n − 2 N − 1) of δ(x 2); the singular part of GN 1 (x; odd n) consists of a logarithmic singularity ln (∣x 2 ∣) along with a polynomial in (x 2) − 1 of degree ☒(n − 2 N − 1). For even‐dimensional spaces, the singular part of both Green's functions consists of a polynomial in (x 2) − 1 ∕ 2 of degree n − 2 N + 1 vanishing outside the light cone for GN and vanishing inside the light cone for GN 1. In all cases no singularities or finite jumps occur when the order 2 N of the operator is greater than the number n + 1 of space‐time dimensions.

40|$|Animals {{frequently}} {{make use}} of highly reflecting surfaces, as for example in the tapeta of {{the eyes of many}} vertebrates, the iridophores and photophores of many marine animals, and the scales of fish. Such surfaces raise the question: how are high reflectivities, often comparable with that of polished metal, achieved using biological materials? Highly reflecting surfaces in which metals are not employed have recently been developed industrially. The principle employed is that of the quarter-wavelength film (Text-fig. 1), in which <b>light</b> <b>reflected</b> from the front surface of a transparent thin film is in phase with, and so interferes constructively with, <b>light</b> <b>reflected</b> from the back surface. <b>Light</b> <b>reflected</b> at a low to high refractive index interface (in this case the upper surface of the film) undergoes a phase change of £ wavelength. So, for construc-tive interference, <b>light</b> <b>reflected</b> from the lower interface must be retarded by wave-length. The optical thickness of the fihn (refractive index, n, x actual thickness, t) must therefore be J wavelength for maximum constructive interference to occur when <b>light</b> is <b>reflected</b> normally...|$|R
