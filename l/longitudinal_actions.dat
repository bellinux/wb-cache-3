40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues in Automated Highway System (AHS) deployment is intelligent vehicle control. While the technology to safely maneuver vehicles exists, the problem of making intelligent decisions to improve a single vehicle’s travel time and safety while optimizing the overall traffic flow is still a stumbling block. We propose an artificial intelligence technique called stochastic learning automata to design an intelligent vehicle path controller. Using the information obtained by on-board sensors and local communication modules, two automata are capable of learning the best possible (lateral and <b>longitudinal)</b> <b>actions</b> to avoid collisions. This learning method is capable of adapting to the automata environment resulting from an unmodeled physical environment. Although the learning approach taken is capable of providing a safe decision, optimization of the overall traffic flow is required. This is achieved by studying the interaction of the vehicles. The design of the adaptive vehicle path planner based on local information is extended to the interaction of multiple intelligent vehicles. By analyzing the situations consisting of conflicting desired vehicle paths, we extend our design by additional decision structures. The analysis of the situations and th...|$|E

40|$|An {{intelligent}} controller is described for an automated vehicle planning its trajectory based on sensor and communication data received. The {{intelligent controller}} is designed using a stochastic learning automaton. Using the data received from on-board sensors, two automata (for lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>actions)</b> {{are capable of}} learning the best possible actions to avoid collisions. The system {{has the advantage of}} being able to work in unmodeled stochastic environments. Computer simulation is a way to test the effectiveness of the learning automata method because the system becomes highly complex {{because of the presence of}} a large number of vehicles. Simulations for simultaneous lateral and longitudinal control of a vehicle using this method provide encouraging results. Multiple vehicle simulations are also given, and the resulting complexity is discussed. The analysis of the situations is made possible by the study of the interacting reward-penalty mechanisms in individual vehicles. Simple scenarios consisting of multiple vehicles are defined as collections of discrete states, and each state is treated as a game of automata. The definition of the physical environment as a series of discrete state transitions associated with a "stationary automata environment" is the key to this analysis and to the design of the intelligent controller. The aim is to obtain the necessary and sufficient rules for state transitions to reach the goal state...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSteel-concrete {{composite}} beams {{combine the}} {{high tensile strength}} of steel with the high compressive strength of concrete to create a stronger stiffer composite member. For the beam to act compositely, internal <b>longitudinal</b> <b>actions</b> must be transferred from the steel to the concrete through shear stud connectors. Once the stud-concrete interface starts to fracture or crush, the load carrying capacity of the beam is compromised. Shear connector capacity has been determined experimentally; however these tests do not generate a detailed understanding of the force transfer mechanisms between stud and concrete. This paper aims to characterise the behaviour of the composite beam when it fails by fracture of the concrete {{along the line of}} the studs, known as splitting failure. Experiments have been conducted on 5 steel-concrete composite beams, with shear stud connections, to investigate in detail the splitting behaviour at the stud-concrete interface. All beams were internal primary beams designed to fail by splitting. Testing was carried out on a specially developed push off rig (A. Gillies et al., 2006), with four specimens being loaded monotonically until failure and the fifth one loaded cyclically and then failed monotonically according to EuroCode 4 (1994) recommendations. Crack initiation and propagation in both the vertical and longitudinal direction were measured, as well as local and global strains. Results show very small changes in rib width as load is increased, giving indication of when micro and macro cracking occurred. It was shown in the cyclic test that concrete splitting and crack growth propagations occurs at very low applied loads. From these measurements it can be concluded that the zone of transverse deformation around the stud is very localized. The stress field in the concrete {{around the base of the}} stud is non-uniform, with a high build-up of compression on one side of the stud and a small amount of tension on the other side...|$|E
40|$|This article {{introduces}} the static scheme, the construction method and the seismic-resistant designing of the Fluvià Viaduct, {{which has a}} total length of 835 m (45 + 10 x 60 + 2 x 70 + 50 m) and an average height of 18 m. So, it is the longest viaduct in the Barcelona-Madrid-French Border section between Barcelona and France. The spans of this structure are medium-long for prestressed concrete solutions in Spain. The general concept of the structure is a 14 span continuous post-tensioning prestressed concrete main girder, simply supported in piers and abutments, with a useful width of 14 m. The main girder cross-section is a 4. 0 m depth one-cell box with quasi-vertical webs, which results in an close-to-optimum length to depth ratio of L/ 15 for the typical spans. In piers P- 11; P- 12 and P- 13 depth grows linearly up to 5. 5 m in order to adapt properly to the bending moments appearing in longer spans. The main girder is prestressed {{to one of the}} abutments, which acts as fixed point of the structure for supporting horizontal <b>longitudinal</b> <b>actions</b> like traction-braking forces and earthquake loads. With a fixed end in one abutment, the viaduct has a total expanding length of 835 m, which is far from the maximum expansion length reached in others structures in Spain, but nearly close to the recommended maximum length that can be solved with conventional track devices. Earthquake loads are the limiting factor in the design of most of the elements of the substructure (foundations, piers and abutments, and diaphragms). The construction method for the piers and the abutments is the most common for this sort of structural parts, and the greatest engineering effort is done to design the girder for a span-by-span construction with a self-bearing falsework designed initially for road bridges of 50 m of maximum spans. The use of this available self-bearing falsework {{for the construction of a}} railway viaduct (with a cross-section heavier than a highway cross-section for the same span length) deals directly with most of the limitations that influenced the design and construction of the girder. It was necessary to limit the load on the falsework girders to an allowable limit, that prevented from casting the whole cross-section at once.
