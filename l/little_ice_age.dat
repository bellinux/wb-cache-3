5|$|Retreat of the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age</b> glaciers {{was slow}} until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid. Between {{the height of}} the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age</b> and 1950, Mount Rainier's glaciers lost about one-quarter of their length. Beginning in 1950 and {{continuing}} through the early 1980s, however, many of the major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of the mid-century. The Carbon, Cowlitz, Emmons, and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s. Since the early-1980s, however, many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{believe that}} Glacier Bay existed during {{a minimum of}} four Glacial periods ending with the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> which has a 4,000-year-old record, as the latest period. All glaciers in the park today {{are said to be}} {{remnants}} of this glacial period.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park is {{dominated}} by mountains which were carved into their present shapes by the huge glaciers of the last ice age. These glaciers have largely disappeared over the last 12,000 years. Evidence of widespread glacial action is found throughout the park {{in the form of}} U-shaped valleys, cirques, arêtes, and large outflow lakes radiating like fingers {{from the base of the}} highest peaks. Since the end of the ice ages, various warming and cooling trends have occurred. The last recent cooling trend was during the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> which took place approximately between 1550 and 1850. During the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> the glaciers in the park expanded and advanced, although to nowhere near as great an extent as they had during the Ice Age.|$|E
25|$|Following the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age's</b> end around 1850, glaciers {{around the}} Earth have retreated substantially. A slight cooling {{led to the}} advance of many alpine glaciers between 1950 and 1985, but since 1985 glacier retreat and mass loss has become larger and {{increasingly}} ubiquitous.|$|R

The exact causes of {{the disappearance of the}} Norse settlements {{toward the end of the}} 15th century remain unverified, but probably resulted from a combination of the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age's</b> cooling temperatures, soil erosion, abandonment by Norway, more convenient ways for Europeans to procure furs and a mercantile eclipsing by the Hanseatic League, and competition from the Inuit moving southward.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent precise {{observations}} of solar global parameters {{are used to}} calibrate an upgraded solar model which takes into account magnetic fields in the solar interior. Historical data about sunspot numbers (from 1500 to the present) and solar radius changes (between 1715 and 1979) are used to compute solar variability on years to centuries timescales. The results show that although the 11 year variability of the total irradiance is {{of the order of}} 0. 1 %, additional, longer lived changes of the order of 0. 1 % may have occurred in the past centuries. These could, for example, account for the occurrence of climate excursions such as <b>little</b> <b>ice</b> <b>ages...</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age</b> caused crop {{failures}} and famines in Europe. The 1690s saw the worst famine in France since the Middle Ages. Finland suffered a severe famine in 1696–1697, during which {{about one-third of}} the Finnish population died.|$|E
5|$|About {{four stages}} of {{glaciation}} {{have been recognized}} in the area during the Pleistocene, although the glacial history is poorly known. Monte Burney was glaciated during the last glacial maximum. During the early Holocene, glaciers retreated quickly then slowed down during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. A slight expansion is noted during the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age.</b>|$|E
5|$|For example, in the 17th century, {{the solar}} cycle {{appeared}} to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum. This coincided {{in time with the}} era of the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures. Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Wetter and cooler {{conditions}} {{developed during}} the Pleistocene epoch and briefly returned via at least two neoglacial episodes (<b>little</b> <b>ice</b> <b>ages)</b> in the current epoch, the Holocene. The various rivers and streams in the area were engorged by increased precipitation and with melt-water from mountain glaciers on the Henry Mountains {{to the east and}} the Aquarius Plateau {{to the west of the}} park. Flash floods, mass wasting of hillsides, frost wedging, and landslides all contributed to a significantly faster rate of erosion. Glaciers plucked 20- to 30-million-year-old black basaltic boulders from atop Boulder and Thousand Lake Mountains that were subsequently deposited over the park area by meltwater streams from the glaciers, rockslides and floods.|$|R

5|$|Glaciers {{were present}} on the volcano until the {{conclusion}} of the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> {{at the beginning of the}} 20thcentury. Pleistocene glaciers have largely eroded Thielsen's calderaleading to exposure of its contents. The small Lathrop Glacier in the northern cirque of the volcano is the only extant glacier on Mount Thielsen. While the glaciation was extensive, volcanic ash from eruptive activity at Mount Mazama has almost certainly masked contents.|$|E
5|$|The Sawtooth Mountains {{were last}} {{extensively}} glaciated in the Pleistocene, but glaciers probably existed during the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> which ended around 1850AD. Evidence of past glaciation is {{abundant in the}} Sawtooth, White Cloud, Boulder, and Smoky mountains, {{as well as the}} north and east-facing slopes of the Albion, Raft River, and Soldier mountains. Remnants of the glaciers include glacial lakes, moraines, horns, hanging valleys, cirques, and arêtes.|$|E

30|$|The turn of {{the nineteenth}} century was {{characterized}} by a period of <b>little</b> <b>ice</b> <b>ages</b> when the climate was cooling down. For the Qing dynasty in China, the {{turn of the}} nineteenth century was also a time of transition from a period of flourishing society to a period of decline society (Fang et al. 2013). This paper analyzes the disaster relief process and the social response for two floods in China, the Yongding River flood in 1801 and the Yellow River flood in 1841 using methods of historical documents analysis and qualitative comparative analysis. These two floods reflect different response processes between the national and provincial capitals during this stage of climate cooling and social transition in the Qing dynasty. This paper explores the functions of governmental decision-making and measures in response to these flood events. Comparative studies of historical climate events and human response processes are helpful to better understand human adaptation mechanisms and to provide a reference for the modern decision making and for reducing social vulnerability.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between global factors ("global" glacio-eustatic sea-level rise) and regional factors (tectonic trend, oceanographic factor) is analyzed {{in different areas}} of the Iberian and Canary Island littoral. Sea-level changes and c 1 imatic variations are stated for the Mediterranean and Atlantic littorals, with different tidal ranges and tectonic trends. Different stages can be envisaged in the coastal evolution of almost all the analyzed areas from the beginning of Holocene (10. 000 BP) : at ca. 7. 000 BP (Flandrian maximum) with a change from open estuaries to aggradational processes (Cádiz Gulf subsiding area), basal peat (Valencia Gulf, subsiding area) and development of microcliffs (Mediterranean uplifting areas). From 7, 000 to 2, 700 BP a first progradation phase with development of spit bars took place in the mediterranean uplifting areas, whilst in the atlantic subsiding one starts the aggradation processes in the formerly open estuaries, an also from ca. 4,OOO BP development of spit-bar system. A second progradation phase ofthe spit bars systems occurs between 2, 400 and 500 BP both in Almería and Cádiz Gulf where a change from aggradation to progradation takes place in the estuary environments, and with a change in the direction of longshore drift (Mediterranean) and prevailing winds (both areas) at ca. 2, 400 BP. At ca. 1, 200 BP a sudden paleogeographic change took place in estuary environments. From 500 BP up to nowa marked in crease of coastal progradation in all littorals is observed. Climatic interpretations led to correlate anticyclonic conditions (as it happened during <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Ages)</b> with the growing of spit bar systems and progradation, while low pressure conditions (as during Medieval Warm Period) coincides with no progradation. In the Canary Islands, the development of storm ridges at ca. 3, 500 BP can be correlated with an intensification of trade winds...|$|R

5|$|The {{first years}} of the 14th century were marked by famines, {{culminating}} in the Great Famine of 1315–17. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn.|$|E
5|$|The rocky cliffs, common {{features}} downstream of the Minho's estuary, disappear in Póvoa de Varzim, {{giving way to}} a coastal plain. The plain {{is located in a}} cuspate foreland, an old marine plateau from the Plio-Pleistocene, conferring a sandy soil to the coastal lands. The sand dunes in the Northwestern coast formed during the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age</b> and started piling up in the 15th or 16th century. Wandering along the coast one discerns Cape Santo André, the tip of the cuspate foreland and the Avarus Promontory, referred to by Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} of Scotland {{in the early}} modern era covers {{all aspects of the}} land in Scotland, including physical and human, between the sixteenth century and the beginnings of the Agricultural Revolution and industrialisation in the eighteenth century. The defining factor in the {{geography of}} Scotland is the distinction between the Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands were subdivided by the Great Glen and the Lowlands into the fertile Central Lowlands and the Southern Uplands. The Uplands and Highlands had a relatively short growing season, exacerbated by the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> which peaked {{towards the end of the}} seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} after the redistribution of population {{as a result of}} the clearances and the industrial revolution that began in the eighteenth century, the population was evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Most of the early modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. One result of the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age</b> was the abandonment of marginal land in the early part of the period, as it became impossible to sustain agriculture in some regions, particularly in the uplands, but new settlements were created {{as a result of the}} opening up of hunting reserves like Ettrick Forest and less desirable low-lying land was also settled, often incorporating features into their names such as bog, marsh and muir.|$|E
5|$|Famines became {{common in}} {{northern}} China {{in the early}} 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event {{now known as the}} <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age.</b> Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility. The central government, starved of resources, could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities. Making matters worse, a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan, killing an unknown but large number of people. The deadliest earthquake of all time, the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556, occurred during the Jiajing Emperor's reign, killing approximately 830,000 people.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age</b> {{may have}} reduced the {{population}} of the great auk by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by polar bears, but massive exploitation by humans for their down drastically reduced the population. By the mid-sixteenth century, the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down, which was used to make pillows. In 1553, the great auk received its first official protection, and in 1794 Great Britain banned the killing of this species for its feathers. In St. John's, those violating a 1775 law banning hunting the great auk for its feathers or eggs were publicly flogged, though hunting for use as fishing bait was still permitted. On the North American side, eider down initially was preferred, but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s, down collectors switched to the great auk {{at the same time that}} hunting for food, fishing bait, and oil decreased.|$|E

5|$|The {{chromosphere}} of Tau Ceti—the {{portion of}} a star's atmosphere just above the light-emitting photosphere—currently displays little or no magnetic activity, indicating a stable star. One nine-year study of temperature, granulation, and the chromosphere showed no systematic variations; Ca II emissions around the H and K infrared bands show a possible 11-year cycle, but this is weak relative to the Sun. Alternatively {{it has been suggested}} that the star could be in a low-activity state analogous to a Maunder minimum—a historical period, associated with the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age</b> in Europe, when sunspots became exceedingly rare on the Sun's surface. Spectral line profiles of Tau Ceti are extremely narrow, indicating low turbulence and observed rotation. The amplitude of the star's oscillations are about half those of the Sun, and have a lower mode lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek {{to optimize}} the capture of solar energy in order {{to optimize the}} productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, {{however, the}} {{expansion}} of European trade – albeit restricted to islands near Guangzhou like Macau – spread the Columbian Exchange of crops, plants, and animals into China, introducing chili peppers to Sichuan cuisine and highly productive corn and potatoes, which diminished famines and spurred population growth. The growth of Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch trade created new demand for Chinese products and produced a massive influx of Japanese and American silver. This abundance of specie remonetized the Ming economy, whose paper money had suffered repeated hyperinflation and was no longer trusted. While traditional Confucians opposed such a prominent role for commerce and the newly rich it created, the heterodoxy introduced by Wang Yangming permitted a more accommodating attitude. Zhang Juzheng's initially successful reforms proved devastating when a slowdown in agriculture produced by the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age</b> joined changes in Japanese and Spanish policy that quickly cut off the supply of silver now necessary for farmers {{to be able to}} pay their taxes. Combined with crop failure, floods, and epidemic, the dynasty collapsed before the rebel leader Li Zicheng, who was defeated by the Manchu-led Eight Banner armies who founded the Qing dynasty.|$|E
