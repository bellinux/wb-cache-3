60|$|DOOLITTLE ["most musical, most melancholy"] I'll tell you, Governor, if you'll only <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> word in. I'm {{willing to}} tell you. I'm wanting to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} {{what will be the}} best plan," [...] Reuben's host of the night before said. [...] "I will ride at once to Mr. Barker's and, if he will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> fresh horse there, I will gallop {{straight}} back to my place, and will send a man off the moment I arrive there to fetch Ruskin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it's no {{inconvenience}} {{to speak}} of. Come in. Well, yez HAVE got some snow on yez. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> broom. You boys stomp your feet well and shake your coats. You girls {{give me your}} things and I'll hang them up. Guess yez are most froze. Well, sit up to the stove and git het up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{too late}} now. I'm here, and I mean {{to stay and}} nurse you, if it's the {{smallpox}} you've got. Maybe it's not. Just now, when a person has a finger-ache, he thinks it's smallpox. Anyhow, whatever it is, {{you ought to be}} in bed and looked after. You'll catch cold. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> light and have a look at you." ...|$|R

[...] {{came from}} Dan Soppinger, who stood with {{his back against the}} door leading to the hall. [...] "I've been wanting to ask you a {{question}} for the last ten minutes. Who of you can tell me the names of the fifth, tenth, and fifteenth presidents of our country?" ...|$|R
60|$|VERNON. Then perhaps you'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> in <b>a</b> word. You think me a snob? [Fanny makes a movement.] As {{a matter}} of fact, I am.|$|R

6000|$|The smith {{looked down}} at his person and saw that he was a good deal blacker than he usually was, so he caught up his hat and ran out after the funeral. This was already close to the church, and the smith wanted to take part in {{carrying}} the coffin, like a good neighbour. So he ran with all his might, and shouted after them, 'Hey! wait <b>a</b> little; <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> hold of him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So this is Betty Zane. Dear child, kiss me," [...] said Grandmother Watkins when Wetzel {{had brought}} Betty up to her. [...] "Now, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{good look at}} you. Well, well, you are a true Zane. Black hair and eyes; all fire and pride. Child, I knew your father and mother long before you were born. Your father was a fine man but a proud one. And {{how do you like}} the frontier? Are you enjoying yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I remember. Everyone wears {{it tonight}} as a badge, {{but you have}} none. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> you <b>a</b> bit, I like to have you one of us in all things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't stand it. I won't {{be made a}} fool of!" [...] he continues. [...] "She {{seems to}} expect {{everybody}} to bow to her, and moves through the world with her imperious airs. Oh, how confoundedly handsome she is with them! I tell you what. I feel inclined to tumble down and feel one of her pretty little feet on my neck and say, There! Trample my life out. Make a slave of <b>me.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> silver collar and mark 'Ethel' on it, {{and go through the}} world with my badge." ...|$|R

"Well, as {{a matter}} of fact, laddie, I didn't get beyond the third page, because the scurvy knave at the bookstall said he wasn't running a free library, and in one way and another there was a certain amount of unpleasantness. Still, it seemed bright and {{interesting}} up to page three. But let's settle down and talk business. I've got a scheme for you, Garny old man. Yessir, the idea of a thousand years.

He would not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> doctor. This morning when I saw his bones {{sticking}} out {{of his face and}} his great bright eyes looking at me I could stand no more of it. 'With your leave or without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor this very hour,' said I. 'Let it be Watson, then,' said he. I wouldn't waste an hour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{will be hurt}} but myself, then?" [...] said Hans, {{putting out}} his lip. [...] "I {{am not going to}} say {{anything}} to her unless I felt sure of the answer. I dare not ask the oracles: I prefer a cheerful caliginosity, as Sir Thomas Browne might say. I would rather run my chance there and lose, than be sure of winning anywhere else. And I don't mean to swallow the poison of despair, though you are disposed to thrust it on me. I am giving up wine, so <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little drunk on hope and vanity." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{could not}} keep my gaze {{off the face of}} this lovely creature, who did not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good look of her dark-blue eyes, however, until I was quite near, when they were {{naturally}} turned towards the form that approached. For a few seconds, while in the very act of passing, we looked intently at each other, and the charm said to be possessed by certain animals, was not more powerful than was our mutual gaze. In this manner we had actually passed each other, and I was still in a sort of mystified prance, when I heard suddenly, in a voice and tone that caused every nerve to thrill within me, the single word-- ...|$|R
6000|$|He dropped back, {{so as to}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> on <b>a</b> {{level with}} him. [...] "Fine evening for a walk, Mr. Franklin," [...] he said, {{as if we had}} just accidentally {{encountered}} each other at that moment.

6000|$|... "But, Captain, dear, sorrow a sup of dhrink did I see {{you take}} this blessed evening; shure then you'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> you <b>a</b> glass of wine before we all begin, jist to prevent your being smothered with the dust like; shure, yer honour hasn't taken a dhrop yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose he}} meant {{anything}} pretty?" [...] said Alderling, {{with a look}} up {{over his shoulder at}} his wife; and then he said to me, [...] "We do; and there are some very curious things I could tell you, if Marion would ever <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> in <b>a</b> word." ...|$|R
6000|$|After a moment's pause he said: [...] "Though I {{came only}} yesterday, I have {{equipped}} myself properly for Bath already, you see," [...] (pointing {{to a new}} umbrella); [...] "I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to walk; though I {{think it would be}} more prudent to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> you <b>a</b> chair." ...|$|R

60|$|It was simple, but I had an {{idea that}} it would be effective. My {{strength}} lay in my acquaintance with the geography of Sanstead House and Buck's ignorance of it. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> but <b>get</b> <b>an</b> adequate start, and he might find pursuit vain. It was this start which I saw my way to achieving.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Phineas, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> do {{something}} for you," [...] said the poor woman. [...] "You {{have not had a}} bit of anything all day. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> you just <b>a</b> cup of tea and a chop." ...|$|R
6000|$|STEVE, soothingly, 'Come now, we won't go {{into that}} again. It was just a mistake; and {{now that it is}} all settled and done with, I'll tell you what we shall do.

[...] Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch {{here and}} there, then fell back, {{with her head}} on one side, observing graciously, [...] "Yes, you'll do. Your head is all I could ask, for that white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing. Hold back your shoulders, and carry your hands easily, no matter if your gloves do pinch. There's {{one thing you can}} do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl. I can't, but it's very nice to see you, and I'm so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one. It's simple, but handsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic. Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly? I like to show my boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose isn't." ...|$|R

"My father thinks I {{might have}} been a little more careful, but my mother says she thinks it is Mr. Sanderson's fault that he <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> such <b>an</b> amount of money in cash and carry it on such a lonely road. But dad is all right, and in his last letter he said he could let Mr. Sanderson have a {{thousand}} dollars if that would help matters out." ...|$|R
40|$|During the {{lifecycle}} of this project, I recieved invaluable {{guidance from}} my supervisor and administrative help from researchers of the NICTA e-Government team. I express my gratitude towards Dr. Liam O'Brien for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> work with him, guiding me along {{the right path}} and giving me endless time to discuss my doubts. Without his conceptual idea for the project and timely inputs, this project would have never been possible. I {{would also like to}} thank Dr. Liam O'Brien, Dr. Uwe Zimmer and Paul Brebner for organizing the project with the ANU. I am grateful to NICTA for allowing me 24 hour access to their office and <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> feel of professional life. A special mention to Dr. Henry Gardner and Dr. Alexei Khorev is also due as I feel I learnt a lot from the courses titled Software Construction for e-science and Introductory Programming which they taught.

40|$|Coming to {{a foreign}} country in a foreign {{continent}} without much knowledge of the language spoken {{there was a new}} and possibly difficult experience. With help from Álvaro Ramírez Ospina and his family, though, the fieldwork I conducted in Medellín went smoothly and without major pitfalls. Mr. Ospina’s help to me as a counsellor has also been significant {{all the way from the}} Autumn of 2008. Other people who need to be thanked for their cooperation and help during my fieldwork are all the participants in HiperBarrio, and in particular Nora Catalina and Catalina, for showing me a slice of Colombian culture and hospitality. The librarian in La Loma must also be given gratitude for making arrangements with the rest of the people in HiperBarrio and <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better understanding of life in La Loma. In the course of my work on the thesis following my fieldwork I have also received help from several people. Those who are most deserving of my gratitude are Anders Johansen, who came to rescue at a time of great distress and helped sail to shore a sinking ship, and Ingrid Aagot Magnus, who with a very short deadline did her very best in making this thesis understandable to other than me. Tove Lise Inderberg needs also to be thanked for taking time in her busy schedule to offer her help. Finally, I must thank my mum, dad and two sisters for their encouragement and support, and for pushing me to finish this paper in reasonable time...|$|R

There {{are as many}} {{different}} points of view as there are people.... Well, if this girl happened to have a new frock, and a new beau to show it to, she'd say, 'I'm the happiest girl in the world.' But she is nothing of the kind. Only she doesn't know that. She approaches marriage, or, for that matter, a more matured life, having had too much, having been too well taken care of, knowing too much. Her masculine satellites--father, brothers, uncles, friends, lovers--all utterly spoil her. Mind you, I mean, girls like us, of the middle class--which is to say the largest and best class of Americans. We are spoiled.... This girl marries. And life goes on smoothly, as if its aim was to exclude friction and effort. Her husband makes it too easy for her. She is an ornament, or a toy, to be kept in a luxurious cage. To soil her pretty hands would be disgraceful! Even if she can't afford a maid, the modern devices of science make the care of her four-room apartment a farce. Electric dish-washer, clothes-washer, vacuum-cleaner, and the near-by delicatessen and the caterer simply rob a young wife of her housewifely heritage. If she has a baby--which happens occasionally, Carley, in spite of your assertion--it very soon goes to the kindergarten. Then what does she find to do with hours and hours? If she is not married, what on earth can she find to do?" ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR UNCLE:--I {{hope you}} haven't bought the book yet, as Dickson Secundus has {{found out that}} there is a shop in the Strand where all the books are sold cheap.

When I'm playful I use the meridians of {{longitude}} and parallels of latitude for a seine, and drag the Atlantic Ocean for whales! I scratch my head with the lightning, and purr myself to sleep with the thunder! When I'm cold, I bile the Gulf of Mexico and bathe in it; when I'm hot I fan myself with an equinoctial storm; when I'm thirsty I reach up and suck a cloud dry like a sponge; when I range the earth hungry, famine follows in my tracks! Whoo-oop! Bow your neck and spread! I put my hand on the sun's face and make it night in the earth; I bite a piece out of the moon and hurry the seasons; I shake myself and crumble the mountains! Contemplate me through leather--don't use the naked eye! I'm the man with a petrified heart and biler-iron bowels! The massacre of isolated communities is the pastime of my idle moments, the destruction of nationalities the serious business of my life! The boundless vastness of the great American desert is my enclosed property, and I bury my dead on my own premises!' He jumped up and cracked his heels together three times before he lit (they cheered him again), and as he come down he shouted out: 'Whoo-oop! bow your neck and spread, for the pet child of calamity's a-coming!' ...|$|R
