However, most network monitoring systems only allow the examination of managed objects of fault-free agents. This work presents the specication and requirements of a clustering architecture for SNMP agents, which supports replication of managed objects. Also, we described its properties. The architecture is struc-tured in three layers. The lower layer corresponds to the managed objects at the network elements. The middle <b>layer</b> contains <b>management</b> <b>entities</b> called clusters that monitor and replicate managed objects. The upper layer allows the denition of management clusters as well as the relationship between clusters. An analysis of network resources demanded on a practical tool for replicating managed objects is presented. Resumo.

30|$|We also {{employ the}} {{invention}} in [19] enabling the marking technique to be utilized. In [19], when the capture effect occurs, {{the information is}} transferred between the layer management entities. Namely, if the medium interface senses the capture effect, it sends PHY_CAPTURE.ind message to PLME. The MAC <b>layer</b> <b>management</b> <b>entity</b> requests the information to PLME, and to notify the capture effect occurrence to the MAC sublayer. Finally, the MAC sublayer decides whether it should send the marked ACK or a normal ACK according to the notification.|$|E
30|$|The results {{given in}} [3] {{demonstrate}} that the capture effect phenomenon occurs frequently in the practical 802.11 -based WLANs. Furthermore, the throughput for each sender becomes unfair depending on the spatial difference from a sender to a receiver {{on the assumption that}} all the senders use the same sending power level [2]. Boer et al. [19] propose a scheme that a data frame can be decoded by delivering the indication which notifies the occurrence of capture effect or the arrival of a new signal in PHY to the PHY <b>layer</b> <b>management</b> <b>entity</b> (PLME). In [20], the SINR threshold values are provided according to different transmission rates for 802.11 a/b. The SINR value plays an important criterion in determining whether the capture effect occurs or not. Ganu et al. [21] have presented that AIFS+TxOP control may improve the throughput fairness under capture effect, but they do not propose any algorithms or protocols that can actually realize it. The main reason is that it requires a central coordinator to find the weak-signal receivers that are suffering from throughput unfairness. Furthermore, it also requires a control system to adjust these parameters. Meanwhile, this study proposes a feedback system that can be used as an algorithm that controls the parameters to converge to a fair state, in a distributed manner. Bejeranoa et al. [22] consider the capture effect unfairness. They view this problem in a multi-cell environment, where the interference from neighboring cells aggravates this phenomenon. They propose a frequency planning algorithm to solve this problem.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{expansion of}} large-scale Paddy field <b>management</b> <b>entity</b> and change of agricultural structure in Japan. Paddy agriculture has changed. Mid-size agricultural <b>management</b> <b>entities</b> have decreased and large-scale <b>management</b> <b>entities</b> have increased. This factor {{is due to}} downturn in rice price and agricultural structure policy. Those large-scale <b>management</b> <b>entities</b> have accumulated paddy fields {{more than half of}} agricultural commune. Sustainability and vison of such a farm <b>management</b> <b>entities</b> are vital for maintenance and development of regional agriculture. 　This paper takes up development of large-scale management. N Corporation, which manages 395 ha of farmland in Toyota, Aichi Prefecture, has been analyzed as a case study. The findings of the analysis are as follows : The speed of increasing the workforce to accompany the enlargement of the managed area depends on, which is the reason why N Corporation became organization change from cooperative to corporation. The conversion in the latter case has changed the status of workers, who used to be members of the cooperative, to employees and the management of workers from a horizontal system to a more vertical and sectional structure. 　From the above, this paper can draw the following conclusion : Large-scale <b>management</b> <b>entities</b> was changed by field scale expansion. They are face a decrease in yield and decrease in earnings of the paddy fields agriculture. As a result, they need to organization change. And agricultural structure policy is not only required to accumulate fields but also to overall management support...|$|R

We focus on the effects and uses of various resources and investigate the characteristics of agricultural networks. Given that the future of the agriculture business (agribusiness) in Japan is becoming increasingly uncertain, it is important to focus our attention to the movements of "agricultural enterprises. " This term refers to an agricultural <b>management</b> <b>entity</b> that operates agriculture rationally and properly. Based on our investigation, we conclude the following: 1) The process of farm management can be classified into nine types. For this classification, we need to pay attention to its origin and its linkage to other diverse economic <b>entities.</b> 2) Agricultural <b>management</b> <b>entities</b> have been increasing steadily over time together with agricultural business diversification and integration. Therefore, agricultural networks are also growing steadily - with nine types of management each having a unique network. 3) These nine types of management have their individual governance structure as well. Conflicts between farm management, companies, and farmer cooperatives are used effectively to restructure its governance structure...|$|R
