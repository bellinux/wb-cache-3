40|$|Mould {{growth on}} new and used {{construction}} timber The growth of mould on building materials varies in both rate and extent from {{one type of}} material to another, depending on the nutrients in the material and on the local conditions. In this respect, wood is a sensitive building material. This investigation has compared the growth of mould on new and on used timber under high humidity conditions (90 - 95 % RH, 22 °C) in a climate test chamber. The used timber was more quickly <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> <b>mould</b> than was the new timber, {{regardless of whether it}} was simply placed in the chamber or was first sterilised and then sprayed with spores before being put into the chamber. However, when the surface of the used timber samples was sawn off, it behaved {{in the same way as}} new timber. The results show that old timber cannot simply be incorporated in new structures without a second thought, but that it can work just as well as new timber if the exposed surface of the old timber is first removed...|$|R

50|$|E. macdonnellii is a {{desirable}} garden plant with attractive dark blue to purple flowers which are well displayed and nearly always present when conditions are favourable. It can be propagated from cuttings or grafted onto Myoporum rootstock. Grafted specimens tend {{to live longer}} and to grow successfully in {{a wider range of}} soils. It is a hardy species, suitable for low-maintenance gardens, is drought tolerant, moderately frost hardy and tolerant of alkaline soils even when grown on its own roots, although in more humid areas it is susceptible to <b>attack</b> <b>by</b> Botrytis <b>mould.</b> Its branches can be brittle and have a tendency to break in strong winds, but the shrub usually recovers quickly in the growing season.|$|R
40|$|The Atlantic Forest on {{the slopes}} of Serra do Mar around Cubatão (São Paulo, Brazil) has been {{affected}} by massive emissions of pollutants from the local growing industrial complex. The effects of air pollution on the amounts of leaf nitrogen, total soluble phenols and total tannins of Tibouchina pulchra Cogn., a common species in the area of Cubatão, were investigated, as well as the possible influence of the altered parameters on the leaf area damaged by herbivores. Fully expanded leaves were collected at two sites: the valley of Pilões river (VP), characterized by a vegetation virtually not affected by air pollution and taken as a reference; and valley of Mogi river (VM), close to the core region of the industrial complex, and severely affected by air pollution. No differences were observed for any parameters between samples collected in the summer and winter in both sites. On the other hand, compared to VP, individuals growing in VM presented higher amounts of nitrogen and lower amounts of total soluble phenols and total tannins, as well as higher percentages of galls per leaf and higher leaf area lost to herbivores. Regression analysis revealed that the increase in leaf area lost to herbivores {{can be explained by the}} increase of the content of nitrogen and decrease in the contents of total soluble phenols and total tannins. Although significant, the coefficients of explanation found were low for all analyses, suggesting that other biotic or abiotic factors are likely to influence <b>leaf</b> <b>attack</b> <b>by</b> herbivores...|$|R
40|$|Staphylinidae) dig wine-bottle shaped burrows in the {{intertidal}} Salicornia zone. The adult female lays {{her eggs}} around her burrow and, by remaining with them, prevents both flooding by the tide and anoxia. Flooding is prevented by an 'ever-ready' burrow which exploits a surface tension effect and by blocking the burrow once the tide comes in. The burrow has a narrow neck (about 2 mm in diameter) {{leading to a}} living chamber 5 mm in di-ameter. Tides over artificial tubes in agar showed that a critical minimum neck diameter of 2 - 3 mm prevented sudden flooding, giving time to block the neck with mud. Blocking took about four min-utes. Ensuring the burrow is reopened at each low tide is a vital role of the brooding female in anaero-bic or impermeable soils. Field models of burrows became anoxic in 4 days, {{much less than the}} 4 week long egg stage. A lab model system with anaerobic agar and calculations of oxygen uptake and diffu-sion supported this conclusion. Mortality of or-phaned larvae may be much lower, however, in burrows within large Bledius aggregations because of mitigating ood drainage and soil aeration: lar-val mortality from physical causes in these burrows did not increase over 3 weeks but without the mother, 14 % of the eggs were <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> <b>mould,</b> and two burrows were taken over by a predatory carabid, Dichierotrichus gustavi, and all larvae eat-en. The surface tension effects of small air-filled openings may be used by small air-breathing ani-mals in many intertidal habitats. Like Bledius, other intertidal animals, including large ones, may block their burrows at high tide to keep them full of air.

In open fields, flowers and fruits were <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> grey <b>mould</b> when the flowering and harvest seasons were wet, and marketable yield was reduced {{by up to}} 20 %. Production in high tunnels showed a potential of high yields of fruits of good quality when strawberry powdery mildew was controlled. Berry size varied significantly among the cultivars. ‘Frida’ had the largest fruits followed by ‘Sonata’ and ‘Florence’, while ‘Polka’, ‘Korona’ and ‘Iris’ had the smallest fruits. All cultivars yielded well, but due to fruit decay caused <b>by</b> grey <b>mould</b> the marketable yield was significantly reduced, especially in open field. Grey mould {{was the most important}} factor influencing marketable yields. Fruits from matted rows were largest, while the highest yield was obtained on woven polyethylene.

Lettuce was cultivated to middle of June up to full flowering time. It {{was found that the}} preparation fenoprop (2, 4, 5 -trichlorofenoxypropionic acid as a dimethylamine salt) in concentrations of 10, 20 and 50 mg·dm - 3 significantly decreased latex tipburn symptoms. Fenoprop increased the healthiness of the plants because treated plants were also less <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> grey <b>mould</b> Botritis sp. Fenoprop also inhibited head formation in lettuce, but the weight of these plants was never smaller than control ones. Sometimes the weight of plants treated with fenoprop was significantly higher than of the control plants. Lettuce plants without heads had bolted earlier. Only the concentration of 100 mg·dm - 3 of fenoprop retarded plant growth. The effect of K-NAA (potassium salt of α-naphthaleneacetic acid) on lettuce was weaker than the effect of fenoprop. After K-NAA treatment at a concentration of 25 mg·dm - 3, lettuce plants formed normal heads but latex tipburn symptoms were retarded...|$|R
40|$|To study {{functional}} {{relationships between}} the effects of solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) on {{different aspects of the}} physiology of a wild plant, we carried out exclusion experiments in the field with the summer annual Datura ferox L. Solar UV-B incident over Buenos Aires reduced daytime seedling emergence, inhibited stem elongation and leaf expansion, and tended to reduce biomass accumulation during early growth. However, UV-B had no effect on calculated net assimilation rate. Using a monoclonal antibody specific to the cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimer (CPD), we found that plants receiving full sunlight had more CPDs per unit of DNA than plants shielded from solar UV-B, but the positive correlation between UV-B and CPD burden tended to level off at high (near solar) UV-B levels. At our field site, Datura plants were consumed by leaf beetles (Coleoptera), and the proportion of plants <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> insects declined with the amount of UV-B received during growth. Field experiments showed that plant exposure to solar UV-B reduced the likelihood of <b>leaf</b> beetle <b>attack</b> <b>by</b> one-half. Our results highlight the complexities associated with scaling plant responses to solar UV-B, because they show: (a) a lack of correspondence between UV-B effects on net assimilation rate and whole-plant growth rate, (b) nonlinear UV-B dose-response curves, and (c) UV-B effects of plant attractiveness to natural herbivores...|$|R
40|$|Black leaf streak disease (BLSD) affects both {{bananas and}} plantains. Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that when plantain is grown under shade in agroforestry systems, there is less damage from BLSD. In this study, BLSD severity and agronomic fruit characteristics of plantain were compared under high and low timber stand densities (TSD), and also under different crop management systems (mulching, burning, intercropping). By 11 months after planting, in high TSDs, plants had 1. 2 more standing leaves, 1. 5 more symptom-free leaves and a lower percentage of total <b>leaf</b> area <b>attacked</b> than in low TSDs. At harvest, plants in high TSDs had, on average, 1. 4 more standing leaves than those in low TSDs. Percentage <b>leaf</b> area <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> BLSD was 43. 0 % in high TSD treatments, {{significantly lower than the}} 57. 2 % in low TSD treatments. There was a significant and positive relationship between the number of leaves at flowering and dry fruit bunch mass for plantains grown under low TSD. However, there was no correlation between the number of leaves and fruit mass for the high TSD. The beneficial effects of shade in the high TSD, such as reduced severity of BLSD, were established. However, as there was bunch mass loss associated with reduced leaf production rates under the high TSD, a reduction in BLSD only partially compensated for this yield loss. Thus overall, at the high TSD, there was no yield gain from reduced BLSD. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{agricultural}} pesticides {{are frequently}} used to avoid <b>attacks</b> <b>by</b> weeds, <b>moulds,</b> bacteria, insects and mice that can damage cultivars. They {{belong to the}} heterogeneous class of xenobiotics. The toxicity of these compounds on mammals is often unknown. Thanks to the high degree in the evolutionary context of generic stress responses, understanding how yeast cells respond to pesticides can contribute in elucidating toxicity mechanisms in more complex and less accessible eukaryotes. In this work, we aimed to investigate how three herbicides belonging to different classes, never tested before on eukaryotes, can affect the biological activity of enological Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, with particular attention to cell growth, viability and ethanol production. We also evaluated the global metabolic profile of yeast cells by testing several different carbon sources and how metabolic patterns could be affected by xenobiotics. Differing from all the previously reported works, we used commercial grade herbicides, authorized {{for use in the}} central regions of Italy, in order to reproduce as far as possible the same conditions applied in the fields. At the same time, we chose, instead of a commercial strain, a wild-type S. cerevisiae strain adopted for enological applications, existing on vineyards of the same geographical areas where herbicides are used, in order to get important information also on the safety of locally produced wines...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} {{several aspects of}} the interaction between the seagrass Posidonia oceanica and the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus were investigated. The 1 st experiment was a descriptive study that had the aim to investigate whether protection has the same effect on the population structure of P. lividus occurring on rocky reef habitat and in P. oceanica. The 2 nd is also a descriptive study that had the aim to estimate herbivory pressure of P. lividus on P. oceanica through indirect measures. Specifically, it was asked what portion of the seagrass <b>leaf</b> is <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> the sea urchins, whether the abundance of grazing marks depend on the number of sea urchins and whether herbivory of P. lividus depends on shoot density of the seagrass. The 3 rd experiment was done to estimate the daily migrations of P. lividus from a rocky habitat to P. oceanica patches and particularly if they depend on the size of sea urchins and the distance from the patch edge. It was postulated that P. lividus moves randomly to the seagrass patch and that the probability of reaching it could decrease with the distance. The 4 th experiment had the purpose to investigate the role of P. oceanica structure on P. lividus distribution manipulating the seagrass structure and modifying the shoot density and leaf high. Also, in this experiment artificial (plastic) seagrass units mimicking natural seagrass have been used so that different combinations of shelter and food were provided...|$|R
40|$|Several {{methods can}} be used to provide water to plants in {{cropping}} systems where irrigation is necessary. For instance, drip irrigation has recently received much attention due to its advantages for water conservation. The type of irrigation can also impact the development of several pathogens responsible for soilborne diseases. Here, we studied the effect of drip irrigation and furrow irrigation on the development of grey <b>mould,</b> caused <b>by</b> the airborne fungus Botrytis cinerea, on tomato plants. A field experiment was conducted in 2004 in five unheated greenhouses. Plants were examined individually every 8 days and the proportion of plants <b>attacked</b> <b>by</b> grey <b>mould</b> on leaves, stems or fruits was recorded from the end of March until the end of June. Our results show that the attacks of Botrytis on the stems occurred earlier in furrow irrigation, 98. 8 days after planting on average, than in drip irrigation: 106. 3 days after planting. The kinetics of plant infection on stems, leaves and fruits were higher under furrow than under drip irrigation. Disease severity was measured by the average number of stem lesions per plant. Disease severity was higher in plants under furrow than under drip irrigation, reaching 1. 32 and 0. 99, respectively, at the end of June. Plant mortality due to grey mould was first recorded at 94 and 110 days after planting, respectively, in the furrow- and in the drip- irrigated greenhouses. These results suggest that drip irrigation could be a useful tool for the implementation of integrated protection schemes and for reducing the use of pesticides in unheated tomato greenhouses. They may also provide an additional incentive for growers to switch from furrow to drip irrigation in sheltered tomato productio...|$|R

Evaluation of the Shpx 6 b peroxidase promoter from the tropical forage legume Stylosanthes humilis [Curtis MD, Rae AL, Rusu AG, Harrison SJ & Manners JM (1997) A peroxidase gene promoter induced by phytopathogens and methyl jasmonates in transgenic plants. Molecular Plant Microbial Interactions 10 : 326 - 338] in transgenic tobacco plants Nicotiana tabacum L. (Solanaceae) demonstrated that this promoter could drive expression of both the β-glucuronidase (GUS uidA gene of E. coli) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter genes in <b>leaf</b> tissues during <b>attack</b> <b>by</b> chewing insects - larvae of potato tuber moth (PTM) Phthorimaea operculella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) and sucking insects - green peach aphids Myzus persicae Sulzer (Homoptera: Aphididae). Strong GUS expression was present in tissues next to cells damaged by PTM larvae 24 h after infestation. With aphid infestation, GUS expression was limited to sites of feeding, and was observed 48 h after infestation. The expression of GFP mirrored that of GUS expression for both treatments, but was normally detected 48 h after infestation. Similarly, the exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJa) induced GUS uniformly across leaf tissue, and mechanical wounding activated GUS expression at wound sites, similar to PTM larvae. GFP expression was observed 48 h after treatment, and for mechanical wounding GFP was localised {{in a manner similar}} to PTM damage. For MeJa treatment, GFP expression was more pronounced in cells around the midrib, and it was not uniformly induced across the leaf tissue. GUS reporter gene levels were also assayed to quantify expression, and the results were consistent with the observed histological patterns of expression. The results presented here show that the Shpx 6 b promoter switches on the expression of linked genes after damage by insect herbivores, and could be useful in regulating the expression of heterologous genes for insect and/or pathogen resistance in transgenic plants...|$|R
