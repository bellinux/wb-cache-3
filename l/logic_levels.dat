25|$|A {{dedicated}} {{voltage comparator}} chip such as LM339 {{is designed to}} interface with a digital logic interface (to a TTL or a CMOS). The output is a binary state often used to interface real world signals to digital circuitry (see analog to digital converter). If there is a fixed voltage source from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the signal path, a comparator is just {{the equivalent of a}} cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the <b>logic</b> <b>levels,</b> thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly Bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large P-N junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small Schottky diodes, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. Slew rate has no meaning for these devices. For applications in flash ADCs the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.|$|E

50|$|To {{understand}} how the inverter operates, {{it is necessary to}} understand the current flow. If the bias current is shunted to ground (low <b>logic</b> <b>level),</b> the transistor turns off and the collector floats (high <b>logic</b> <b>level).</b> If the bias current is not shunted to ground because the input is high-z (high <b>logic</b> <b>level),</b> the bias current flows through the transistor to the emitter, switching on the transistor, and allowing the collector to sink current (low <b>logic</b> <b>level).</b> Because the output of the inverter can sink current but cannot source current, it is safe to connect the outputs of multiple inverters together to form a wired AND gate. When the outputs of two inverters are wired together, the result is a two-input NOR gate because the configuration (NOT A) AND (NOT B) is equivalent to NOT (A OR B) (per De Morgan's Theorem).|$|R
50|$|Because {{the voltage}} levels {{are higher than}} <b>logic</b> <b>levels</b> {{typically}} used by integrated circuits, special intervening driver circuits are required to translate <b>logic</b> <b>levels.</b> These also protect the device's internal circuitry from short circuits or transients that may appear on the RS-232 interface, and provide sufficient current {{to comply with the}} slew rate requirements for data transmission.|$|E
