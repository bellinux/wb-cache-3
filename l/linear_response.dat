25|$|An {{advanced}} approach uses {{a combination}} of stochastic methods and <b>linear</b> <b>response</b> theory.

25|$|According to the Kramers-Kronig relation, the {{dispersion}} in {{the sound}} velocity (given by the real part of K or G) goes along with a maximum {{in the sound}} attenuation (dissipation, given by the imaginary part of K or G). According to <b>linear</b> <b>response</b> theory, the Fourier transform of K or G describes how the system returns to equilibrium after an external perturbation; for this reason, the dispersion step in the GHz..THz region is also called structural relaxation. According to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, relaxation towards equilibrium is intimately connected to fluctuations in equilibrium. The density fluctuations associated with sound waves can be experimentally observed by Brillouin scattering.|$|E
40|$|We study <b>linear</b> <b>responses</b> of D 0 -branes {{in the low}} {{frequency}} region by using gauge/gravity correspondence. The dynamics of the D 0 -branes is described by Matrix theory with finite temperature, which is dual to a near extremal D 0 -brane black hole solution. We analyze the tensor mode and vector modes of a stress tensor and a Ramond-Ramond 1 -form current of Matrix theory. Then, we show that if a cutoff surface is close to a horizon of the D 0 -brane black hole, the <b>linear</b> <b>responses</b> take forms similar to the hydrodynamic stress tensor and current on S^ 8. By taking a Rindler limit, those <b>linear</b> <b>responses</b> come to obey the hydrodynamics exactly, {{which is consistent with}} previous works on a Rindler fluid. We also show that if the cutoff surface is far from the horizon, the <b>linear</b> <b>responses</b> do not take the forms of the hydrodynamic stress tensor and current on S^ 8. Especially, we find that the vector modes no longer possess a diffusion pole in the {{low frequency}} region, which indicates that the <b>linear</b> <b>responses</b> of the D 0 -branes cannot be explained by hydrodynamics.

25|$|The {{memory effect}} is {{evaluated}} using {{the ratio of}} Rmax to Rmin (see figure). This ratio increases with decreasing light intensity and has a value of 1.5–1.6 at 0.1 lux and 1.05–1.10 at 1000 lux for PerkinElmer devices. In some low-resistive RO models this ratio was as high as 5.5, but by 2009 their production has been discontinued. High-resistance photoresistors typically have a less pronounced memory effect, are less sensitive to temperature, and have a more <b>linear</b> <b>response,</b> but are also relatively slow. Some devices designed in the 1960s had a negligible memory effect, but exhibited unacceptably high signal distortions at high current levels.|$|E
25|$|Young's modulus {{represents}} the factor of proportionality in Hooke's law, which relates {{the stress and}} the strain. However, Hooke's law is only valid under the assumption of an elastic and <b>linear</b> <b>response.</b> Any real material will eventually fail and break when stretched over a very large distance or with a very large force; however all solid materials exhibit nearly Hookean behavior for small enough strains or stresses. If the range over which Hooke's law is valid is large enough compared to the typical stress that one expects {{to apply to the}} material, the material is said to be linear. Otherwise (if the typical stress one would apply is outside the linear range) the material is said to be non-linear.|$|E

If the initial rate of the reaction is measured over a range of substrate concentrations (denoted as [...] ), the reaction rate (v) increases as [...] increases, as shown on the right. However, as [...] gets higher, the enzyme becomes saturated with substrate and the rate reaches Vmax, the enzyme's maximum rate.|$|E
40|$|In various {{economic}} environments, people observe {{those with}} whom they strategically interact. We can model such information-sharing relations as an information network, and the strategic interactions as a game on the network. When any two agents in the network are connected directly or indirectly, the equilibrium approach is cumbersome to use, because the testable implications from an equilibrium generally involve all the players of the game, when the data set in reality typically contains {{only a small fraction}} of the players. This paper develops a tractable empirical model of linear interactions where each agent, after observing part of his neighbors' types, not knowing the full information network, uses best <b>linear</b> <b>responses</b> that are <b>linear</b> in his and other players' types that he observes, based on simple beliefs about other players' strategies. We provide conditions on information networks and beliefs such that best <b>linear</b> <b>responses</b> take an explicit form with multiple intuitive features. Furthermore, the best <b>linear</b> <b>responses</b> reveal how local payoff interdependence among agents is translated into local stochastic dependence of their actions, allowing the econometrician to perform asymptotic inference without having to observe all the players in the game or having to know precisely the sampling process...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{important}} {{class of}} non-equilibrium statistical mechanical models deals with {{systems that are}} only very slightly perturbed from equilibrium. With very small perturbations, the response can be analysed in <b>linear</b> <b>response</b> theory. A remarkable result, as formalized by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, is that the response of a system when near equilibrium is precisely related to the fluctuations that occur when the system is in total equilibrium. Essentially, {{a system that is}} slightly away from equilibrium—whether put there by external forces or by fluctuations—relaxes towards equilibrium in the same way, since the system cannot tell the difference or [...] "know" [...] how it came to be away from equilibrium.|$|E

2500|$|Research geared towards life {{extension}} strategies in various organisms is currently {{under way at}} a number of academic and private institutions. Since 2009, investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold; the record in nematodes was achieved through genetic engineering and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and caloric restriction. A 2009 review of longevity research noted: [...] "Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best, and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable {{life extension}} factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm's lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover, the very notion of a [...] "life-extension factor" [...] that could apply across taxa presumes a <b>linear</b> <b>response</b> rarely seen in biology." ...|$|E

The conventional techniques involve large number of samples and higher order filter for better approximation resulting in complex hardware for implementing the same. In addition, an extensive computational resource for obtaining the inverse of huge matrices is required.
