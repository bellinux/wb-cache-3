40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of experimental investigations into the interaction between the propellers (Ps) and the airframe of a twin-engine, twin-boom light transport aircraft with a Π-shaped tail. An analysis was performed of the forces and moments acting on the aircraft with rotating Ps. The main features of the methodology for windtunnel testing of an aircraft model with running Ps in TsAGI’s T- 102 wind tunnel are outlined. The effect of 6 -blade Ps slipstreams on the longitudinal and lateral aerodynamic characteristics as well as the effectiveness of the control surfaces was studied on the aircraft model in cruise and takeoff/landing configurations. The tests were conducted at flow velocities of V ∞ = 20 to 50 m/s in the ranges of angles of attack α =  - 6 to 20 deg, sideslip angles of β = - 16 to 16 deg and blade loading coefficient of B 0 to 2. 8. For the aircraft of unusual layout studied, an increase in blowing intensity is shown to result in decreasing longitudinal static stability and significant asymmetry of the directional stability characteristics associated with the interaction between the Ps slipstreams of the same (<b>left-hand)</b> <b>rotation</b> and the empennage...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{dynamics}} of a coalescence of current loops using three-dimensional electromagnetic (EM) particle simulation code. Our focus is the investigation of such kinetic processes as energy trasnfer, heating particles, and electromagnetic emissions associated with a current loop coalescence which cannot be studied by MHD simulations. First, the two loops undergo a pinching oscillation due to a pressure imbalance between the {{inside and outside of}} the current loop. During the pinching oscillation, a kinetic kink instability is excited and electrons in the loops are heated perpendicularly to an ambient magnetic field. Next, the two current loops collide and coalesce, {{while at the same time}} a helical structure grows further. Subsequently, the perturbed current, which is due to these helically bunched electrons, can drive a whistler instability. It should be noted in this case that the whistler wave is excited by the kinetic kink instability and not a beam instability. After the coalescence of two helical loops, tilting motions can be observed in the direction of <b>left-hand</b> <b>rotation,</b> and the helical structure will relax resulting in strong plasma heating mostly in the direction perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. It is also shown that high-frequency electromagnetic waves can be emitted from the region where the two loops coalesce and propagate strongly in the direction of the electron drift velocity. These processes may be important in understanding heating mechansims for coronal loops as well as radio wave emission mechanisms from active regions of solar plasmas...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{estimator}} for the magnetic helicity density, {{a measure of}} the spiral geometry of magnetic field lines, in the wave number domain as a wave diagnostic tool based on multi-point measurements in space. The estimator is numerically tested with a synthetic data set and then applied to an observation of magnetic field fluctuations in the Earth foreshock region provided by the four-point measurements of the Cluster spacecraft. The energy and the magnetic helicity density are determined in the frequency and the wave number domain, which allows us to identify the wave properties in the plasma rest frame correcting for the Doppler shift. In the analyzed time interval, dominant wave components have parallel propagation to the mean magnetic field, away from the shock at about Alfvén speed and a <b>left-hand</b> spatial <b>rotation</b> sense of helicity with respect to the propagation direction, which means a right-hand temporal rotation sense of polarization. These wave properties are well explained by the right-hand resonant beam instability as the driving mechanism in the foreshock. Cluster observations allow therefore detailed comparisons with various theories of waves and instabilities...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the structures of}} a set of rotational discontinuities detected in the solar wind by the ISEE- 3 spacecraft. It is found that the complexity of the structure increases as the angle theta between the propagation vector k and the magnetic field decreases. For rotational discontinuities that propagate at a large angle to the field with an ion (<b>left-hand)</b> sense of <b>rotation,</b> the magnetic hodograms tend to be flattened, in agreement with prior numerical simulations. When theta is large, angular 'overshoots' are often observed at one or both ends of the discontinuity. When the propagation is nearly parallel to the field (when theta is small), many different types of structure are seen, ranging from straight lines, to S-shaped curves, to complex, disorganized shapes...|$|R
40|$|Onset of {{substorm}} due to unloading instability {{is proposed}} {{in this paper}} based on a kinetic M-I coupling model. Nonadiabatic motion of energetic ions in the near Earth plasma sheet can lead to an effective Hall conductivity in the plasma sheet similar to the Hall conductivity in the E-region ionosphere. Hall conductivity can lead to <b>left-hand</b> <b>rotation</b> of electric field {{with respect to the}} background magnetic field. Nonuniform distribution of diffuse aurora in ionosphere and nonuniform distribution of energetic ions in plasma sheet can result in nonuniform distribution of Hall conductivity. Nonuniform Hall conductivity can lead to nonuniform rotation of electric field. As a result of M-I coupling process, a southward curl-E field distribution {{can be found in the}} premidnight region of near Earth plasma sheet prior to the onset of substorm. An electron time scale dynamo process in response to the southward curl-E field distribution can lead to formation of premidnight upward field-aligned current. The premidnight upward field-aligned current can initiate dipolarization in the midnight region and trigger unloading instability. Unloading instability will grow if there are enough energetic ions in the near Earth plasma sheet at onset of substorm. Enough energetic ions in the plasma sheet imply that the cross-tail current is mainly contributed by the Hall current. Positive feedback between thickening of current sheet and reduction of Hall current leads to amplification of current disruption and onset of substorm expansion phase. Our model can explain the observed magnetic field signature during explosive thinning prior to onset of substorm. Our model can also explain onset of substorm due to northward turning of IMF. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMental-Imagery based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) {{allow their}} users to send {{commands}} {{to a computer}} via their brain activity, measured while they are performing specific mental tasks. While very promising (e. g., assistive technologies for motor-disabled patients) MI-BCI remain barely used outside laboratories {{because of the difficulty}} encountered by users to control such systems. Indeed, although some users obtain very good control performance after training, a substantial proportion remains unable to reliably control an MI-BCI. This huge variability led the community to look for predictors of MI-BCI control ability. In this paper, we introduce two predictive models of MI-BCI performance, based on a dataset of 17 participants who had to learn to control an MI-BCI by performing 3 MI-tasks: mental <b>rotation,</b> <b>left-hand</b> motor imagery and mental subtraction, across 6 sessions. These models include aspects of participants' personality and cognitive profiles, assessed by questionnaires. Both models, which explain more than 96 % and 80 % of MI-BCI performance variance, allowed us to define user profiles that could be associated with good BCI performances...|$|R
