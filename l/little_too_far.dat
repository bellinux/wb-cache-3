25|$|The unorthodox play of Higgins was {{encapsulated}} in his {{break of}} 69, made under unusual pressure, against Jimmy White in the penultimate frame of their World Professional Snooker Championship semi-final in 1982. Higgins was 0–59 {{down in that}} frame, but managed to compile an extremely challenging clearance during which he was scarcely in position until the colours. In particular, former world champion Dennis Taylor considers a three-quarter-ball pot on a blue into the green pocket especially memorable, {{not only for its}} extreme degree of difficulty but for enabling Higgins to continue the break and keep White off the table and unable to clinch victory at that moment. In potting the blue, Higgins screwed the cue-ball on to the side cushion to bring it back towards the black/pink area with extreme left-hand sidespin, a shot Taylor believes could be played 100 times without coming close to the position Higgins reached with cue-ball. He went a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> for ideal position on his next red but the match-saving break was still alive.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{commented that}} Stephenson seems to carry his {{understanding}} of the period a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> at times, delving into too much detail. Nick Hasted of The Independent wrote that this research made [...] "descriptions of Restoration London feel leaden, and intellectual discourses between Newton and his contemporaries textbook-dry." [...] Despite the thorough examination of the period, however, Stephenson does take liberty in depicting the Enlightenment. Both main and secondary fictional characters become prominent members of society who advise the most important figures of the period and affect everything from politics to economics and science. For example, he repopulates the real Cabal Ministry with fictional characters.|$|E

500|$|In 1749, a court {{decision}} made by Fielding – {{in his role as}} magistrate – provoked rumours that he was being paid to defend brothels. Three years later, a letter written by [...] "Humphry Meanwell" [...] voiced objection to the 1752 Disorderly House Act (25 Geo. II, c. 36), which was intended to remove prostitutes and brothels from Britain. The public soon associated this letter with Fielding; his publication of what was seen as an endorsement of the letter in the 22 June issue strengthened this feeling: [...] "The following Letter which was sent to the Justice by an unknown Hand, hath been transmitted to us; and tho' perhaps some Points are carried a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far,</b> upon the whole I think it a very sensible Performance, and worthy the Attention of the Public."

Noting that a third of the set-list was made up of covers, she expressed dislike for Lewis' interpretation of [...] "Time After Time". Abbott wrote that her [...] "only real criticism" [...] of the performance was for the stage production, which she described as [...] "five strips of giant toilet paper hanging at the back, occasionally changing colour, and spaced a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> apart to make for easy viewing of the video footage of Leona explaining why her music is so important to her".

He particularly praised Louis CK and some of the smaller jokes in the episode, like the fact that a gay character's [...] "straight guy" [...] Halloween costume is identical to Mark's regular wardrobe. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said the episode [...] "demonstrated how an episode of P can work wonders—dial up the conditions that might drive a character insane, as they did to Leslie, and watch them squirm". He also said the episode featured every supporting character well, but that Ann was less funny without a [...] "wacky person to play off of". Time magazine critic James Poniewozik said it was a [...] "strong episode that hit office and personal sides of the characters equally well". Poniewozik praised Pratt and Louis C.K. in particular, but also said Leslie was pushed [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> into the crazy-obsessive end of the spectrum".

Another piano version of the song was performed on May 21, 2011, on the season finale of Saturday Night Live, where Gaga wore a metallic black dress, knee-high boots and a semi-circular metallic headdress. The full version was first performed at the final show of American Idol season 10 on May 25, 2011, where she was joined by Clemons in person. Gaga appeared perched atop a mountain top on the [...] "Idol" [...] stage, dressed in a long cape and a bedazzled headpiece. A trio of dancers were {{at the base of the}} set performing choreographed dance steps while Gaga sang from the top. At the end of the performance, Gaga and a dancer embraced each other, took a breath and then jumped off the edge of the stage, landing out of sight on a bed of fake rocks, as steam shot up high in the air. Len Melisurgo from The Star-Ledger felt that the performance was too [...] "sexually suggestive" [...] for the audience of American Idol and wondered whether Gaga [...] "went just a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> for a family-oriented show that's geared toward a younger audience?"

2500|$|Vine's cricket {{career was}} not one of a rapid rise to fame. Although he played his first {{first-class}} match in 1896, it was not until 1900, after some tentative appearances in the three previous seasons, that he earned a regular place in the Sussex eleven. After that, however, he was indispensable. He was essentially a county cricketer, nearly all his work having been done for Sussex, but if, in addition to his batting and fielding, he had managed to retain his skill as a leg-break bowler it is quite likely that he would have played for England before he played his two Test matches in 1911/2. Already a dependable player, he made a great advance as a batsman in 1904 and during 1905 he was better than he had ever been before, scoring for Sussex in county matches alone over sixteen hundred runs. Good as his position is he would probably have been thought still more of if he had belonged to another county. A batsman would need to be great indeed to play on the same side as Ranjitsinhji and C.B. Fry, and not be overshadowed. His success as a batsman was largely gained in a series of first-wicket partnerships with Fry, and though he may at times carry caution a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> and keep an undue check on his hitting powers, the result is nearly always so satisfactory that it would be sheer hypercriticism to find fault with him. As an outfield Vine has not the wonderful pick-up of Denton, but in every other respect was in the highest class, {{and in the course of}} a season at the beginning of the twentieth century, perhaps no one saved a larger number of runs.|$|E

2500|$|Cardinal Pierre-Marie Gerlier of Lyon, {{a staunch}} anti-Semite who {{supported}} Vichy's efforts {{to solve the}} [...] "Jewish question" [...] in France thus far, opposed the rafles of Jews, arguing in a sermon that the [...] "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" [...] was taking things a <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> (his [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish question" [...] was conversion of the Jews to Roman Catholicism). Archbishop Jules-Géraud Saliège of Toulouse in a pastoral letter of 23 August 1942 declared about the deportations: [...] "You cannot do whatever you wish against these men, against these women, against these fathers and mothers. They are part of mankind. They are our brothers". Pastor Marc Boegner, president of the National Protestant Federation, denounced the rafles in a sermon in September 1942, asking Calvinists to hide Jews. A number of Catholic and Calvinist schools and organizations such as Jesuit Père Pierre Chaillet's l'Amitié Chrétienne began to take in Jewish children and passed them off as Christian. Many Protestant families, influenced by memories of persecution, {{had already begun to}} hide Jews, and after the summer of 1942, the Catholic Church, which until then had been broadly supportive of Vichy's anti-Semitic laws, began to condemn racial anti-Semitism and organized efforts to hide Jews. The official story was that the Jews were being [...] "resettled in the East", being moved to a [...] "Jewish homeland" [...] said to exist somewhere in Eastern Europe, but right from the start, there were disturbing rumors that the Jews were actually being killed. As 1942 went on, the fact that no one knew precisely where this [...] "Jewish homeland in the East" [...] was or had seen it together with the fact that those sent to be [...] "resettled in the East" [...] were never seen or heard from again led more and more people to the correct conclusion that the horrific rumors of the Jews were in fact being all exterminated were true.|$|E
