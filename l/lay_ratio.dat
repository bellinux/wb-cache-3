40|$|The {{electrical}} resistance of helically-stranded conductors (aluminium and aluminium alloy), {{intended for use}} in distribution and transmission lines, depends on the conductor cross-section area, the conductivity of the aluminium alloy, the lay length of the aluminium layers, and {{the presence or absence}} of a steel reinforcing core. The presence of a stranded steel core both reduces the conductor resistance due to the conductivity of the galvanized steel wires and increases the resistance due to core magnetizing effects. This brochure describes a process of calculation for stranded aluminium conductors both with and without a steel reinforcing core. APPENDIX A provides a MathCad programme to determine the AC resistance of a stranded conductor for a given current. This output can be used in conjunction with the steady state model to determine the actual current flow or conductor temperature. APPENDIX B provides an alternate model for the calculation of the AC resistance On the basis of laboratory tests and theoretical studies, it has been determined, that AC resistance of stranded aluminium conductors (AAC) or all aluminium conductors (AAAC) can be calculated with acceptable accuracy by taking into consideration the conductor geometry, e. g. <b>lay</b> <b>ratio,</b> diameter of wire, current and temperature distribution of conductor. Resistance calculations with Aluminium conductor Steel reinforced (ACSR), however, can be more complex due interactions between the currents in each helically stranded layer coupled through the steel core. On the basis of results from research [5, 6, 7, 8]* computer programs have been developed that can determine the AC resistance of ACSR very accurately (one presented here). This brochure describes the theory as well as demonstrating a programme that can be used within existing software packages that will enable rapid and accurate determination of AC resistance for helically stranded conductor types...|$|E

40|$|In various studies, chronic {{elevation}} of corticosterone levels in female birds under natural or experimental conditions resulted in female biased offspring sex ratios. In chicken, one study with injected corticosterone {{resulted in a}} male sex ratio bias. In the current study, we chronically elevated blood plasma corticosterone levels through corticosterone feeding (20 mg/kg feed) for 14 days using 30 chicken hens in each of treatment and control groups and studied the primary offspring sex ratio (here defined as the proportion of male fertile eggs determined in freshly laid eggs, i. e., without egg incubation). Mean plasma corticosterone concentrations were significantly higher in the treatment group but were not associated with sex <b>ratio,</b> <b>laying</b> rate, and fertility rate. Corticosterone treatment by itself did not affect egg sex but affected sex ratio as well as laying rate and fertility rate in interaction with hen body mass. Body mass had a negative association with sex <b>ratio,</b> <b>laying</b> rate, and fertility rate per hen in the corticosterone group, but a positive association with sex ratio in untreated hens. These interactions were already seen when taking the body mass {{at the beginning of}} the experiment, indicating intrinsic differences between light and heavy hens with regard to their reaction to corticosterone treatment. The effects on laying rate, fertility rate, and sex ratio suggest that some factor related to body mass act together with corticosterone to modulate ovarian functions. We propose that corticosterone treatment in conjunction with hen body mass can interfere with meiosis, which can lead to meiotic drive and to chromosomal aberrations resulting in postponed ovulation or infertile ova...|$|R

First, whole birch trunk pieces were cryosectioned into cork cambium, non-conductive phloem, the cambial zone (conductive phloem, cambium and differentiating xylem), lignified xylem and the previous year’s xylem; material that would show differences in lignin amount and quality. Second, clonal material from one natural birch population was analyzed to show variations between individuals and between the lignin analysis methods. The different tissues showed marked differences in lignin amount and the syringyl:guaiacyl (S/G) ratio. In the non-conductive phloem tissue containing sclereids, the S/G ratio was very low, and typical for phloem fibers and in the newly-formed xylem, {{as well as in}} the previous year’s xylem, the <b>ratio</b> <b>lay</b> between five and seven, typical for broadleaf tree xylem.

In addition, it harbors a very high species diversity. Posidonia oceanica beds {{are very sensitive to}} disturbances caused by human activity (e. g. coastal development, pol-lution, turbidity, anchoring, etc.) and their loss has been observed in a number of regions. The aim of the monitoring of P. oceanica meadows along the Provence and French Riviera coasts is (i) to evidence possible new losses and (ii) to evaluate through a biological indi-cator the efficiency of regional policies (e. g. setting up of sewage treatment plants, reduc-tion in industrial and domestic pollution levels in the rivers flowing towards the Mediterranean, establishment of Marine Protected Areas, banning of new harbors and reclamations). Monitoring tools operate at three scales: (i) system scale (aerial photo-graphs, measurement of bottom cover, permanent transects), (ii) meadow scale (e. g. photographs of Posidonia around cement markers positioned along meadow limits, shoot-density, permanent quadrats) and (iii) shoot scale (e. g. plagiotopic to orthotropic rhizome <b>ratio,</b> <b>laying</b> bare of the rhizomes, lepidochronology, leaf epiphytes, leaf biome...|$|R
40|$|Sex ratio theory allows unparalleled {{opportunities}} for testing how well animal {{behavior can be}} predicted by evolutionary theory. For example, Hamilton's theory of local mate competition (LMC) is well understood and can explain variation in sex allocation across numerous species. This allows more specific predictions to be developed and tested. Here we extend LMC theory to a situation that will be common {{in a range of}} species: asymmetrical LMC. Asymmetrical LMC occurs when females lay eggs on a patch asynchronously and male offspring do not disperse, leading to relatively weaker LMC for males emerging from later broods. Varying levels of LMC then lead to varying optimal sex ratios for females, depending on when and where they oviposit. We confirm the assumptions of our theory using the wasp Nasonia vitripennis and then test our predictions. We show that females adjust their offspring sex ratios in the directions predicted, <b>laying</b> different sex <b>ratios</b> on different hosts within a patch. Specifically, there was a less female-biased sex ratio when ovipositing on an unparasitized host if another host on the patch had previously been parasitized and a less female-biased sex ratio on parasitized hosts if females also oviposited on an unparasitized host...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHatching {{asynchrony}} in avian species generally {{leads to}} a size hierarchy among siblings, favouring the first-hatched chicks. Maternally deposited hormones affect the embryo and chick's physiology and behaviour. It has been observed that progesterone, a hormone present at higher levels than other steroid hormones in egg yolks, is negatively related to body mass in embryos, chicks and adults. A differential within-clutch progesterone deposition could therefore {{be linked to the}} size hierarchy between siblings and to the resulting brood reduction. We tested whether yolk progesterone levels differed between eggs according to future parental ability to feed the entire clutch in wild rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome. This species presents a unique reversed egg-size dimorphism and hatching asynchrony, with the larger secondlaid egg (B-egg) hatching before the smaller first-laid egg (A-egg). Yolk progesterone levels increased only slightly with female body mass at <b>laying.</b> However, intra-clutch <b>ratios</b> were not related to female body mass. On the other hand, yolk progesterone levels increased significantly with the date of laying onset for A-eggs while they decreased for B-eggs. Early clutches therefore had proportionally more progesterone in the B-egg compared to the A-egg while late clutches had proportionally less progesterone in the B-egg. We propose that females could strategically regulate yolk progesterone deposition within clutches according to the expected food availability during chick growth, an adaptive strategy to adjust brood reduction to conditions. We also discuss these results, relating to yolk progesterone, in the broader context of other yolk steroids...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} {{influencing}} sex of egg and sex <b>ratio</b> in <b>laying</b> chicken {{may lead to}} finding potential solutions for the problem of killing of day old male chicks, which is the current practice in breeding of laying hens. In studies described in this thesis, it was investigated if {{the sex of the}} chicken egg can be predicted by measurable differences in male and female eggs at unincubated stage and if the female primary sex ratio can be induced in laying chicken using different experimental conditions such as feed restriction and corticosterone feeding. The method of sex determination in unincubated chicken eggs using PCR targeted to CHD 1 gene was first developed. This method was subsequently used to study the primary sex ratio bias as well as relationship between egg sex and yolk hormones. No significant relationship of the sex of egg with concentrations of several hormones (testosterone, estradiol, androstenedione, progesterone, dihydrotestosterone) and glucose in yolk as well as of egg parameters (mass, width and length) was found. Effect of feed availability on sex ratio was tested in two separate studies. In one study, the rate of change of hen body mass between day of laying and day of laying minus 2 days (encompass time of meiosis completion) was a significant predictor for the sex of that egg, suggesting meiotic drive as mechanism of sex ratio bias. This relationship was not found in the later study. The difference in results could be due to the reason that hens decreased in body mass much less in the later study as compared to earlier study. Blood corticosterone concentrations were associated with sex ratio per hen in the earlier study. Effect of egg mass on egg sex was studied during the later experiment of feed restriction. The egg sex ratio per hen was negatively associated with the average egg mass per hen in the feed restriction group. Two groups of hens were selected from the feed restriction group i. e. male biased hens with low egg mass and female biased hens with high egg mass for microarray analysis of gene expression in the germinal disc of collected F 1 follicle. The results did not show differential expression of genes between the groups. However, gene set enrichment analysis showed that a number of processes related to cell cycle progression, mitotic/meiotic apparatus and chromosomal movement were differently enriched between the groups, supporting meiotic drive as potential mechanisms underlying sex ratio determination. In another experiment, blood circulating levels of corticosterone in hens were increased by feeding corticosterone mixed feed under ad libitum. The blood levels of corticosterone were significantly higher in treated hens but these levels were not associated with sex ratio. Treatment did not affect the overall sex ratio, but affected the sex ratio in interaction with hen body mass. In the corticosterone group, sex <b>ratio,</b> <b>laying</b> rate, and fertility rate per hen were decreased in heavy hens. These results suggest that three parameters (sex <b>ratio,</b> <b>laying</b> rate and fertility rate) are connected at the level of ovarian physiology. Interference with meiosis have been shown to affect these three parameters, suggesting the involvement of meiotic drive as mechanism of sex ratio bias...|$|R
40|$|Three {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid on egg production and immune response in Leghorn chickens. Corn oil rich in linoleic acid and flaxseed rich in linolenic acid were used to adjust levels of dietary linoleic and linolenic acids. The first {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of four dietary ratios of linoleic to linolenic acid [17 : 1 (control), 8 : 1, 4 : 1, or 2 : 1] in pullet chicks on immune response to standard vaccinations. Dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid did not influence feed consumption and body weight. Decreasing dietary ratios enhanced (P 3 ̆c 0. 004) antibody production against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine at 12 to 16 weeks of age. The dietary ratio of 4 : 1 or 2 : 1 enhanced antibody production against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) vaccine at 16 weeks of age. The second study was conducted to investigate whether dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid affected egg production parameters and immune response of mature <b>laying</b> hens. Dietary <b>ratio</b> of linoleic to linolenic acid did not affect egg production and quality. Decreasing dietary ratio from 17 : 1 to 8 : 1 or 4 : 1 improved antibody production against NDV vaccine (P 3 ̆c 0. 0004) and in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in response to Con A (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) or LPS (P 3 ̆c 0. 02). The relationship between dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid on subpopulations of blood T lymphocytes was evaluated in a third study. Decreasing dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid from 17 : 1 to 8 : 1, 4 : 1, or 2 : 1 significantly increased proportion of CD 4 +CD 8 − T lymphocytes, but decreased proportion of CD 4 −CD 8 + T lymphocytes. These observations indicate that supplementing flaxseed as a source of linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 3) to lower dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid improved the immune response of Leghorn chickens without showing negative effects on body weight gain and egg production. The linolenic acid-induced change in blood T-lymphocyte subpopulations may be attributed to the enhancement of immune response. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{offers a}} case that Richard McCormick 2 ̆ 7 s ethical theory, {{referred}} to here and elsewhere as proportionalism, is consequentialist. Such a case is needed for a few reasons. First, the moral tradition in which McCormick claims a place for himself is not consequentialist, and so this study may {{have a role to}} play in deciding whether McCormick actually stands outside of this tradition. Second, while some have made the charge that McCormick 2 ̆ 7 s version of proportionalism is consequentialist, a thorough, philosophical argument that such is the case has not yet been offered. Third, McCormick has denied that his theory is consequentialist and has offered arguments in support of this position, arguments which have not been systematically and thoroughly rebutted. Finally, this study also gains relevance from the considerable stature McCormick enjoys in his field, a rather high-profile former standard bearer of the proportionalist movement, his significance in the area of moral theology is not in dispute. Chapter 1 <b>lays</b> out the <b>ratio</b> of consequentialist ethical theories by identifying what they maintain determines the moral quality of acts and what they assert every agent 2 ̆ 7 s basic moral duty to be. Chapter 2 traces a brief history of proportionalism and makes note of McCormick 2 ̆ 7 s indebtedness to his predecessors, thereby putting his version of this theory in its proper historical and theoretical context. Chapters 3 through 5 contain the case that McCormick 2 ̆ 7 s proportionalism is, despite his denials, consequentialist. The case is made by examining both his theoretical statements about the nature of morally right and morally wrong acts, and the case studies where he applies his theory. Our analysis reveals that McCormick 2 ̆ 7 s foundational position is that the amount or kind of good or evil that any moral act entails is the sole decisive element in making that act to be morally right or morally wrong. We see that all of the theoretical refinements McCormick incorporates into his proportionalism, refinements such as his necessity and undermining principles, his association of basic goods, and his sensitivity to the distinction between directly and indirectly causing evil, serve a single purpose: identifying that choice among an agent 2 ̆ 7 s options which promises the greatest realization of good or the greatest diminution of evil. And to identify that act among an agent 2 ̆ 7 s choices which promises the greatest good or least evil is, for McCormick, to identify the morally obligatory act for that agent. In this way, then, McCormick 2 ̆ 7 s proportionalism must be considered a consequentialist ethical theory...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{is arguably}} the most {{important}} abiotic factor influencing the embryonic development in ectothermic species. Incubation temperature has demonstrated effects on offspring phenotypes in ectotherms, including traits such as sex, size, shape, colouration and post-hatch growth and survival. However, in endotherms the influence temperature has on development is relatively unexplored due to the narrow range of temperatures that embryonic endotherms are exposed to during develop. Megapode birds utilize environmental heat sources to incubate their eggs and therefore provide a potential model to test how temperature influences embryonic development and offspring phenotypes in endotherms. I used the Australian Brush-turkey (Alectura lathami), a megapode bird that incubates its eggs in mounds of soil and leaf litter to investigate the effects of temperature on embryonic development and chick morphology. Previous reports of Australian Brush-turkey incubation mound temperatures relied on spot measurements and theoretical modeling and thus have not provided a comprehensive examination of the range of temperatures Brush-turkey embryos are exposed to and how these might vary during the course of incubation. Therefore to examine the range of temperatures experienced by developing embryos I continuously recorded the temperature of eggs and mound material at naturally occurring positions within incubation mounds over the full developmental period. As in previous studies I found the average incubation temperature to be about 34 °C, however egg temperatures typically fluctuated more than previously reported or predicted from modeling. The thermal tolerance of Brush-turkeys is remarkable compared to non-megapode birds, with embryos developing successfully despite prolonged exposure to sub-optimal temperatures over the range 25 - 40 °C. I also demonstrated that the incubation period was negatively correlated with mean incubation temperature. To simplify the examination of temperature effects on embryonic development, constant temperature artificial incubation of Brush-turkey eggs was used to determine influence of incubation temperature on the energetics of embryonic development and the sex ratio, morphology and chemical composition of chicks. Because initial investigation of mound temperatures determined the mean incubation temperature in Brush-turkeys to be 34 °C this was used as the preferred temperature for constant temperature incubation with 32 °C and 36 °C representing low and high temperatures respectively. Previously, the sex ratio of Brush-turkey chicks at hatching was shown to be temperature dependent. A thermally sensitive period early in development resulted in more females hatching from high temperature and more males hatching from low temperatures with an equal ratio at the preferred temperature. Using molecular sexing techniques to determine the sex of both failed embryos and chicks that hatched, I established that at <b>laying</b> the sex <b>ratio</b> of eggs was 50 : 50, and that temperature-dependent sex-biased embryo mortality was the mechanism behind the skewed sex ratio of chicks hatching from non-preferred temperatures. Low incubation temperature increased female embryonic mortality and high incubation temperature increased male embryonic mortality. This represents a novel mechanism operating to alter sex ratios in a bird species and offers an unparalleled system to explore sex allocation theory. It is well established that temperature influences the rate of development and the morphology of offspring in reptilian species. Also, in a previous study using artificially incubated Brush-turkey eggs, temperature was found to affect the mass of chicks but not their size (linear dimensions). This finding suggests that at different incubation temperatures the amount of yolk converted into tissue during embryonic development is influenced by incubation temperature. I tested this hypothesis by incubating eggs at different constant temperatures and found high incubation temperatures produce chicks with lighter yolk-free bodies and heavier residual yolks but similar linear dimensions compared to chicks hatching from lower temperatures. Because eggs incubated at low temperatures have longer incubation periods, I hypothesized the proportion of lipid in the yolk-free body would be higher in chicks emerging from eggs incubated at low temperature because more time is available for the conversion of yolk to fat bodies during embryonic development. This hypothesis was not supported as the composition of yolk-free chicks (total water, lipid, protein and ash) was not temperature dependent. A previous study in Malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata), another megapode bird, found that the total energetic cost of production was influenced by incubation temperature. Such that embryos developing at low temperatures required 72 % more energy than embryos developing at high temperatures. However these findings were contrary to expectation from studies of reptilian incubation where the energetic cost of development is independent of temperature. Therefore I tested the hypothesis that the total energetic cost of development is temperature dependent in the Australian Brush-turkey. I used bomb calorimetry to measure the energy content of freshly laid eggs and of chicks (both the yolk-free body and residual yolk) that had hatched from eggs incubated 32 oC, 34 oC and 36 oC. I found that the total energy content of chicks at hatching was greater in chicks emerging from eggs incubated at 34 oC and 36 oC compared to eggs incubated at 32 oC. My thesis work demonstrated that incubation temperature is more variable for Brush-turkey embryos than for non-megapode birds and that even a small difference in temperature can have important effects on chick sex ratios, morphology and energy reserves. I have shown that incubation under artificial constant temperature conditions can significantly alter the developmental trajectories and phenotypic outcomes for chicks. In addition to laboratory based work, future studies should continue to examine how embryonic development and chick attributes are influenced by temperatures experienced under natural incubation conditions. Furthermore, investigation is required to determine how incubation temperature induced differences in hatchling phenotypes influence the post-hatch grow and fitness of chicks...|$|R
