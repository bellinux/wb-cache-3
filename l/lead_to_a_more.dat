This means globally reduced evaporation and hence precipitation occur in a dimmer and warmer world, which could ultimately <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> humid atmosphere in which it rains less.|$|E

There are two main haplotypes that explain 25% of variation: low-dose haplotype group (A) and a high-dose haplotype group (B). VKORC1 polymorphisms explain why African Americans are on average relatively resistant to warfarin (higher proportion of group B haplotypes), while Asian Americans are generally more sensitive (higher proportion of group A haplotypes). Group A VKORC1 polymorphisms <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> rapid achievement of a therapeutic INR, but also a shorter time to reach an INR over 4, which is associated with bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl fell in {{love with}} the arts in her childhood. She began to paint and write poetry at the age of four. She was also athletic, and at the age of twelve joined a {{gymnastics}} and swimming club. Her mother was confident her daughter would grow up to be successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Riefenstahl's father, who was not interested in his daughter's artistic inclinations. In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of Snow White which interested her deeply; it led her to want to be a dancer. Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education that could <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> dignified occupation. His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion. Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.|$|E

5|$|Some {{interest}} in Forster's life and revolutionary actions was revived {{in the context}} of the liberal sentiments leading up to the 1848 revolution. But he was largely forgotten in the Germany of Wilhelm II and more so in the Third Reich, where {{interest in}} Forster was limited to his stance on Poland from his private letters. Interest in Forster resumed in the 1960s in East Germany, where he was interpreted as a champion of class struggle. The GDR research station in Antarctica that was opened on October 25, 1987, was named after him. In West Germany, the search for democratic traditions in German history also <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> diversified picture of him in the 1970s. The Alexander von Humboldt foundation named a scholarship program for foreign scholars from developing countries after him. His reputation as one of the first and most outstanding German ethnologists is indisputable, and his works are seen as crucial in the development of ethnology in Germany into a separate branch of science.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} of the south polar region {{is marked by a}} pattern of parallel, Y- and V-shaped ridges and valleys. The shape, orientation, and location of these features suggest they are caused by changes in the overall shape of Enceladus. As of 2006 there were two theories for what could cause such a shift in shape: the orbit of Enceladus may have migrated inward, leading to an increase in Enceladus's rotation rate. Such a shift would <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> oblate shape; or a rising mass of warm, low-density material in Enceladus's interior may have led to a shift in the position of the current south polar terrain from Enceladus's southern mid-latitudes to its south pole. Consequently, the moon's ellipsoid shape would have adjusted to match the new orientation. One problem of the polar flattening hypothesis is that both polar regions should have similar tectonic deformation histories. However, the north polar region is densely cratered, and has a much older surface age than the south pole. Thickness variations in Enceladus's lithosphere is one explanation for this discrepancy. Variations in lithospheric thickness are supported by the correlation between the Y-shaped discontinuities and the V-shaped cusps along the south polar terrain margin and the relative surface age of the adjacent non-south polar terrain regions. The Y-shaped discontinuities, and the north-south trending tension fractures into which they lead, are correlated with younger terrain with presumably thinner lithospheres. The V-shaped cusps are adjacent to older, more heavily cratered terrains.|$|E

25|$|A {{controversy}} has arisen, in part, over concern {{due to the}} role of human embryonic cell lines and vaccine development. Unlike bacteria or fungi, viruses cannot reproduce autonomously and require a living organism host in order to replicate. The ability of the virus to cause infection usually depends on the host with whom its cells have adapted to over generations of replication. In other words, a virus can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> severe infection in certain organisms versus others. To create a vaccine that is safe for individuals while having the ability to induce a protective immune response necessitates choosing an appropriate cell line to grow a virus.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of anger management {{has been studied}} {{in children and adolescents}} for the purpose of evaluating existing programs and designing more effective programs. In a meta-analyses of 40 studies, an overall effect size of 0.67 was found for CBT anger management treatment, suggesting anger management as a legitimate approach to problematic levels of anger. Skills development (0.79) and problem solving (0.67) both had a higher impact than affective education (0.36). This was believed to be due to behavioral aspects being more easily conveyed than cognitive for children. The true value from early interventions aimed at youths comes from the preventative aspect. Curbing negative behaviors early in life could <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> positive outlook as an adult.|$|E
500|$|Goff {{looked at}} the {{relationship}} between nuisance and Rylands v Fletcher, particularly how they treat strict liability. In nuisance, liability is strict in that the defendant can be liable {{even if he has}} taken reasonable care, but this is kept [...] "under control" [...] by the principle that a defendant is not liable for actions a reasonable user takes on his land. He took into consideration an article published by F.H. Newark in 1949, in which Newark called the decision in Rylands [...] "a simple case of nuisance" [...] rather than a revolutionary doctrine that established strict liability outside nuisance. Goff also found similarities between the principle of [...] "non-natural use" [...] under Rylands and that of the [...] "reasonable user" [...] requirement in nuisance, concluding that [...] "t would <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> coherent body of common law principles if the rule [...] were to be regarded essentially {{as an extension of the}} law of nuisance".|$|E

Mitch Winehouse had also stated {{that his daughter}}'s lungs were operating at 70 percent capacity {{and that she had}} an irregular heartbeat. He said that these problems had been caused by her chain smoking crack cocaine. The singer's father also reported that doctors had warned Winehouse that, if she continued smoking crack cocaine, she would have to wear an oxygen mask and would eventually die. In a radio interview, Mitch Winehouse said the singer was responding [...] "fabulously" [...] to treatment, which included being covered with nicotine patches. British Lung Foundation spokesman Keith Prowse noted this type of condition could be managed with treatment. Prowse also said the condition was not normal for a person her age but [...] "heavy smoking and inhaling other substances like drugs can age the lungs prematurely." [...] Norman H. Edelman of the American Lung Association explained that if she stopped smoking, her lung functions would decline at the rate of a normal person, but continued smoking would <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> rapid decline in lung function.|$|E

However, because the ratio of soil organic carbon to nitrogen is mediated by soil biology such that it maintains a narrow range, a doubling of soil organic carbon is likely to imply a doubling in the storage of nitrogen in soils as organic nitrogen, thus providing higher available nutrient levels for plants, supporting higher yield potential. The demand for imported fertilizer nitrogen could decrease, and provide the opportunity for changing costly fertilisation strategies.|$|E

2500|$|A {{basic concept}} in some CBT {{treatments}} used in anxiety disorders is in vivo exposure. The term {{refers to the}} direct confrontation of feared objects, activities, or situations by a patient. For example, a woman with PTSD who fears the location where she was assaulted may be assisted by her therapist in going to that location and directly confronting those fears. Likewise, a person with social anxiety disorder who fears public speaking may be instructed to directly confront those fears by giving a speech. This [...] "two-factor" [...] model is often credited to O. Hobart Mowrer. Through exposure to the stimulus, this harmful conditioning can be [...] "unlearned" [...] (referred to as extinction and habituation). Studies have provided evidence that when examining animals and humans that glucocorticoids may possibly <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> successful extinction learning during exposure therapy.
