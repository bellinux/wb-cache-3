We find a destructive quantum interference (DQI) feature in the transmission function slightly below the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) which dominates the conductance even for the uncharged branched compound with spacer groups inserted. In an analysis based on mapping the structural characteristics {{of the range of}} molecules in our article onto tight-binding models, we identify the structural source of the DQI minimum as the through-space coupling between the pyridyl anchor groups.
