5|$|After {{undergoing}} trials {{following a}} refit, the Gnat {{met up with}} the <b>Ladybird,</b> who also had a ship's dog. However Judy had to be kept away as while he took a fancy to her, she did not care for him. In the early morning after the <b>Ladybird</b> departed, Judy alerted the ship {{to the presence of}} river pirates who were about to board the Gnat in the darkness. The attack was easily repelled as the pirates lost the surprise element. Several days later, Judy was taken ashore with a shooting party for the first time but she was unsuccessful as a gundog. Throughout her stay on the Gnat, the crew repeatedly tried to use her as a gundog, each time resulting in a failure.|$|E
5|$|Species used {{to control}} spider mites include the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis, Neoseilus californicus, and Amblyseius cucumeris, the predatory midge Feltiella acarisuga, and a <b>ladybird</b> Stethorus punctillum. The bug Orius insidiosus has been {{successfully}} used against the two-spotted spider mite and the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis).|$|E
5|$|Five Red Data Book {{invertebrate}} {{species have}} been recorded in the area. These include: the soldier flies Odontomyia ornata and Stratiomys singularior, hover fly Lejops vittata, the great silver water beetle (Hydrophilus piceus), and the water beetle Hydrovatus clypealis. Nationally scarce species include the aquatic snail Gyraulus laevis, the hairy dragonfly (Brachytron pratense), and the <b>ladybird</b> Coccidula scutellata.|$|E
40|$|Adult <b>ladybirds</b> feed {{on other}} insects that are harmful to crops. The {{problem is that}} the <b>ladybirds</b> fly away. The New Agriculturist No. 7 of 1998 reports that {{researchers}} at INRA, the French national institute of agronomic research, have found a way of breeding <b>ladybirds</b> that can't fly, so they'll stay around to eat pests.

5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; {{angelfish}} and zebras are striped. These patterns have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which {{increase the chances}} that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is signalling — for instance, a <b>ladybird</b> {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a <b>ladybird</b> and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} its {{military}} accomplishment, Japan's international reputation was blackened by the Nanking Massacre, {{as well as by}} a series of international incidents that occurred during and after the battle. Most notable among them were the shelling by Japanese artillery of the British steamship <b>Ladybird</b> on the Yangtze River on December 12, and the sinking by Japanese aircraft of the American gunboat Panay not far downstream on the same day. The Allison Incident, the slapping of an American consul by a Japanese soldier, further increased tensions with the United States.|$|E
5|$|Several metamorphosing insects' {{scientific}} names reference the myth. Myrrha is a genus of ladybug beetles, {{such as the}} 18-spot <b>ladybird</b> (Myrrha octodecimguttata) Libythea myrrha, the club beak, is a butterfly native to India. Cupido myrrha is a rare species of butterfly named by Herrich-Schäffer found on Mount Erciyes in south-eastern Turkey. Catocala myrrha is a synonym for a species of moth known as married underwing. In total the United Kingdom's Natural History Museum lists eight Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) with the myrrha name.|$|E

5|$|The various {{habitats}} provide {{homes to}} numerous species of insects. There are 700 moth species {{recorded in the}} nature reserve, again {{a quarter of the}} national total. At different spots across the site butterflies (including the green hairstreak), damselflies (like the large red), and dragonflies (such as the hairy dragonfly) can be observed. According to a 2005 report, the exceedingly rare thirteen-spotted <b>ladybird</b> (Hippodamia 13-punctata) was recently observed at the head, the first sighting in the UK since 1952.|$|E
5|$|Later {{research}} {{has managed to}} create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and <b>ladybird</b> shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations). Richard Prum's activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables {{to account for the}} observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array of dots. More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl Numida meleagris in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.|$|E
5|$|The elytra allow beetles to both fly {{and move}} through {{confined}} spaces, doing so by folding the delicate wings under the elytra while not flying, and folding their wings out just before take off. The unfolding and folding of the wings is operated by muscles {{attached to the}} wing base; {{as long as the}} tension on the radial and cubital veins remains, the wings remain straight. In some day-flying species (for example, Buprestidae, Scarabaeidae), flight does not include large amounts of lifting of the elytra, having the metathorac wings extended under the lateral elytra margins. The altitude reached by beetles in flight varies. One study investigating the flight altitude of the <b>ladybird</b> species Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis using radar showed that, whilst the majority in flight over a single location were at 150–195m above ground level, some reached altitudes of over 1100m.|$|E

5|$|Unpalatability, broadly understood, can {{be created}} {{in a variety of}} ways. Some insects such as the <b>ladybird</b> or tiger moth contain bitter-tasting chemicals, while the skunk {{produces}} a noxious odour, and the poison glands of the poison dart frog, the sting of a velvet ant or neurotoxin in a black widow spider make them dangerous or painful to attack. Tiger moths advertise their unpalatability by either producing ultrasonic noises which warn bats to avoid them, or by warning postures which expose brightly coloured body parts (see Unkenreflex), or exposing eyespots. Velvet ants (actually parasitic wasps) such as Dasymutilla occidentalis both have bright colours and produce audible noises when grabbed (via stridulation), which serve to reinforce the warning. Among mammals, predators can be dissuaded when a smaller animal is aggressive and able to defend itself, as for example in honey badgers.|$|E

25|$|This {{species is}} widely {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the world’s most invasive insects, partly due to their tendency to overwinter indoors and the unpleasant odor and stain left by their bodily fluid when frightened or squashed, as well as their tendency to bite humans. In Europe it is currently increasing to the detriment of indigenous species, its voracious appetite enabling it to outcompete and even eat other ladybirds. The harlequin <b>ladybird</b> is also highly resistant to diseases that affect other <b>ladybird</b> species, and carries a microsporidian parasite to which it is immune, but that can infect and kill other species. Native <b>ladybird</b> species have experienced often dramatic declines in abundance in areas invaded by H. axyridis.|$|E

In {{particular}} the arrival of the Harlequin Harmonia axyridis (new to Britain in 2004), seen as a major threat to native <b>ladybirds,</b> prompted the development of two on-line recording schemes (www. ladybird-survey. org and www. harlequin-survey. org). The response to the surveys has been fantastic; we have received over 70, 000 records in the last three years.
