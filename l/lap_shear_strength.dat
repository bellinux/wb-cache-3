Due to the advantages over other joining techniques, self-piercing riveting (SPR) is a main joining technique for aluminium structures. In this paper, the effect of setting velocity/force on the joint quality and performance was studied. It was found that in the range studied, the increase of setting velocity increased the static <b>lap</b> <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> but reduced the static T peel strength of the SPR joints. The results also suggested that the setting velocity did not have significant influence on the lap shear fatigue strength, but the T peel fatigue strength of the joints was increasing {{with the increase of}} setting velocity until it reached certain value. An increase in the setting velocity led to a decrease in the rivet head height and an increase in the interlock.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{fuel efficiency}} and reduce emission, aluminium alloys have been increasingly used in automotive body-in-white structures for lightweighting. Due to its advantages {{over some of}} the more traditional joining technologies, self-piercing riveting (SPR) has been widely used for these lightweight structures. Research has showed that friction is a very important factor that influences both the riveting process and joint strength for SPR, but these influences have not been fully understood. In this paper, an innovative method was used to modify the local surface of the top sheet around the rivet piercing location with different impression tools (the central pin, the small ring, the medium ring and the large ring) and garnet particles to study the influence of local frictions on rivet inserting process, joint features and static <b>lap</b> <b>shear</b> <b>strength.</b> The results showed that the local surface textures on the aluminium sheet did not have significant influence on the rivet inserting process based on displacement-force curve analysis. The local surface textures could slightly change the joint features, especially the rivet head height, but overall this influence was not significant. The lap shear tests showed that ring impressions with garnet particles and central pin impressions on the bottom surface of the top sheet increased the static <b>lap</b> <b>shear</b> <b>strength</b> of the SPR joints.
