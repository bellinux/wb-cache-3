40|$|Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic {{heart disease}} (RHD) are auto-immune {{conditions}} resulting from infection with group A streptococcus. Current management of these conditions includes secondary antibiotic prevention. This comprises regular 3 to 4 weekly <b>long-acting</b> intramuscular benzathine <b>penicillin</b> injections. Secondary antibiotic prevention aims to protect individuals against reinfection with group A streptococcus, thereby preventing recurrent ARF {{and the risk of}} further damage to the heart valves. However, the uptake of benzathine penicillin can be poor leaving patients at risk of avoidable and progressive heart damage. This review utilizes the Chronic Care Model as a framework to discuss initiatives to enhance the delivery of secondary antibiotic prophylaxis for ARF and RHD. Results from the search strategy utilized revealed that there is limited pertinent published evidence. The evidence that is available suggests that register/recall systems, dedicated health teams for delivery of secondary antibiotic prophylaxis, education about ARF and RHD, linkages with the community (particularly between health services and schools) and strong staff-patient relationships may be important. However, it is difficult to generalize findings from individual studies to other settings and high quality studies are lacking. While secondary antibiotic prophylaxis is an effective treatment for those with ARF or RHD, the difficulties in implementing effective programs that reduce the burden of ARF and RHD demonstrates the importance of on-going work in developing and evaluating research translation initiatives...|$|R
40|$|Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic {{heart disease}} (RHD) are auto-immune {{conditions}} associated with prior exposure to Group A streptococcus (GAS). ARF is an acute condition associated with fever and joint, brain, skin and heart inflammation. RHD is its chronic sequela and is characterised by permanent heart valve damage which can, in turn, lead to heart failure and {{an increased risk of}} endocarditis and stroke. To avoid such complications interventions may be required to repair or replace damaged valves. ARF and RHD are preventable diseases rarely encountered in mainstream Australia. However, Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples have amongst the highest reported rates of ARF/RHD in the world with significant morbidity and mortality. This thesis comprises complementary projects and articles that can inform the community and health service response to prevention, diagnosis and management of ARF/RHD with a particular focus on Indigenous Australians. Prevention: Three systematic reviews are presented that examine strategies to improve primary and secondary prevention of ARF/RHD. High quality studies are often lacking and much of the evidence informing strategies to prevent ARF/RHD is limited or absent. Available evidence indicates primordial prevention via improvements in social, economic and environmental conditions is key. While primary prevention may be achieved through improved diagnosis and early treatment of GAS pharyngitis, implementation can be difficult and research into the development of a GAS vaccine remains crucial. Effective secondary prevention of ARF/RHD is possible with <b>long-acting</b> benzathine <b>penicillin</b> (LAB). Nonetheless, delivery of LAB is highly variable and frequently poor. Further work is needed to enhance health care systems to maximize uptake of LAB and to identify more effective formulations or delivery devices for administration. Diagnosis: The utility of screening for RHD via echocardiography (heart ultrasound) to detect early disease is topical as this may facilitate early administration of secondary prophylaxis thereby limiting disease progression. A review of the feasibility of implementing RHD screening in Australia is presented and a number of limiting factors are highlighted. These include a lack of an agreed case definition and a limited understanding of the significance, natural history and potential treatment of early and subclinical RHD. Further, the delivery of secondary prevention is often suboptimal and the impact of additional cases on health services, and the psychosocial health of patients and families, can be substantial. The refinement of a screening-based case definition for RHD, and particularly the significance of minor heart valve abnormalities, was informed by the Rheumatic Fever Follow-up Study (RhFFUS). Children with prior Borderline RHD (defined under World Heart Federation (WHF) criteria) were up to nine times more likely to experience ARF compared with children with a normal echocardiogram. Their risk of having progressive valve damage was also significantly greater and 1 in 6 developed Definite RHD. In contrast, children with less severe valve abnormalities not satisfying criteria for Borderline RHD were at no greater risk of ARF or echocardiographic progression of valvular lesions. These results provide cogent evidence that, in some children, valvular changes consistent with Borderline RHD detected on screening echocardiograms represent the earliest stage of Definite RHD. Such children may benefit from secondary prophylaxis or enhanced surveillance through regular echocardiographic monitoring to assess for progression of disease. Moreover, these results lend support to the validity of WHF criteria that distinguish Borderline RHD from other minor echocardiographic changes, as {{it is only in the}} former group that there is a greater risk of ARF and valvular lesion progression. Nonetheless, the fact that individuals with minor echocardiographic changes not satisfying criteria for Borderline RHD still had an increased risk of developing Definite RHD suggests that such individuals should be initially monitored with echocardiography to ensure they do not progress. Management: The final component of this thesis comprises two papers that describe projects that were undertaken to inform potential improvements in the management of ARF/RHD. The first compared the quality of care provided to patients in the Kimberley and far north Queensland where differing models of care were operating. This highlighted more severe disease in the Kimberley and greater specialist follow-up and prescription and receipt of secondary prophylaxis in far north Queensland. This supported an association between far north Queensland's single-provider model of care and centralised RHD control programme and improved patient care, potentially fewer cases of severe disease, and reduced need for surgical and other interventions. Since this study was completed, a centralized RHD control and management programme has been implemented in the Kimberley. The second project related to the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent bacteremia, and potentially infective endocarditis (IE), in patients with RHD undergoing high-risk procedures. While this is recommended for Indigenous patients with RHD under Australian guidelines, American guidelines were recently amended to recommend prophylaxis only in people with prosthetic valves and not in those with "native-valve" RHD. A review of infective endocarditis cases in northern Australia was undertaken to determine whether native valve RHD was associated with an increased risk of IE. Results of this study showed that those with native valve RHD were at increased risk of IE (RR 58) compared to individuals without native valve RHD. Interestingly, the risk of IE in non-Indigenous patients with RHD was found to be 3. 7 times higher than in Indigenous Australians with RHD. This study led to recommendations to broaden current Australian guidelines so as to offer prophylactic antibiotics to all persons with RHD undergoing procedures associated with a high risk of bacteraemia. In conclusion, this thesis provides a number of new insights to address existing knowledge gaps regarding prevention, diagnosis and management of ARF/RHD. It is hoped that continued work on developing a GAS vaccine will eventually deliver an effective and safe method of primary prevention. In the interim the continued focus on early and accurate diagnosis of ARF/RHD and best-practice management (particularly improving uptake of secondary prophylaxis) should be pursued. Overarching these health initiatives must be a commitment to improving the socioeconomic and environmental status of Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples living in remote communities as a means of effecting ARF/RHD primordial prevention...|$|R

40|$|A 36 -year-old man {{was seen}} at the {{outpatient}} clinic after referral by his general practitioner to exclude underlying perianal abscess since the patient was complaining about mushy stools mixed with blood and mucus during the last four days. At the same time, he mainly suffered from a perianal discomfort, abdominal pain and a fever (38. 9 degrees Celsius). He had no prior important medical history. Familial history revealed a sister with severe Crohn’s disease. Further systemic history didn’t reveal any important issues. A physical examination showed a mild abdominal tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Anal inspection {{showed no signs of}} an abscess or fistula. Adenopathies could not be clinically discovered. Laboratory analyses demonstrated a normal white blood cell count (8. 69 x 10 * 9 /l) with a normal differentiation, but an elevated C-reactive protein level (40 mg/l [0. 0 – 5. 0]) was seen. The remainder of the blood analysis was satisfying. We performed a stool analysis that could not identify any pathogens. Analysis of fecal calprotectin turned out to be highly positive (814 microgram / g feces, whereas a normal range is below 50). The patient was admitted the same day in the hospital for a semi-urgent diagnostic work-up. We performed a magnetic resonance imaging of the lower abdomen and pelvis for the purpose of excluding hidden abscesses and fistulae, also because this was the reason of patient referral by the general practitioner since the patient had a sister with severe Crohn’s disease with perianal manifestations. The images showed an edematous rectal abdominal wall with inflammatory infiltration of the mesorectal adipose tissue and the presence of enlarged lymphatic nodules. An ileocolonoscopy was performed the day after. There was a normal appearing mucosa of the terminal ileum and colon, except for the inspection of the rectal mucosa, which showed multiple atypical mucosal ulcerations with adjacent edematous mucosa. Multiple biopsies were taken as well of the ileum, the colon as the rectum. The anatomopathological findings of the terminal ileum and colon were normal. Those of the rectum showed a mild chronic inflammatory reaction suggestive of an infectious colitis with also an excess of plasma cells in the inflammatory infiltrate. There was no evidence for underlying inflammatory bowel disease. Taking into account that the rectal ulcers had atypical characteristics, we asked for sexual behavior. Because the patient admitted having unprotected anal intercourse, we performed testing for sexually transmitted disease (STD). The analyses of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae on a rectal swab and on an urine sample (to exclude urethritis as a co-infection) were negative. We also performed a more general diagnostic work-up for other STD by screening for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV by serologic tests. These results turned out to be negative. Laboratory analyses demonstrated a positive Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) (index 15. 8, positive when > 1. 1) and a positive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL). We established the diagnosis of an early primary syphilis infection of the anorectum, also described as a syphilitic proctitis, and treated the patient and his sexual partner with one intramuscular injection of 2. 4 million units of benzathine penicillin G. An endoscopic reassessment was performed six weeks after initiation of the treatment. This showed a proper endoscopic healing with remaining small stellate scars. Control of serologic tests after treatment showed a negativation of the VDRL test while the TPHA test remained positive. Rectal ulcerations are an uncommon presentation of a primary syphilis infection or primary syphilitic proctitis. It is difficult to diagnose because of its often asymptomatic or atypical clinical presentation. It is important to consider sexually transmitted diseases in all patients presenting with rectal symptoms.

When treatment of the acute disease was initiated before jaundice occurred, suitable single doses of streptomycin, chlortetracycline, tetracycline, erythromycin, oxytetracycline and oxytetracycline (in oil) prevented death and chronic renal infection in {{a high percentage of}} mice. Bicillin, a <b>long-acting</b> <b>penicillin</b> preparation, was more effective than other penicillins, but it prevented the development of chronic renal infection in only half the treated mice.

40|$|Background. Syphilis {{remains an}} {{important}} source of morbidity worldwide. <b>Long-acting</b> <b>penicillin</b> is the only therapy currently recommended for syphilis in much of the world. Because of hesitation to use penicillin for fear of anaphylaxis, {{there is a need for}} an effective, well-tolerated alternative to penicillin for syphilis therapy. Methods. This multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted in clinics for the treatment of persons with sexually transmitted diseases. We compared serological cure rates for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) – negative persons with early syphilis treated with azithromycin at a dosage of 2. 0 g administered orally as a single dose with cure rates for those treated with benzathine penicillin G at a dosage of 2. 4 million units administered intramuscularly. Results. A total of 517 participants were enrolled in the trial. In the intention-to-treat analysis, after 6 months of follow-up, serological cure was observed in 180 (77. 6 %) of 232 azithromycin recipients and 186 (78. 5 %) of 237 penicillin recipients (1 -sided lower bound 95 % confidence interval, 7. 2 %). Nonserious adverse events were more common among azithromycin recipients than they were among penicillin recipients (61. 5 % vs 46. 3 %), and such adverse events were accounted for, in large part, by self-limited gastrointestinal complaints. Conclusions. In this trial, the efficacy of azithromycin at a dosage of 2. 0 g administered orally was equivalent to that of benzathine penicillin G for the treatment of early syphilis in persons without HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the last}} century some sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STI), which had been held to be almost extinct, have seen an unexpected resurgence. They mainly present as urethritis, genital ulcers or genital warts and must always be diagnosed and treated so as to prevent further transmission. The main causes of urethritis are gonorrhea and chlamydia, the latter can also cause only minor symptoms. The pathogen should always be diagnosed with direct microscopy of a urethral smear as well as culture or PCR. Antibiotic treatment is usually straightforward. Genital ulcer disease can be caused by a wide spectrum of bacteria and viruses as well as non-infectious causes. It is significant as it can facilitate the transmission of HIV. The most frequent cause is herpes simplex virus which usually presents itself with painful ulcers and a recurrent course. Syphilis occurs in different clinical stages. The first stage is usually a painless ulcer, it can be difficult to diagnose and is often missed. In the second stage, characterised by a rash and a variety of classical symptoms such as condylomata lata, the diagnosis can be made with various serologic tests. <b>Long-acting</b> <b>penicillin</b> remains the treatment of choice.

40|$|Background: Recent {{evidence}} {{suggest that}} group A ß-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection {{may increase the}} risk of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders (PANDAS) composed of the clinical signs of obsessive-compulsive and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the titer of antibodies against GABHS between children with PANDS and the controls. Methods : This cross-sectional, case-control study was done in Hazrat Rasoul Hospital, in Tehran, Iran during 2008 - 2010. We compared serum antibodies streptolysin O, deoxyribonuclease B, and streptokinase against GABHS quantitatively in 79 cases with PANDAS and 39 age-matched controls. The area under ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of tests were calculated. Results : Most cases were studied in summer (57 %) and spring (23 %). The three aforesaid antibodies were higher in the cases (P= 0. 001). Antisterptolysin O (cut-off point 195) had a 90 % sensitivity, 82 % specificity and a 92 % PPV, (CI= 95 %, 0. 99 - 0. 91). Anti streptokinase (cut-off point 223) had an 82 % sensitivity, 82 % specificity and a 95 % PPV, (CI= 95 %, 0. 934 - 0. 735).
