5|$|Doctors {{were the}} first to deal with the toll that AIDS would take in the United States. Some—like Marcus Conant, James Curran, Arye Rubenstein, Michael S. Gottlieb, and Mathilde Krim—would also realize their {{professional}} life's courses in dealing with patient after patient who showed up in their offices with baffling illnesses, most notably <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's Sarcoma, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidia, and other opportunistic infections that caused death by a grisly combination of ailments overtaxing a compromised immune system. With no information on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} {{are followed by}} a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV. Without treatment, this second stage of {{the natural history of}} HIV infection can last from about three years to over 20years (on average, about eight years). While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains. Between 50 and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over three to six months.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lymphadenopathy</b> {{refers to}} one or more {{enlarged}} lymph nodes. Small groups or individually enlarged lymph nodes are generally reactive in response to infection or inflammation. This is called local <b>lymphadenopathy.</b> When many lymph nodes in different areas of the body are involved, this is called generalised <b>lymphadenopathy.</b> Generalised <b>lymphadenopathy</b> may be caused by infections such as infectious mononucleosis, tuberculosis and HIV, connective tissue diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers, including both cancers of tissue within lymph nodes, discussed below, and metastasis of cancerous cells {{from other parts of the}} body, that have arrived via the lymphatic system.|$|E

30|$|In {{esophageal cancer}} {{patients}} with suspected <b>lymphadenopathies</b> from sarcoidosis or sarcoid-like reactions, monitoring {{the response to}} chemotherapy via FDG-PET/CT {{may be helpful to}} diagnose whether the <b>lymphadenopathies</b> are benign or metastatic. However, this method may not be applicable when the esophageal cancer does not respond to chemotherapy/chemoradiotherapy. Nevertheless, 84 % of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma demonstrate good responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy on FDG-PET/CT.|$|R

40|$|Hodgkin's {{lymphoma}} is {{the most}} common pediatric head and neck malignancy, often presenting as cervical <b>lymphadenopathies.</b> Here, we report a case of a 12 -year-old boy with a right painless neck mass for 2 weeks. Sonographic examination revealed ill-defined confluent <b>lymphadenopathies</b> over the right neck. We then applied ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on the cervical mass under local anesthesia and achieved the final diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma, thus preventing the risks of open excisional biopsy...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{sensitivity}} of lymph node excisional biopsy requires validation. Power Doppler ultrasound (US) helps predict the malignant status of <b>lymphadenopathies.</b> We used power Doppler US to select for biopsy the lymph node most suspected of malignancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-two patients having <b>lymphadenopathies</b> with clinical suspicion of lymphoma {{were divided into}} two well-matched groups and randomly assigned to undergo either standard or power Doppler US-directed lymph node excisional biopsy. RESULTS: Histology showed a malignancy in 64...|$|R
40|$|Lymph nodal {{involvement}} {{is an important}} clinical-pathological sign in primary cutaneous lymphoma (PCL), as it marks the transformation/evolution of the disease from localized to systemic; therefore the surveillance of lymph nodes {{is important in the}} staging and follow up of PCL. Fine needle cytology (FNC) is widely used in the diagnosis of <b>lymphadenopathies</b> but has rarely been reported in PCL staging and follow-up. In this study an experience on reactive and neoplastic <b>lymphadenopathies</b> arisen in PCL and investigated by FNC, combined to ancillary techniques, is reported...|$|R
25|$|Primidone {{is one of}} the {{anticonvulsants}} {{associated with}} anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome, others being carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. This syndrome consists of fever, rash, peripheral leukocytosis, <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> and occasionally hepatic necrosis.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{stage of}} the disease, {{occurring}} most often {{in the spring and}} summer, begins one to three weeks after infection and lasts for two to four weeks. Clinical signs include a fever, petechiae, bleeding disorders, vasculitis, <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> discharge from the nose and eyes, and edema of the legs and scrotum. There are no outward signs of the subclinical phase. Clinical signs of the chronic phase include weight loss, pale gums due to anemia, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> dyspnea, coughing, polyuria, polydipsia, lameness, ophthalmic diseases such as retinal hemorrhage and anterior uveitis, and neurological disease. Dogs that are severely affected can die from this disease.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{cases have}} been {{associated}} with acute fever, myalgias, bronchospasm, pruritic rashes, <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> subcutaneous nodules associated with eosinophilia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated creatinine kinase levels. Symptoms may last as long as five years. Segmental necrotizing enteritis has been reported on one occasion.|$|E
40|$|Oncocytic carcinomas of {{the nasal}} cavity are {{extremely}} rare. We report 1 patient whose primary tumor and neck <b>lymphadenopathies</b> were under control nearly 2 years after combined surgery and radiotherapy. An 80 -year-old man {{with a history of}} nasal oncocytoma had received excision twice previously. Computed tomography demonstrated locally advanced recurrent tumor invading the paranasal sinuses and orbit with <b>lymphadenopathies</b> in the right neck. Skull base surgery was performed. Pathological examination revealed oncocytic carcinoma. Positron emission tomography showed hypermetabolic lesions in the surgical bed and right neck. The patient subsequently received intensity-modulated radiotherapy to the primary site and the whole neck. Follow-up computed tomography 4 months later showed marked shrinkage of the neck <b>lymphadenopathies.</b> There was no progression after nearly 2 years. Although these tumors have historically been regarded as radioresistant, the combined treatment of surgery followed by radiotherapy may offer the best chance for control of locally advanced disease...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Bartonella henselae {{infections are}} among the most common causes of fever and <b>lymphadenopathies,</b> but can lead to severe {{complications}} in immunocompromised hosts; early recognition of these infections is of paramount importance in immunocompromised patients. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of a renal transplant recipient who presented with fever, <b>lymphadenopathies,</b> and a splenic abscess secondary to Bartonella henselae infection, successfully treated with doxycycline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: We discuss the various clinical presentations of Bartonella henselae infections in immunocompromised patients and the available diagnostic tools for this potentially severe complication...|$|R
50|$|In {{lymph node}} biopsies, the typical histopathologic pattern is {{characterized}} by geographic areas of necrosis with neutrophils and necrotizing granulomas. The pattern is non specific and similar to other infectious <b>lymphadenopathies.</b>|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} common signs of CMML is splenomegaly, found in {{approximately}} half of cases. Other less frequent signs and symptoms consist of anaemia, fever, weight loss, night sweats, infection, bleeding, synovitis, <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> skin rashes, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and peritoneal effusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{usually is}} made serologically (through complement fixation) and by exclusion of other causes of inguinal <b>lymphadenopathy</b> or genital ulcers. Serologic testing has a sensitivity of 80% after 2 weeks. Serologic testing {{may not be}} specific for serotype (has some cross reactivity with other chlamydia species) and can suggest LGV from other forms because of their difference in dilution, 1:64 {{more likely to be}} LGV and lower than 1:16 is likely to be other chlamydia forms (emedicine).|$|E
25|$|CT scans may {{more rarely}} reveal mosaic-appearance attenuation, centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud opacities and pleuropulmonary {{fibrosis}} (a finding consistent with CPA, a disease with ABPA as a known precursor). Rarely other manifestations {{can be seen}} on CT scans, including military nodular opacities, perihilar opacities (that mimic hilar <b>lymphadenopathy),</b> pleural effusions and pulmonary masses. Cavitation and aspergilloma are rarer findings, not exceeding 20% of patients, and likely represent a shift from ABPA to CPA if accompanied by pleural thickening or fibrocavitary disease.|$|E
30|$|Sarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} inflammatory disease {{of an unknown}} cause that {{is characterized by the}} widespread development of non-caseating granulomas in more than one organ system, frequently hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes [6]. Sarcoid-like reactions are also observed as epithelioid cell granulomas of the lymph nodes due to a malignancy [6 – 11]. Although the coexistence of these <b>lymphadenopathies</b> with esophageal cancer is relatively uncommon, the ability to differentiate these cases from lymph node metastasis is crucial. Moreover, clinical staging based on an accurate diagnosis of these <b>lymphadenopathies</b> is important for selecting the most appropriate treatment.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, the {{improved}} assessment of mural thickening features, perivisceral changes, and <b>lymphadenopathies</b> with WE-MDCT may prove helpful to distinguish AD from other inflammatory, ischaemic, or neoplastic conditions {{that may affect}} the colon [20, 22, 23].|$|R
30|$|In {{patients}} with esophageal cancer, differentiation between lymph node metastasis and <b>lymphadenopathies</b> from sarcoidosis or sarcoid-like reactions of lymph nodes is clinically important. Herein, we report two esophageal cancer cases with {{lymph node involvement}} of sarcoid-like reaction or sarcoidosis.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{symptoms}} {{may include}} inflammatory {{involvement of the}} perirectal or perianal lymphatic tissues. In females, cervicitis, perimetritis, or salpingitis may occur as well as lymphangitis and lymphadenitis in deeper nodes. Because of lymphatic drainage pathways, some patients develop an abdominal mass which seldom suppurates, and 20–30% develop inguinal <b>lymphadenopathy.</b> Systemic signs which can appear include fever, decreased appetite, and malaise. Diagnosis is more difficult in {{women and men who}} have sex with men (MSM) who may not have the inguinal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Rubella has {{symptoms}} {{that are similar}} to those of flu. However, the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days (that is why it is often referred to as three-day measles). The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical <b>lymphadenopathy),</b> joint pains, headache, and conjunctivitis.|$|E
25|$|Hyperammonemic {{encephalopathy}} {{was reported}} by Katano Hiroyuki of the Nagoya City Higashi General Hospital in early 2002 in a patient who had been stable on primidone monotherapy for five years before undergoing surgery for astrocytoma, a type of brain tumor. Additionally, her phenobarbital levels were inexplicably elevated post-surgery. This is much more common with the valproates than {{with any of the}} barbiturates. A randomized controlled trial whose results were published in the July 1985 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine found that primidone was more likely to cause impotence than phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital. Like phenytoin, primidone is rarely associated with <b>lymphadenopathy.</b> Primidone can also cause vomiting; this happens in 1.0–0.1% of users.|$|E
30|$|In {{an earlier}} {{retrospective}} study, Frager et al. [5] demonstrated extra-spinal pathology at lumbar CT examinations in 22 (1.45  %) out of 1, 517 patients. IF included retro-peritoneal tumours and <b>lymphadenopathies</b> {{as well as}} vascular, urinary tract and gynaecological abnormalities.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundLymphadenopathies are {{the most}} common form ofextrapulmonary {{tuberculosis}} and tuberculous lymphadenitisis {{the most common cause of}} peripheral lymphadenopathyin a developing country like Nepal. The objective of thisstudy is to compare the findings of fine needle aspirationcytology to histopathology in diagnosing cervicallymphadenopathies. MethodThis is a prospective, longitudinal, comparative study wasperformed in the Department of ENT and Head and NeckSurgery, TU Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu between August 2007 and January 2009. Patients 13 years of age or olderwere included. There were 55 patients with cervicallymphadenopathies subjected to both fine needle aspirationcytology (FNAC) and histopathology (HPE). The sensitivity,specificity, false positive, false negative, positive predictivevalue and negative predictive value were calculated. ResultsOf 55 patients, 48 patients had <b>lymphadenopathies</b> ofinfective origin while 7 patients had metastatic disease. Majority of patients (n= 20) were in age group 23 - 32 yearsand males outnumbered females. The sensitivity, specificity,false positive, false negative, positive predictive value andnegative predictive value of FNAC of <b>lymphadenopathies</b> todiagnose tubercular <b>lymphadenopathies</b> were 80. 0 %, 100. 0 %, 0. 0 %, 20. 0 %, 100. 0 % and 82. 14 % respectively. Similarly, sensitivity, specificity of FNAC oflymphadenopathies to differentiate benign and malignantlesion were 100 % each. False positive, false negative,positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 0. 0 %, 0. 0 %, 100. 0 % and 100. 0 % respectively. Overallcorrelation of FNAC and HPE was 90. 9 %. ConclusionFNAC can distinguish tubercular lymphadenitis fromreactive and granulomatous lymphadenitis in majority ofcases. Similarly, it can distinguish well between benign andmalignant <b>lymphadenopathies.</b> It can be used as an initialinvestigation for routine screening of cervicallymphadenopathies where facilities of histopathology arenot available...|$|R

25|$|The {{symptoms}} of diphtheria usually begin two {{to seven days}} after infection. Symptoms of diphtheria include fever of 38°C (100.4°F) or above, chills, fatigue, bluish skin coloration (cyanosis), sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, foul-smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge, and <b>lymphadenopathy.</b> Within two to three days, diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system. The dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose. This thick gray coating is called a “pseudomembrane.” It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, voice box, and throat, making {{it very hard to}} breathe and swallow. Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} stage most often occurs 10–30 days later, but can present {{up to six}} months later. The infection spreads to the lymph nodes through lymphatic drainage pathways. The most frequent presenting clinical manifestation of LGV among males whose primary exposure was genital is unilateral (in 2/3 of cases) lymphadenitis and lymphangitis, often with tender inguinal and/or femoral <b>lymphadenopathy</b> because of the drainage pathway for their likely infected areas. Lymphangitis of the dorsal penis may also occur and resembles a string or cord. If the route was anal sex the infected person may experience lymphadenitis and lymphangitis noted above. They may instead develop proctitis, inflammation limited to the rectum (the distal 10–12cm) that may be associated with anorectal pain, tenesmus, and rectal discharge, or proctocolitis, inflammation of the colonic mucosa extending to 12cm above the anus and associated with symptoms of proctitis plus diarrhea or abdominal cramps.|$|E
25|$|Many low-grade lymphomas remain {{indolent}} {{for many}} years. Treatment of the nonsymptomatic patient is often avoided. In {{these forms of}} lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma, watchful waiting is often the initial course of action. This is carried out because the harms and risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. If a low-grade lymphoma is becoming symptomatic, radiotherapy or chemotherapy are the treatments of choice; although they do not cure the lymphoma, they can alleviate the symptoms, particularly painful <b>lymphadenopathy.</b> Patients with these types of lymphoma can live near-normal lifespans, but the disease is incurable. Some centers advocate the use of single agent rituximab {{in the treatment of}} follicular lymphoma rather than the wait and watch approach. Watchful waiting is not a good strategy for all patients, as it leads to significant distress and anxiety in some patients. It has been equated with watch and worry.|$|E
40|$|Chronic/recurrent {{behaviour}} may be {{encountered in}} some distinct atypical or malignant lymphoproliferations, while recurrences are not generally observed in reactive/benign <b>lymphadenopathies.</b> We retrospectively anal- ysed a consecutive series of 486 human immunodeﬁciency virus-negative adults, who underwent lymphadenectomy. Neoplastic and benign/reactive histopathological pictures were documented in 299 (61 5...|$|R
40|$|Summary Morphological and morphometric data {{showing a}} higher number of mast cells (MCs) in the stroma of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL) than in benign <b>lymphadenopathies</b> are {{presented}} {{in support of the}} suggestion that angiogenesis during the progression of B-NHL may be partly mediated by angiogenic factors in their secretory granules...|$|R
30|$|In {{the first}} {{postoperative}} period CT may show {{a series of}} findings that {{should be regarded as}} “normal” physiological temporary consequences of surgery. Among these, the most common are pneumobilia, perivascular cuffing, fluid collections, <b>lymphadenopathies,</b> acute anastomotic oedema, peripancreatic fat stranding and presence of stents and free air [2, 4, 6, 16].|$|R
