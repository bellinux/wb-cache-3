5|$|The {{calculations}} that {{purported to}} show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.|$|E

25|$|Grasp has {{heavy lift}} system that {{consists}} of large bow and stern rollers, deck machinery, and tackle. The rollers serve as low-friction fairlead for the wire rope or chain used for the lift. The tackle and deck machinery provide up to 75 tons of hauling for each lift. The two bow rollers can be used together with linear hydraulic pullers to achieve a dynamic <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> 150 tons. The stern rollers {{can be used with}} the automatic towing machine to provide a dynamic <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> 150 tons.

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> {{representations}} between the N-fold metaplectic covers of SL(n, F) where n|N and PGL(n, F), F a local field, and obtain a formula relating irreducible characters of PGL(n, F) and SL~(n, F) (the covers of SL(n, F)). This {{is achieved by}} generalizing the approach of Adams [1]. In {{the second part of}} the thesis we study the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> functions between SL~(n, F) and PGL(n, F). Using orbital integrals we obtain the formula for the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> characters as a dual to the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> functions. This is based on the methods of Flicker and Kazhdan [7]. Finally we use our methods <b>of</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> orbital integrals to provide alternate proof of a well-known fact about p-adic fields (under certain restrictions). We show that for a Galois extension E/F, F*/N(E*) isomorphic Gal(E/F) ab where Gal(E/F) is the Galois group of E over F and Gal(E/F) ab denotes its abelianization and N: E* to F* is the norm map...|$|R

25|$|Leading edge {{extensions}} {{and body}} lift are incorporated to enhance {{performance in a}} canard layout. This combination is said by the designer to generate 1.2 times the <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> an ordinary canard delta, and 1.8 times more lift than an equivalent sized pure delta configuration. The designer claims such a combination allows {{the use of a}} smaller wing, reducing supersonic drag without compromising transonic lift-to-drag characteristics that are crucial to the aircraft's turn performance.|$|E

The Treaty of Lübeck, which ended the hostilities between the Danish king and the emperor in May, likewise {{did not result in}} a relief or a <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> the occupation, even though the capitulation of Franzburg had been justified with the emperor's right to recruit military support from his subjects to their own and the empire's protection.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time in 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), mostly made up of {{diasporic}} Tutsi in Uganda, advanced to Rwanda. It had experience in organized irregular warfare from the Ugandan Bush War, and got much support from the government of Uganda. The initial RPF advance was halted by the <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> French arms to the Rwandan government. Attempts at peace culminated in the Arusha Accords.

25|$|Mignet {{made the}} {{aircraft}} intentionally simple. The Flying Flea {{is essentially a}} highly staggered biplane, which almost could {{be considered to be}} a tandem wing aircraft, built of wood and fabric. The original design was a single-seater, and had two-axis flying controls. The aircraft had a standard control stick. Fore-and-aft movement controlled the front wing's angle of attack, increasing and decreasing the <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> the wing. Because the front wing was located forward of the center of gravity, that would pitch the nose up and down.|$|E
25|$|The rear COW gun {{mounting}} {{was installed}} immediately aft of the wing, in a fixed mount that only {{allowed for a}} limited adjustment of the angle. A special sight for this gun was installed in the pilot's cockpit. This armament would be aimed by the pilot from a position below the aircraft attacked, {{in the manner of}} the Schräge Musik installation used by the Germans during WWII. However, the concept was based on the theory of no allowance sighting, which sought to install the gun at an angle at which the body <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> the projectile, due to the forward motion of the aircraft, would compensate for the effect of gravity, straightening the trajectory. The first firing trials resulted in several broken wing ribs, and a special rubber-spring shield was developed to protect the upper wing.|$|E
25|$|Two {{designs were}} {{considered}} for Tobruk, with a modified Sir- or Round Table-class landing ship logistics, in {{use with the}} Royal Fleet Auxiliary at the time, selected for construction. Tobruk design was based on RFA Sir Bedivere, {{the second of the}} class, which had been modified following the Royal Fleet Auxiliary's experience with operating the class' lead ship, RFA Sir Lancelot. The ship is designed as a multi-purpose, roll-on/roll-off heavy lift and transport vessel. The Australian modifications to the design were kept to a minimum to simplify construction; the most significant changes were to improve the ship's ability to operate both large and multiple helicopters, fitting an operations room, and adding a derrick with a <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> 70 tonnes. Most of the other changes related to bringing accommodation conditions into line with Australian requirements. Like the other ships of the Round Table class, Tobruk was built to commercial rather than military standards, and is unable to sustain as much damage as warships.|$|E
