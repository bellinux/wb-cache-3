500|$|The wooden {{track is}} {{approximately}} [...] {{in length and}} {{the height of the}} lift is approximately [...] El Toro is very different from a traditional wooden roller coaster because it uses prefabricated wooden track. It was built and designed by Intamin but they also worked with members of Rocky Mountain Construction to build the ride. Instead of carpenters cutting, shaping, and laying down the track on site by hand, the track is <b>laser</b> <b>cut</b> in a factory. This means that the track is manufactured to a higher degree of precision than could be achieved by hand. The [...] "Plug and Play" [...] aspect of the coaster speeds construction of the coaster since track {{does not have to be}} completely manufactured on site. [...] In addition, because of the speed of construction, the costs of building the coaster are lowered due to fewer man-hours spent on the construction. [...] The riders are subject to a coaster that is as smooth as steel. El Toro is the first Intamin [...] "Plug and Play" [...] wooden roller coaster in the United States and one of four in the world. The other three are Colossos at Heide Park in Germany, Balder at Liseberg in Sweden, and T Express at Everland in South Korea.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{calculation}} of the process temperatures in fusion cutting was carried out based on the power balance approach. Cutting experiments with CO 2 and disk lasers were performed on 1, 5 and 8 mm thick cold work tool steel sheets. The experimental, numerical and analytical evaluation of the single terms of the power balance equation allowed the explanation of the observed cut quality differences between disk and CO 2 <b>laser</b> <b>cuts.</b> Lower process temperatures calculated by a power balance equation for disk <b>laser</b> <b>cuts</b> lead to the increase of viscosity of molten material. The subsequent increase in difficulty for ejection of the molten material from the cut kerf explains the worse cut quality if compared with CO 2 <b>laser</b> <b>cuts.</b> Experimental evidence and theoretical calculations showed that the additional physical mechanisms like plasma formation {{should be considered in}} the overall power balance under particular cutting conditions...|$|R

40|$|Experimental, {{numerical}} {{and analytical}} investigations {{were performed to}} give a possible explanation {{of the differences in}} cutting quality detected for inert gas laser beam cutting process performed with disk and CO 2 <b>laser</b> sources. <b>Cutting</b> experiments were carried out at maximum cutting speed on cold work steel test specimens with different sheet thicknesses. The particular feature of the applied experimental setup was the similar geometry of both the CO 2 and the disk laser beam with comparable values of the focus diameter and the Rayleigh length. The thermodynamic analysis was based on experimentally primary losses evaluation by means of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) blocks, on numerical computation of conductive power losses and analytical calculation of the remaining terms of energy ba lance. Energy balance allowed the evaluation of secondary losses and proportion of vaporized kerf volume used for justifying the lower quality of disk <b>laser</b> <b>cuts.</b> The lower proportion of vaporized kerf volume detected for disk <b>laser</b> <b>cuts</b> results in an increased process temperature, thus an increase of viscosity of molten material and the subsequent more difficult ejection of the melted material from the cut kerf...|$|R
