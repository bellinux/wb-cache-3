5|$|On {{the table}} are various {{other pieces of}} {{equipment}} that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large <b>liquid-filled</b> glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E
5|$|The diving {{environment}} {{is limited by}} accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving {{is done in the}} shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and <b>liquid-filled</b> industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.|$|E

25|$|UV {{sources for}} UV curing {{applications}} include UV lamps, UV LEDs, and Excimer flash lamps. Fast {{processes such as}} flexo or offset printing require high-intensity light focused via reflectors onto a moving substrate and medium so high-pressure Hg (mercury) or Fe (iron, doped)-based bulbs are used, energized with electric arcs or microwaves. Lower-power fluorescent lamps and LEDs {{can be used for}} static applications. Small high-pressure lamps can have light focused and transmitted to the work area via <b>liquid-filled</b> or fiber-optic light guides.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in Britain, the {{location}} of the second meeting, the Americans have brought the Killing Stone of the Maya, recovered from Mexico; Vulture brings one of the pillars, from the treasury of his family, the Royal House of Saud; and a representative of the British Royal Family, Iolanthe Compton-Jones, brings the pillar kept by her family. The pillars are cloudy diamond bricks with a <b>liquid-filled</b> void in the centre. After being 'cleansed' by the Philosopher's Stone, the pillars become clear and the liquid silver. It is also discovered that the pillars' markings reveal Iolanthe's as the fourth, and Vulture's as the first. The Killing Stone of the Maya is united with the Firestone, and it reveals the dates by which the pillars must be laid - the first on the next day, and the second some seven days later. The Adamson twins have correlated the data from Stonehenge, and found that the first Vertex is underneath Lake Nasser in Egypt, close to Abu Simbel. The team starts out, accompanied by Astro and Iolanthe, leaving the Adamson twins with Tank to continue their calculations and find the other Vertices.|$|E
500|$|The {{underwater}} protection, also {{virtually identical}} {{to that of the}} King George Vs, consisted of a [...] wide three-layer system of voids and <b>liquid-filled</b> compartments meant to absorb the energy of an underwater explosion. It was bounded on the inside by the [...] torpedo bulkhead. Both of the inner and outer voids were fitted with pumps to flood them with water to level the ship (counter-flood) in case she began to list. Over the length of the citadel, this system was found to be proof against [...] of TNT during full-scale trials. The Lion-class ships had a double bottom with a depth of [...]|$|E
500|$|The game {{begins with}} Fred {{waking up in}} the castle of a Dr. Freidrich Steiner, an {{employee}} of Ulysses Pitt. [...] Fred soon learns that he has been murdered and subsequently resurrected, and his head is missing. [...] In its place is a <b>liquid-filled</b> jar that contains his brain and eyes. [...] Steiner explains that Fred is a private detective who had been investigating Pitt, but Pitt had discovered that Fred was on to him and had him murdered. Many of Fred's memories are missing {{as a result of the}} trauma to his brain, and before Steiner can explain further, Pitt and several of his henchmen arrive. [...] As Fred hides in Steiner's lab, Pitt's thugs apprehend Steiner and announce that he is to be taken to the Horseman, a minion of Pitt's who resides in Creepy Hollow.|$|E
500|$|Vanguards {{underwater}} protection was enhanced {{when she}} was redesigned in 1942 to reflect the lessons learned when Prince of Wales was sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers. It still consisted of a three-layer system of voids and <b>liquid-filled</b> compartments meant to absorb the energy of an underwater explosion. It was bounded on the inside by the [...] torpedo bulkhead. Her enlarged oil tanks reduced the empty spaces that could flood and cause the ship to list and greater provision was made to pump these spaces out. The longitudinal bulkheads of the side protection system were raised one deck higher to further subdivide the spaces behind the waterline armour belt. The side protection system had a maximum depth of , but this decreased significantly as the ship narrowed at its ends. Over {{the length of the}} citadel, this system was found to be proof against [...] of TNT during full-scale trials.|$|E
500|$|The side {{protection}} system incorporated five compartments divided by torpedo bulkheads {{and a large}} anti-torpedo bulge that {{ran the length of}} the [...] "armored raft". The outer two compartments, the innermost compartment and the bulge would remain empty, while the third and fourth compartments would be filled with liquid. The system was reduced in depth at either end by the forward and rear gun turrets. In these areas, the fifth compartment was deleted; instead, there was an outer empty compartment and two <b>liquid-filled</b> spaces, backed by another empty compartment. To compensate for the reduced underwater protection system, these sections received additional armor plating, up to [...] in thickness. The complete system was designed to withstand warheads of up to [...] of TNT. Underwater protection was rounded out by a triple bottom that was [...] deep. The bottom layer was [...] thick and was kept filled with fluid, while the upper [...] thick layer was kept empty. The triple bottom was also heavily subdivided to prevent catastrophic flooding should the upper layer be penetrated.|$|E
500|$|Vicious Cycle then {{submitted}} the concept to art company Massive Black Studios to develop initial character sketches. [...] Massive Black's artists {{were allowed to}} use their imagination while developing Fred, but the one stipulation Vicious Cycle made from the beginning was Fred's head—the developers {{wanted it to be}} a <b>liquid-filled</b> jar with the detective's brain and eyes floating around inside. [...] Massive Black came up with several different versions of Fred, including some with guns, which lead designer Adam Cogan had already decided the game would not include. [...] After receiving the sketches, Vicious Cycle chose several that portrayed Fred with a squat, childlike appearance that retained some of the youthful focus of the scrapped Geo project. [...] The publisher, D3, decided to present all of the concept art to a test group. [...] To the developers' surprise, the test group was much more interested in a darker, more intimidating portrayal of Fred than the cartoonish, playful look they had chosen. [...] The developers decided to flesh out the concept and took the chosen sketches back to Massive Black. [...] This time the art came back darker, with similarities to Dirty Harry and The Matrix and The Evil Dead, and a Norman Rockwell-inspired look that would influence the game's art style towards a more violent theme.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{compasses}} {{in ancient}} Han dynasty China {{were made of}} lodestone, a naturally magnetized ore of iron. The compass was later used for navigation during the Song Dynasty of the 11th century. [...] Later compasses were made of iron needles, magnetized by striking them with a lodestone. Dry compasses began to appear around 1300 in Medieval Europe and the Islamic world. This was supplanted in the early 20th century by the <b>liquid-filled</b> magnetic compass.|$|E
2500|$|The JLTV {{could have}} polyfibroblast applied to it, {{a type of}} {{self-healing}} paint developed by the Office of Naval Research and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory made to decrease vehicle maintenance. [...] Development began in 2008 and created a powder consisting of microscopic <b>liquid-filled</b> polymer spheres that can be combined with standard primers. [...] The substance lets paint scratches heal by breaking capsules and forming a coating over the exposed steel before corrosion takes place, cutting maintenance costs and allowing vehicles {{to operate in the}} field longer.|$|E
2500|$|Week 8 of Friday Night Live had a [...] "Mexican" [...] theme where housemates had {{to throw}} <b>liquid-filled</b> {{balloons}} at a Mexican Flag, {{with the intention of}} drenching the fabric. This use of the Mexican flag provoked criticism from Mexican officials. In a letter to the Australian Communications and Media Authority and production company Endemol Southern Star, Mexico's Foreign Ministry complained about the offensive use of the country's flag. [...] "(We) demand they take adequate measures to avoid this type of incident in the future", the ministry said. The show's producers later issued an apology.|$|E
2500|$|While glass fuses {{have the}} {{advantage}} of a fuse element visible for inspection purposes, they have a low breaking capacity (interrupting rating), which generally restricts them to applications of 15 A or less at 250 VAC. Ceramic fuses {{have the advantage}} of a higher breaking capacity, facilitating their use in circuits with higher current and voltage. Filling a fuse body with sand provides additional cooling of the arc and increases the breaking capacity of the fuse. [...] Medium-voltage fuses may have <b>liquid-filled</b> envelopes to assist in the extinguishing of the arc. Some types of distribution switchgear use fuse links immersed in the oil that fills the equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. M-1950 {{military}} lensatic compass {{does not}} use a <b>liquid-filled</b> capsule as a damping mechanism, but rather electromagnetic induction to control oscillation of it magnetized card. A [...] "deep-well" [...] design is used to allow the compass to be used globally with a card tilt of up to 8 degrees without impairing accuracy. [...] As induction forces provide less damping than fluid-filled designs, a needle lock is fitted to the compass to reduce wear, operated by the folding action of the rear sight/lens holder. The use of air-filled induction compasses has declined over the years, as they may become inoperative or inaccurate in freezing temperatures or extremely humid environments due to condensation or water ingress.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{compasses}} usually use a magnetized needle or dial {{inside a}} capsule completely {{filled with a}} liquid (lamp oil, mineral oil, white spirits, purified kerosene, or ethyl alcohol is common). While older designs commonly incorporated a flexible rubber diaphragm or airspace inside the capsule to allow for volume changes caused by temperature or altitude, some modern liquid compasses utilize smaller housings and/or flexible capsule materials to accomplish the same result. The liquid inside the capsule serves to damp {{the movement of the}} needle, reducing oscillation time and increasing stability. [...] Key points on the compass, including {{the north end of the}} needle are often marked with phosphorescent, photoluminescent, or self-luminous materials to enable the compass to be read at night or in poor light. [...] As the compass fill liquid is noncompressible under pressure, many ordinary <b>liquid-filled</b> compasses will operate accurately underwater to considerable depths.|$|E
2500|$|Computer {{programmer}} Thomas Anderson lives {{a double}} life under the hacker alias [...] "Neo". He believes {{something is wrong with}} the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the cryptic phrase [...] "the Matrix". Trinity contacts him, saying that a man named Morpheus can explain its meaning; however, the Agents, led by Agent Smith, apprehend Neo at his office and attempt to get a plea bargain out of Neo in exchange for helping them capture Morpheus, whom they call a terrorist. Undeterred, Neo meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between a red pill, which will allow him to learn the truth about the Matrix, and a blue pill, which will return him to his former life. After swallowing the red pill, Neo's reality disintegrates and he awakens, naked and weak, in a <b>liquid-filled</b> pod, one of countless people connected by cables to an elaborate electrical system. He is rescued and brought aboard Morpheus' hovercraft, the Nebuchadnezzar.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrostatic shock or {{hydraulic}} shock {{is a term}} which describes the observation that a penetrating projectile can produce remote wounding and incapacitating effects in living targets through a hydraulic effect in their <b>liquid-filled</b> tissues, in addition to local effects in tissue caused by direct impact. Just as force applied by a pump in a hydraulic circuit is transmitted throughout the circuit because of the near incompressibility of the liquid, so the kinetic energy of a bullet can sometimes send a shock wave through the body, transferring physical shock to tissues whose physiologic function may be disrupted by it (especially in the circulatory or nervous systems). (Other kinds of shock, namely circulatory and psychological, may follow, but mechanical shock is the immediate disruptor.) There is scientific evidence that hydrostatic shock can produce remote neural damage and produce incapacitation more quickly than blood loss effects. In arguments about the differences in stopping power between calibers and between cartridge models, proponents of cartridges that are [...] "light and fast" [...] (such as the 9×19mm Parabellum) versus cartridges that are [...] "slow and heavy" [...] (such as the [...]45 ACP) often refer to this phenomenon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difference}} in the travel velocities of the two shear waves {{can be explained by}} comparing their polarizations with the dominant direction of anisotropy in the area. The interactions between the tiny particles that make up solids and liquids can be used as an analogue for the way a wave travels through a medium. Solids have very tightly bound particles that transmit energy very quickly and efficiently. [...] In a liquid, the particles are much less tightly bound and it generally takes a longer time for the energy to be transmitted. [...] This is because the particles have further to travel to transfer the energy from one to another. [...] If a shear wave is polarized parallel to the cracks in this anisotropic medium, then it may look like the dark blue wave in Figure 4. [...] This wave is acting on the particles like energy being transferred through a solid. [...] It will have a high velocity because of the proximity of the grains to each other. [...] If there is a shear wave that is polarized perpendicular to the <b>liquid-filled</b> cracks or elongated olivine crystals present in the medium, then it would act upon these particles like those that make up a liquid or gas. The energy would be transferred more slowly through the medium and the velocity would be slower than the first shear wave.|$|E
