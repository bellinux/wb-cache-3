500|$|... "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and {{produced}} by Dave Fortman. The Millennium Choir performed background vocals for the song. According to Lee, the song talks about celebrities who have completely false images. It has been misinterpreted as a message against Christian faith, due to the band's denial of being a Christian band. During an interview, Lee explained: [...] "My little sister was really getting into these, I don't want to offend anyone, but like really fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started dressing like them and she was like 8 years old. So I gave her the talk and I wrote a song." [...] She later revealed that the song was written for American pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera adding, [...] "At this point, everybody knows that Britney is fake. The song is not about Britney Spears; it's {{about a lot of}} people in this industry. It's so fake, the whole Hollywood thing. 'Look at how perfect I am!' Nobody <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> It's all fake and it's really hurting a lot of girls' and women's self images. Where are all the normal people?". According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the website Musicnotes.com, [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] is written in the key of F major. It is set in a time signature of common time and performed in a tempo of 92 beats per minute. Lee's vocals in the song range from the note of A3 to the note of D5. After the third single from Fallen, [...] "My Immortal" [...] continued to grow successfully, Lee revealed that [...] "Imaginary" [...] would become the band's next and final single from the album stating, [...] "I think it's very epic. It's one of those big Aerosmith or Black Sabbath kind of songs. It's like an opus, with the choir and the rock and the programming. I love that song." [...] However, the release of [...] "Imaginary" [...] was scrapped and [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] was released as the fourth single from Fallen on June 4, 2004, while a maxi single was released on April 28, 2004.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inscription}} contains 3 incomplete lines, comprising 8 complete {{words and}} fragments of 5 more, all {{written in the}} [...] "Moabite language" [...] known from only one other artifact - the Mesha Stele. The text of the inscription <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of the Mesha Stele, {{but there is one}} special feature: the letter He has four horizontal strokes going to the left from the vertical stroke, while a typical He in tenth to fifth century BC northwest Semitic inscriptions contains only three strokes to the left. This letter is present in the inscription at least 3 times, and each time it appears with 4 horizontal strokes. Another different between the Mesha Stele and the Moabite inscription, is the separating between the words. In the Mesha Stele there are dots, and in the Moabite inscription there are small lines.|$|E

6000|$|I {{copied the}} little galley-slave who {{is made to}} figure in the initial letter of this paper, from a quaint old silver spoon which we {{purchased}} in a curiosity-shop at the Hague.* It {{is one of the}} gift spoons so common in Holland, and which have multiplied so astonishingly of late years at our dealers' in old silverware. Along the stem of the spoon are written the words: [...] "Anno 1609, Bin ick aldus ghekledt gheghaen"--"In the year 1609 I went thus clad." [...] The good Dutchman was released from his Algerine captivity (I imagine his figure <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a slave amongst the Moors), and in his thank-offering to some godchild at home, he thus piously records his escape.|$|E

Well, I hope he'll get {{something}} from us, I'm sure. He has been reported to be engaged to Miss Winkworth; I have no doubt you know who I mean. But Mr. Gracie says he hasn't looked at her more than twice. That's the way rumours fly round in that set, I presume. Well, I am glad we are not in it, wherever we are! Mr. Gracie is very different; he is intensely plain, but I believe he is very learned. You don't think him plain? Oh, you don't know? Well, I suppose you don't care, you must see so many. But I must say, when a young man <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> I call him painfully plain. I heard Doctor Tarrant make the remark the last time he was here.
