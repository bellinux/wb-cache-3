25|$|Estrogen {{may play}} a role in suppressing binge eating. Hormone {{replacement}} therapy using estrogen may be a possible treatment for binge eating behaviors in females. Estrogen replacement has been shown to suppress binge eating behaviors in female mice. The mechanism by which estrogen replacement inhibits binge-like eating involves the replacement of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Women exhibiting binge eating behaviors are found to have increased brain uptake of neuron 5-HT, and therefore less of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the cerebrospinal fluid. Estrogen works to activate 5-HT neurons, leading to suppression of binge <b>like</b> <b>eating</b> behaviors.|$|E

25|$|The {{group of}} gorillas {{is led by}} one or more adult males. In cases where there are more than one silverback males in a group, they are most likely father and son. Groups {{containing}} only one male are believed to be the basic unit of the social group, gradually growing in size due to reproduction and new members migrating in. In the study done at Lope, gorillas harvest most of their food arboreally, but less than half of their night nests are built in trees. They are often found on the ground and are made up of up to 30 gorillas. Western lowland gorillas live in the smallest family groups of all gorillas, with an average of 4 to 8 members in each. The leader (the silverback) organizes group activities, <b>like</b> <b>eating,</b> nesting and travelling in their home range. Those who challenge this alpha male are apt to be cowed by impressive shows of physical power. He may stand upright, throw things, make aggressive charges, and pound his huge chest while barking out powerful hoots or unleashing a frightening roar. Despite these displays and the animals' obvious physical power, gorillas are generally calm and nonaggressive unless they are disturbed. Young gorillas, from three to six years old, remind human observers of children. Much of their day is spent in play, climbing trees, chasing one another and swinging from branches.|$|E
500|$|... "Friday" [...] {{uses the}} 50s {{progression}}, an I-VI-IV-V chord progression that many popular songs have used such as [...] "Heart and Soul" [...] and [...] "Unchained Melody". It is {{performed in the}} key of B major at a tempo of 112 beats per minute. According to Randy Lewis of Los Angeles Times, the familiar structure contributes to the song's catchiness, making it what others have called an earworm. The song also sees Black on a harmony track. In a review for Rolling Stone, writer Matthew Perpetua described the vocals as having [...] "a peculiar tonality that inadvertently highlights the absurdity of boilerplate pop lyrics," [...] adding that the tone in the refrain [...] "sounds unlike anything else in pop music." [...] He noted the sound as being not entirely agreeable to listen to, but stated that Black ultimately ends up [...] "sounding like a distinct singer with an alluring sort of anti-charisma." [...] The lyrics of the song speak about [...] "hanging out with friends and having fun." [...] Paul Asay of Plugged In noted that lyrics reflect the happenings of a day, {{in the life of}} a teenager like Black, <b>like</b> <b>eating</b> breakfast and going to school.

2500|$|Similarly, reading [...] "My {{ordinances}} ( [...] , mishpatai) shall you do, and My statutes ( [...] , chukotai) shall you keep," [...] the Sifra distinguished [...] "ordinances" [...] ( [...] , mishpatim) from [...] "statutes" [...] ( [...] , chukim).

The term [...] "statutes" [...] ( [...] , chukim), taught the Sifra, refers to those rules that the impulse to do evil ( [...] , yetzer hara) and {{the nations of the world}} try to undermine, <b>like</b> <b>eating</b> pork (prohibited by [...] and [...] ), wearing wool-linen mixtures ( [...] , shatnez, prohibited by [...] and [...] ), release from levirate marriage ( [...] , chalitzah, mandated by [...] ), purification of a person affected by skin disease ( [...] , metzora, regulated in [...] ), and the goat sent off into the wilderness (the scapegoat, regulated in [...] ).

2500|$|In the media, {{the ideal}} {{version of a}} man {{is seen as a}} strong, toned man. The {{idealized}} version of a woman is thin (Aubrey, pg. 7). The concept of body evaluation is more common in criticizing women. However, body evaluation revolves more towards nonverbal cues for men. It is more common in women because sexual, sometimes offensive, verbal remarks are directed towards women. Men, on the other hand, experience more body evaluation through gazing and other nonverbal cues. Gazing is simply the way in which depict men from an idealized perspective. Men tend to experience this from other men, whereas women experience it from both sexes. The Interpersonal Sexual Objectification Scale (ISOS) is a scale that shows sexual objectification of respondents, both men and women. While experiencing sexual objectification it creates the need to constantly maintain and critique one’s physical appearance. This leads to other things <b>like</b> <b>eating</b> disorders, body shaming, and anxiety. The ISOS scale can be related to objectification theory and sexism. Self-objectification, which {{is the way in which}} we evaluate ourselves, is concentrated more on women. [...] Men typically experience it through media display. [...] The difference is that men typically do not experience the negative effects to the extent that women do.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{reported}} that actress Katee Sackhoff auditioned five times {{for the role of}} Emma, but according to her, the producers really wanted Morrison to play the part, and she accepted a role in the television series Longmire. In the end, Morrison was hired for the part of Emma. Morrison explained her character as someone who [...] "help her son Henry whom she abandoned when he was a baby and who seems like he's a little bit emotionally dysfunctional", but noted that Emma does not start out believing in the fairytale universe. Morrison has described Emma as being like an overgrown teenager who does not know how to properly do certain things, <b>like</b> <b>eating</b> or taking care of herself; this is due to Emma not growing up in a family unit. Morrison said that when she does {{not know what to do}} with Emma, she thinks, [...] "What a 14-year-old boy would do?"

2500|$|The Bhairavi {{initiated}} Ramakrishna into Tantra. Tantrism {{focuses on}} the worship of shakti and the object of Tantric training is to transcend the barriers between the holy and unholy {{as a means of}} achieving liberation and to see all aspects of the natural world as manifestations of the divine shakti. Under her guidance, Ramakrishna went through sixty four major tantric sadhanas which were completed in 1863. He began with mantra rituals such as japa and purascarana and many other rituals designed to purify the mind and establish self-control. He later proceeded towards tantric sadhanas, which generally include a set of heterodox practices called vamachara (left-hand path), which utilise as a means of liberation, activities <b>like</b> <b>eating</b> of parched grain, fish and meat along with drinking of wine and sexual intercourse. According to Ramakrishna and his biographers, Ramakrishna did not directly participate in the last two of those activities (some even say he didn't indulge in meat eating), all that he needed was a suggestion of them to produce the desired result. Ramakrishna acknowledged the left-hand tantric path, though it had [...] "undesirable features", as one of the [...] "valid roads to God-realization", he consistently cautioned his devotees and disciples against associating with it. The Bhairavi also taught Ramakrishna the kumari-puja, a form of ritual in which the Virgin Goddess is worshiped symbolically {{in the form of a}} young girl. Under the tutelage of the Bhairavi, Ramakrishna also learnt Kundalini Yoga. The Bhairavi, with the yogic techniques and the tantra played an important part in the initial spiritual development of Ramakrishna.|$|E
