25|$|Paradoxically, {{the same}} federal <b>laws</b> <b>do</b> not grant the {{language}} the same {{protection in the}} Province of Turin because Franco-Provençal speakers make up less than 15% of the population.

25|$|The Court {{found the}} same true for the PVPA. Under that law, however, “A farmer who legally {{purchases}} and plants a protected variety can save the seed from these plants for replanting on his own farm.” The PVPA and also the PPA operate in parallel with § 101 of the utility patent law. They provide different degrees of protection and have different requirements for securing protection. The later <b>laws</b> <b>do</b> not supersede the earlier one.|$|E
25|$|This law holds {{no matter}} how {{complicated}} the force is between particles. Similarly, if there are several particles, the momentum exchanged between each pair of particles adds up to zero, so the total change in momentum is zero. This conservation law applies to all interactions, including collisions and separations caused by explosive forces. It can also be generalized to situations where Newton's <b>laws</b> <b>do</b> not hold, for example {{in the theory of}} relativity and in electrodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Institutional barriers: {{include many}} laws, policies, practices, or {{strategies}} that discriminate against people with disabilities.

25|$|Many of the {{religious}} laws which applied in ancient times are applied in the modern State of Israel; others have not been revived, since the State of Israel does not adhere to traditional Jewish law. However, {{certain parts of the}} current territory of the State of Israel, such as the Arabah, are considered by some religious authorities to be outside the Land of Israel for purposes of Jewish law. According to these authorities, {{the religious}} <b>laws</b> <b>do</b> not apply there.|$|E

Some tax resisters have put forth legal arguments for their position—for instance that they cannot pay taxes for nuclear weapons development because this would put them in violation of the Nuremberg Principles—that could be considered varieties of tax-protester theories.|$|E

25|$|Child labour {{refers to}} the {{employment}} of children in any work that deprives children of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful. This practice is considered exploitative by many international organisations. Legislation across the world prohibit child labour. These <b>laws</b> <b>do</b> not consider all work by children as child labour; exceptions include work by child artists, family duties, supervised training, certain categories of work such as those by Amish children, some forms of child work common among indigenous American children, and others.|$|E
25|$|Rugby {{union is}} {{played on a}} field, known as a pitch, that should have a grassy surface, though the Laws {{permit the use of}} {{artificial}} grass, clay, sand or snow, but not permanently hard surfaces such as asphalt or concrete.

Middlesex Superior Court Judge Linda Giles ruled against Stein and Johnson, stating that the state's campaign finance <b>laws</b> <b>do</b> {{not apply to the}} press organizing political debates and that the invitations to Shannon O'Brien and Mitt Romney did not constitute a campaign contribution.|$|E
