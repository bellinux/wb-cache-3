5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and {{in a relatively short}} period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered <b>lard.</b> <b>Lard</b> was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming <b>lard</b> and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, <b>lard,</b> a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E

40|$|These {{studies on}} the {{relationship}} of the physical and chemical characteristics and constants of <b>lards</b> and other fats to their culinary value were started during the fall of 1932 and completed during the summer of 1937. The culinary tests were divided into three groups as follows: 1. The shortening power of <b>lards</b> and other fats in pastry and cookies. 2. the use of <b>lards</b> and other fats in plain cake, 3. the frying life of <b>lards</b> compared with other fats. This section of the report presents the studies relating to the shortening value of <b>lards</b> as compared with other fats.

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The {{incoming}} material, food, enters {{the body and}} is concocted into blood; waste is excreted as urine, bile, and faeces, and the element fire is released as heat. Blood is made into flesh, the rest forming other earthy tissues such as bones, teeth, cartilages and sinews. Leftover blood is made into fat, whether soft suet or hard <b>lard.</b> Some fat {{from all around the}} body is made into semen.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, <b>lard</b> {{is used to}} fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, or {{vegetable}} oil are also frequently used (although clarified butter {{may be used as}} well like in colonial times). The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.|$|E
5|$|Myriad {{additional}} ingredients can be used, including onion, {{roasted red}} bell pepper, {{red and green}} chili peppers, cilantro, lime, lime juice and lime zest, lemon juice, sour cream, oil, <b>lard,</b> vinegar and apple cider vinegar, water, and spices such as garlic, cumin, coriander, chili powder and cayenne, hot sauce, salt and pepper. The various ingredients can be mixed or puréed together using a food processor, a blender, or by hand. Bean dip is sometimes topped with shredded cheese and garnished with ingredients such as chopped cilantro, chopped green onion, chopped fresh or dried parsley and lime zest, among others.|$|E

5|$|Olive oil was a {{ubiquitous}} {{ingredient in}} Mediterranean cultures, but remained an expensive import {{in the north}} where oils of poppy, walnut, hazel and filbert were the most affordable alternatives. Butter and <b>lard,</b> especially after the terrible mortality during the Black Death made them less scarce, were used in considerable quantities in the northern and northwestern regions, especially in the Low Countries. Almost universal in middle and upper class cooking all over Europe was the almond, {{which was in the}} ubiquitous and highly versatile almond milk, which was used as a substitute in dishes that otherwise required eggs or milk, though the bitter variety of almonds came along much later.|$|E
5|$|When being cooked, {{fried chicken}} is often divided into smaller pieces. The chicken is then {{generally}} {{covered in a}} batter, often consisting of ingredients such as eggs or milk, and a thickener such as flour. This is {{used to create a}} crust on the exterior of the meat. In addition, seasoning is often added at this stage. Once the chicken is ready to be cooked, it is placed in a deep fryer, frying pan or pressure cooker (depending on the method used) and fried in <b>lard</b> or a type of oil.|$|E
5|$|As {{the home}} country of {{beetroot}} borscht, Ukraine boasts great {{diversity of the}} soup's regional variants, with virtually every province having its own recipe. Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the kind of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, chicken, duck or goose. The use of zucchini, beans and apples is characteristic of the Chernihiv borscht; in this variant, beetroots are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than <b>lard,</b> and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples. The Lviv borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of Vienna sausages.|$|E

50|$|A lardon, {{also called}} lardoon or <b>larding,</b> {{is a small}} strip or cube of pork fat (usually {{subcutaneous}} fat) used {{in a wide variety}} of cuisines to flavor savory foods and salads. In French cuisine, lardons are also used for <b>larding,</b> by threading them with a needle into meats that are to be braised or roasted. Lardons are not normally smoked, and they are made from pork that has been cured with salt.|$|R
5|$|Cheese was {{far more}} {{important}} as a foodstuff, especially for common people, {{and it has been}} suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes. Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan, were available and well known in late medieval times. There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses. Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas. Butter, another important dairy product, was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production in the latter half of the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. While most other regions used oil or <b>lard</b> as cooking fats, butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas. Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward.|$|E
5|$|Gibanica {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{recognizable}} pastry dishes from the Balkans, whether served on festive occasions, or as a comforting family snack. In Serbia, the dish is often consumed at traditional events such as Christmas, Easter and Slava. According to the Serbian media, the largest Gibanica ever made was in the town of Mionica in 2007. It weighed over 1,000 kg, and was applied for inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records. 330kg of phyllo dough, 330kg of cheese, 3,300 eggs, 30 l. of oil, 110 l. of mineral water, 50kg of <b>lard</b> and 500 packets of baking powder went into its creation. In Serbia, as well as in neighboring countries, there are festivals dedicated to pies. One of them, called the Gibanica festival or Days of Banitsa, is held each year in Bela Palanka. It first took place in 2005.|$|E
5|$|It {{was soon}} {{established}} {{that some of}} the pirates were from Cabo Rojo, since they disembarked there. Undercover agents were sent to the town to track them, and new mayor Juan Font y Soler requested resources to deal with a larger group which was out of control. Links between the pirates and local sympathizers made arresting them difficult. The central government, frustrated with Cabo Rojo's inefficiency, demanded the pirates' capture and western Puerto Rico military commander José Rivas was ordered to exert pressure on local authorities. Although Cofresí was tracked to the beach in Peñones, near his brothers' homes in Guaniquilla, the operation only recovered the Johns sails, meat, flour, cheese, <b>lard,</b> butter and candles; the pirates escaped aboard a schooner. A detachment caught Juan José Mateu and charged him with conspiracy; his confession linked Cofresí to the two hijackings.|$|E

5|$|During dinner, {{the family}} is euphoric with their new powers. However, it leads to an {{argument}} about {{what they should be}} doing with them.

Realizing none of their powers are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit Professor Frink. They visit his house to find him not there, but they stumble upon a portal that sends them to a place called the Game Engine where all video games are made. After saving him from a giant gorilla, Frink gives them The Simpsons Games player's guide to teach them how to better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid Captain McCallister in beating back mind-controlled dolphins that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the <b>Lard</b> Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they rescue Cletus from the aliens.|$|E
5|$|While {{watching}} a 1950s science fiction movie, Bart and Lisa see {{a commercial for}} a model rocket kit and Bart orders it by using Homer's credit card number. Homer helps Bart and Milhouse build it, but it blows up before launching. Jealous that Ned Flanders built a superior rocket, Homer enlists {{the help of his}} former nerdy college roommates, Gary, Doug, and Benjamin, to build a rocket piloted by the hamster Nibbles. The rocket lifts off successfully, but it develops complications and Nibbles bails out. However, Homer makes an attempt to shoot down the rocket with a 12 gauge shotgun, but the rocket crashes into the church. The church council meets up to decide how to come up with money to fund the repairs to the church, and with no other aid available they accept help from Mr. Burns and Lindsay Naegle who wish to run the church as a business. The two rebuild the church as a commercial monstrosity, complete with advertising signs, a <b>Lard</b> Lad statue, and a Jumbotron. Lisa is appalled at this and abandons the church, feeling her religion has lost its soul.|$|E
