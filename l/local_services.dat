5|$|The Great Western Main Line from London to Bristol is in {{the process}} of being electrified. However because of cost overruns and delays, on 8 November 2016 the {{government}} announced that several elements of the programme would be deferred including electrification south west of Thingley Junction near Chippenham and Bristol Parkway. This will leave Temple Meads un-electrified but the new Hitachi Super Express trains are bi-mode so can operate as diesels around Bristol and can use electricity where the electrification work is complete. The electrification plans do not extend west of Bristol so <b>local</b> <b>services</b> will continue to be provided using diesel trains, with Class 165/166s cascaded from Thames Valley services scheduled to replace the 150/153/158s on <b>local</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the {{nationalisation}} of British Rail in 1948, Marylebone {{was initially}} kept open as a long-distance station. New services were introduced, including the Master Cutler service to Sheffield and the South Yorkshireman to Bradford, {{but they were}} not well-used. From 1949, all <b>local</b> <b>services</b> towards High Wycombe and Princes Risborough were routed into Marylebone, although the frequency of trains was reduced two years later.|$|E
5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Bedminster passed to Regional Railways. <b>Local</b> <b>services</b> were franchised to Wales & West when the railway was privatised in 1997, which was in turn succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, {{the success of}} deep-bore {{electric}} trains on the Underground suggested that <b>local</b> <b>services</b> out of London could also be electrified. Following the war, the GER needed more capacity out of Liverpool Street as it was at capacity (serving almost 230,000 passengers daily in 1921), {{but they could not}} afford electrification. They considered high powered and high tractive steam locomotives including the GER Class A55 as a possible alternative, but these were rejected because of high track loadings.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{multiple}} units began running on 1 January 1905 and by 20 March all <b>local</b> <b>services</b> between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. The use of six-car trains was considered wasteful on the lightly used line to Uxbridge and in running an off-peak three-car shuttle to Harrow the Met aroused the displeasure of the Board of Trade {{for using a}} motor car to propel two trailers. A short steam train was used for off-peak services {{from the end of}} March while some trailers were modified to add a driving cab, entering service from 1 June.|$|E

5|$|Ownership of Charing Cross {{passed to}} the Southern Railway (SR) in 1923 {{following}} the Big Four grouping. The line was electrified in 1926 to cater for suburban services. The lighter load of multiple-unit electric trains was found to put far less strain on the bridge, and so traffic was redesigned so that <b>local</b> <b>services</b> ran on the older section, with mainline services using the 1887 extension.|$|E
