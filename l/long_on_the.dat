5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1975, members of the North Vietnamese Political Bureau paid {{close attention to the}} military situation in South Vietnam to plan for their next major offensive. On January 8, two days after the Vietnam People’s Army 4th Corps had captured Phuoc <b>Long</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northern edges of South Vietnam’s III Corps Tactical Zone, North Vietnamese leaders agreed to launch an all-out military offensive, in order to win the war. Originally the North Vietnamese leaders expected the campaign would last two years, be completed in 1976, and pave the way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable conditions on the battlefield so that combat forces could be deployed from their current localities.|$|E
5|$|In London, he {{had been}} {{introduced}} in 1881 to Constance Lloyd, daughter of Horace Lloyd, a wealthy Queen's Counsel. She happened to be visiting Dublin in 1884, when Wilde was lecturing at the Gaiety Theatre. He proposed to her, and they married on 29 May 1884 at the Anglican St James's Church, Paddington in London. Constance's annual allowance of £250 was generous for a young woman (equivalent to about £ in current value), but the Wildes had relatively luxurious tastes, and they had preached to others for so <b>long</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of design that people expected their home to set new standards. No. 16, Tite Street was duly renovated in seven months at considerable expense. The couple had two sons, Cyril (1885) and Vyvyan (1886). Wilde became the sole literary signatory of George Bernard Shaw's petition for a pardon of the anarchists arrested (and later executed) after the Haymarket massacre in Chicago in 1886.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{architectural}} prominence, {{very little}} is known of the church's history and its precise architecture. Most of {{the information on the}} church's original appearance is derived from the epigram in honour of Juliana and her family, which was inscribed in pieces {{in various parts of the}} church. The epigram claims that the church was laid out as a replica of the ancient Jewish Temple with the precise proportions given in the Bible for the Temple of Solomon, and using the royal cubit as a unit of measure, as in its model. Richard Martin Harrison, the site's chief excavator, has reconstructed the church as a roughly square basilica, ca. 52 m <b>long</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sides, with a central nave and two side aisles, fronted by a narthex and preceded by a large atrium of 26 m length. To the north of the atrium, remains of another building have been identified as either the church's baptistery or Juliana's palace. An oval substructure in the building's center indicates the position of the ambon, while strong foundations throughout the building indicate, according to Harrison, the presence of a dome, bringing the estimated height of the building to over 30 m. The area of the altar was not sufficiently excavated, and its shape remains unknown. The possible presence of a dome, although not universally accepted, is of major importance, since it would mean that it was St. Polyeuctus, and not Justinian's churches (Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the Hagia Sophia), which first combined the traditional basilica with a dome. From the epigram, we know that the interior featured two storeys with colonnades and galleries. Based on the epigram and the substructures, Harrison also posited the existence of a pair of two-storey exedrae, composed of three niches with a pier in between, on the northern and southern sides of the ambo. The spaces around the domed western bay would have been covered with barrel or cross-vaults.|$|E

5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is a {{terrestrial}} rodent {{with short}} forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150mm (5.9in) and body mass of 105g (3.7oz) {{in the only}} known complete specimen, it is much larger than M.bastardi, and its measurements fall {{at or above the}} upper end of the known range of variation in M.ingens. The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover hairs (the main part of the fur) are dark brown for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short dark brown tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover hairs there are entirely dark brown. The hairs are 6 to 8mm (0.2 to 0.3in) <b>long</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulders and 7 to 9mm (0.3 to 0.4in) on the back. The guard hairs are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover hairs, they are slightly lighter than the rest of the upperparts. They are sharply separated in color from the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60mm (2.4in), and white or black in color. The pinnae (external ears) are dark brown and covered with fine gray hairs, and ear length is 32mm (1.3in).|$|E

25|$|The {{potential}} transmembrane {{portions of}} a protein {{can be detected}} by hydropathy analysis. A hydropathy analysis uses an algorithm that quantifies the hydrophobic character at each position along the polypeptide chain. One of the accepted hydropathy scales is that of Kyte and Doolittle which relies on the generation of hydropathy plots. In these plots, the negative numbers represent hydrophilic regions and the positive numbers represent hydrophobic regions on the y-axis. A potential transmembrane domain is about 20 amino acids <b>long</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> x-axis.|$|E
25|$|Laphria, {{a festival}} for Artemis in Patrai.

However, the sacrifice is not offered until the next day.|$|E
25|$|Tamarindus indica is {{probably}} indigenous to tropical Africa, {{but has been}} cultivated for so <b>long</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Indian subcontinent that it is sometimes reported to be indigenous there, where it is known as imli in Hindi-Urdu.

25|$|Another {{very common}} {{strategy}} is the protective put, {{in which a}} trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and buys a put. This strategy acts as an insurance when investing on the underlying stock, hedging the investor's potential loses, but also shrinking an otherwise larger profit, if just purchasing the stock without the put. The maximum profit of a protective put is theoretically unlimited as the strategy involves being <b>long</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> underlying stock. The maximum loss {{is limited to the}} purchase price of the underlying stock less the strike price of the put option and the premium paid. A protective put is also known as a married put.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{the report}} of the Castilian chronicler Palencia shows that Ferdinand can't have been so <b>long</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> camp, after the battle, since he wrote that Ferdinand left the {{battlefield}} at 9:00p.m. –at a time when the battle, according to the timing given by Pulgar, was still undecided (his departure {{before the end of the}} battle is also supported by the Portuguese chroniclers). Indeed, if Ferdinand had remained 3 or 4 hours on the battlefield after the end of the battle and departed at 9:00p.m., this would imply that the battle (which lasted several hours) had finished between 5:00p.m. and 6.00 p.m., –but all chroniclers of both sides agree that the battle began very late, at the sunset (7:00p.m.) of that day. The battle could not have ended before it began.|$|E

25|$|Although he {{had been}} not <b>long</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Lý throne, Lý Thần Tông at once made several {{major changes in the}} royal court such as {{relaxing}} strict laws, appointing officials for important positions and maintaining diplomatic relations with the Song Dynasty and the Kingdom of Champa. At that time, the Đại Việt's borders were fairly stable except for some skirmishes with the Khmer rulerSuryavarman II, starting in 1128, and Champa, which were driven out by the Lý army without difficulty. Besides the Emperor, the victory over Champa was also attributed to the protection of the Buddhist and Taoist deities, an opinion that the historian Lê Văn Hưu did not agree with since the historian thought that the victory in battlefield was solely due to the ability of the commander.|$|E

25|$|The railway {{needed a}} loop {{to run its}} {{locomotives}} around the train on the quay. Without a loop the company {{had to go to}} the extra expense of having two locomotives in steam at one time, even with the winter load of a single coach. Bideford Town Council refused the construction and after much argument the railway company went ahead and built the loop in defiance of the council. A court injunction forced the railway company to remove it again. The railway appealed to the Board of Trade and by May 1903 permission had been secured to re-lay the loop. Later on a fine of 40 shillings was imposed on the company for allowing its trains to remain too <b>long</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quay. In July 1901 a complaint was made that two loaded trucks had been left at the wharf and a week later the prosecution came to the Bideford Petty Sessions Court, together with matters relating to safety on the quay, no whistle or bell and no adequate driver's seat for the engine driver to see out, leading to a 10s fine.|$|E
