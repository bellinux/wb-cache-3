40|$|This thesis <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> discord between {{asymmetric}} warfare and just war theory. Specifically, it <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> place of just war theory in political science, and the competing theories that analyse war. Consequently, it <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> specific problems that face just war theory in an {{asymmetric warfare}} context, by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> three parts of just war theory. The first is jus ad bellum, {{the justice of}} war, and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{decision to go to}} war. The second is jus in bello, the justice in war, and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conduct of war. The final is jus post bellum, and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conclusion of war. By the end of this thesis, I aim to have provided a basis for reconciling asymmetric warfare and just war theory. Department of Government and International Relation...|$|R

5|$|Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was {{established}} in 1960 to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> matter again. Also it recommended a tunnel and a central station.

The proposal {{was presented to the}} Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station was passed unanimously.|$|E

5|$|Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I do care. But to be {{perfectly}} honest with you, I don't care a lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died.

5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting a closer <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> data is required.|$|E
