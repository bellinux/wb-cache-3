6000|$|The lilly cheek, the [...] "purple {{light of}} love," [...] The <b>liquid</b> <b>lustre</b> of the melting eye,-- Mary! of these the Poet sung, for these Did Woman triumph! with no angry frown View this {{degrading}} conquest. At that age No MAID OF ARC had snatch'd from coward man The heaven-blest sword of Liberty; thy sex Could boast no female ROLAND'S martyrdom; No CORDE'S angel and avenging arm Had sanctified again the Murderer's name As erst when Caesar perish'd: yet some strains May even adorn this theme, befitting me To offer, nor unworthy thy regard.|$|E
60|$|To this life, miserable father, I devote thee!--Go!--Be thy {{days passed}} with savages, and thy nights under the cope of heaven! Be thy limbs worn and thy heart chilled, and all youth be dead within thee! Let thy hairs be as snow; thy walk {{trembling}} and thy voice have lost its mellow tones! Let the <b>liquid</b> <b>lustre</b> of thine eyes be quenched; {{and then return}} to me, return to thy Mathilda, thy child, who may then be clasped in thy loved arms, while thy heart beats with sinless emotion. Go, Devoted One, and return thus!--This is my curse, a daughter's curse: go, and return pure to thy child, who will never love aught but thee.|$|E
60|$|The {{refreshing}} meal, {{the brilliant}} fire, {{the presence and}} kindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her own unique mind, had roused her powers within her. They woke, they kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the <b>liquid</b> <b>lustre</b> of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of radiance. Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence? Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.|$|E
6000|$|At length the Commander-In-Chief and the Lt. Governor entered together, {{occupying the}} same box, though two had been provided, their attendants having {{recourse}} to the second. The commotion produced by these arrivals had hardly subsided, when the curtain arose, {{and a new}} world was presented to our view! Of the playing, I shall not venture to say much; though to me it seemed perfection. Bulstrode gained great applause that night; and I understand that divers gentlemen, who had either been educated at home, or who had passed much time there, declared that his Cato would have done credit to either of the royal theatres. His dress appeared {{to me to be}} everything it should be; though I cannot describe it. I remember that Syphax wore the uniform of a colonel of dragoons, and Juba, that of a general officer; and that there was a good deal of criticism expended, and some offence taken, because the gentlemen who played these parts came out in wool, and with their faces blacked. It was said, in answer to these feelings, that the characters were Africans; and that any one might see, by casting his eyes at the gallery, that Africans are usually black, and that they have woolly hair; a sort of proof that, I imagine, only aggravated the offence. [15] Apart from this little mistake, everything went off well, even Marcia. It is true, that some evil-inclined person whispered that the [...] "virtuous Marcia" [...] was a little how-came-you-so; but Bulstrode afterwards assured me that his condition helped him along amazingly, and that it added a <b>liquid</b> <b>lustre</b> to his eyes, that might otherwise have been wanting. The high-heeled shoes appeared to trouble him; but some persons fancied it gave him a pretty tottering in his walk, that added very much to the deception. On the whole, the piece went off surprisingly, as I could see by Lord Loudon and the Lt. Governor, both of whom seemed infinitely diverted. Herman Mordaunt smiled once or twice, when he ought to have looked grave; but this I ascribed to a want of practice, of late years, in scenic representations. He certainly was a man of judgment, and must have known the proper moments to exhibit particular emotions.|$|E
