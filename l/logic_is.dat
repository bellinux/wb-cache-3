40|$|Abstract. Hybrid branching-time <b>logics</b> <b>are</b> {{introduced}} as extensions of CT L-like logics with state {{variables and the}} downarrow-binder. Following recent work in the linear framework, only logics with a single variable are considered.

As main result, the satisfiability problem for the hybrid versions of several branching-time <b>logics</b> <b>is</b> proved to be 2 EXPTIME-complete. These branching-time logics range from strict fragments of CT L to extensions of CT L that {{can talk about the}} past and express fairness-properties. The complexity gap relative to CT L is explained by a corresponding succinctness result. To prove the upper bound, the automata-theoretic approach to branchingtime <b>logics</b> <b>is</b> extended to hybrid logics, showing that non-emptiness of alternating one-pebble Büchi tree automata is 2 EXPTIME-complete. ...|$|R
