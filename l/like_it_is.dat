Within cheirogaleids, the sublingua lacks cartilage, and the sublingua of the gray mouse lemur has a distinct plica mediana and ends in two lobe-like projections that lack keratinized serrations, but have three keratinized ridges which make the sublingua rigid.|$|E

25|$|One {{strategy}} {{to control the}} disease in areas where it is common is the treatment of entire groups of people regardless of symptoms via mass drug administration. This is often done among school-age children and is known as deworming.

25|$|Physical {{simulators}} {{differ in}} the way they react on a collision. Some use the softness of the material to calculate a force, which will resolve the collision in the following time steps <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in reality. Due to the low softness of some materials this is very CPU intensive. Some simulators estimate the time of collision by linear interpolation, roll back the simulation, and calculate the collision by the more abstract methods of conservation laws.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of its opening, the Hall of Northwest Coast Indians was one of four halls {{dedicated}} to the native peoples of United States and Canada. It was originally organized in two sections, the first being a general area pertaining to all peoples of the region and the second a specialized area divided by tribe. This was a point of contention for Boas who wanted all artifacts in the hall {{to be associated with the}} proper tribe (much <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> currently organized), eventually leading to the dissolution of Boas’ relationship with the museum.|$|E

25|$|In-ha {{suffers from}} the Pinocchio Syndrome, where she cannot lie without {{breaking}} into hiccups. Instead of choosing {{to withdraw from the}} world, she believes in telling it <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> In-ha chooses to become a reporter because she believes that it might bring her closer to her mother Song Cha-ok, whom she has always idolized. Stubborn and strong-willed, In-ha believes that all news reported must be completely truthful, and goes all out in order to do so. Together with Dal-po, she unravels the truth behind a greater conspiracy, standing up to her mother in the process. Though In-ha initially treats Dal-po as family, her growing feelings towards him grow undeniable with her hiccups.|$|E
25|$|The site {{contains}} many fine stone buildings {{in various states}} of preservation, and many have been restored. The buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways, called sacbeob.). Archaeologists have identified over 80 sacbeob criss-crossing the site, and extending in all directions from the city. Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red, green, blue and purple colors. Pigments were chosen according to what was most easily available in the area. The site must be imagined as a colorful one, not <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> today. Just like gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings.|$|E
25|$|In children, {{assessment}} of infantile reflexes {{is also a}} diagnostic tool, such as the Moro reflex and the Romberg Test. The Moro reflex is rarely present in infants after 6 months of age and is characterized {{as a response to}} a sudden loss of support that causes the infant to feel <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> falling. The infant will respond by abduction and adduction (or spreading and unspreading) of the arms, as well as crying. The Moro reflex is significant in evaluating the integration of the central nervous system and patients with ataxic cerebral palsy will show a persistence and exacerbation of the reflex. In addition, patients with ataxic cerebral palsy will rarely show a positive Romberg test, which indicates that there is localized cerebellar dysfunction.|$|E

25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{the case}} with all trans-municipal {{metropolitan}} areas in Mexico, there is no elected government institution in charge of administering the entire metropolitan area. Each municipality is autonomous to administer its local affairs, regulated {{by the government of}} the states they belong to. However, unlike some other large metropolitan areas that are entirely contained in one state, like Greater Guadalajara and Greater Monterrey in which the state government coordinates metropolitan activities, Greater Mexico City spreads over three federal entities—two states and the Federal District—and therefore most of the metropolitan projects have to be agreed upon by government officials of each federal entity and/or overseen by the federal government—since the budget of the Federal District is approved by the Congress of the Union, being the capital of the federation—or through metropolitan commissions.|$|E
25|$|A third {{mainstream}} {{theory of}} ageing, the Disposable soma theory, proposed in 1977 by Thomas Kirkwood, presumes {{that the body}} must budget {{the amount of energy}} available to it. The body uses food energy for metabolism, for reproduction, and for repair and maintenance. With a finite supply of food, the body must compromise, and do none of these things quite as well as it would <b>like.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> the compromise in allocating energy to the repair function that causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age. A caveat to the disposable soma theory suggests that time, rather than energy, is a limiting resource that may be critical to an organism. The concept is that each organism must reproduce in an optimal period in order to ensure the greatest chance of success for the offspring. This optimal period is dictated by the ecological niche of the organism but in essence, it limits the time that any given organism can devote to growth and development prior to bearing offspring. Thus, developmental rate and gestational rate are subject to evolutionary pressure. The need to accelerate gestation limits the time allocated to damage repair at the cellular level, resulting in an accumulation of damage and a decreased lifespan relative to organisms with longer gestation. This concept stems from a comparative analysis of genomic stability in mammalian cells.|$|E
