500|$|Johnson said Adolf {{previously}} made {{comments about}} killing any African American {{who ran for}} president: [...] "He made a comment in the past. I can't honestly tell you how long ago in the past, that he didn't believe a black should be {{the leader of this}} country." [...] According to Johnson, Adolf said he was already wanted for other crimes, so it [...] "wouldn't matter if he killed Obama". Johnson also claimed Adolf said he would never be taken alive and wanted to [...] "go down in a blaze of glory". <b>Law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>sources</b> told KCNC-TV that one of the suspects [...] "was directly asked if they had come to Denver to kill Obama. He responded in the affirmative." [...] Johnson said Gartrell came to Denver to help Adolf execute the plan, and Gartrell later admitted to police that in talking about Obama, they referred to [...] "shooting on a grassy knoll," [...] a reference to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. An arrest warrant read, [...] "Adolf said that he wanted to kill Obama and additionally stated that he would specifically use a sniper rifle and high powered scope, and find high ground to set up and shoot Obama." [...] However, Johnson also told the reporter he {{came to the conclusion that}} there was assassination plot only after being questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation multiple times, adding, “I told them I had no idea there was a plot, a plan, a conspiracy or anything like that ... When the feds came and laid out everything on the table and how it looked, I was in agreement that they could have been up here to do something like that." [...] Johnson later rejected additional media interview requests.|$|E

The reports also alleged that Haneef may have been {{one of a number of}} people who had expressed interest in the operations of planes at premises in Queensland.

He elaborates that the words may have been intended to be read in a different order, producing wording that makes more sense ("I'm not jealous ... stupid bitch", for instance). In addition he theorizes that more than one writer may have been involved, or that not all of it may have been written at the same time.|$|R

2500|$|Comey {{informed}} Congress of {{this additional}} investigation despite having been advised by Justice Department officials {{that such an}} announcement would violate department policies and procedures, including a policy not to comment on investigations close to an election.

[...] <b>Law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>sources</b> added that he feared he would be accused of concealing relevant information if he did not disclose it.|$|E
2500|$|After the Sandy Hook Elementary School {{shooting}} on 14 December 2012, initial media reports mis-identified the shooter as Ryan Lanza, {{the brother of}} the perpetrator. After discovering that Ryan had liked Mass Effect on Facebook, an internet mob immediately attacked the game's Facebook page, labelling the developers [...] "child killers". Once it was discovered that it was his brother, Adam, who had carried out the massacre, initial news stories claimed a link to two video games, Starcraft and Dance Dance Revolution. After a UK tabloid claimed that Lanza had a Call of Duty obsession, this was widely repeated across the internet, Subsequently, a small town near Sandy Hook organized the collection and burning of video games in exchange for a gift certificate. A report by CBS claimed that anonymous <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>sources</b> suggested a link to video games, which was later dismissed by the Connecticut police, saying that it was [...] "all speculation". However, the incident prompted a wave of legislative and bureaucratic efforts against violent video games in the following months, including a meeting between US vice president, Joe Biden, and representatives from the video game industry on the topic of video game violence. The official investigation report, released on 25 November 2013, discussed video games only briefly in the 48-page document and did not suggest they contributed to Lanza's motive. The report revealed that Lanza played a variety of video games, although he was most fond of non-violent video games such as Dance, Dance Revolution and Super Mario Brothers. The report particularly focused on Dance, Dance Revolution which he played regularly, for hours, with an associate.|$|E

The Los Angeles Times quoted a senior <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>source</b> as saying authorities may not pursue charges even if the coroner declares the case a homicide, because Jackson's well-documented drug abuse would make any prosecution difficult. Nonetheless, the source said prosecutors had not ruled out more serious charges [...] "all the way up to involuntary manslaughter" [...] if it were determined that Jackson's death was indeed caused by the drug propofol.|$|R

5000|$|Sweeney {{was charged}} with aggravated DWI (driving while under the {{influence}} of alcohol or other drugs) when he was arrested by New York State Police at 1:19 a.m. on November 11, 2007.

50|$|Angelo said he innocently met FBI special agent, John Connolly, in the Prudential Center in {{the fall}} of 1987, after Vanessa's had been searched. He was still disgruntled from the humiliation of being {{successfully}} bugged, accused the FBI of trying to plant evidence during their secret forays into the store and bragged that the Mafia had outsmarted them. He was trying to best John Connolly in a battle of insider information. Connolly calmly rattled off the name of the Patriarca crime family's inside <b>source</b> for <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> information. Angelo had unknowingly confirmed that the Patriarca crime family had a <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>source,</b> and he knew what it meant if the FBI exposed his Top Echelon Informant status. Angelo's conversation restored Stephen Flemmi's Top Echelon Informant status in November 1987. In less than a year, Angelo had joined Stephen as a Top Echelon Informant, and was constantly feeding the FBI inside information on his associates in the Patriarca crime family. In some ways he even supplanted James J. Bulger and Stephen Flemmi in importance- the FBI and the Organized Crime Strike Force were targeting the Patriarca crime family, Robert Carrozza, J.R. Russo and Vincent Ferrara, and as a member of their inner circle, Mercurio was privy to information that even Stephen Flemmi could not obtain. He threw himself into his informant role enthusiastically- even though he had been the best man at Vincent Ferrara's first wedding, this did not stop him from thoroughly informing on the illicit activities of his old friend. Angelo's value as an informant made protecting him a priority.|$|R

Oseguera González pleaded not guilty and claimed that he worked in construction and was a car salesperson since he was 16 years old. He also claimed that he inherited properties from his mother after she bought them when he was younger and put them under his name.|$|R
