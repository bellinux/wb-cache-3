The weight of the cage being lifted, lifted the rods, released the teeth and tightened the spring, allowing the cage to move freely. If the chain or cable broke, the springs would force the rods down and the teeth would dig into the wood, stopping the cage.|$|R

50|$|Great {{improvements}} {{were also}} {{made in the}} hoisting apparatus and cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work. As {{the depth of the}} diggings increased, the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical, as their self-weight became a significant fraction of their tensile strength (breaking weight). After hemp rope, iron chains began to become more common. However, fracture was quick, at around half a millisecond. In 1829 Wilhelm Albert had studied and reported on the failure of the iron chains and began creating a twisted metal cabling known as Albert Rope. In 1864 Andrew Smith Hallidie manufactured wire rope and was heavily involved in building early cable bridges and ropeway conveyors; his wire rope went on to be used in San Francisco's famous cable cars, and was also added to the cable drums in the hoist houses on the Comstock Lode.

We have shown in {{previous}} work that elevation of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca 2 +]c) can manipulate orientation in growing pollen tubes, but our results suggested that [Ca 2 +]c changes {{either in the}} tip or in more distal regions might regulate the critical orienting mechanism. To identify the spatial location of the orienting motor, we combined the techniques of ion imaging with confocal microscopy and localized photoactivation of <b>loaded</b> <b>caged</b> Ca 2 + (nitr- 5) and diazo- 2 (a caged Ca 2 + chelator) to manipulate [Ca 2 +]c in different pollen tube domains. We found that increasing [Ca 2 +]c {{on one side of}} the pollen tube apex induced reorientation of the growth axis toward that side. Similarly, a decrease in [Ca 2 +]c promoted bending toward the opposite side. These effects could be mimicked by imposing localized external gradients of an ionophore (A 23187) or a Ca 2 + channel blocker (GdCl 3); the pollen tubes bend toward the highest concentration of A 23187 and away from GdCl 3. Manipulation of [Ca 2 +]c in regions farther back from the apical zone also induced changes in growth direction, but the new orientation was at random. We observed communication of these distal events to the tip through a slow-moving [Ca 2 +]c wave. These data show that localized changes of [Ca 2 +]c in the tip, which could result from asymmetric channel activity, control the direction of pollen tube growth...|$|R

We report a method to free-draw single lipid nanotube (LNT) patterns in any shape on surfaces with 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) that takes an inverted hexagonal (HII) phase. We used pre-self-assembled LNTs or HII lipid blocks as a lipid reservoir from which new LNTs were pulled by applying a point load with a micromanipulator. The extreme simplicity of our technique originates from the fundamental nature of DOPE lipids that prefer a HII phase, while all the conventional approaches use PC lipids that form a lamellar phase.

Here the electrical and Ca 2 + responses of Deiters' cells evoked by purinergic stimulation were investigated in the organ of Corti, the auditory sensory epithelium. Adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP, 50 - 100 muM) applied focally by pressure increased the intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +](i)). At the same time ATP evoked an early inward current {{that was followed by}} an outward component, reflecting a sustained Ca 2 +-dependent reduction of the pre-stimulus offset current. These responses were maintained when Ca 2 + was removed from the extracellular medium (0 [Ca 2 +](o)), indicating a contribution to Ca 2 + signalling from P 2 Y metabotropic receptors. UV photolysis of caged inositol 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate (InsP(3), 16 muM) produced Ca 2 + responses similar to those evoked by exogenous ATP, accompanied by reduction of the offset current.

Six modified cages featured {{the addition of a}} 1 m wide outer cage surrounding a 10 m square inner cage stocked with intensively fed channel catfish (Ictalarus punctatus). Outer cages were stocked with filter-feeding herbivorous fish including, bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis nilocticus). These species fed on phytoplankton, particulate waste from the inner cage, and periphyton, thereby retaining nutrients and possibly improving water quality around the cages. This experiment compared phosphorus balances of modified cages with three traditional cages also stocked with channel catfish, but which did not include an outer cage. Additional experiments compared growth rates of fish in outer cages to fish in a control cage distant from any impacts of intensively fed inner cages. Water samples were also taken to measure total phosphorus concentrations inside the cages, 1 m outside cages, and at reference sites 500 - 1000 m away from cages. Outer cage fish retained 0. 08 - 0. 1 kg P ton- 1 harvested fish or 0. 05) between modified cages, traditional cages, and reference sites. Even though I concluded that outer cage fish retained nutrients from inner cages, retention was not substantial enough to improve water quality around modified cages.

Patch pipettes {{were used}} to voltage clamp pre- and postsynaptic neurons and to <b>load</b> the <b>caged</b> Ca 2 + chelator o-nitrophenyl EGTA (NPE) and the Ca 2 + indicator BTC into presynaptic neurons. The relationships between presynaptic [Ca 2 +]i and postsynaptic responses were compared between peptidergic and cholinergic synapses formed by cell B 2. Using variable intensity flashes, Ca 2 + stoichiometries of peptide and acetylcholine (ACh) release were approximately 2 and 3, respectively. The difference did not reach statistical significance. ACh quanta summate linearly postsynaptically. We also found a linear dose-response curve for peptide action, indicating a linear relationship between submaximal peptide concentration and response of the SN. The minimum intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca 2 +]i) for triggering peptidergic and cholinergic transmission were estimated to be about 5 and 10 μm, respectively. By comparing normal postsynaptic responses to those evoked by photolysis of NPE, we estimate [Ca 2 +]i at the release trigger site elicited by a single action potential (AP) {{to be at least}} 10 μm for peptidergic synapses and probably higher for cholinergic synapses. Cholinergic release is brief (half-width ≈ 200 ms), even in response to a prolonged rise in [Ca 2 +]i, while some peptidergic release appears to persist for as long as [Ca 2 +]i remains elevated (for up to 10 s). This may reflect differences in sizes of reserve pools, or in replenishment rates of immediately releasable pools of vesicles. Electron microscopy revealed that most synaptic contacts had at least one morphologically docked dense core vesicle that presumably contained peptide; these were often located within conventional active zones. Both cholinergic and peptidergic vesicles are docked within active zones, but cholinergic vesicles may be located closer to Ca 2 + channels than are peptidergic vesicles...|$|R
40|$|Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{was applied}} to {{evaluate}} the potential environmental impacts associated with two-net cage aquaculture systems of common carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio) and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in the Cirata reservoir, Indonesia. The studied system included fingerling production in hatcheries, fish rearing in cages, and transport of fry and feed {{as well as that}} of harvested fish to markets. The environmental impact indicators were calculated based on the annual production in 2006 - 2007 using the CML 2 Baseline 2000 method, and expressed per tonne of fresh fish delivered to the market. The rearing performances and the environmental efficiency of the system were highly dependent on the lake water quality. Therefore the location of the cages and associated practices influenced the environmental impacts. Feed was identified as the major contributor to land occupation, primary production use, acidification, climate change, energy use and water dependence. Those impacts were mainly linked to the production of fishmeal followed by the production of crop-based feed materials and the production of electricity for feed processing. Eutrophication was mainly the consequence of the fish growing stage and linked closely to nutrient <b>loading</b> from <b>cages.</b> Better feeding practices to reduce feed conversion ratio (FCR), as well as improvement of feed composition by using less fishmeal and more local plant-based materials along with improving energy efficiency of feed production processing should be implemented to improve the environmental profiles of carp and tilapia production. The reduction of FCR from 2. 1 to 1. 7 could decrease eutrophication by about 22 %. However, it is of first priority to reduce the number of cages in order to improve the water quality of the reservoir. The comparison of Cirata reservoir fish culture to other sources of animal protein revealed that it generated average energy use but high eutrophication level. LCA was demonstrated to be a useful tool for decision-making when targeting improved environmental sustainability of cage aquaculture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} brain ventricles {{are lined}} with ciliated ependymal cells. As yet {{little is known about}} the mechanisms by which neurotransmitters regulate cilia beat frequency (CBF). Application of 5 -HT to ependymal cells in cultured rat brainstem slices caused CBF to increase. 5 -HT had an EC 50 of 30 μM and at 100 μM attained a near-maximal CBF increase of 52. 7 ± 4. 1 % (mean ± s. d.) (n= 8). Bathing slices in Ca 2 +-free solution markedly reduced the 5 -HT-mediated increase in CBF. Fluorescence measurements revealed that 5 -HT caused a marked transient elevation in cytosolic Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]c) that then slowly decreased to a plateau level. Analysis showed that the [Ca 2 +]c transient was due to release of Ca 2 + from inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) -sensitive stores; the plateau was probably due to extracellular Ca 2 + influx through Ca 2 + release-activated Ca 2 + (CRAC) channels. Application of ATP caused a sustained decrease in CBF. ATP had an EC 50 of about 50 μM and 100 μM ATP resulted in a maximal 57. 5 ± 6. 5 % (n= 12) decrease in CBF. The ATP-induced decrease in CBF was unaffected by lowering extracellular [Ca 2 +], and no changes in [Ca 2 +]c were observed. Exposure of ependymal cells to forskolin caused a decrease in CBF. Ciliated ependymal cells <b>loaded</b> with <b>caged</b> cAMP exhibited a 54. 3 ± 7. 5 % (n= 9) decrease in CBF following uncaging. These results suggest that ATP reduces CBF by a Ca 2 +-independent cAMP-mediated pathway. Application of 5 -HT and adenosine- 5 ′-O- 3 -thiotriphosphate (ATP-γ-S) to acutely isolated ciliated ependymal cells resulted in CBF responses similar to those of ependymal cells in cultured slices suggesting that these neurotransmitters act directly on these cells. The opposite response of ciliated ependymal cells to 5 -HT and ATP provides a novel mechanism for their active involvement in central nervous system signalling...|$|R
40|$|Background: Anopheles arabiensis {{is one of}} {{the major}} malaria vectors that put {{millions}} of people in endemic countries at risk. Mass-rearing of this mosquito is crucial for strategies that use sterile insect technique to suppress vector populations. The sterile insect technique (SIT) package for this mosquito species is being developed by the Insect Pest Control Subprogramme of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture. To improve mass-rearing outcomes for An. arabiensis, the question of whether the egg production by females would be affected by the size of the adult holding cages, the source of the blood meal and the total number of pupae that could be <b>loaded</b> into the <b>cages</b> was addressed and finally the impact of adding additional pupae to the cage daily to maintain adult numbers on egg productivity assessed. Methods: Mass production cages of two different volumes, two different sources of blood meal (bovine and porcine) and two different population densities (<b>cages</b> originally <b>loaded</b> with either 15, 000 or 20, 000 pupae) were tested and evaluated on the basis of eggs produced/cage or per female. Males and females pupae with a ratio of 1 : 1 were added to the cages at day 1 and 2 of pupation. The emerging adults had constant access to 5...|$|R
40|$|Although {{a lot of}} {{research}} has been performed, large segmental bone defects caused by trauma, infection, bone tumors or revision surgeries still represent big challenges for trauma surgeons. New and innovative bone substitutes are needed. Three-dimensional (3 D) printing is a novel procedure to create 3 D porous scaffolds {{that can be used for}} bone tissue engineering. In the present study, solid discs as well as porous cage-like 3 D prints made of polylactide (PLA) are coated or filled with collagen, respectively, and tested for biocompatibility and endotoxin contamination. Microscopic analyses as well as proliferation assays were performed using various cell types on PLA discs. Stromal-derived factor (SDF- 1) release from cages filled with collagen was analyzed and the effect on endothelial cells tested. This study confirms the biocompatibility of PLA and demonstrates an endotoxin contamination clearly below the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) limit. Cells of various cell types (osteoblasts, osteoblast-like cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells) grow, spread and proliferate on PLA-printed discs. PLA <b>cages</b> <b>loaded</b> with SDF- 1 collagen display a steady SDF- 1 release, support cell growth of endothelial cells and induce neo-vessel formation. These results demonstrate the potential for PLA scaffolds printed with an inexpensive desktop printer in medical applications, for example, in bone tissue engineering...|$|R
