2500|$|The Montenegrin Orthodox Church {{was founded}} in Cetinje on October 31, 1993, by Antonije Abramović, {{allegedly}} with the <b>Liberal</b> <b>Alliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>Montenegro</b> (LSCG), a political party that existed at the time. At the time, Montenegro {{was part of the}} federal state with Serbia called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was formed a year earlier following a 1992 referendum. LSCG, a party with a pro-independence agenda, is claimed to having used MOC as a tool in their quest for Montenegrin sovereignty. At that time, the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) maintained close ties to Milošević's administration in Serbia, and therefore the initial activities of the MOC were very sporadic.|$|E

Metropolitan Antonije Abramović (initially vehemently supported by the biggest pro-independence party in Montenegro at the time [...] <b>Liberal</b> <b>Alliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>Montenegro</b> (LSCG)) was the first leader {{of the church in}} 1993. After his death, he was replaced by Metropolitan Dedeić. Most liberals did not approve of this change, and their support for the church soon started to fade. After 1997 the Government of the Republic of Montenegro started supporting and financing the Church, receiving support from both the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro and the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro; however, after 2001 this support seemingly waned.|$|E
