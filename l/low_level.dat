Thus, other things being equal, individuals in the United States at the <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> of Educational Attainment with parents also at the <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> of Educational Attainment, were more than 10 times more likely to score in the <b>lowest</b> <b>levels</b> of the Literacy scale than individuals whose Educational Attainment was at least upper secondary, as was that of their parents.|$|R
5|$|Wind shear affects sailboats {{in motion}} by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. The effect of <b>low</b> <b>level</b> wind shear can be factored into {{the selection of}} sail twist in the sail design, but this {{can be difficult to}} predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for <b>low</b> <b>level</b> wind shear, for example using a boom vang.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the prevalence and {{factors associated with}} <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> of lumbar strength in adolescents. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study involving 601 adolescents, aged 14 to 17 years, enrolled in {{public schools in the}} western region of Santa Catarina State - Southern Brazil. Lumbar strength was analyzed by the lumbar extension test developed by the Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology, which proposes different cutoffs for boys and girls. Independent variables were sex, age, socioeconomic status, dietary habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aerobic fitness. For data analysis, univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used, with significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: The prevalence of <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> of lumbar strength was 27. 3 %. The population subgroups most likely to present <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> of lumbar strength were females (OR: 1. 54, 95 % CI : 1. 06 to 2. 23), adolescents with <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> of aerobic fitness (OR: 2. 10, 95 % CI: 1. 41 to 3. 11) and the overweight (OR: 2. 28, 95 % CI: 1. 35 to 3. 81). CONCLUSION: Almost one-third of the studied students have <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> of lumbar strength. Interventions in the school population should be taken with special attention to female adolescents, those with <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> of aerobic fitness, and those with overweight, as these population subgroups were most likely to demostrate <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> of lumbar strength...|$|R

5|$|On August 31, Jimena {{encountered}} strong southerly wind shear, {{causing it}} to quickly weaken back to a tropical storm by September 1.

Jimena continued to weaken as wind shear increased and the storm weakened to a tropical depression on September 3. After weakening back to a depression, Jimena crossed the International Date Line on September 5 at 0600 UTC, where it became the first storm to exist in all three Pacific basins since 1999's Hurricane Dora. However, Jimena was only tracked briefly by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, since strong wind shear resulted in the <b>low</b> <b>level</b> circulation to be exposed from the center and at 1727 UTC, the <b>low</b> <b>level</b> had nearly dissipated.

5|$|Over {{the next}} day the system moved north-westwards and {{gradually}} developed further, before the JMA reported that the system had developed into a tropical storm and named it Bavi during March 11. Later that day as the system's <b>low</b> <b>level</b> circulation centre continued to consolidated and deep convection wrapped into it, the JTWC initiated advisories and designated the system as 03W. The system subsequently continued to gradually intensify as it moved westwards, around the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge of high pressure located to the northwest of the system. During March 14, the system peaked as a tropical storm with the JMA reporting 10-minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph), while the JTWC reported 1-minute sustained winds of 95km/h (60mph). By this time the system was approaching the Mariana islands and had started to weaken, with system's <b>low</b> <b>level</b> circulation becoming partially exposed and displaced from the atmospheric convection. As a result of this the system's <b>low</b> <b>level</b> circulation passed over Guam during March 15, while convection associated with the system passed over the Northern Mariana islands. Over {{the next couple of days}} the system moved westwards and continued to weaken, before it weakened into a tropical depression during March 17, as it moved into the Philippine area of responsibility where it was named Betty by PAGASA. The JTWC stopped monitoring Bavi during March 19, after the system had weakened into a tropical disturbance, however, the JMA continued to monitor the system as a tropical depression, until it dissipated within the Philippines, during March 21.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome depends on findings such as rapid development of muscle paralysis, absent reflexes, absence of fever, and a likely cause. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (through a lumbar spinal puncture) and nerve conduction studies are supportive investigations commonly {{performed in the}} {{diagnosis of}} GBS. Testing for antiganglioside antibodies is often performed, but their contribution to diagnosis is usually limited. Blood tests are generally performed to exclude the possibility of another cause for weakness, such as a <b>low</b> <b>level</b> of potassium in the blood. An abnormally <b>low</b> <b>level</b> of sodium in the blood is often encountered in Guillain–Barré syndrome.
