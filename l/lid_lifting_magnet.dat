40|$|An iron ball floats {{in midair}} {{in a plastic}} box when several iron balls were {{attracted}} by a permanent magnet. A complex interaction between magnetized sphere materials and a <b>lifting</b> <b>magnet</b> enabled the suspension of an iron ball. The balls {{in the first row}} are simply attracted by the <b>lifting</b> <b>magnet.</b> The ball in the second row is also attracted by the <b>lifting</b> <b>magnet,</b> however, due to the repulsive forces exerted from the balls sitting above, it can float in midair. We also found that there are two stable positions for the ball to float. The floating ball could be transported from one equilibrium position to another by simply rotating the <b>lifting</b> <b>magnet.</b> This will make it possible to construct a noncontact load transport device.

[...] The load itself would be based on the maximum load that the equipment can lift safely. Lifting equipment that is designed for lifting people must also be appropriately and clearly marked.|$|R

The British bred Salad Dodger caught the Irish leader on the run in to claim the huge prize with Droopys Ward just failing to catch Salad Dodger after overtaking Crokers Champ for second place.

5000|$|In many {{practical}} applications of electromagnets, such as motors, generators, transformers, <b>lifting</b> <b>magnets,</b> and loudspeakers, the iron core {{is in the}} form of a loop or magnetic circuit, possibly broken by a few narrow air gaps. [...] This is because the magnetic field lines are in the form of closed loops. Iron presents much less [...] "resistance" [...] (reluctance) to the magnetic field than air, so a stronger field can be obtained if most of the magnetic field's path is within the core.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. At present, {{the lifting}} {{electromagnet}} {{is widely used}} in almost all {{the countries in the}} world. But it has some fatal disadvantages related to the electrical power input that it requires among other things. To eliminate these disadvantages, a Rare Earth <b>lifting</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> was designed. This paper introduces the magnetic circuit design of <b>lifting</b> permanent <b>magnet.</b> At the same time, a perfect self-acting driving system has been invented, which guarantees that the attracted cargoes can be lifted or unloaded fast and conveniently without using any electricity at all...|$|R

Guangs have a vertical handle {{at one end and}} a spout at the other, both zoomorphic, and were often highly decorated with taotie. The handle of the guang is of often {{in the shape of the}} neck and head of an animal with stylized horns, and the spout of the vessel is in the form of the head of a creature whose mouth constitutes the end of the spout. The back and animal head at the pouring end usually are a removable <b>lid,</b> <b>lifted</b> off for pouring.|$|R
50|$|It can be {{seen that}} to {{maximize}} the force, a core with a short flux path L and a wide cross sectional area A is preferred (this also applies to magnets with an air gap). To achieve this, in applications like <b>lifting</b> <b>magnets</b> (see photo above) and loudspeakers a flat cylindrical design is often used. The winding is wrapped around a short wide cylindrical core that forms one pole, and a thick metal housing that wraps around the outside of the windings forms {{the other part of the}} magnetic circuit, bringing the magnetic field to the front to form the other pole.|$|R

The Garden Egg Chair is known by several names; “seftenberger ei, pod chair, l’œuf en garden(egg)chair.” Elastogran/Reuter produced the plastic polyurethane. Ghyczy's job was to start a design centre {{in order to show}} industrial customers polyurethane's potential. The Garden Egg Chair {{is one of the first}} chairs made with polyurethane. For a long time, the chair was produced by the East German company VEB-Synthese-Werk, but since 1998, it has been produced in the Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|Pot pourri à vaisseau or pot pourri en navire ("{{pot-pourri}} holder as a vessel/ship") is a {{shape of}} a number of pot-pourri vases in the shape of masted ships, first produced between the late 1750s to the early 1760s by the Sèvres manufactory near Paris. The colours and details of the painted decoration vary between examples, as is typical of Sèvres porcelain, and some examples have been placed on later bases of ormolu. The openwork <b>lid</b> <b>lifts</b> off to allow refilling of the pot-pourri. The shape was eventually produced in two or three versions, at slightly different sizes. It was first designed in 1757, probably by Jean-Claude Duplessis (c. 1695-1774), the artistic director of the factory. The first surviving finished example dates to 1759. [...] Another name for them is vaisseau à mat (masted ship).|$|R

5000|$|... − In 1964, the Cascade-Spring Glen Community Club {{requested}} that the King County Library System (KCLS) start a library in their club-owned building at 11635 SE 170th Place. A lease was signed in November and the Vista Library was born. It was furnshed with an establishment grant from the Washington State Library and the collection was supplied by KCLS. KCLS purchased the Vista Library building in 1967 and the Cascade-Spring Glen Community Club donated $10,000 for remodeling costs. The remodeling began in February 1969 and was completed in April. The Vista Library reopened the remodeled 1,440-square-foot facility on May 19, 1969, complete with new landscaping donated by the Carriage Lane Garden Club. As {{a result of a}} <b>lid</b> <b>lift</b> approval in March 1980, planning for construction of a new Fairwood Library and three other KCLS buildings began. The residents of Fairwood had been so excited about the prospect of a new library that they organized a committee and helped distribute 10,000 copies of a flyer urging residents to vote “yes” on the library proposition. After the <b>lid</b> <b>lift</b> was passed, Mithun Architects was chosen to design the new Fairwood Library on 140th Avenue SE, across from the entrance to the Fairwood Golf Course. The Fairwood/Vista Library Friends generated an enormous amount of community support for the new building, including a special book fair with local authors and other special events. The new 15,000-square-foot library, with a capacity of 90,000 items, opened its door on January 21, 1986. Later that year, on October 4, 1986, an oil painting of Mount Rainier by Byron Birdsall entitled “Sentinel” was installed in honor of Harold O. Sternberg, a KCLS’ construction coordinator who was instrumental {{in the development of the}} Fairwood Library. In 1987, the Fairwood Library won an American Institute of Architects (AIA)/American Library Association (ALA) Award of Excellence for its design.The library was renovated in 2013/2014, increasing the floor area by 1/3.|$|R

40|$|The module has a movable {{vibrator}} head (2) with {{at least}} two plates (6, 8). One plate (8) carries a holder (10) for parts or tools. The two plates are parallel to a base of the vibrator head remote from the workpiece and are driven in oscillation along a longitudinal direction so that the tool holder vibrates in a plane. Each plate has a through opening (18, 20) for a rotary drive connection from the holder to a drive unit (24) {{on the other side of}} the plate from the workpiece. The plate on the workpiece side rotatably encloses the holder. The plates can be positioned wrt. each other and the head base for fine positioning. The positioning and oscillating drives for the plates are each provided by <b>lifting</b> <b>magnets</b> (28, 30) interacting with a sprung return device (36, 38). ADVANTAGE - Compact module can be manufactured efficiently...|$|R
50|$|Repulsive {{systems have}} a major {{downside}} as well. At slow speeds, the current induced in these coils by the slow change in magnetic flux with respect to time, is not large enough to produce a repulsive electromagnetic force sufficient to support {{the weight of the}} train. For this reason the train must have wheels or some other form of landing gear to support the train until it reaches a speed that can sustain levitation. Since a train may stop at any location, due to equipment problems for instance, the entire track must be able to support both low-speed and high-speed operation. Another downside is that the repulsive system naturally creates a field in the track in front and {{to the rear of the}} <b>lift</b> <b>magnets,</b> which act against the magnets and create a form of drag. This is generally only a concern at low speeds, at higher speeds the effect does not have time to build to its full potential and other forms of drag dominate.|$|R
