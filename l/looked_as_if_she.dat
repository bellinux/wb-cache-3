5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E
500|$|During this period, Hershey {{changed her}} stage name to [...] "Seagull". In 1979, a blunt {{newspaper}} article from the Knight News Service referenced {{this period of}} her life, saying of her acting career that [...] "it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> blew it." [...] The article referred to Hershey as a [...] "kook" [...] and stated that she was frequently [...] "high on something." [...] In addition to that criticism, she had been ostracized for breast-feeding her son during an appearance on The Dick Cavett Show, and for breast-feeding him beyond {{the age of two}} years. She said that this period of her life hurt her career; [...] "Producers wouldn't see me because I had a reputation for using drugs and being undependable. I never used drugs at all and I have always been serious about my acting career." [...] After splitting up with Carradine, she changed her stage name back to [...] "Hershey", explaining that she had told the story of why she adopted the name [...] "Seagull" [...] so many times that it had lost its meaning.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, she starred {{alongside}} Denzel Washington in {{the action}} film The Book of Eli. Although the film received mixed reviews, it performed well at the box office, grossing over $157million worldwide. Film critic Richard Roeper praised Kunis's performance, calling it a [...] "particularly strong piece of work". Several other reviews were equally positive, including that of Pete Hammond of Boxoffice magazine, who wrote that she's [...] "ideally cast in the key female role" [...] Even reviewers who didn't necessarily like the film complimented her performance, such as James Berardinelli, who wrote that [...] "the demands of the role prove to be within her range, which is perhaps surprising considering she has been thus far pigeonholed into more lightweight parts", and Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, who wrote that she [...] "generated a spark and brought a degree of determination to her character, developing an independent female character who's not always in need of rescuing." [...] Other critics, such as Claudia Puig of USA Today felt she was miscast, noting that [...] "she <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial". Kunis received another Teen Choice Award nomination for her performance. Kunis was also cast in a minor role in the 2010 comedy film Date Night, starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell. She garnered several positive reviews for her performance. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune concluded her performance with James Franco helped save the film and gave it [...] "a shot in the arm." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dwarfs {{are native}} to Narnia. They are called Sons of Earth by Aslan, {{as opposed to}} humans, who are called Sons of Adam or Daughters of Eve. Dwarfs exist {{in at least two}} varieties: Black Dwarfs and Red Dwarfs, {{distinguished}} by the colour of their hair. While many Red Dwarfs are kind and loyal to Aslan, Black Dwarfs appear to be more selfish and hostile. Dwarfs appearing in the books are male and live together in communities, although they are known to mingle with and reproduce with humans. For example, Prince Caspian's Tutor Cornelius is a half-dwarf, and Caspian's former nurse is described as [...] "a little old woman who <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had dwarf blood in her".|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} Soap Opera, Dorothy Hobson {{suggests}} that Raquel epitomised {{the representation of}} Northern working-class women during the 1990s: [...] "Raquel articulated the hopes of many young women in her position. The character was complex; one that the whole audience loved, she was naive, gentle, and although she <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would break men's hearts, {{for the most part}} it was her own heart that was broken." [...] Hobson deemed Raquel's breakdown at the registry office prior to her marriage to Curly [...] "one of the most poignant and heartbreaking of any scene in a soap opera, or indeed in any other dramas." [...] She felt that in sobbing with awareness that she was marrying not for love but security, Raquel [...] "spoke of the young working-class women, bright, intelligent, who had been failed by the education system, thus united the shared cultural knowledge of the audience as she wept for herself and millions of other women like her." ...|$|E
