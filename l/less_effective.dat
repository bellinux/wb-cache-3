5|$|After the Second World War, {{the use of}} radar made {{camouflage}} generally <b>less</b> <b>effective.</b> However, camouflage {{may have}} helped to protect US warships from Vietnamese shore batteries using optical rangefinders.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, radar made {{camouflage}} generally <b>less</b> <b>effective,</b> though coastal {{boats are}} sometimes painted like land vehicles. Aircraft camouflage too {{came to be}} seen as less important because of radar, and aircraft of different air forces, such as the Royal Air Force's Lightning, were often uncamouflaged.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} antibiotics are used for C. difficile, with the available agents being more or <b>less</b> equally <b>effective.</b>|$|R
5|$|Oral {{contraceptive}} pills have contradictory {{results from}} different studies regarding any effect of decreasing relapse rate {{in women with}} multiple sclerosis. Certain medications for MS symptoms, such as carbamazepine (used to treat spasms and pain) and modafinil (used to treat fatigue) can make oral contraceptive pills <b>less</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E
5|$|Short-pitched bowling {{continues}} to be permitted in cricket, even when aimed at the batsman. However, over time, several of the Laws of Cricket were changed to render the bodyline tactic <b>less</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be <b>less</b> <b>effective</b> than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is <b>less</b> <b>effective</b> than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E
50|$|In British Columbia, Canada {{the cost}} of the PPIs varies {{significantly}} from 0.20 CAD to 2.38 CAD per dose while all agents in the class appear more or <b>less</b> equally <b>effective.</b>|$|R
50|$|Intravaginal agents: butoconazole, clotrimazole, miconazole, nystatin, tioconazole, terconazole. Candidal {{vulvovaginitis}} {{in pregnancy}} {{should be treated}} with intravaginal clotrimazole or nystatin for at least 7 days. All are more or <b>less</b> equally <b>effective.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{two common}} {{mechanical}} methods of control. One {{is to use}} a protective covering to wrap the fruit while it develops. The other is to use baited traps. The latter is <b>less</b> cost <b>effective.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Jayhawks' {{ground game}} was <b>less</b> <b>effective</b> than their pass offense, but still had success against a tough Virginia Tech defense. Running back Brandon McAnderson, Kansas' leading rusher, {{finished}} {{the game with}} 15carries for 75yards. Backup running back Jake Sharp rushed nine times for 33yards, including several key first-down runs.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of effective time-delay shells {{at the end}} of World War I made this scheme much <b>less</b> <b>effective,</b> as the intact shell would penetrate layers of weak armour and explode deep inside the ship. In addition, she was grossly overweight compared to her original design, making her a wet ship with a highly stressed structure.|$|E
5|$|The new ball rule {{also meant}} that spin bowling was <b>less</b> <b>effective</b> in the Tests, so Australia only used one {{full-time}} spinner in the Tests, off spinner Johnson, until his omission in favour of leg spinner Ring. Together they took only eight wickets.|$|E
50|$|A 2017 {{study found}} this testing to be <b>less</b> cost <b>effective</b> as {{compared}} to colonoscopy or fecal occult blood testing. Three-year sDNA screening has been estimated to cost $11,313 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) compared with no screening.|$|R
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} before Pinoy Idols premiere, Torre gave the lapses in Philippine Idol which he hoped Pinoy Idol should not replicate, such as Agoncillo's <b>less</b> than <b>effective</b> hosting style and the somewhat scripted and less wise comments of Magalona and Corrales.|$|R

5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Parkinson's disease, with {{treatment}} directed at improving symptoms. Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication levodopa (L-DOPA), with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes <b>less</b> <b>effective.</b> As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost, these medications become <b>less</b> <b>effective</b> {{while at the same}} time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems, is less strong.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, the {{universal}} adoption of radar made traditional camouflage generally <b>less</b> <b>effective,</b> {{and led to}} development of stealth ships, a form of radar camouflage. However, camouflage may have helped United States warships avoid hits from Vietnamese shore batteries which used optical rangefinders. Some U. S. Navy PTF boats were camouflaged experimentally in 1975 with green overall, broken up by patterns of gray and black. USS Freedom, a littoral combat ship, is however {{said to be the}} first U.S. Navy ship to have camouflage reminiscent of that used in the World Wars.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} by British staff {{officers of the}} initial period of the Normandy campaign found that 7% of all German tanks destroyed by British forces were knocked out by PIATs, compared to 6% by rockets fired by aircraft. However, {{they also found that}} once German tanks had been fitted with armoured skirts that detonated hollow-charge ammunition before it could penetrate the tank's armour, the weapon became much <b>less</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E
25|$|Control has {{a meaning}} of {{mitigation}} {{by reducing the}} numbers of introduced species down to ecologically and economically less harmful level. Since it is not complete wiping out strategy, {{this has to be}} taken constantly and repeatedly. This strategy is said to be feasible but <b>less</b> cost <b>effective</b> due to its incompleteness.|$|R
50|$|AGM and Gel-cell {{batteries}} {{are also used}} for recreational marine purposes, with AGM being more commonly available. AGM deep-cycle marine {{batteries are}} offered {{by a number of}} suppliers. They typically are favored for their low maintenance and spill-proof quality, although generally considered a <b>less</b> cost <b>effective</b> solution relative to traditional flooded cells.|$|R

5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could not afford to wait out the {{prosecution}} of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became <b>less</b> <b>effective</b> against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal orb webs {{are fairly}} common, despite being <b>less</b> <b>effective</b> at intercepting and {{retaining}} prey and {{more vulnerable to}} damage by rain and falling debris. Various researchers have suggested that horizontal webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight. However, {{there is no single}} explanation for the common use of horizontal orb webs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to obvious dangers such as rodenticides, insecticides, and herbicides, cats may be poisoned by many chemicals usually considered safe by their human guardians, because their livers are <b>less</b> <b>effective</b> at {{some forms of}} detoxification than those of many other animals, including humans and dogs. Some {{of the most common}} causes of poisoning in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits. Cats may be particularly sensitive to environmental pollutants. When a cat has a sudden or prolonged serious illness without any obvious cause, it has possibly been exposed to a toxin.|$|E
40|$|Point {{sources of}} water-quality {{impairment}} {{have been reduced}} due to their ease of identification and {{the passage of the}} Clean Water Act in 1972. However, water-quality problems remain, and as further point-source control becomes <b>less</b> cost <b>effective,</b> attention is being directed towards the role of agricultural nonpoint sources in water-quality degradation. Today, continuing water-quality impairment has led to major initiatives to reduce losse...|$|R
30|$|A typical {{problem here}} {{is the lack of}} {{preparedness}} prior to these natural events, making any governmental action afterward <b>less</b> cost <b>effective.</b> Despite the need, the current Drought Alleviation Plan formulated by the Chilean government for the region (FOSIS 2008) does not include strategies for drought early warning, and the feasibility of such a system has yet to be demonstrated.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} two {{solutions}} (massive and scaling) for the covariant Yang–Mills Dyson–Schwinger equations within stochastic quantization, {{and find that}} the scaling solution does not survive outside Landau gauge. We also see that the (rainbow) massive solution has <b>less</b> Faddeev–Popov <b>effective</b> action. Finally, we argue that gluon confinement has only been marginally established in experiment and suggest further empirical work. ...|$|R
5|$|In the Test series, Hirst scored 217 runs at {{an average}} of 24.11 and took 15 wickets {{at an average}} of 30.06. He scored 569 runs at 33.47 and took 36 wickets at 24.50 over all {{first-class}} games on the tour. His best bowling performance was five for 37 against Tasmania. Warner described Hirst as a very consistent batsman throughout the tour, and noted that while he was a <b>less</b> <b>effective</b> bowler in Australian conditions than at home, he was often unlucky.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, {{there is evidence that}} fish predators such as blueheads may adapt to visual cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism <b>less</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E
5|$|Japanese website ITmedia {{reviewed}} the beta version in September 2004. The reviewer enjoyed the experience overall and found communication with other players easy, but {{found a few}} faults with the game that they hoped would be resolved later, and generally found the female characters <b>less</b> <b>effective</b> in battle. During its first day of operation, the game registered 200,000 users, making it the best-selling mobile game up until that time, and was accessed 1.6 million times. According to Ito, by 2006, the game was still highly popular in Japan.|$|E
50|$|An {{advantage}} of celebrity branding is by using social networks, {{as it is}} a <b>less</b> cost <b>effective</b> scheme of assembling and distributing information so that consumers become more aware of the product before purchasing it, as well as having great online consumer reviews will increase sales due to great advertisement done by the company/brand and the celebrity promoting the product.|$|R
50|$|Since {{traditional}} {{production systems}} require little investment {{and serve as}} a safety net for lower income households, prevention and treatment can been seen as <b>less</b> cost <b>effective</b> than letting a few birds die. Effective control not only requires prior agreements to be made with relevant government agencies, such as seen with Indonesia, they must also not unduly threaten food security.|$|R
