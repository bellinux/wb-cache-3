40|$|The {{spite of}} being the most {{established}} laser processing technology since more than 25 years, <b>laser</b> beam <b>cutting</b> is still a rapidly developing technology. New laser sources with higher power and improved beam quality {{as well as the}} modern drive and control equipment together with advanced process developments allow a significant increase in cutting speed and cutting depth at excellent quality features. About laser beam slitting of sheet metal coils with speeds up to more than 100 m/min and the corresponding system technology of the world's first industrial laser slitting line has recently been reported.

25|$|A {{chemical}} oxygen iodine laser is {{an infrared}} chemical laser. The chemical oxygen iodine laser {{was invented by}} the United States Air Force's Phillips Laboratory in 1977 for military purposes. Its properties make it useful for industrial processing as well; the beam is focusable and can be transferred by an optical fiber, as its wavelength is not absorbed much by fused silica but is very well absorbed by metals, making it suitable for <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> and drilling. COIL is the main weapon laser for the military airborne laser and advanced tactical laser programs.|$|E
25|$|Slotted liners can be {{selected}} {{as an alternative}} to pre-holed liner, sometimes as a personal preference or from established practice on a field.

The slotted liner is machined with multiple longitudinal slots, for example 2mm x 50mm, spread across the length and circumference of each joint. Recent advances in <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> means that slotting can now be done much cheaper to much smaller slot widths and in some situation slotted liner is now used for the same functionality as sand control screens.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} best use a diamond gemstone's {{material}} properties, {{a number of}} different diamond cuts have been developed. A diamond cut constitutes a more or less symmetrical arrangement of facets, which together modify the shape and appearance of a diamond crystal. Diamond cutters must consider several factors, such as the shape and size of the crystal, when choosing a cut. The practical history of diamond cuts {{can be traced back to}} the Middle Ages, while their theoretical basis was not developed until the turn of the 20th century. Design creation and innovation continue to the present day: new technology—notably <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> and computer-aided design—has enabled the development of cuts whose complexity, optical performance, and waste reduction were hitherto unthinkable.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} to align an optical fiber with another optical fiber, or with an optoelectronic device {{such as a}} light-emitting diode, a laser diode, or a modulator. This can involve either carefully aligning the fiber and placing it {{in contact with the}} device, or can use a lens to allow coupling over an air gap. Typically the size of the fiber mode is much larger than the size of the mode in a laser diode or a silicon optical chip. In this case a tapered or lensed fiber is used to match the fiber mode field distribution to that of the other element. The lens {{on the end of the}} fiber can be formed using polishing, <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> or fusion splicing.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>cutting</b> {{may be used}} to form {{intricate}} designs from PMMA sheets. PMMA vaporizes to gaseous compounds (including its monomers) upon <b>laser</b> <b>cutting,</b> so a {{very clean}} cut is made, and cutting is performed very easily. However, the pulsed lasercutting introduces high internal stresses along the cut edge, which on exposure to solvents produce undesirable [...] "stress-crazing" [...] at the cut edge and several millimetres deep. Even ammonium-based glass-cleaner and almost everything short of soap-and-water produces similar undesirable crazing, sometimes over the entire surface of the cut parts, at great distances from the stressed edge. Annealing the PMMA sheet/parts is therefore an obligatory post-processing step when intending to chemically bond lasercut parts together.|$|E
40|$|From {{industrial}} electrical machine production {{it is well}} known, that {{processing of}} non-oriented electrical steels causes changes in the lattice and microstructure that also affect the magnetic structure. While applying these manufacturing techniques (punching or <b>laser</b> fusion <b>cutting),</b> mechanical and thermal stresses are induced due to elastic and plastic deformation or temperature gradients within the material. For more than 15 years, fusion cutting with CO 2 -lasers enabled a flexible and wear-free production but mostly for prototypes and small batches. Ten years ago, the development of fraction limited solid-state lasers started and thus enabled <b>laser</b> remote <b>cutting.</b> Nowadays, industry demands sheet thicknesses between 0. 35 mm and 0. 5 mm {{due to the fact}} of eddy current loss reduction. Concerning this context, best choice is <b>laser</b> remote <b>cutting</b> (LRC). Within this work, latest results are presented in terms of resulting cutting speed, cutting edge quality and magnetic properties. Cutting speed of LRC beats <b>laser</b> fusion <b>cutting</b> with keeping the high rate of flexibility. The magnetic material properties of laser remote cut laminates are identical or even better to conventional punched parts. Therefore, the manufacturer has been given the possibility to tweak his process towards perfect magnetic behavior or high output volume. All in all, {{it will be possible to}} produce high efficient electrical machines regarding the application demands of the costumer...|$|R

A process integrated surface treatment additionally reduces the manufacturing related magnetic degradation by up to ten percent. Matter under consideration will be the control of cycle time of exemplary stator tooth geometry as well as the magnetic properties in comparison to conventional techniques...|$|R

2500|$|A [...] "casting robot" [...] {{would use}} {{sculpting}} tools and templates to make plaster molds. Plaster {{was selected because}} the molds are easy to make, can make precise parts with good surface finishes, and the plaster can be easily recycled afterward using an oven to bake the water back out. The robot would then cast most of the parts either from nonconductive molten rock (basalt) or purified metals. A carbon dioxide <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> and welding system was also included.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the electrical hazards, lasers may create chemical, mechanical, and other hazards specific to particular installations. [...] Chemical hazards may include materials intrinsic to the laser, such as beryllium oxide in argon ion laser tubes, halogens in excimer lasers, organic dyes dissolved in toxic or flammable solvents in dye lasers, and heavy metal vapors and asbestos insulation in helium cadmium lasers. [...] They may also include materials released during laser processing, such as metal fumes from cutting or surface treatments of metals or the complex mix of decomposition products produced in the high energy plasma of a <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> plastics.|$|E
