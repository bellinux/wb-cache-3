Aims of the studyThe objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether the GABAA/benzodiazepine complex or serotonin neurotransmission mediates the anxiolytic-like effect of <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil.</b> Materials and methodsMale Swiss mice were subjected to the marble-burying test after being exposed to the aroma of <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> (1 – 5 %), amyl acetate (5 %; used as a behaviorally neutral odor), or distilled water for 15 min via inhalation. Additionally, the effect of 5 % <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> was also evaluated in mice subjected to the elevated plus maze. GABAA/benzodiazepine mediation was evaluated by pretreating the mice with the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin before the marble burying test and [3 H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor. Serotonergic mediation was studied by pretreating the mice with O-methyl-[3 H]-N-(2 -[4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]ethyl) -N-(2 -pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY 100635), a serotonin 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist before the marble burying test. We also evaluated changes in the pharmacologically induced serotonin syndrome and the effects of combined administration of subeffective doses of <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> and the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT). ResultsLavender essential oil (1 – 5 %) decreased the number of marbles buried compared with the control and amyl acetate groups. In the elevated plus maze, 5 % <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> inhalation increased the percentage of time spent on and number of entries into the open arms compared with controls. No effect was seen in the number of closed arm entries or number of beam interruptions in the automated activity chamber. Pretreatment with the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin (0. 5 mg/kg) did not modify the behavioral effect of 5 % <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> in the marble-burying test. <b>Lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> also did not alter [3 H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor. Pretreatment with the serotonin 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 (3 mg/kg) blocked the anxiolytic-like effect of <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> and the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist 8 -OH-DPAT (3 mg/kg). A combination of ineffective doses of 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 5 mg/kg) and <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> (0. 1 %) reduced the number of marbles buried. Finally, 5 % <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> attenuated the serotonin syndrome induced by 40 mg/kg fluoxetine plus 80 mg/kg 5 -hydroxytryptophan. ConclusionsThese results indicate an important role for the serotonergic system in the anxiolytic-like effect of <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil...</b>|$|R
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that differences in penis size between individuals are caused not only by genetics, but also by environmental factors such as culture, diet, and chemical or pollution exposure. Endocrine disruption resulting from chemical exposure has been linked to genital deformation in both sexes (among many other problems). Chemicals from both synthetic (e.g., pesticides, anti-bacterial triclosan, plasticizers for plastics) and natural (e.g., chemicals found in tea tree oil and <b>lavender</b> <b>oil)</b> sources have been linked to various degrees of endocrine disruption. Both PCBs and the plasticizer DEHP have been associated with smaller penis size. DEHP metabolites measured from the urine of pregnant women have been significantly associated with the decreased penis width, shorter anogenital distance, and the incomplete descent of testicles of their newborn sons, replicating effects identified in animals. Approximately 25% of US women have phthalate levels similar to those in the study. A 2007 study by University of Ankara, Faculty of Medicine found that penile size may decrease as a result of some hormonal therapy combined with external beam radiation therapy.

40|$|AbstractAimThe {{inhalation}} of Lavandula angustifolia (<b>lavender)</b> essential <b>oil</b> has anxiolytic-like {{effects in}} animal models and humans, but its {{mechanism of action}} is still not fully understood. The inhalation of essential oils can induce anxiolytic effects through {{the central nervous system}} (e. g., lung absorption and bloodstream transport) or stimulation of the olfactory system and secondary activation of brain regions. Thus, the main objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate whether the perception of <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> aroma, when inhaled, is necessary to obtain its anxiolytic-like effects in mice tested in the marble-burying test. Main methodsAnosmia was induced by irrigating the nasal cavity with zinc gluconate+zinc acetate so that the mice could not detect odors in the olfactory discrimination test. The marble-burying test was used to evaluate the anxiolytic-like effects of inhaled <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil.</b> Key findingsAnosmia did not interfere with the anxiolytic-like effect of <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> inhalation in the marble-burying test at concentrations of 2. 5 % (number of marbles buried: vehicle, 4. 7 ± 1. 0; zinc, 6. 2 ± 2. 2; p> 0. 10) and 5 % (number of marbles buried: vehicle, 3. 4 ± 0. 8; zinc, 4. 3 ± 0. 9; p> 0. 10). <b>Lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> at a concentration of 0. 5 % was ineffective. SignificanceThese results suggest that olfactory system activation is unlikely to participate in the anxiolytic-like effect of <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oil</b> inhalation...|$|R

The essential oils were analysed by gas chromatography, gas chromatography– mass spectrometry and headspace gas-chromatography. Multivariate analyses (principal component analysis) identiﬁed three main phytochemical clusters among <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oils,</b> represented by 1, 8 -cineole, linalyl acetate and linalool. Functional properties of the essential oils were checked by (1) estimating cytotoxicity and genotoxicity using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae D 7 strain; (2) determining antifungal activity against three common phytopathogens (Pythium ultimum, Magnaporthe grisea and Botrytis cinerea), by performing an agar vapour bioassay; and (3) calculating the antioxidant capacity by using the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and b-carotene bleaching tests. No mutagenic effects were detected, but multivariate analyses (PLS, partial least squares regression) showed that the essential oils belonging to the linalool cluster were the most cytotoxic. Antifungal activity against phytopathogens conﬁrmed the predictive results of PLS. The differences among <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oils</b> regarding weak antioxidant capacity showed a positive relationship between the high polarity compounds and the DPPH method, as determined by PLS. The opposite effect was shown for the same type of compound and b-carotene. Ketones and esters did not exert any signiﬁcant antioxidant activity. In conclusion, taking <b>lavender</b> essential <b>oils</b> as a model and computing multivariate data of a reduced number of parameters, the proposed approach assured the description of the relationship between a phytocomplex, its constituents and bioactivities, and allowed a comprehensive, predictive approach to be deﬁned, for which the chemical proﬁle provides a possible synergic overall effort in terms of applicative perspectives...|$|R
