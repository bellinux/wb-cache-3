5|$|The terpenoids, {{sometimes}} referred to as isoprenoids, are organic chemicals similar to terpenes, derived from five-carbon isoprene units. There are over 10,000 known types of terpenoids. Most are multicyclic structures which differ from one another in both functional groups, and in basic carbon skeletons. Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 isoprene units, are volatile essential oils such as citronella, <b>limonene,</b> menthol, camphor, and pinene. Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene units, are widely distributed in latex and resins, and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making Rhododendron leaves poisonous. Plant steroids and sterols are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including vitamin D, glycosides (such as digitalis) and saponins (which lyse red blood cells of herbivores).|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{extensive}} ethnomedical tradition, the phytochemistry of P.atriplicifolia {{has been}} the topic of several studies. Analysis of the plant's essential oil has identified over two dozen compounds, although the compounds detected and their relative prevalence have not been consistent. Most analyses have identified various monoterpenes and monoterpenoids as the dominant components, such as carene, eucalyptol, <b>limonene,</b> γ-terpinene, and (+)-β-thujone, although the essential oil of a sample from the Orto Botanico dell'Università di Torino had camphor as its most prevalent component. Other monoterpenes, camphene, α-pinene, and β-pinene are also present, as are sesquiterpenes such as γ-cadinene, δ-cadinene, trans-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. Several terpenoid alcohols—borneol, cedrol, and menthol—have been extracted from P.atriplicifolia, as have caffeic acid and ferulic acid. More complex compounds have been isolated, {{some of which were}} first identified in this manner, including perovskatone; the glycosides atriplisides A and B; and atricins A and B, a pair of triterpenes that are similar to oleanane.|$|E
25|$|<b>Limonene</b> is {{also used}} as a solvent for filament-fused 3D printing. Printers can print the plastic of choice for the model, but erect {{supports}} and binders from HIPS, a polystyrene plastic that is easily soluble in <b>limonene.</b> As it is combustible, <b>limonene</b> has also been considered as a biofuel.|$|E
25|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of carvone is by oxidation of <b>limonene.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Limonene</b> {{is used as}} {{a solvent}} for {{cleaning}} purposes, such as the removal of oil from machine parts, as it is produced from a renewable source (citrus oil, as a byproduct of orange juice manufacture). It {{is used as a}} paint stripper and is also useful as a fragrant alternative to turpentine. <b>Limonene</b> is also used as a solvent in some model airplane glues and as a constituent in some paints. All-natural commercial air fresheners, with air propellants, containing <b>limonene</b> are used by philatelists to remove self-adhesive postage stamps from envelope paper.|$|E
25|$|<b>Limonene</b> occurs {{commonly}} as the d or (R)-enantiomer, but racemizes to dipentene at 300°C. When warmed with mineral acid, <b>limonene</b> isomerizes to the conjugated diene α-terpinene (which {{can also}} easily {{be converted to}} p-cymene). Evidence for this isomerization includes the formation of Diels-Alder adducts between α-terpinene adducts and maleic anhydride.|$|E
25|$|<b>Limonene</b> {{is formed}} from geranyl pyrophosphate, via {{cyclization}} of a neryl carbocation or its equivalent as shown. The final step involves {{loss of a}} proton from the cation to form the alkene.|$|E
25|$|Although not as juicy or tasty as the flesh, {{orange peel}} is edible and has {{significant}} contents of vitamin C, dietary fiber, total polyphenols, carotenoids, <b>limonene</b> and dietary minerals, such as potassium and magnesium.|$|E
25|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of menthol {{has been}} investigated in M. x piperita and the enzymes involved in have been identified and characterized. It begins with the synthesis of the terpene <b>limonene,</b> followed by hydroxylation, and then several reduction and isomerization steps.|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} practiced {{conversion}} of <b>limonene</b> is to carvone. The three step reaction {{begins with the}} regioselective addition of nitrosyl chloride across the trisubstituted double bond. This species is then converted to the oxime with base, and the hydroxylamine is removed to give the ketone-containing carvone.|$|E
25|$|Since {{bacteria}} {{possess the}} ability to make secondary metabolites such as the antibiotic penicillin, their production began quite early during evolution. But they assume more significant roles in eukaryotic and multicellular organisms. In plants they seem to have diversified using mechanisms such as gene duplications, evolution of novel genes and the development of novel biosynthetic pathways. Studies have shown that diversity in some of these compounds may be positively selected for. Cyanogenic glycosides may have been proposed to have evolved multiple times in different plant lineages, and there are several other instances of convergent evolution. For example, the enzymes for synthesis of <b>limonene</b> – a terpene – are more similar between angiosperms and gymnosperms than to their own terpene synthesis enzymes. This suggests independent evolution of the <b>limonene</b> biosynthetic pathway in these two lineages.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{research}} {{has begun to}} identify the various chemicals that are extracted in the distillation process and contribute to gin's flavoring. For example, juniper monoterpenes come from juniper berries. Citric flavors come from chemicals, such as <b>limonene</b> and gamma-terpinene linalool. Spice-like flavors come from chemicals, such as sabinene, delta-3-carene, and para-cymene.|$|E
25|$|<b>Limonene</b> is a colorless liquid {{hydrocarbon}} {{classified as a}} cyclic terpene. The more common D-isomer possesses a strong smell of oranges. It is used in chemical synthesis as a precursor to carvone and as a renewables-based solvent in cleaning products. The less common L-isomer is found in mint oils and has a piney, turpentine-like odor.|$|E
25|$|Epazote {{essential}} oil contains ascaridole (up to 70%), <b>limonene,</b> p-cymene, and smaller amounts of numerous other monoterpenes and monoterpene derivatives (α-pinene, myrcene, terpinene, thymol, camphor and trans-isocarveol). Ascaridole (1,4-peroxido-p-menth-2-ene) is rather an uncommon constituent of spices; another plant owing {{much of its}} character to this monoterpene peroxide is boldo. Ascaridole is toxic and has a pungent, not very pleasant flavor; in pure form, it is an explosive sensitive to shock. Ascaridole content is lower in epazote from Mexico than in epazote grown in Europe or Asia.|$|E
25|$|Pepper {{gets its}} spicy heat mostly from piperine derived {{both from the}} outer fruit and the seed. Black pepper {{contains}} between 4.6% and 9.7% piperine by mass, and white pepper slightly more than that. Refined piperine, by weight, is about one percent as hot as the capsaicin found in chili peppers. The outer fruit layer, left on black pepper, also contains aroma-contributing terpenes, including germacrene (11%), <b>limonene</b> (10%), pinene (10%), alpha-phellandrene (9%), and beta-caryophyllene (7%), which give citrusy, woody, and floral notes. These scents are mostly missing in white pepper, which is stripped of the fruit layer. White pepper can gain different odours (including musty notes) from its longer fermentation stage. The aroma of pepper is attributed to rotundone (3,4,5,6,7,8-Hexahydro-3α,8α-dimethyl-5α-(1-methylethenyl)azulene-1(2H)-one), a sesquiterpene originally discovered in the tubers of cyperus rotundus, which can be detected in concentrations of 0.4 nanograms/L in water and in wine: rotundone is also present in marjoram, oregano, rosemary, basil, thyme, and geranium, {{as well as in}} some Shiraz wines.|$|E
500|$|Fragrances are {{predominantly}} monoterpene isoprenoids, {{with a small}} amount of benzenoids, although N. jonquilla has both equally represented. Another exception is N. cuatrecasasii which produces mainly fatty acid derivatives. The basic monoterpene precursor is geranyl pyrophosphate, and the commonest monoterpenes are <b>limonene,</b> myrcene, and trans-β-ocimene. Most benzenoids are non-methoxylated, while a few species contain methoxylated forms (ethers), e.g. [...] N. bugei. Other ingredient include indole, isopentenoids and very small amounts of sesquiterpenes. Fragrance patterns can be correlated with pollinators, and fall into three main groups (see Pollination).|$|E
500|$|The pulvinic acid {{derivatives}} atromentic acid, variegatic acid, and xerocomic acid {{are present}} in B.calopus mushrooms. These compounds inhibit cytochrome P450—major enzymes involved in drug metabolism and bioactivation. [...] Other compounds found in the fruit bodies include calopinB, and the sesquiterpenoid compounds cyclopinol and boletunonesA and B. The latter two highly oxygenated compounds have significant free-radical scavenging activity in vitro. The compounds 3-octanone (47.0% of total volatile [...] compounds), 3-octanol (27.0%), 1-octen-3-ol (15.0%), and <b>limonene</b> (3.6%) are the predominant volatile components that give the fruit body its odour.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Limonene</b> {{takes its}} name from the lemon, as the rind of the lemon, like other citrus fruits, {{contains}} considerable amounts of this compound, which contributes to their odor. <b>Limonene</b> is a chiral molecule, and biological sources produce one enantiomer: the principal industrial source, citrus fruit, contains D-limonene ((+)-limonene), which is the (R)-enantiomer. Racemic <b>limonene</b> is known as dipentene. [...] D-Limonene is obtained commercially from citrus fruits through two primary methods: centrifugal separation or steam distillation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Limonene</b> is a {{relatively}} stable terpene and can be distilled without decomposition, although at elevated temperatures it cracks to form isoprene. [...] It oxidizes easily in moist air to produce carveol, carvone, and <b>limonene</b> oxide. With sulfur, it undergoes dehydrogenation to p-cymene.|$|E
2500|$|The dextro-form, S-(+)-carvone is {{obtained}} practically pure by the fractional distillation of caraway oil. The levo-form {{obtained from the}} oils containing it usually requires additional treatment to produce high purity R-(−)-carvone. This {{can be achieved by}} the formation an addition compound with hydrogen sulfide, from which carvone may be regenerated by treatment with potassium hydroxide in ethanol and then distilling the product in a current of steam. Carvone may be synthetically prepared from <b>limonene</b> via <b>limonene</b> nitrosochloride which may be formed by treatment of <b>limonene</b> with isoamyl nitrite in glacial acetic acid. This compound is then converted into carvoxime, which can be achieved by refluxing with DMF in isopropanol. Refluxing [...] carvoxime with 5% oxalic acid yields carvone. This procedure affords R-(−)-carvone from R-(+)-limonene. [...] The major use of d-limonene is as a precursor to S-(+)-carvone. [...] The large scale availability of orange rinds, a byproduct in the production of orange juice, has made <b>limonene</b> cheaply available, and synthetic carvone correspondingly inexpensively prepared.|$|E
2500|$|Caraway {{was used}} for {{medicinal}} purposes by the ancient Romans, but carvone was probably not isolated as a pure compound until Franz Varrentrapp (1815–1877) obtained it in 1849. [...] It was originally called carvol by Schweizer. [...] Goldschmidt and Zürrer identified it as a ketone related to <b>limonene,</b> and the structure was finally elucidated by Georg Wagner (1849–1903) in 1894.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} double bonds in carvone capable of {{reduction}}; {{the product of}} reduction depends on the reagents and conditions used. [...] Catalytic hydrogenation of carvone (1) can give either carvomenthol (2) or carvomenthone (3). [...] Zinc and acetic acid reduce carvone to give dihydrocarvone (4). [...] MPV reduction using propan-2-ol and aluminium isopropoxide effects reduction of the carbonyl group only to provide carveol (5); a combination of sodium borohydride and CeCl3 (Luche reduction) is also effective. Hydrazine and potassium hydroxide give <b>limonene</b> (6) via a Wolff-Kishner reduction.|$|E
2500|$|Pure adamantane is a colorless, {{crystalline}} solid with {{a characteristic}} camphor smell. It is practically insoluble in water, but readily soluble in nonpolar organic solvents. Adamantane has {{an unusually high}} melting point for a hydrocarbon. [...] At 270°C, its melting point {{is much higher than}} other hydrocarbons with the same molecular weight, such as camphene (45°C), <b>limonene</b> (−74°C), ocimene (50°C), terpinene (60°C) or twistane (164°C), or than a linear C10H22 hydrocarbon decane (−28°C). However, adamantane slowly sublimes even at room temperature. Adamantane can be distilled with water vapor.|$|E
2500|$|Termite colonies are {{generally}} large enclosed nests or mounds that house large supplies of wood for the termites to exploit, fulfilling the first criteria for fortress defense. In N. corniger, the soldier caste has had their heads modified to spew a noxious, sticky liquid when {{under attack from}} Tamandua anteaters. The secretion contains pinene, <b>limonene</b> and other high molecular weight compounds that deter the anteater from returning. The termites then remain on guard near the breach for several minutes. This adaptive morphology and defense of the habitat are sufficient for satisfying the second two criteria for fortress defense.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Limonene</b> {{is common}} in {{cosmetic}} products. As the main odor constituent of citrus (plant family Rutaceae), d-limonene is used in food manufacturing and some medicines, e.g. as a flavoring to mask the bitter taste of alkaloids, and as a fragrance in perfumery, aftershave lotions, bath products, and other such products that include fragrance. d-Limonene is also used as botanical insecticide. d-Limonene {{is used in the}} organic herbicide [...] "Avenger." [...] It is added to cleaning products, such as hand cleansers to give a lemon-orange fragrance (see orange oil) and for its ability to dissolve oils. In contrast, l-limonene has a piney, turpentine-like odor.|$|E
2500|$|The various basils {{have such}} {{different}} scents because the herb {{has a number}} of different essential oils that come together in different proportions for various breeds. The strong clove scent of sweet basil is derived from eugenol, the same chemical as actual cloves. The citrus scent of lemon basil and lime basil reflects their higher portion of citral, which causes this effect in several plants including lemon mint, and of <b>limonene,</b> which gives actual lemon peel its scent. African blue basil has a strong camphor smell because it contains camphor and camphene in higher proportions. Licorice basil contains anethole, the same chemical that makes anise smell like licorice, and in fact is sometimes called [...] "anise basil." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>limonene</b> {{which is}} the main {{component}} of the oil is a mild irritant, as it dissolves protective skin oils. <b>Limonene</b> and its oxidation products are skin irritants, and limonene-1,2-oxide (formed by aerial oxidation) is a known skin sensitizer. Most reported cases of irritation have involved long-term industrial exposure to the pure compound, e.g. during degreasing or the preparation of paints. However a study of patients presenting dermatitis showed that 3% were sensitized to <b>limonene.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Limonene</b> 1,2-monooxygenase {{flavoprotein}} (FAD).|$|E
50|$|<b>Limonene</b> is also flammable.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, {{specifically}} those acting on ether bonds (ether hydrolases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is limonene-1,2-epoxide hydrolase.
