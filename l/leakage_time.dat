40|$|Background and Aim: Today several {{materials}} {{have been used}} for root- end filling in endodontic surgery. Optimal properties of Pro Root MTA in in-vitro and in-vivo studies has been proven. On the other hand, based on some studies, Root MTA (Iranian Pro Root MTA) and Portland cement are similar to Pro Root MTA in physical and biologic properties. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate bacterial leakage (amount and mean <b>leakage</b> <b>time)</b> of four root- end filling materials. Materials and Methods: In this experimental in-vitro study, seventy six extracted single- rooted human teeth were randomly divided into six groups for root-end filling with gray Pro Root MTA, white Pro Root MTA, Root MTA (Iranian Pro Root MTA), Portland Cement (type I) and positive and negative control groups. Root canals were instrumented using the step- back technique. Root- end filling materials were placed in 3 mm ultra sonic retro preparations. Samples and microleakage model system were sterilized in autoclave. The apical 3 - 4 mm of the roots were immersed in phenol red with 3 % lactose broth culture medium. The coronal access of each specimen was inoculated every 24 h with a suspension of Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC 10556). Culture media were observed every 24 h for colour change indicating bacterial contamination for 60 days. Statistical analysis was performed using log- rank test with P< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: At the end of study 50 %, 56. 25 %, 56. 25 % and 50 % of specimens filled with Gray Pro Root MTA, White Pro Root MTA. Root MTA and Portland Cement (type I) had evidence of leakage respectively. The mean <b>leakage</b> <b>time</b> was 37. 19 ± 6. 29, 36. 44 ± 5. 81, 37. 69 ± 5. 97 and 34. 81 ± 6. 67 days respectively. Statistical analysis of data showed no significant difference among the leakage (amount and mean <b>leakage</b> <b>time)</b> of the four tested root- end filling materials (P= 0. 9958). Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, there were no significant differences in leakage among the four tested groups at 60 days.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of multilevels on {{decoherence}} and dephasing properties of a quantum system consisting of a nonideal two level subspace, identified as the qubit, and a finite set of higher energy levels above this qubit subspace. The whole system is under interaction with an environmental bath through a Caldeira-Leggett type coupling. The model that we use is an rf-SQUID under macroscopic quantum coherence and coupled inductively to a flux noise characterized by an environmental spectrum. The model interaction can generate dipole couplings which can be appreciable between the qubit and the high levels. The decoherence properties of the qubit subspace is examined numerically using the master equation formalism of the system's reduced density matrix. We calculate the relaxation and dephasing times as the spectral parameters of the environment are varied. We observe that, these calculated time scales receive contribution from all available frequencies in the noise spectrum (even well above the system's resonant frequency scales) stressing the dominant role played by the nonresonant transitions. The relaxation and dephasing and the <b>leakage</b> <b>times</b> thus calculated, strongly depend on the appreciably interacting levels determined by the strength of the dipole coupling. Under the influence of these nonresonant and multilevel effects, the validity of the two level approximation is dictated not by the low temperature as conveniently believed, but by these multilevel dipole couplings as well as the availability of the environmental modes. © 2005 The American Physical Society...|$|R

We present a reservoir computing approach for functionally identifying a biological neural network, i. e. for building an artificial system that is functionally equivalent to the reference biological network. Employing feed-forward and recurrent networks with fading memory, i. e. reservoirs, we propose a point process based learning algorithm to train the internal parameters of the reservoir and the connectivity between the reservoir and the memoryless readout neurons. Specifically, the model is an Echo State Network (ESN) with leaky integrator neurons, whose individual <b>leakage</b> <b>time</b> constants are also adapted. The proposed ESN algorithm learns a predictive model of stimulus-response relations in in vitro and simulated networks, i. e. it models their response dynamics. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicates that these ESNs can imitate the response signal of a reference biological network. Reservoir adaptation improved the performance of an ESN over readout-only training methods in many cases. This also held for adaptive feed-forward reservoirs, which had no recurrent dynamics.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a latchable phase-change mi-crovalve with integrated microheaters, which {{is suitable for}} lab-on-a-chip systems where minimal energy consumption is desired. The microvalve exploits low-melting-point paraffin wax, whose solid–liquid phase changes allow switching of fluid flow through deformable microchannel ceiling. Switching is initiated by melting of paraffin through an integrated microheater, with an additional pneumatic pressure used for the open-to-close switching. The valve consumes energy only during initiation of valve switching. When paraffin solidifies, the switched state is maintained passively. The microvalve was fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane through multilayer soft lithography techniques. Experiments show that the valve can switch flow within 4 – 8 s due to the small thermal mass and localized melting of paraffin wax; when closed, the valve can passively withstand an inlet pressure over 50 kPa without <b>leakage.</b> <b>Time</b> response of the valve can be further improved with improved heater and wax chamber designs, while the latching abil-ity can be improved by optimizing the wax chamber/membrane design. Compared to existing latchable phase-change valves, the microvalve has no risk of cross-contamination. In addition, the improved sealing offered by the compliant membrane makes the valve robust and flexible in operation, allowing large ranges of initiation pressure from various actuation schemes.

Materials and Methods: Seventy single-rooted mandibular premolars were instrumented and obturated by cold lateral compaction technique. The teeth were randomly divided into four experimental groups according to used material: CEM, MTA, amalgam and composite resin (n= 15) and two control groups (n= 5). In experimental groups, 2 mm of coronal gutta-percha was removed and replaced with the study material. All the teeth were mounted in a two-chamber apparatus and the coronal portion was exposed to human saliva. The day the turbidity occurred was recorded for each sample. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Results: The negative control group showed no leakage while the average microleakage time in the positive control group was 3. 5 days. The average bacterial leakage times for amalgam, composite resin, MTA, and CEM groups were 27. 42 ± 3. 6, 29. 35 ± 3. 15, 52. 57 ± 2. 87, and 50. 42 ± 2. 73 days, respectively.

40|$|International audienceMagnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroen- cephalography (EEG) source {{localization}} is an ill-posed problem {{due to a}} {{small number}} of sensors measuring the brain activity. This results in a non-unique source estimate. To identify an appropriate solution out of an infinite set of possible candidates, the problem requires setting certain constraints depending on the assumptions or a priori knowledge about the source distri- bution. Different constraints have been proposed so far, mainly those that impose sparsity on the source reconstruction in both standard and time-frequency domains. Source localization in the time-frequency domain has already been investigated using Gabor dictionary in both a convex (TF-MxNE) and non-convex way (Iterative Reweighted TF-MxNE). The iterative reweighted (ir) TF-MxNE solver has been shown to outperform TF-MxNE in both source recovery and amplitude bias. However, the choice of an optimal dictionary remains unsolved. Due to a mixture of signals, i. e. short transient signals (right after the stimulus onset) and slower brain waves, the choice of a single dictionary explaining simultaneously both signals types in a sparse way is difficult. In this work, we introduce a method to improve the source estimation relying on a multi-scale dictionary, i. e. multiple dictionaries with different scales concatenated to fit short transients and slow waves at the same time. We compare our results with irTF-MxNE on realistic simulation, then we use somatosensory data to demonstrate the benefits of the approach on in terms of reduced <b>leakage</b> (<b>time</b> courses mixture), temporal smoothness and detection of both signals types...|$|E
