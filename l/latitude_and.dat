5|$|The primary {{atmospheric}} circulation bands consist {{of the trade}} winds in the equatorial region below 30° <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.

5|$|Another dispute exists {{concerning}} the track the hurricane took, specifically between the downgrade to tropical depression and dissipation. The best track and ESSA report both showed that Liza went southwestward through the time period. However, the JTWC final report on Liza reported that Liza made a tiny loop that was entirely within 24°N to 25°N <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> 125°W to 126°W longitude from September 4 to September 6.|$|E
5|$|Karl {{holds the}} record for the northernmost {{formation}} of a November tropical or subtropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean.

However, it stayed over open waters and did not have any effects on land. It was the 11th named storm of the season, and due to the lack of damage, its name was not retired.|$|E
5|$|Subglacial eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption characterized by interactions between lava and ice, often under a glacier. The nature of glaciovolcanism dictates that it occurs at areas of high <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> high altitude.

This meltwater mix means that subglacial eruptions often generate dangerous jökulhlaups (floods) and lahars.|$|E

5|$|The Svalbard Treaty {{was signed}} on 9 February 1920 and came into effect on 14 August 1925.

It secures full Norwegian {{sovereignty}} over the archipelago, but contains several restrictions: peaceful {{use of the}} islands, the non-discrimination of citizens and companies of signatory countries, the obligation to protect the natural environment and limitations in taxation. The treaty has 39 signatories.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} conditions have been significantly altered {{from the original}} conditions {{by the presence of}} life-forms, which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods, and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.|$|E

5|$|This bird breeds {{throughout}} most of North America, from Alaska and Canada southward to northern Florida and Mexico. While robins occasionally overwinter {{in the northern part}} of the United States and southern Canada, most migrate to winter south of Canada from Florida and the Gulf Coast to central Mexico, as well as along the Pacific Coast. Most depart south by the end of August and begin to return north in February and March (exact dates vary with <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> climate).|$|E
5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E
5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> longitude became more precise {{and it became}} possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of {{large areas of the}} ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Faith {{reached the}} northernmost <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> had the longest track of any Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclone. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season, Faith developed {{from an area}} of disturbed weather between Cape Verde and {{the west coast of}} Africa on August21. Tracking westward, the depression gradually intensified and became Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, it continued to slowly strengthen, reaching hurricane status early on August23. About 42hours later, Faith reached an initial peak with winds of 105mph (165km/h), before weakening slightly on August26. Located near the Lesser Antilles, the outer bands of Faith produced gale force winds in the region, especially Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Antigua. Minor coastal damage occurred as far south as Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, the UK {{produced}} derivatives {{of the design}} based on the T-1, {{as opposed to the}} original Mk. XIV. These T-2 and T-4 (Blue Devil) designs had much higher altitude, airspeed and wind-speed settings, suitable for high-altitude bombing in the jet stream. These were normally part of the Navigation and Bombing System, which combined inputs from aircraft instruments, H2S and Green Satin radars, star fixes and radio navigation systems, in a mechanical computer that directly output the <b>latitude</b> <b>and</b> longitude of the aircraft, based on automatic dead reckoning. The same outputs were also sent to the sighting head of the T-4, eliminating the need to manually set the windage and providing those values with much higher accuracy (about ±0.1mph and ±0.1 degrees).|$|E
5|$|Svalbard and Jan Mayen {{constitute}} two {{outlying areas}} of Norway. Svalbard is an archipelago in the Arctic about midway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.

The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act established administration by the appointed Governor of Svalbard. Jan Mayen is a volcanic {{island in the}} Arctic Ocean located at {{the border of the}} Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea. Since 1994, the island has been administrated by the County Governor of Nordland, with some authority delegated to the station commander.|$|E
