25|$|Cape Santo André (Saint Andrew Cape), a {{place that}} shows {{evidence}} of Romanization and of probable earlier importance, was known in Classical Latin as Promontorium Avarus and in Ancient Greek as Auaron akron (Αὔαρον ἄκρον), a name of Celtic origin. It is of ancient cult in Póvoa, and was common to see groups of fishermen, holding lights in their hands, making pilgrimage to the Cape's chapel on the <b>last</b> <b>evening</b> of November. They believed Saint Andrew fished, from the depths, {{the souls of the}} drowned. Those who did not visit Santo André in life would have to make the pilgrimage as a corpse.|$|E

25|$|After {{the opening}} of the airport, Widerøe also applied to operate the route. At the time, the {{ministry}} would select one company who would be granted a concessional monopoly on the route. The concession was granted to Coast Aero Center, which was permitted to operate to Bergen and Stavanger. The ministry stated that Fonnafly was not fully operational while Norving had stated that they could not make money without flying to Oslo. The reason the route to Oslo was dropped, was that there was insufficient capacity at Fornebu. After being rewarded the concession, Coast Aero Center started plans to build a hangar at Sørstokken. The route was set up to leave Stavanger in the morning and fly via Sørstokken to Bergen and then back; this was repeated in the afternoon and then a single round trip was flown from Stavanger to Sørstokken after the <b>last</b> <b>evening</b> plan from Oslo had landed in Stavanger.|$|E

500|$|Rupert died in 1948, {{leaving a}} strong company to his {{daughter}} Bridget D'Oyly Carte. [...] She soon hired Frederic Lloyd as general manager. [...] Bridget and Lloyd also took steps to keep the productions fresh, engaging designers to redesign the costumes and scenery. [...] Peter Goffin, who had redesigned Yeomen (1939) and Ruddigore (1948) for the company, created new settings and costumes for Bridget for half a dozen more productions: The Mikado (1952; settings only, most of the celebrated Charles Ricketts costumes being retained), Patience (1957), The Gondoliers (1958), Trial by Jury (1959), H.M.S. Pinafore (1961; ladies' costumes) and Iolanthe (1961). [...] A new production of Princess Ida in 1954 was designed by James Wade. [...] Eleanor Evans, however, {{was an example of}} one of the company's stage directors (from 1949 to 1953) who was said to be reluctant to update and freshen stagings. In 1957, Goffin designed a unit set for the company to facilitate touring, reducing the number of vans required to carry the scenery from twenty to nine. [...] A 1957 review of Yeomen in The Times praised the production and marvelled at [...] "the continued vitality of the Savoy operas", noting: [...] "The opera remains enchanting; the singing seems, on the whole, better and more musical than that which one used to hear, say, 30 years since; and though the acting lacks some of the richly crusted performances of those days, it is perhaps none the worse for that". [...] In 1949, the company began a new series of recordings with Decca, featuring Green, who had returned to the company after the war, and continued the series with his successor, Peter Pratt. [...] The company cooperated with the production of the 1953 film The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan, which used some former members of the company in the cast. [...] In 1955, the company gave a seven-month tour to the U.S. to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its first American productions.

2500|$|Donizetti's {{obligations}} in Vienna included {{overseeing the}} annual Italian {{season at the}} Theater am Kärntnertor which began in May. Verdi's Nabucco (which Donizetti had seen in Milan at its premiere in March 1842 and with {{which he had been}} impressed) was featured as part of that season. However, his main preoccupation was to complete the orchestration of Maria di Rohan, which was accomplished by 13 February for planned performances in June. The season began with a very successful revival of Linda di Chamounix. Nabucco followed, the first production of a Verdi opera in Vienna. The season also included Don Pasquale in addition to The Barber of Seville. Finally, Maria di Rohan was given on 5 June. In reporting the reaction to this opera in a teasing letter to Antonio Vasselli in Rome, he tried to build suspense, stating that [...] "With the utmost sorrow, I must announce to you that <b>last</b> <b>evening</b> I have given my Maria di Rohan [...] All their talent was not enough to save me from [...] "a sea of [...] – applause....Everything went well.

2500|$|Further {{attention}} {{was drawn to}} the startup when the airlines delivered a [...] "parting shot" [...] {{in the form of a}} publicity stunt to remind the public of its efficiency in mail service. World War I legend Eddie Rickenbacker, a vice president of North American Aviation (Eastern Air Transport's parent holding company) and Jack Frye of Transcontinental and Western Air, both of which had lost their mail contracts, flew T's prototype Douglas DC-1 airliner [...] "City of Los Angeles," [...] which was still in flight test, across the country on the <b>last</b> <b>evening</b> before the Air Corps operation began. Carrying a partial load of mail and a passenger list of airlines officials and news reporters, they flew from Douglas Aviation's plant at Burbank, California, to Newark, New Jersey. Bypassing several regular stops to stay ahead of a blizzard, the stunt established a new cross-country time record of just over 13 hours, breaking the old record by more than five hours. The DC-1 arrived on the morning of February 19 only two hours before the Air Corps was forced by the winter weather to cancel the startup of AACMO.|$|E

2500|$|Brian Close's forthright views {{had never}} been welcome at Lord's and the affable Colin Cowdrey {{returned}} to lead the M.C.C. tour of the West Indies in 1967–68. It was here that Snow really made his mark in international cricket. Although he was not picked for the first test, which was drawn, Snow {{had the advantage of}} being fully acclimatised by the Second Test. He took 7/49 at Jamaica, [...] including in his haul the opener Steve Camacho, Rohan Kanhai, Gary Sobers (lbw for another first ball duck), Basil Butcher, David Holford, Charlie Griffith and Wes Hall as the West Indies were scuttled for 143. Rioting interrupted play when the crowd objected to Butcher's dismissal, even though he walked. Riot police and tear gas were used to restore order and the incident allowed the West Indies team to recover their poise against the now unsettled tourists. They made 391 following on (Snow 1/91) and England were reduced to 68/8 {{at the end of the}} last day, which was played before an empty stadium. Sobers decided to bat on a flat wicket at Barbados, [...] but Snow (5/80) restricted them to 349. England made 449 and the home team batted out the game with 284/6, Snow claiming 3/39. Ironically England won the series at Trinidad with no help from Snow (0/68 and 1/29) thanks to a sporting declaration by Gary Sobers giving England two and three quarter hours to make 215 for victory, which they did for the loss of three wickets with three minutes to spare. Snow finished the series with 4/84 and 6/60 in Guyana, [...] his 10/144 being his best Test figures and his only 10-wicket haul. Even so, England barely survived; 209–9 at stumps on the last day and staring defeat in the face as Gary Sobers (3/53) and Lance Gibbs (6/60) whirred through the overs. Snow played his part lasting 60 balls and 45 minutes before he was out for 1 on the <b>last</b> <b>evening.</b> Rohan Kanhai had repeatedly told him in 1966 that [...] "We'll smash you all over the park when we get you on those wickets in the Caribbean", but Snow had taken 27 wickets (18.66) in four tests. This remains the most wickets taken by an England bowler in a series in the West Indies, though it was equalled by Angus Fraser in 1997–98 when he took 27 wickets (18.22) in six tests. Snow was instrumental in England's second series victory in the Caribbean, and they would have to wait 36 years for the next.|$|E
