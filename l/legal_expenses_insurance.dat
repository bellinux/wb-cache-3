40|$|Introduction. In this chapter, we {{will provide}} an {{overview}} of the economic literature regarding cost shifting, fee arrangements and <b>legal</b> <b>expense</b> <b>insurance.</b> In the economic analysis of law, legal rules are regarded as instruments which can provide actors with behavioural incentives. In essence, private law (torts, contracts, property, etc.) allocates the costs which arise out of different activities. Those costs may only be borne by the party causing them if the party initially suff ering from them brings suit. Problems in fi nancing civil litigation may eff ectively hinder such lawsuits, so that the behavioural incentives which the law intends to provide do not reach the party causing the harm.

50|$|In their {{thematic}} {{review of}} the UK's Motor <b>Legal</b> <b>Expenses</b> <b>Insurance</b> industry, the Financial Conduct Authority highlighted further lack of awareness by consumers. Many consumers could not distinguish between the legal cover of car insurance (protection against being sued for damages) and Motor <b>Legal</b> <b>Expenses</b> <b>Insurance</b> (pursuit of legal rights in recovering uninsured losses and cases of prosecution). They cited the range of names used in the market to describe the product as a cause for confusion, with insurers using the terms Legal Assistance Plan, Motor Legal Protection, Drivers’ Legal Protection, Legal Assistance and Motor Legal Cover variably.|$|E

Coverage is generally not discretionary; if the claim is covered within the governing terms and conditions of the policy, the policy responds. In addition to liability insurance against certain kinds of legal liability, <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> can also offer coverage for predictable {{events such as the}} drafting of a will or power of attorney, and simple legal advice.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} policy of Conditional Fee Arrangements together with After-The-Event insurance and their role for achieving access to justice in the legal compensation system of UK. Despite its recent introduction in the country, arguments and disbeliefs regarding its effectiveness, the level of costs and efficiency for personal injury claims came into sight between the providers of after the event insurance and the liability insurers. The research expands and describes this “cost war” from {{the first years of}} introduction until recently and highlights the key differences between the <b>Legal</b> <b>Expense</b> <b>Insurance</b> market of UK and successful countries like Germany. The findings of the paper support the fact that costs tend to influence the levels of ATE premiums in relation to the personal injury claim type as well as that ATE premiums and the Success Fees are the factors that insurance companies and CFA lawyers compensate themselves according to the level of risk that they bear for each personal injury case. Overall {{on the basis of the}} evidence, this dissertation argues that factors like disbursement costs, general damages, profit costs; costs that an ATE insurance policy covers, influence ATE premiums and therefore agree to some extend with ATE insurance providers beliefs. What the findings of the paper however caused the author to realize is that perhaps the structure of the UK’s LEI market is not mature enough and may not have the appropriate legislations to function well. Finally the paper concludes with recommendations and suggestions for further work...|$|R
40|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>Expense</b> <b>Insurance</b> (LEI) {{is one of}} the ‘access to justice’ {{mechanisms}} that was considered in many societies in the 1980 s and 1990 s. Governments, legal professions and legal reformers in rich western societies highlighted the potential of mechanisms such as LEI, contingency fees and class actions to improve citizens’ access to justice by controlling the cost of legal services. By controlling these costs, LEI and the other mechanisms promised to improve citizens’ access to legal services and the courts. LEI was particularly popular because it promised to improve access to legal services for the ‘in betweens’ of middle income groups. That is to say, it promised to improve access to legal services for the income groups that were not poor enough to qualify for legal aid but not rich enough to easily afford the costs of legal services. The evidence from the last two decades suggests, however, that LEI has been a qualified success in improving citizens’ access to justice. In general, it seems that the reformers had unrealistic expectations about the ease of developing LEI. The result is that while LEI is successful in some societies, the cost of legal services continues to be a problem for the ‘in between’ in many others. This article takes stock of LEI developments in a number of societies {{in the last two decades}} and considers its prospects for the future. First, it describes the development of LEI in a group of common and civil law societies. It demonstrates that LEI has fared best in the societies with civil law traditions but that the picture is more ambiguous in the common law societies. It concludes by highlighting some lessons to be learnt from these developments...|$|R
25|$|Exxon {{recovered}} {{a significant portion}} of clean-up and <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> through <b>insurance</b> claims associated with the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the Seattle Seven for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement, and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should have told the jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the jury would know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.|$|R

40|$|The {{technological}} progress {{in terms of}} increasing computational power and growing virtual space to collect data offers great potential for businesses to benefit from data mining applications. Data mining can create a competitive advantage for corporations by discovering business relevant information, such as patterns, relationships, and rules. The role of the human user within the data mining process is crucial, {{which is why the}} research area of domain knowledge becomes increasingly important. This thesis investigates the impact of domain knowledge-driven variable derivation on classifier performance for corporate data mining. Domain knowledge is defined as methodological, data and business know-how. The thesis investigates the topic from a new perspective by shifting the focus from a one-sided approach, namely a purely analytic or purely theoretical approach towards a target group-oriented (researcher and practitioner) approach which puts the methodological aspect by means of a scientific guideline in the centre of the research. In order to ensure feasibility and practical relevance of the guideline, it is adapted and applied to the requirements of a practical business case. Thus, the thesis examines the topic from both perspectives, a theoretical and practical perspective. Therewith, it overcomes the limitation of a one-sided approach which mostly lacks practical relevance or generalisability of the results. The primary objective of this thesis is to provide a scientific guideline which should enable both practitioners and researchers to move forward the domain knowledge-driven research for variable derivation on a corporate basis. In the theoretical part, a broad overview of the main aspects which are necessary to undertake the research are given, such as the concept of domain knowledge, the data mining task of classification, variable derivation as a subtask of data preparation, and evaluation techniques. This part of the thesis refers to the methodological aspect of domain knowledge. In the practical part, a research design is developed for testing six hypotheses related to domain knowledge-driven variable derivation. The major contribution of the empirical study is concerned with testing the impact of domain knowledge on a real business data set compared to the impact of a standard and randomly derived data set. The business application of the research is a binary classification problem in the domain of an insurance business, which deals with the prediction of damages in <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> <b>insurances.</b> Domain knowledge is expressed through deriving the corporate variables by means of the business and data-driven constructive induction strategy. Six variable derivation steps are investigated: normalisation, instance relation, discretisation, categorical encoding, ratio, and multivariate mathematical function. The impact of the domain knowledge is examined by pairwise (with and without derived variables) performance comparisons for five classification techniques (decision trees, naive Bayes, logistic regression, artificial neural networks, k-nearest neighbours). The impact is measured by two classifier performance criteria: sensitivity and area under the ROC-curve (AUC). The McNemar significance test is used to verify the results. Based on the results, two hypotheses are clearly verified and accepted, three hypotheses are partly verified, and one hypothesis had to be rejected {{on the basis of the}} case study results. The thesis reveals a significant positive impact of domain knowledge-driven variable derivation on classifier performance for options of all six tested steps. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the classification technique influences the impact of the variable derivation steps, and the bundling of steps has a significant higher performance impact if the variables are derived by using domain knowledge (compared to a non-knowledge application). Finally, the research turns out that an empirical examination of the domain knowledge impact is very complex due to a high level of interaction between the selected research parameters (variable derivation step, classification technique, and performance criteria) ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> (LEI), {{also known}} as legal {{protection}} insurance (LPI) or simply legal insurance, {{is a type of}} insurance which covers policyholders against the potential costs of legal action brought by or against the policyholder. The concept originated around 1911 {{as a result of a}} fatal crash at the famous Le Mans race during which some spectators lost their lives and others were severely injured. When the victims or their families claimed damages from the insurers of the organizers, their claims were repudiated. They then all contributed to a pool which was used to fund collective action against the insurers. They were successful. This gave rise to the first LEI policy being developed in France. Not long after that, a motoring club in Germany called the [...] "Deutsche Automobil Schutz" [...] (DAS) increased membership contributions to create a similar pool to pay for the defence of its members charged with traffic related offences. Members of the general public then enquired about joining the scheme. That is when the idea of an insurance available to the general public became firmly established. At present, the DAS of Germany is still the largest legal expenses insurer in the world. It is estimated that they write approximately 50% of LEI business worldwide. Then follows ARAG, also a German insurer. It is estimated that they write approximately 30% of global business.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} forms of LEI, before-the-event and after-the-event ("the event" [...] being that event which {{triggers}} legal action). [...] "After-the-event" [...] <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> is a misnomer, since insurance technically, can only indemnify against future unforeseen events. Most legal insurance plans are before-the-event, and [...] "after the event" [...] is not common and found mainly in the United Kingdom, where it is an insignificant percentage of total LEI business. The majority of LEI business worldwide, is conducted in Europe (Germany and France in particular).In the United States, the general idea of financial assistance with litigation is most often called pre-paid legal services (PPL or PPLS). The {{reason for this is}} that many plans are not insurance based. Some are offered by trade unions as a free benefit of union membership. Others are non-profit clubs set up by groups with a common interest, like University students. Some forms of insurance such as professional liability insurance, medical malpractice insurance,Professional liability insurance, errors and omissions insurance for consultants, agents and brokers of various sorts, and directors and officers liability insurance for principals and supervisory officers of corporations and other organisations, are often marketed under the banner of LEI, but they are in fact liability insurances, a small component of which is to cover the legal expenses of a liability suit. In reality, the insurer is funding the defense of litigation against itself. If it were to fail in doing so, there is a risk that their insured might be held liable for damages that they would be liable to pay under the liability insurance. They are therefore merely protecting their own interests by funding the defence.|$|E
