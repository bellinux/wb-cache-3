The rivet is modeled by spring-damper elements. Several numerical models are studied with different quantities of rivets (1, 3 and 5) and spring-damper elements (4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 20) per rivet. In parallel, samples of two aluminum material plates connected by different quantities of rivets (1, 3 and 5) are built and tested {{in order to be}} known its modal characteristics – natural frequencies and mode shapes. The purpose of the different settings is to get the best numerical <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint representation relatively to the experimental one. For this purpose a finite element model updating methodology is used. An evaluation of the best numerical <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint is carried out based on comparisons between the numerical model after updating and the experimental one. It is shown that the <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints composed by eight and twelve spring-damper elements per rivet have the best representation. A stiffness constant value k is obtained for the <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints in study...|$|R

Finally, the fatigue cracking initiated from the knife edge associated with the countersunk <b>lap</b> joint <b>rivet</b> holes; the knife edge concentrated stresses that were transferred through the <b>rivets</b> because of <b>lap</b> joint disbonding.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringThis thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effect of controllable process parameters in riveting (i. e., such as the sequence of riveting, distance between rivets (pitch) and gap between sheets) on the quality of <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint and formed rivet. The quality of a <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint is characterized by sheet metal bulging, sheet material growth, residual stress level on sheets and rivets, and post riveting clearance in the joint. The quality of a formed rivet is often determined by the geometry of its head formation. This study is to determine the best riveting sequence for <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint in sheet metal assembly with 1 / 8 " nominal diameter of flat head tinner rivet on 0. 064 " thick aluminum sheet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of riveting process. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting process along with the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality parameters of <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint in sheet metal assembly. A good combination of riveting process parameters is found that minimizes the residual stress in sheets and rivets, bulging and material growth in sheets and reduces the chance of post riveting clearance in <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint...|$|R
40|$|<b>Riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints {{are being}} used {{traditionally}} for long in the aerospace industry. These joints are the crucial zones that are designed under damage tolerance procedures in the civil aircraft industry. Conventional design procedures of <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints {{are based on the}} assumption that all rivets carry equal load. As this assumption is not entirely valid as found in research literature associated with fatigue and fracture, it is important to investigate this point in terms of the static strength of the riveted joint as well. Hence, in the present study, riveted joint’s static strength experiments and numerical studies are carried out on four different (single and multi-row) <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints with strain gauges placed at specified locations. The experiments show that all the <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints sustained the estimated ultimate load and failed only after reaching or exceeding the joint failure load. All these <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints are analyzed by non-linear finite element method, considering the rivet yielding, plate yielding, geometrical nonlinear and secondary bending effects of the lap joint. The analysis of <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints shows that though there is unequal load distribution among the rivets in the elastic regime, once the rivets start yielding, significant redistribution of the load takes place among the rivets and the load sharing between the rivets is nearly equal at the failure load of the joint. The agreement between the finite element analysis strains and experimental strains is reasonably good at the failure load and this in conjunction with the aforementioned experimental finding proves that the rivets share nearly equal load at the joint failure load and justifies the conventional design methodology of riveted joints. To the authors’ knowledge no previous research evidence for such correlation was found and this paper confirms conventional design procedures are adequate, though complex interactions between the plate and rivets tend to exist based on non-linear behavior. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the Aloha Airlines {{accident}} in 1988 damage monitoring has received specific additional attention with aircraft structures. <b>Lap</b> joints either <b>riveted</b> or bonded {{have become a}} matter of focal interest. In parallel the topic of structural health monitoring (SHM) emerged during that time, mainly triggered by upcoming smart structures activities during the late 1980 ies. Since this time a lot of research work has been done in SHM which has allowed the sensitivity of different monitoring techniques to be better understood. However there is currently still no seriously marketable SHM solution to be seen around so far. A major reason for this is possibly the fact that fundamentals in SHM having been elaborated, such as acoustic waves travelling in plates with a hole and/or a crack, are by far not sufficient to be applied for what might be considered to be a simple but real structural component such as a riveted joint. The presentation will start with those fundamentals and will then further move into gradually enhancing structural complexity by limiting the boundaries of a plate, allowing cracks to grow from the holes, filling the holes and finally ending up with a <b>lapped</b> <b>riveted</b> joint. Based on these results SHM-related procedures for reliably monitoring cracks in damage tolerant structures will then be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Fatigue of the {{pressurized}} fuselages {{of transport}} aircraft {{is a significant}} problem all builders and users of aircraft {{have to cope with}} for reasons associated with assuring a sufficient lifetime and safety, and formulating adequate inspection procedures. These aspects are all addressed in various formal protocols for creating and maintaining airworthiness, including damage tolerance considerations. In most transport aircraft, fatigue occurs in lap joints, sometimes leading to circumstances that threaten safety in critical ways. The problem of fatigue of lap joints has been considerably enlarged by the goal of extending aircraft lifetimes. Fatigue of <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints between aluminium alloy sheets, typical of the pressurized aircraft fuselage, is the major topic of the present book. The richly illustrated and well-structured chapters treat subjects such as: structural design solutions and loading conditions for fuselage skin joints; relevance of laboratory test results for simple lap joint specimens to riveted joints in a real structure; effect of various production and design related variables on the riveted joint fatigue behaviour; analytical and experimental results on load transmission in mechanically fastened lap joints; theoretical and experimental analysis of secondary bending and its implications for riveted joint fatigue performance; nucleation and shape development of fatigue cracks in <b>riveted</b> longitudinal <b>lap</b> joints; overview of experimental investigations into the multi-site damage for full scale fuselage panels and <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint specimens; fatigue crack growth and fatigue life prediction methodology for <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints; residual strength predictions for <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints in a fuselage structure.

40|$|Crack {{initiation}} in notched elements occurs {{very early}} in the fatigue life. This is also true for <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints, an important fatigue critical element of a pressurized fuselage structure. Crack nucleation in a <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint can occur at different locations, depending on the riveting operation. It can occur {{at the edge of the}} rivet hole, at a small distance away from the hole, but still with subsequent crack growth through the hole, and ahead of the hole with a crack no longer passing through the hole. Moreover, crack nucleation can occur in the top row at the countersunk holes (outer sheet) or in the bottom row at the non-countersunk holes. Fractographic evidence is shown. The initial growth of the small cracks occurs as an (invisible) part through crack. As a consequence, predictions on the crack initiation life are problematic. After a though crack is present, the major part of the fatigue life has been consumed. There is still an apparent lack of empirical data on crack growth and residual strength of <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints, five years after the Aloha accident. Such data are very much necessary for further developments of prediction models. Some test results are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} associated with fatigue were brought into the forefront of research by the explosive decompression and structural failure of the Aloha Airlines Flight 243 in 1988. The structural failure of this airplane {{has been attributed to}} debonding and multiple cracking along the longitudinal <b>lap</b> splice <b>riveted</b> joint in the fuselage. This crash created what may be termed as a minor "Structural Integrity Revolution" in the commercial transport industry. Major steps have been taken by the manufacturers, operators and authorities to improve the structural airworthiness of the aging fleet of airplanes. Notwithstanding, this considerable effort there are still outstanding issues and concerns related to the formulation of Widespread Fatigue Damage which {{is believed to have been}} a contributing factor in the probable cause of the Aloha accident. The lesson from this accident was that Multiple-Site Damage (MSD) in "aging" aircraft can lead to extensive aircraft damage. A strong candidate in which MSD is highly probable to occur is the <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint...|$|R

The system was implemented for the detection of buried notches placed next to the rivets of a laboratory made lap joint mock-up. Associated to a dedicated signal processing method, the system allows 6 mm deep EDM notches (0. 2 mm' 3 mm' 7 mm) to be detected and localized within the depth of the inspected structure, and appears very promising for the characterization of buried defects in actual <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the effect of Corrosion Inhibiting Compounds (CICs) on the fatigue performance of <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints typically used in General Aviation (GA) aircraft. Extensive experience with the airlines and military has shown that CICs are able to provide substantial benefits for corrosion protection. But, with the CICs containing lubricating properties, it could create a risk that the structural fatigue life of joints could be affected by their use, and that cracking may occur in unanticipated time and locations. In {{this research}}, experimental works were conducted to identify the effect of CICs on fatigue life and failure modes of <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints. In addition, Finite Element analysis was employed to validate the mechanical response observed in the experiments of the joints treated and untreated with CICs. The outcomes were then used to identify the potential impact of using CICs on GA sector, an aging aviation sector with under-developed corrosion management programs, and a series of safety recommendations are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{fastener}} clearance fit, friction coefficient, and corrosion pillowing on {{the stress}} state in triple-row <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints were studied numerically using three-dimensional finite element methods. The material elastoplastic constitutive relationship and geometric nonlinear properties, {{as well as}} nonlinear contact boundary conditions, {{were included in the}} numerical simulations. The numerical modeling was validated using experimental measurements of the rivet driven head deformation and in-situ strains. The lap joints were loaded in tension after riveting. Three different clearance fits, three different friction coefficients, and four corrosion pillowing conditions were analyzed. The stress variation along prescribed paths during the tensile loading stage is discussed for each of these conditions. Full-field contours of the friction and maximum principal stresses during the tensile loading stage were investigated. Numerical results showed that a small increase in the clearance fit considerably increased the joint stress magnitude. The clearance fit magnitude also affected the maximum stress location in the vicinity at the top fastener hole. A large friction coefficient increased the contact and friction stresses in the hole vicinity. These results could explain the scatter degree of the fatigue data and could be used to improve the manufacture quality for high fatigue-rated <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints. Serious corrosion pillowing significantly increased the stress magnitude at both the middle and top hole regions, and led to the co-existence of the two highly-stressed areas in the outer sheet, which greatly decreased the integrity of the aged <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint due to the occurrence of the multiple-sited damages during cyclic loading.

40|$|The {{detection}} of disbonds in <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints is of increasing {{interest to the}} aerospace community. Adhesively bonded and <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints are used to bond the thin overlapped sheets of aluminum which comprise the outer skin of an aircraft. Through time, {{the integrity of the}} bond can become compromised by disbanding, leading to corrosion and stress concentrations at the rivets and subsequent cracking leading to joint failure. A thermal technique for determining bond integrity in these structures has been investigated by Winfree, et al [1]. This technique involves active heating of the aircraft fuselage with a measurement of the temperature on the outer surface of the structure with an infrared imager. By even application of heat to the outer surface of the lap joint, details of the inner structure become thermographically detectable. A disbond will prevent heat from penetrating from the surface layer to the subsurface layers, resulting in an increase in surface temperature over the disbond. Thermographic {{detection of}} disbonds excels over other methods by being a noncontacting, quantitative method for inspecting large areas {{in a short period of}} time...|$|R

40|$|Using {{scanning}} acoustic microscopy, {{optical microscopy}} and scanning electron microscopy, {{in conjunction with}} fractography of fractured surfaces, the crack formation and growth kinetics of subsurface fatigue cracks and surface breaking fatigue cracks near rivets have been characterized in detail in this research. The scanning acoustic microscope was used to quantitatively investigate subsurface fatigue cracks (even when they were very small) at and near countersunk <b>rivets</b> in <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint specimens {{that are similar to}} the <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joints found in the fuselages of many aircraft. It was found that the maximum nominal applied stress influences the fatigue crack initiation and propagation behavior. Eyebrow type cracks develop at lower stresses and centerline cracks develop at higher stresses. At low stress ranges, the fatigue cracks initiate a short distance from the rivet at or near the hidden surface of the chamfered panel. At higher stress amplitudes, the cracks initiate at the blunt knife edge. Residual compressive stresses and fretting are suggested to play more important roles at lower stress ranges. Both types of cracks initiate in a shear mode but transform to tensile, mode I, cracks as they grow. This transition occurs much more rapidly at the higher stress amplitude. At both high and low stresses, the cracks are longer on the fayed surface of the panel than elsewhere. In a comparison of Alclad 2024 -T 3 and Ale lad 2524 -T 3, {{it was found that the}} high purity aluminum alloy 2524 nucleates cracks at a greater number of cycles than the less pure aluminum alloy 2024. At high stress, crack initiation plays less of a roll and the 2024 alloy has a longer life. The scanning acoustic microscope enabled us to study subsurface fatigue cracks. The understanding gained from the characterization of the subsurface fatigue cracks will help in the modeling of crack initiation and growth in the <b>riveted</b> <b>lap</b> joint and will also aid in the improvement of NDE techniques for the detection of these cracks.

The present work involves the appropriate configuration and characterization of these joints for maximum utilization. By using finite element method, stress and fracture analyses are carried out under both the residual stress field and external tensile loading. Using a two step simulation, riveting process and subsequent tensile loading of the lap joint are simulated to determine the residual and overall stress state. Residual stress state due to riveting is obtained by interference and clamping misfit method. By employing different interference and clamping misfit values, the effects of riveting process parameters on stress state are examined. Two cracks namely the semi elliptical surface crack at faying surfaces of plates and the quarter elliptical corner crack at rivet hole are the most widely observed crack types in riveted joints. Fracture analysis of cracked riveted joints is carried out by introducing these two crack types to the outer plate at a plane perpendicular to the loading.

The Rivet Element, based on a closed-form solution of a theoretical model of the rivet joint, is able to accurately evaluate, in FE analysis, both local and overall stiffness of riveted joints with a very low contribution of dofs.
