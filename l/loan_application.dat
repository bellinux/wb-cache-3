25|$|Within {{five minutes}} of launch, the first <b>loan</b> <b>application</b> was processed, and within a week the first loan default occurred. The {{subsequent}} months of operation showed increased demand, but traditional methods of credit risk assessment proved inadequate and the company experienced default rates of around 50%. The company used this period to gather data on customer behaviour and began developing their own proprietary risk technology. The full market launch of Wonga.com was July 2008 and 100,000 loans were reached by June 2009. Through the experience of processing these loans, the company developed technologies which began to dramatically reduce the percentage of defaults. In July 2009 Wonga raised a further £13.9m of funding in a Round B led by Accel Partners, Greylock Partners and Dawn Capital which improved the technology and the launch in December 2009 of the first end-to-end iPhone credit app. In 2009 the company was already profitable and default rates were below 10%, less than the average for credit cards. A third round of funding was completed in 2011, for £73m led by Oak Investment Partners including additional investors Meritech Capital Partners and the Wellcome Trust. By the end of 2011, Wonga's technology could reliably reject two-thirds of applications and predict to 93% accuracy {{the ability of a}} customer to repay a loan. In May 2012, they opened a business in South Africa offering consumer loans. The Daily Telegraph reported in November 2012 that Wonga were also testing their technology in Canada.|$|E
25|$|In November 2000 {{during the}} election, the Grand-Mere Affair, {{also known as}} the Shawinigate scandal broke. After initial denials, Chrétien {{acknowledged}} having lobbied the Business Development Bank of Canada, owned by the Government of Canada, to grant a $2million loan to Yvon Duhaime. Duhaime was a friend and constituent to whom the Prime Minister stated that he had sold his interest in the Grand-Mère Inn, a local Shawinigan-area hotel and golf resort, eventually providing evidence of the sale—a contract written on a cocktail napkin. Duhaime was a local businessman with an unsavoury reputation and a criminal record, who received a loan from the Business Development Bank that he was ineligible to collect on the account of his criminal record (Duhaime did not mention his record when applying for the loan). The Business Development Bank had turned down the initial <b>loan</b> <b>application,</b> but later approved a $615,000 loan following further lobbying by Chrétien. When the Business Development Bank refused to extend the loan in August 1999 under the grounds that Duhaime was a businessman with a bad reputation with a history for losing money on past business ventures and that he was already behind on his current payments, the president of the bank François Beaudoin was fired by Chrétien in September 1999, which led to a wrongful dismissal suit that Beaudoin was to win in 2004. It was revealed that Chrétien had never been paid for his share in the sale of the adjoining golf course, and criminal charges were laid against Duhaime. The Prime Minister's ethics counsellor Howard Wilson, who was appointed by and reported to the Prime Minister, determined that Prime Minister Chrétien had not violated any conflict-of-interest rules, noting that there were no clear rules on lobbying Crown corporations for making loans to business ventures that the Prime Minister may or may not had a stake in. There was no comment on ethics of Chrétien's lobbying by the ethics counsellor Wilson. The revelation of the Grand-Mere affair did not affect the outcome of the 2000 election. Chrétien and his circle believed that the breaking of the Grand-Mere story during the election was the work of the Martin fraction.|$|E

2500|$|The Delhi Jal Board (DJB), which {{administers the}} water system of Delhi, was first {{approached}} by Parivartan in November 2004, following {{a report by}} the newspaper The Asian Age, where the scheme was revealed to the public for the first time. The DJB denied the existence of the project, but after an appeal, the RTI request was granted. The documents revealed that the project began in 1998, in complete secrecy within the DJB administration. The DJB approached the World Bank for a loan to improve the water system, which it approved, and the effort began with a $2.5 million consultation loan. The Delhi government could have easily provided the money, and the interest rate of 12% that was to be loaned by the World Bank could have been raised on capital markets for 6%. Following the consultation, 35 multi-national companies bid, of which six were to be short listed. When PwC was in 10th place, the World Bank said that at least one company should be from a developing country, and since PwC made the bid from its Kolkata office, it was dubbed an [...] "Indian" [...] company, and its rank was dropped to 6th. When PwC failed in the second round, the World Bank pressured the DJB to start over with a fresh round of bidding. Only one company succeeded in the new round that was not PwC, and the World Bank had the lowest marks from an evaluator thrown out. The contract was awarded to PwC in 2001. Following the investigation by Parivartan, a campaign was waged by Kejriwal, Aruna Roy, and other activists across Delhi, and the DJB withdrew the <b>loan</b> <b>application</b> to the World Bank.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyse female and male loan officers' (LOs) risk aversion as they assess {{different}} types of small- and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) <b>loan</b> <b>applications.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The data were gathered from a sample of 75 Swedish LOs, using the repertory grid technique and related questions. The data were analysed statistically. Findings – The findings demonstrate that female LOs focus more on collateral (used {{as a proxy for}} risk aversion) in their evaluations of first-time <b>loan</b> <b>applications</b> than male LOs. However, the findings also suggest that there are {{no significant differences between the}} two groups as far as risk aversion when they evaluate additional <b>loan</b> <b>applications.</b> The other variables controlled for (age, tenure, insight, education, and location) did not significantly affect the LOs' risk aversion. Research limitations/implications – The study might have benefited from the use of complementary data collection approaches. Access to actual assessment and decision-making procedures could have increased the understanding of female and male LOs' attitudes toward risk. Practical implications – The findings suggest that by the use of female-male LO teams, banks may achieve more balanced assessments of SMEs' <b>loan</b> <b>applications.</b> Originality/value – To the authors' knowledge, the literature has not explicitly addressed risk aversion among female and male LOs with respect to different types of bank loans. Moreover, the authors investigated risk aversion in the context of standardised assessments procedures used to reduce exposure to credit risk...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{significance}} {{of race in}} mortgage lending {{has emerged as a}} major public policy issue and focus of scholarly research in the United States. In this paper the experiences of black and Latino mortgage loan applicants in a large midwestern metropolitan area are examined by means of a database on the disposition of individual mortgage <b>loan</b> <b>applications</b> that is now available. It is found that, after controlling for income, age of housing, housing value, and occupancy status, black applicants and applicants from predominantly black communities are less likely to have their <b>loan</b> <b>applications</b> approved than are white applicants or applicants from predominantly white areas. Although no disparities were associated with Latino applicants, those applicants from predominantly Latino communities {{were less likely to be}} approved than were others. Specific research and policy recommendations are offered to develop a further under-standing of the racial implications of the mortgage market and for reducing racial disparities in accessing credit for home purchases. "Well, I'm not a statistician, but when blacks are getting their <b>loan</b> <b>applications</b> rejected twice as often as whites, and in some cities, it's three and four times as often, I conclude that discrimination is part of the problem.
