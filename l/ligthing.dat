40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to show the method of rent {{assessment}} for the instalment of optical cables into a public <b>ligthing</b> duct system when the owner of such a duct system is the local community and the future lessee is the administrator of a communications network. First the elementary characteristics of construction and usage of communications networks and public lighting networks will be shown, {{the emphasis on the}} specificities of communications networks. Next, we will show how to assesse the value of rent for the purpose of a public <b>ligthing</b> duct system lease, using the methodology of rent assesment for the instalment of optical cables into a public <b>ligthing</b> duct system. The value of the average cost of construction of a public lighting duct system in the City Municipality of Kranj is calculated {{on the basis of the}} cost of construction of a duct system and the value of land. The initial value of annual rent is estimated by using the method of direct capitalization. The usage of adjustment factors for the rent assessment of specific, concrete examples is described next. In the last chapter rent assessments of specific cases of the instalment of optical cables into a public <b>ligthing</b> duct system in various locations in the City Municipality of Kranj are presented. The evaluation of the adequacy of assessed rents follows. In the closing arguments we recommend that before a duct system is leased, records of free capacities and a plan of development of the public lighting network are made...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{performance}} {{has been a}} topic of study for many years. For a variety of reasons, it {{has been difficult to}} develop a completely satisfactory model of visual performance. Recently the connection has been made between reaction time experiments and realistic studies of visual performance. In this report an extensive set of reaction time data are presented which were collected over a large range of stimulus conditions relevant to interior and exterior lighting applications. An empirical model of visual performance was developed from these data. It forms the next logical step in the development of an application tool for <b>ligthing</b> practioners. Also presented at the National Lighting Conference held at Cambridge, UK, March 1988 Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{photometric}} solids {{into both}} real time and photorealistic rendering allows designers and computer artists to enhance easily {{the quality of}} their images. Lots of such data are available from lighting societies since they allow these societies to easily present the luminance distribution of their often complex <b>ligthing</b> systems. When accuracy is required the amount of discretized luminance directions and the number of photometric solids that have to be used increase considerably the memory requirements and reduce the algorithm efficiency. In this paper we describe and compare two machine learning approaches used for approximating any photometric solid: an artificial neural network and ECON (Equi-Correlated Network Algorithm). By applying these two approaches on a large set of real photometric distribution data, we were able to show that one of them provides generally a better approximation of the original distribution...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhen {{we look at}} {{images taken}} from outdoor scenes, much of the {{information}} perceived is due to the <b>ligthing</b> conditions. In these scenes, the solar beams interact with the atmosphere and create a global illumination that determines the way we perceive objets in the world. Lately, exploration of the sky like the main illuminance component has began to be explored in Computer Vision. Some of these studies could be classified like color-based algorithms while some others fall in the physics-based category. However most of them assume that the photometric and geometric camera parameters are constant, or at least, that they could be determined. This work presents a simple and effective method in order to find images with similar lighting conditions. This method is based on a Gaussian mixture model of sky pixels represented by a 3 D histogram in the La*b* color space...|$|E
40|$|A {{classroom}} {{functions as}} a place for learning and teaching activities. To accommodate these funcions, {{it is important to}} consider the lighting quality that should meet the standard requirement for the learning activities. Initial measurements of the light intensity of the classrooms in SMA Negri 9 Surabaya show that some of these classrooms have not met the standard requirement. This research used the Dialux v. 4. 8 software to investigate and discover the best lighting quality that should be achieved according to <b>ligthing</b> standards. Results show that the type of lamp used influences the lighting conditions of a classroom. Meanwhile different interior elements, furniture materials and finishings also affect the distribution of light which produce different light reflections that influence the comfort level of the users. The use of colour on the interior elements and furnitures also affect the light intensity in which every colour produces different light reflections and interior atmoshphere...|$|E
40|$|This paper overviews some {{design and}} {{performance}} aspects of United States and European glulam. First, the uses and design philosophy behind United States glulam are presented. Results from a Norwegian glulam study that influenced European design requirements are also presented. 2 United States Glulam In the United States, glulam {{is used in}} a wide variety of applications, ranging from headers or support beams in residential house framing to major structural elements in the framing of domed stadiums that span more than 500 ft (150 m). Glulam is produced in many sizes and shapes, ranging from large, long-span straight beams to complex curved-arch configurations. With the introduction of wet-use or durable adhesives about 50 years ago, glulam became a viable construction matierial for diverse uses such as utility structure crossarms, <b>ligthing</b> standards, electric transmission line towers, and roadway and railroad bridge structures. In the United States, 600 000 m 3 (more than 2. 5 * 108 board feet) of lumber are used annually i...|$|E
40|$|Proceeding of: 14 th International Conference, ACIVS 2012, Brno, Czech Republic, September 4 - 7, 2012 The {{movement}} of the vehicle is an useful information for different applications, such as driver assistant systems or autonomous vehicles. This information can be known by different methods, for instance, by using a GPS or {{by means of the}} visual odometry. However, there are some situations where both methods do not work correctly. For example, there are areas in urban environments where the signal of the GPS is not available, as tunnels or streets with high buildings. On the other hand, the algorithms of computer vision are affected by outdoor environments, and the main source of difficulties is the variation in the <b>ligthing</b> conditions. A method to estimate and predict the {{movement of}} the vehicle based on visual odometry and Kalman filter is explained in this paper. The Kalman filter allows both filtering and prediction of vehicle motion, using the results from the visual odometry estimation.
