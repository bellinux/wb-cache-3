This created the drowned estuarine river mouths common {{along the western}} shore.

The lake left behind a layer of <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediment</b> that blankets the Jordan Valley with terraces of sediment up to 40 m thick. These sediments are commonly called marls and are composed of layers of true loam and calcareous silt loams mixed with other chemicals and salts.

40|$|The {{hamlet of}} Montelago (‘Mountain of the Lake’) lies within the {{northern}} Marche Apennines {{close to the}} watershed of Fosso del Lago (‘Stream of the Lake’) : both Italian toponyms clearly suggest {{the presence of a}} paleolake. Official geological maps reported <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediments</b> within the upper basin of the Fosso del Lago stream, where outcrops of <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediments</b> have also been noted for about five decades. The nineteenthcentury Gregorian cadastral map also reports water ponds roughly in the area where <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediments</b> were found: nonetheless, their position is clearly shifted upstream with respect to the reported <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediments.</b> In this context, we have recently performed a targeted geomorphological survey addressed at unravelling such apparent discrepancy. Our study confirms the occurrence of <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediments</b> spanning from Atlantic up to Sub-Boreal exactly in the place reported by previous geological works. The detailed geomorphological map created for the area allowed us to adequately locate previously published subsurface prospecting both highlighting landslide damming as the process responsible for lake formation and providing information for an adequate morphoevolutive reconstruction of the area. Geomorphological mapping also resolved the problem of the different position of the ponds mapped by the Gregorian Cadastre, stating that these had no direct relationships with the former lake but rather consisted of a small man-made reservoir directly connected by broad channels to springs which are currently dried-out...|$|R
50|$|Once Lake Monongahela formed, {{the water}} drowned the {{existing}} landforms. The lake did not erode the topography—it simply covered {{the land with}} water and <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediment.</b> The sediment settled on both topographic highs and lows {{beneath the surface of}} the lake. Drowned terraces and abandoned meander channels, as well as low hills, slopes, and valley bottoms, received this covering of sediment. As such, sediments found on different terraces can actually be the same age. Marine (1997) found five terrace levels along the rivers, but he had to conclude that the lake deposits found on them resulted from only two episodes of glacial damming. Deposits on the fifth and fourth terrace levels represent damming during a pre-Illinoian glaciation, whereas the third- and second-terrace-level deposits represent damming during Illinoian glaciation. The first terrace (the modern floodplain) consists simply of Wisconsinan outwash and Holocene alluvial deposits, which fill river valleys that had been cut to bedrock by the end of Illinoian time.|$|E
50|$|Three fossils {{have been}} found in a <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediment</b> in the North-West Tien Shan foothills of the Karatau Mountains. In the Jurassic this area had some {{similarities}} in habitat to the Solnhofen lagoon deposits in Bavaria, Germany. The genus is based on holotype PIN 52-2, an incomplete and disarticulated skeleton consisting of skull fragments, jaws, vertebrae, ribs, legs and wing bones. The skull of 48 mm (1.9 in) long is high, short and broad. The upper jaws have in total 22 or 24 recurved conical teeth; with the lower jaws they make a short and very wide mouth. The animal is not preserved with a tail. Whether it had one is debatable; usually it is assumed a short tail was present. The wingspan has been estimated at 50 cm (20 in); David Unwin in 2000 gave a higher estimate of 75 cm (30 in). Like all anurognathids Batrachognathus is assumed to have been an insectivore, catching insects on the wing with its broad mouth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediments,</b> {{aragonite}} is {{a widespread}} mineral, whereas monohydrocalcite is a rare carbonate mineral. In the cold and high-attitude Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau, where aragonite has been commonly found in <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediments,</b> there is no aragonite, but low-Mg calcite, monohydrocalcite and trace dolomite. The lake receives solutes primarily from surface runoffs and remains fairly constant water chemistry for a long time. The total CaCO 3 percentage in sediments could be controlled by evaporation and inflow of detrital materials. The absence of aragonite is unusual {{when compared to other}} <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediments</b> from the Tibetan Plateau. This could be due to low Ca/Mg ratio, low salinity, low Mg and Ca concentration. Monohydrocalcite might precipitate from the lake water mediated by biological activities.

40|$|<b>Lacustrine</b> <b>sediment</b> {{records were}} used to examine debris flow {{magnitude}} and frequency at two sites in northwestern Canada. A rod-driven piston corer was used to collect four <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediment</b> cores from Mount Aramis Lake, Yukon Territory (YT) and five from Three Guardsmen Lake, British Columbia (BC). Nine layers deposited in the <b>Lacustrine</b> <b>sediment</b> of Mount Aramis Lake over an estimated 3400 to 3800 yrs and ten layers deposited in Three Guardsmen Lake over an estimated 3000 to 3500 yrs are inferred {{to be due to}} debris flows. However, these layers represent the minimum number of events because lacustrine sediments only contain a record of debris flows with sufficient energy to reach the lake. Variations in the sedimentary structure of the debris flow layers between the sites could not be attributed to differences in debris flow magnitude and frequency resulting from local variations in slope gradients, debris supply, or precipitation. The lacustrine, terrestrial, and climatic evidence indicates that lower precipitation at Mount Aramis may result in higher magnitude, lower frequency debris flows. Conversely, higher precipitation at Three Guardsmen Mountain may cause lower magnitude, higher frequency debris flows. However, these are preliminary conclusions and further research regarding the relationship between precipitation regime, debris supply, and debris flow magnitude and frequency is required...|$|E

40|$|A sedimentological, geochemical, micropaleontological, and {{palynological study}} of a <b>lacustrine</b> <b>sediment</b> record from the small TT Lake (southern-central Tibetan Plateau) shows that the {{background}} sedimentation was frequently interrupted by event-related deposits. These event-related deposits are interpreted {{as the result of}} hydrologic events that are triggered by above-average precipitation events. In total, 11 events were recorded in the TT Lake sequence. Two types can be differentiated: fluvial runoff events caused by precipitation that carried sediment in suspension into the lake and a sediment mass transport caused by torrential precipitation. The hydrologic events appear to be decoupled from long-term climate and environmental variations, but there is evidence that anthropogenic impact, in terms of pastoralism, might have favored the runoff events. The multi-proxy approach proved to be valuable and allowed for a detailed study of sedimentary processes within the lake and its watershed in order to assess their triggering processes and dynamics. The findings show the complexity of these sedimentary processes and their controlling factors, and the study aims to improve their understanding.
