40|$|Nepotistic {{practices}} are detrimental for academia. An analysis of shared <b>last</b> <b>names</b> among academics was recently proposed {{to measure the}} diffusion of nepotism, the results of which have had a huge resonance. This method was thus proposed to orient the decisions of policy makers concerning cuts and funding. Because of the social relevance of this issue, the validity of this method must be assessed. Thus, we compared results from an analysis of Italian and United Kingdom academic <b>last</b> <b>names,</b> and of Italian <b>last</b> and given <b>names.</b> The results strongly suggest that the analysis of shared <b>last</b> <b>names</b> is not a measure of nepotism, as it is largely affected by social capital, professional networking and demographic effects, whose contribution is difficult to assess. Thus, the analysis of shared <b>last</b> <b>names</b> is not useful for guiding research policy...|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} article, I {{showed that in}} several {{academic}} disciplines in Italy, professors display a paucity of <b>last</b> <b>names</b> that cannot be explained by unbiased, random, hiring processes. I suggested that this scarcity of <b>last</b> <b>names</b> {{could be related to}} the prevalence of nepotistic hires, i. e., professors engaging in illegal practices to have their relatives hired as academics. My findings have recently been questioned through repeat analysis to the United Kingdom university system. Ferlazzo & Sdoia found that several disciplines in this system also display a scarcity of <b>last</b> <b>names,</b> and that a similar scarcity is found when analyzing the first (given) names of Italian professors. Here I show that the scarcity of first names in Italian disciplines is completely explained by uneven male/female representation, while the scarcity of <b>last</b> <b>names</b> in United Kingdom academia is due to discipline-specific immigration. However, these factors cannot explain the scarcity of <b>last</b> <b>names</b> in Italian disciplines. Geographic and demographic considerations [...] proposed as a possible explanation of my findings [...] appear to have no significant effect: after correcting for these factors, the scarcity of <b>last</b> <b>names</b> remains highly significant in several disciplines, and there is a marked trend from north to south, with a higher likelihood of nepotism in the south and in Sicily. Moreover, I show that in several Italian disciplines positions tend to be inherited as with <b>last</b> <b>names</b> (i. e., from father to son, but not from mother to daughter). Taken together, these results strenghten the case for nepotism, highlighting that statistical tests cannot be applied to a dataset without carefully considering the characteristics of the data and critically interpreting the results.
