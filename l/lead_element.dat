Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front, rear and both flanks. At 9:56am the <b>lead</b> <b>element</b> of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail. Almost immediately, the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of the trail and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared. George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail, but {{by the time they were}} in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared and everything was quiet. About 10–15 minutes later, the 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving, in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and the rattle of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|While {{pursuing}} the Viet Cong, a helicopter gunship from the U.S. 68th Assault Helicopter Company {{was shot down}} and crashed in the Quảng Giao rubber plantation, about four kilometres away from Bình Giã, killing four of its crewmen. On December 31, the U.S. Marines Advisory Group sent a team of four personnel, led by Captain Donald G. Cook, to Bình Giã to observe conditions on the battlefield. At the same time, the 4th Marine Battalion was ordered to locate the crashed helicopter and recover {{the bodies of the}} dead American crewmen. Acting against the advice of his American advisor, Major Nguyễn Văn Nho, commander of the 4th Marine Battalion, sent his 2/4th Marine Battalion company out to the Quảng Giao rubber plantation. Unknown to the 4th Marine Battalion, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment had assembled in the plantation. About one hour after they had departed from the village of Bình Giã, the commander of the 2/4th Marine Battalion reported via radio that his troops had found the helicopter wreckage, and the bodies of four American crewmen. Shortly afterwards, the Viet Cong opened fire and the 2/4th Marine Battalion was forced to pull back. In an attempt to save the 2nd Company, the entire 4th Marine Battalion was sent out to confront the Viet Cong. As the <b>lead</b> <b>element</b> of the 4th Marine Battalion closed in on the Quảng Giao plantation, they were hit by accurate Viet Cong artillery fire, which was soon followed by repeated human wave attacks. Having absorbed heavy casualties from the Viet Cong's ambush, the 2/4th Marine Battalion had to fight {{their way out of the}} plantation with their bayonets fixed. During the entire ordeal, the company did not receive artillery support because the plantation was beyond the range of 105mm artillery guns based in Phước Tuy and Bà Rịa. They however escaped with the crucial support of the U.S. aircraft and helicopters whose rocket attacks forced the enemy to pull back and halted their attempt at pursuit.|$|E

At about noon on May 27, his <b>lead</b> <b>element</b> skirmished briskly with the Confederates until Porter's main body arrived, driving the outnumbered Confederates {{up the road}} {{in the direction of the}} courthouse. Porter set out in pursuit with most of his force, leaving three regiments to guard the New Bridge and Hanover Court House Roads intersection. This movement exposed the rear of Porter's command to attack by the bulk of Branch's force, which Porter had mistakenly assumed was at Hanover Court House.|$|E

The communists were well concealed, but not dug in and thus not fully prepared for the ensuing battle. The 3d Platoon, still in the lead, continued to receive heavy fire and was unable to gain the upper hand. Then the platoon reported being attacked on its right (south) flank {{as well as from the}} front (east).|$|E
25|$|Porter's men {{approached}} Peake's Crossing in {{a driving}} rain. At about noon on May 27, his <b>lead</b> <b>element,</b> the 25th New York Infantry, encountered Col. James H.

The New Yorkers, along with the 1st U.S. Sharpshooters, skirmished briskly with the Confederates until Porter's main body arrived, driving the outnumbered Rebels up {{the road in the}} direction of the courthouse. Porter set out in pursuit with most of his force, leaving three regiments (the 2nd Maine, the 44th New York, and the damaged 25th New York), under the command of Brig. Gen. John H. Martindale, to guard the New Bridge and Hanover Court House Roads intersection, a mile to the west of Kinney's farm. This movement exposed the rear of Porter's command to attack by the bulk of Branch's force, which Porter had mistakenly assumed was at Hanover Court House.|$|E

Nearly 1,500 family and friends attended the memorial, with speakers such as Hollywood icon Harrison Ford, film producer David Ellison, Jonna Doolittle (granddaughter of Jimmy Doolittle) and many others. The event culminated with the United States Air Force Honor Guard presenting the American Flag to the family - which coincided with a three element fly-over. The <b>lead</b> <b>element</b> featured a Rockwell Sabreliner similar to that which Hoover flew during airshows, along with two F-16s from the USAF Thunderbirds and a CT-114 from the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. The second element featured the USAF Heritage Flight with an F-22 Raptor and two F-86 Sabres, and {{the third and final}} installment featured a four-ship World War II warbird flight, with the P-51 Ole' Yeller pulling up in the missing man formation on the final note of Taps.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of May 28, 1965, the Viet Cong marched into their {{designated}} positions around Ba Gia; the 90th Battalion took up their position at Minh Thanh, the 60th Battalion at Vinh Loc 1, the 40th Battalion at Duyen Phuoc, and the 45th Battalion at Vinh Khanh. The 271st Regimental Headquarters set up camp at Nui Thanh, while the 83rd Local Force Battalion was ordered to encircle the administrative centre at Nghia Hanh. Precisely at 5.45am on May 29, elements of the Viet Cong 271st Regiment launched a surprise attack on Phuoc Loc, a small village located south of Ba Gia. Within 10 minutes of fighting, the two platoons of South Vietnamese Regional Force defending Phuoc Loc were subdued, and the Viet Cong quickly consolidated the battlefield around the area. At around 6:00am ARVN Captain Nguyen Van Ngoc, commander of the 1st Battalion, 51st Infantry Regiment, led his unit from Go Cao south toward Phuoc Loc to stage a counter-attack against the <b>lead</b> <b>element</b> of the enemies’ 271st Regiment.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{to expand}} the {{bridgehead}} were stopped by German resistance and the division was withdrawn {{to the south of}} Zaporizhia with the aim of capturing another bridgehead. To prepare for the attack, the 1120th Regiment sent the reconnaissance platoon over the river to collect intelligence. On the night of 12 November Kabanov crossed the Dnieper under fire near Belenky village. Advancing into a German trench, he reportedly saw a German soldier preparing to throw a grenade at the other Soviet soldiers and killed him. During the reconnaissance mission, two more German soldiers were killed. After taking prisoners, the group recrossed the river. For his actions, Kabanov was recommended for the Order of the Patriotic War 1st class but instead received the Order of Glory 3rd class. The regiment crossed the river on the night of 26 November. The reconnaissance platoon was again the <b>lead</b> <b>element</b> and crossed to the Kanevsky Island by nightfall. During fighting for the village of Kanev, Kabanov reportedly captured nine German soldiers while advancing into a trench. He then reportedly used a machine gun and grenades to kill 12 more German soldiers. During the fighting, Kabanov was killed in action on 28 November.|$|E

500|$|Kampfgruppe Peiper, the <b>lead</b> <b>element</b> of the Sixth Panzer Army's spearhead, 1st SS Panzer Division, {{consisted}} of 4,800 men and 600 vehicles. On December 16, {{it started as}} much as [...] to the east in Tondorf, Germany, {{and was unable to}} advance at its scheduled rate because of road congestion. The road from Scheid to Losheim was one solid traffic jam, in part due to two blown railroad overpasses blocking the advance of the 3rd Parachute Regiment and the 12th Volksgranadier Division to Losheimergraben, but also due to the stiff American resistance. Peiper's lead units did not reach Losheim until 7:30pm, when he was ordered to swing west and join up with the 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division, which had finally cleared the route through Lanzerath. Peiper was furious about the delay. En route to Lanzerath, Peiper's unit lost five tanks and five other armored vehicles to American mines and anti-tank weapons. Kampfgruppe Peiper finally reached Lanzerath near midnight.|$|E
