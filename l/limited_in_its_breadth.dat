40|$|Water {{efficiency}} is the optimised use of water commensurate to need. Achieving water efficiency has, {{in the last}} decade, become an increasing important part of policy programmes to ensure resource resilience and future supply. This study originated from {{a growing body of}} literature which purports differences in environmental behaviour in urban and rural residents. It presents initial findings from surveys conducted in two communities in Sussex, England. The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate and compare collective views on water efficiency by comparing users in different geographical contexts. The survey conducted in a rural and urban community started with the general assessment of basic household demographics and characteristics before investigating both water and energy use. Questions include factors that encourage or discourage water efficiency behaviour, views on information-led water efficiency interventions and limitations to the adoption of water efficient technologies. The paper concludes by discussing the differences and similarities found and the extent to which the findings are usable in water efficiency policies and processes, although it is worth highlighting that this study is the first set of a series of studies and is <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>breadth...</b>|$|E
40|$|There is {{significant}} potential for family farming {{to contribute to}} several dimensions of the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. Our research aims to provide insights to help strengthen sustainable family farming. We focus on initiatives that have advanced sustainable family farming innovations in Colombia and analyse the factors and dynamics {{that have led to}} the limited penetration of those innovations across the country. To that aim, a transformative methodology is applied involving representatives of farmers' associations, supporting organisations and researchers from various disciplinary fields. We analyse the network of initiatives against the conceptual background of sociotechnical niches and identify a stable niche where generic lessons are being systematically identified and used to establish replication projects. However, this niche is still <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>breadth,</b> which results in a low capacity for expansion and a strong dependency on international donors for reproducing experiences. Specific recommendations are outlined for broadening the type of actors involved in the interpretation and dissemination of lessons from the niche. Moreover, we outline suggestions for further research and conceptualisation in two directions: for exploring effective ways of broadening the niche and translating niche lessons to state policies and for deepening the understanding of interactions between the niche and other levels...|$|E

''If they ''leave it to the market'' and award contracts {{on the basis of a}} competitive process and set up arms-length relationships to pursue compliance, they may find themselves hostage to suppliers that cannot be replaced once the contract is under way. If, instead, they seek supplies from government-owned arsenals and shipyards, they may find it difficult to resit political pressures to preserve legacy sectors, facilities and products. And, if they look to overseas suppliers to meet their requirements, they usually lack the market power to negotiate favourable terms and sometimes to have their requirements met at all.
