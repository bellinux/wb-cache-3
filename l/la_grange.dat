5|$|In {{the years}} after Adrienne's death, Lafayette mostly {{remained}} quietly at <b>La</b> <b>Grange</b> as Napoleon's power in Europe waxed, and then waned.

5|$|<b>La</b> <b>Grange</b> draws {{attention}} to the notably high tessitura for the sopranos, for soloists and for choral singers. He characterises the alto solos as brief and unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in PartII is both extensive and demanding, requiring on several occasions {{to be heard over the}} choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biography}} of Walter Francis White—African-American civil rights leader and N.A.A.C.P president—historian Kenneth Robert Janken notes that White's mother Madeline Harrison traced some of her mixed-race white ancestry to Harrison in Virginia. According to Janken, her family maintained that Dilsia, a female slave belonging to William Henry Harrison, had six children by him, born into slavery. Four {{were said to be}} sold to a planter in <b>La</b> <b>Grange,</b> Georgia, including a daughter, Marie Harrison. Marie was said to be Madeline's mother.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1815, {{four days}} after Waterloo, Napoleon abdicated. Lafayette {{arranged}} for the former emperor's passage to America, but the British prevented this, and Napoleon ended his days {{on the island of}} Saint Helena. The Chamber of Representatives, before it dissolved, appointed Lafayette to a peace commission that was ignored by the victorious allies who occupied much of France, with the Prussians taking over <b>La</b> <b>Grange</b> as a headquarters. Once the Prussians left in late 1815, Lafayette returned to his house, a private citizen again.|$|E

50|$|By his own admission, Mitchell's work on Mahler has {{not been}} principally {{as a work of}} {{biography}} (he cites Henry-Louis de <b>La</b> <b>Grange's</b> four-volume work as the standard), but rather a series of extended essays, often personal in nature. Across the four volumes Mitchell also presents analyses of Mahler's work, grouped loosely into early works (vol. 1), Wunderhorn works (vol. 2) and later works (vols. 3 and 4).|$|R

5|$|In 1936, Chandler urged {{implementation}} of the state's first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal Rural Electrification Act. He implemented an old-age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment and in 1938, proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy blind people to the state's assistance rolls. He increased funding to the state's hospitals and asylums, and personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the Ohio River flood of 1937. Following the flood, Chandler convinced the legislature to construct a new reformatory at <b>La</b> <b>Grange.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{may have}} weakened Mallory politically and certainly diverted him from other duties, {{but it was}} not enough to drive him from office. Perhaps because {{there was no one to}} replace him and perhaps because he absorbed shafts that were aimed at the president, Davis retained him in the cabinet until the end of the war. After the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox, Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South, first to Danville, Virginia, then to Greensboro, North Carolina, Charlotte, Abbeville, South Carolina, and finally Washington, Georgia. There, Mallory submitted his resignation and went to <b>La</b> <b>Grange,</b> Georgia, where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at <b>La</b> <b>Grange,</b> he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
50|$|The {{river was}} swollen by rains, so {{capturing}} a bridge {{would be required}} to make swift progress. Wilson determined that either one of two locations with bridges would suit this purpose: the one at West Point or the more heavily defended one at Columbus. The two towns were only 35 miles apart and Wilson divided his force to attack both, in order to increase the chances of one being taken intact. Colonel Oscar Hugh <b>La</b> <b>Grange's</b> brigade was detailed to attack West Point.|$|R
50|$|<b>La</b> Prairie <b>Grange</b> Hall No. 79, {{also known}} as the La Prairie Town Hall, is an {{historic}} two-story wooden Grange hall located in La Prairie, Rock County, Wisconsin. It was built in 1874 as a joint project of <b>La</b> Prairie <b>Grange</b> No. 79 and the town of La Prairie at a cost of $1,938.50. In 1960, the town relinquished its ownership interest in the property, but continues to share its use with the Grange, which uses it as its meeting place. On April 11, 1977, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as LaPrairie Grange Hall No. 79.|$|R
50|$|Williams began {{suffering}} from acute arthritis in the 1950s, and in 1952 {{turned over the}} running of the ranch to a young prostitute named Edna Milton. After Williams died in 1961, Milton purchased the property, which she officially renamed Edna's Fashionable Ranch Boarding House. Milton maintained many of Williams's rules for the girls. They were prohibited from drinking or getting tattoos, and were not allowed to visit the bars or cafes in town. Before beginning their employment, the prostitutes were fingerprinted and photographed by Flournoy and underwent a background check. After beginning work, they were required to see the doctor in town weekly for a checkup. To encourage support from the townspeople, supplies were bought from local stores on a rotating basis. Milton also contributed to local civic causes, becoming one of <b>La</b> <b>Grange's</b> largest philanthropists.|$|R

25|$|State Highway 3-A was a {{state highway}} {{proposed}} on July 9, 1917, splitting from the main route at Houston and roughly parallelling it to the north through <b>La</b> <b>Grange</b> and ending at San Marcos. On October 8, 1917, the routing had changed slightly, now veering further north from <b>La</b> <b>Grange</b> through Bastrop and ending in Austin. On August 21, 1923, this routing had been renumbered as SH 71 west of <b>La</b> <b>Grange</b> and SH 73 (now I-10) east of <b>La</b> <b>Grange.</b> SH 3A was reassigned to an alternate routing of SH 3 that was under construction between San Antonio and Waelder.

During non-rush hours, a freight train may run along the line as frequently as once every ten minutes on average. The nearby Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad runs underneath the BNSF line and has trains running through non-stop.|$|E

5000|$|The {{area was}} {{considered}} desirable by the Union Pacific Railroad {{because of the}} many stone quarries in the area {{near the town of}} Stout (now flooded by Horsetooth Reservoir). The influx of railroad workers to work the quarries prompted Flowers to open a general store, saloon, barber shop, and post office. In 1880 he built a one-story sandstone structure to house his business. The Bellvue Post Office opened in the building on June 24, 1884. [...] The building served as the local general store and post office up through the middle 20th century, when it became the meeting house of Cache <b>la</b> Poudre <b>Grange,</b> Chapter 456 of the Colorado State grange, a designation for which it is now commonly known.|$|R
50|$|She {{showed a}} mixture of innocence and {{strength}} in her roles. In 1973 she appeared in three films, Elle court, elle court <b>la</b> banlieue, Les <b>granges</b> brulées and Les aventures de Rabbi Jacob. Her big break came with Blier's Les Valseuses (Going Places), released in 1974. After her role in Les valseuses, she began getting leading roles in comedy and drama. Through the 1970s, she had roles in such films as F comme Fairbanks (1976), Alain Tanner's Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000 (1976), Losey's Roads to the South (1978) and La dérobade (Memoirs of a French Whore, 1979) directed by Daniel Duval, in which she portrayed a young prostitute.

2500|$|Laclède himself {{arrived in}} April 1763 {{to inspect the}} site, at which point he named the village St. Louis and {{provided}} detailed plans for laying out streets and for construction of his headquarters. The plan of the village {{was similar to that}} of New Orleans, including a public marketplace centered on the riverfront and a grid street pattern. The market, Laclède's headquarters, and a church stood in a line of blocks west from the bank of the river, and the market block was separated from the river by a limestone block ledge. Three streets ran parallel to the river: First Street (also known as La Rue Royale, La Grande Rue, and Main Street), Second Street (also known as La Rue d'Eglise or Church Street), and Third Street (also known as <b>La</b> Rue des <b>Granges</b> or Barn Street). North of the market block and perpendicular to the river was Market Street (also known as La Rue de la Place or La Rue Bonhomme); south of the market block were Walnut Street (also known as La Rue de la Tour) and Chestnut Street (also known as La Rue Missouri). [...] In addition, many prominent, intelligent figures, such as Madame Marie-Therese Chouteau, had moved to St. Louis, and with their keen eye and intelligence, was able to advise the new residents on how to best prosper in the local government and home.|$|R
