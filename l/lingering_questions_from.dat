In the {{interview}} he explained that his family, friends and fellow sports athletes had known that he was gay {{for a number of}} years and the coming out was to a wider audience part to answer <b>lingering</b> <b>questions</b> <b>from</b> fans and to be himself. In the interview he told the BBC that he had been in [...] "a really happy relationship" [...] for the last four-and-a-half years.

40|$|What causes {{regions of}} the Russian Federation to opt for {{conflict}} with the central authority? Why do some regions legitimate their conflict with Moscow in overtly ethnic tones, while others do not? In attempting to answer these questions, this research responds {{to the need for}} a reconfigured understanding of federalism and ethnicity in modern society; more specifically, it answers several <b>lingering</b> <b>questions</b> <b>from</b> previous investigations of primordial and rational choice theories. This research concludes that the likelihood of future conflict with Moscow can, in fact, be broken down systematically and predicted. In support of its arguments, the study (1) suggests a two-pronged method of regional analysis that captures primordial and rational explanations of center/periphery conflict, (2) demonstrates the accuracy of a model that simulates this analysis on the macro-level, and (3) tests the suggested theory on the micro level through an in-depth study of the critical case of Tatarstan. In the end,this investigation finds that the regions of Russia 2 ̆ 7 s ethnic federation will pursue their set preference for autonomy whenever certain variables [...] ethnic or otherwise lower the risks associated with center/periphery conflict...|$|E

In addition to reviewing the current literature and case law on voting machine standardization, I also present an unrecognized and undocumented connection between the “all deliberate speed” order in Brown and the Court’s discussion of voting technology in Bush v.

Williams added that they were currently unsure on if they would fund a full second season, do a one time movie answering the <b>lingering</b> <b>questions</b> left over <b>from</b> season one, or do a movie to [...] "re-introduce UnderGRADS to a new audience and try to get the second season that way." ...|$|R
40|$|Digital systems pervade classic STS {{sites of}} interest, from {{connecting}} laboratories to mediating lay-expert divides. But STS {{has so far}} been reticent to build the theoretical and analytical perspectives necessary for embracing digital systems as an important element of contemporary fieldwork, research, and practice. This paper charts a course for bringing STS concepts to bear on digital systems and vice versa, bringing our <b>lingering</b> concern with <b>questions</b> <b>from</b> the sociology of knowledge to bear on digitally-enacted and mediated scientific and technical practices. It shows how we can eschew the language of technological determinism inherent to discussion about digital systems outside of STS, asking instead questions germane to STS theory and practice such as the configuration of such systems to include and exclude, the epistemic entanglements of using digital tools in research practice, and the potential to build new systems that suggest alternative arrangements...|$|R
