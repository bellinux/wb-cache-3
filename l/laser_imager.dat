In the application to be discussed here, the system was utilized as an imaging system for background features in a forested locale. The SPARTA mini-ladar system was used at the International Paper Northern Experimental Forest near Howland, Maine to assist in a project designed to study the thermal and radiometric phenomenology at forest edges. The imager was used to obtain data from three complex sites, a 'seed' orchard, a forest edge, and a building. The goal {{of the study was to}} demonstrate the usefulness of the <b>laser</b> <b>imager</b> as a tool to obtain geometric and internal structure data about complex 3 -D objects in a natural background. The data from these images have been analyzed to obtain information about the distributions of the objects in a scene. A range detection algorithm has been used to identify individual objects in a laser image and an edge detection algorithm then applied to highlight the outlines of discrete objects. An example of an image processed in such a manner is shown. Described here are the results from the study. In addition, results are presented outlining how the laser imaging system could be used to obtain other important information about bio/geophysical systems, such as the distribution of woody material in forests...|$|E

30|$|The other {{phenomenon}} {{affecting the}} performances of underwater <b>laser</b> <b>imagers</b> is scattering. Light backscattered by water and falling into the angular field {{of view of the}} receiver gives rise to an undesirable signal (optical noise), which combines with the target signal that carries the information necessary to image reconstruction. (Because of its deleterious effects on 3 D imaging measures, the signal due to light backscattered by water {{is often referred to as}} optical noise in this work-although it cannot be considered noise in strict sense.) The result is a reduction of the accuracy of range measurements, as well as a degradation of image contrast. It follows that optical noise has to be strongly reduced, in order to obtain 3 D images of high contrast, resolution and accuracy.|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the technical cooperation agreements between the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the European Atomic Energy Commission (EURATOM), and between DOE and the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of nuclear materials (ABACC), a collaborative effort has been established to investigate the use of a three dimensional (3 D) laser imaging system combined with gamma imaging systems for international safeguards applications. The effort is being conducted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the Joint Research Centre at Ispra, Italy (JRC-Ispra) and ABACC. In a previous study, ORNL, LLNL and JRC-Ispra demonstrated the capability of combining outputs from a commercially available 3 D laser system and gamma-ray imager prototypes. Because safeguards inspections rely heavily on design information verification, gamma and neutron measurements, the possibility of combining different measurement techniques into one tool would optimize inspection effort and increase effectiveness.

40|$|Computer aided {{design of}} a {{prosthesis}} for a below-the-knee (trans-tibial) amputee begins with a digitized representation of {{the shape of the}} residual limb. Certain anatomical landmarks must be located on this shape to identify optimal areas for load and pressure relief. Normally, the technician or prosthetist operating the digitizer places the marks on the shape before or after digitization. This method is somewhat prone to human error and bias. The approach presented here uses a pattern recognition algorithm in the digitizer's control software to locate automatically these landmarks at the time of digitization. Automating this task reduces error and allows the techician to work more efficiently. Neural networks are used to find the midpoint of the patellar tendon, the head of the fibula, and the distal end of the tibia. Neural networks are computational devices, simulated in a computer program, that are capable of recognizing and classifying patterns such as features in a digitized shape. The neural networks are trained to place markers on a set of shapes for which the landmarks have been located manually. Once they have learned to recognize the landmarks in the training set, the neural networks can then be used to find them for arbitrary shapes. Each neural network is trained on a different anatomical landmark. Experimental results show that the method is at least as accurate as a trained prosthetist. The method has been incorporated into software controlling a laser-scanning device (The San Antonio <b>Laser</b> <b>Imager)</b> that digitizes the surface of the skin. Within seconds after the patient's residual limb is scanned, the predicted landmarks are placed onto the digitized shape, which can then be modified in a CAD program for socket design...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of gas leaks represents a critical operation performed regularly by the gas industry {{to maintain the}} integrity and safety of its vast network of piping, both {{above and below the}} ground. We are developing a technology that allows the real-time imaging of gas plumes in a television format. Termed backscatter absorption gas imaging (BAGI), the technique operates by illuminating a scene with infrared laser radiation having a wavelength that is absorbed by the gas to be detected (in this case, methane). Backscattered laser radiation is used to create a video image of the scene. If a leak of the target gas is present in the field-of-view of the camera, it attenuates a portion of the backscatter and creates a dark cloud in the video picture. The specific purpose of this project is to investigate a new method of accomplishing BAGI using a pulsed laser source. The efficacy of using BAGI to detect natural gas leaks has already been demonstrated using a first-generation gas imaging technology that was developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. That technique accomplishes imaging by scanning a continuous-wave infrared laser (infrared helium-neon laser, emitting at 3. 39 {mu}m) across a scene at real-time video rates as the scene is imaged by a scanned infrared camera. The primary limitation to the use of that system is the weak output energy of the helium neon laser (30 mW). The pulsed <b>laser</b> <b>imager</b> under development in this project is expected to have a range ({ge} 40 m) and sensitivity (< 10 ppm-m) that will surpass the respective attributes of the scanned imager. The pulsed system will operate by flooding (rather than scanning) the imaged scene with pulses of laser radiation. Imaging will be accomplished using a focal-plane array camera that operates in a snapshot format. The higher power of the pulsed laser source and the more effective collection optics of the focal-plane array-based receiver will allow the performance enhancements to be achieved...|$|E

30|$|The {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. In the first part, {{we set up}} a simple theoretical framework, by summarizing results that help shed light on the characteristics of optical noise in underwater imaging systems. In particular, in Sections 2 and 3 we develop a simplified model of water backscattering that specifically applies to the case of AM <b>laser</b> <b>imagers,</b> by providing an analytical solution to the corresponding radiative transfer problem in the small angle diffusion approximation. The model is exploited in Section 4 to outline some possible modulation/demodulation experimental procedures, that enable the cancellation of optical noise by exploiting the existence of an interference-like effect between water and target signals. A complementary polarimetric approach is described in Section 5, where we briefly introduce the Muller-Stokes formalism, and use it to give grounds for the different polarization characteristics of light scattered by the medium and the target, respectively. In {{the second part of the}} article, we assess the effectiveness of the optical noise rejection techniques suggested by theory, by describing a number of experiments purposely carried out in the ENEA laboratories. Specifically, the experimental apparatus is briefly described in Section 6. In Section 7 we verify the low-pass filter behavior of water backscattering as a function of the modulation frequency in AM systems [7 – 9]. The analysis of how the water backscattering signal affects the performance of AM <b>laser</b> 3 D <b>imagers</b> in turbid water—firstly published in [10] and then further explored in [11, 12]—is given in Section 8, where methods for the direct cancellation of the optical noise are also suggested.

40|$|The <b>laser</b> speckle {{contrast}} <b>imager</b> (LSCI) provides a powerful yet simple technique for measuring microcirculatory blood flow. Ideal for blood dynamic responses, the LSCI {{is used in}} the same way as a conventional <b>Laser</b> Doppler <b>Imager</b> (LDI). However, with a maximum skin depth of approximately 1 mm, the LSCI is designed to focus on mainly superficial blood flow. It is used to measure skin surface areas of up to 15 cm x 20 cm. The new technique introduced in this paper accounts for alternating speeds of microcirculations; i. e. both slow and fast flow flux measurement using the LSCI. The novel technique also overcomes LSCI's biggest shortcoming, which is high sensitivity to artifact movement. An adhesive opaque patch (AOP) is introduced for satisfactory recording of microcirculatory blood flow, by subtracting the LSCI signal from the AOP from the laser speckle skin signal. The optimal setting is also defined because the LSCI is most powerful when flux changes are measured relative to a reference baseline, with blood microcirculatory flux expressed as a percentage change from the baseline. These changes may be used for analyzing the status of the blood flow syste...|$|R

40|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} {{emphasis on}} maintaining road assets {{to a high}} standard, the need for fast accurate inspection for road distresses is becoming extremely important. Surface distresses on roads are essentially three dimensional (3 -D) in nature. Automated visual surveys are the best option available. However, the imaging conditions, in terms of lighting, etc., are very random. For example, the challenge of measuring {{the volume of the}} pothole requires a large field of view with a reasonable spatial resolution, whereas microtexture evaluation requires very accurate imaging. Within the two extremes, there is a range of situations that require 3 -D imaging. Three-dimensional imaging consists of a number of techniques such as interferometry and depth from focus. Out of these, <b>laser</b> <b>imagers</b> are mainly used for road surface distress inspection. Many other techniques are relatively unknown among the transportation community, and industrial products are rare. The main impetus for this paper is derived from the rarity of 3 -D industrial imagers that employ alternative techniques for use in transportation. In addition, the need for this work is also highlighted by a lack of literature that evaluates the relative merits/demerits of various imaging methods for different distress measurement situations in relation to pavements.

40|$|For several years, {{detecting}} {{and preventing}} cardiovascular diseases {{have become a}} major issue. Different methods {{have been developed to}} evaluate endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction {{is one of the first}} steps leading to atherosclerosis. This review presents an insight into endothelial function, the interests of its assessment and methods for studying endothelial function. To date, the vascular endothelium must be considered as a specific organ with its own functions that contribute to the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system. Endothelial dysfunction typically corresponds to a decrease of nitric oxide NO bioavailability. Biological or physico-chemical methods may be used to assess dysfunction. Biological methods allow measuring NO metabolites and pro-inflammatory and vasoconstrictor mediators released by the endothelium. The physico-chemical methods include intra-coronary injections, plethysmography, flow-mediated dilation (FMD), digital plethysmography and optical techniques using laser (laser Doppler single-point, <b>laser</b> Doppler <b>imager,</b> <b>laser</b> speckle contrast imaging) that can be coupled with provocation tests (iontophoresis, microdialysis, post-ischemic hyperemia, local heating).

Stereo-photogrammetric techniques have been extensively developed, and many researchers {{have looked at}} related techniques such as shape from motion, shape from accommodation, and shape from shading. Recently, considerable attention has focused on laser radar systems for imaging distant objects, such as automobiles from an airborne platform, and on laser-based active stereo imaging for close-range objects, such as part scanners for automated inspection. Each use of these <b>laser</b> <b>imagers</b> generally results in a range image, an array of distance measurements {{as a function of}} direction. For multi-look data or data fused from multiple sensors, we may more generally treat the data as a 3 D point-cloud, an unordered collection of 3 D points measured {{from the surface of the}} scene. This paper presents a general approach to object recognition in the presence of significant clutter, that is suitable for application to a wide range of 3 D imaging systems. The approach relies on a probabilistic framework relating 3 D point-cloud data and the objects from which they are measured. Through this framework a minimum probability of error recognition algorithm is derived that accounts for both obscuring and nonobscuring clutter, and that accommodates arbitrary (range and cross-range) measurement errors. The algorithm is applied to a problem of target recognition from actual 3 D point-cloud data measured in the laboratory from scale models of civilian automobiles. Noisy 3 D measurements are used to train models of the automobiles, and these models are used to classify the automobiles when present in a scene containing natural and man-made clutter...|$|R
