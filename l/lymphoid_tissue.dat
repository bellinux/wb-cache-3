These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable thymus and a well-developed spleen (their most important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{enters the}} body through the mouth, infecting the first cells {{with which it}} comes in contact — the pharynx and {{intestinal}} mucosa. It gains entry by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or CD155, on the cell membrane. The virus then hijacks the host cell's own machinery, and begins to replicate. Poliovirus divides within gastrointestinal cells for about a week, from where it spreads to the tonsils (specifically the follicular dendritic cells residing within the tonsilar germinal centers), the intestinal <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissue</b> including the M cells of Peyer's patches, and the deep cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes, where it multiplies abundantly. The virus is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E

40|$|To {{define the}} role of alpha/beta interferons (IFN-α/β) in simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) infection, IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA levels and mRNA levels of Mx, an antiviral effector molecule, were determined in <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> of rhesus macaques infected with pathogenic SIV. IFN-α/β responses were induced during the acute phase and persisted in various <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> throughout the chronic phase of infection. IFN-α/β responses were most consistent in tissues with high viral RNA levels; thus, IFN-α/β responses were not generally associated with effective control of SIV replication. IFN-α/β responses were differentially regulated in different <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> and {{at different stages of}} infection. The most consistent IFN-α/β responses in acute and chronic SIV infection were observed in peripheral lymph nodes. In the spleen, only a transient increase in IFN-α/β mRNA levels during acute SIV infection was observed. Further, IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA levels showed a tissue-specific expression pattern during the chronic, but not the acute, phase of infection. In the acute phase of infection, SIV RNA levels in <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> of rhesus macaques correlated with mRNA levels of both IFN-α and IFN-β, whereas during chronic SIV infection only increased IFN-α mRNA levels correlated with the level of virus replication in the same <b>tissues.</b> In <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> of all SIV-infected monkeys, higher viral RNA levels were associated with increased Mx mRNA levels. We found no evidence that monkeys with increased Mx mRNA levels in <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> had enhanced control of virus replication. In fact, Mx mRNA levels were associated with high viral RNA levels in <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> of chronically infected animals...|$|R

40|$|The omentum {{contains}} peculiar <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> termed omental milky spots. In NZB mice, omental milky spots show extramedullary neutrophilic myelopoiesis and mgakaryopoiesis. Similar milky spots（ splenoportal milky spots）, {{which also}} show similar hematopoiesis, {{are present in}} the splenoportal fat band developing along the splenic artery. The splenoportal fat band contains sporadic aberrant spleens. In addition, transitional forms between splenoportal milky spots and aberrant spleens are occasionally present in the fat band. These three types of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> in the fat band are supplied by branches of the splenic artery. Based upon the blood vessel supply, the extramedullary hematopoiesis and the morphological transition from aberrant spleens via transitional forms to splenoportal milky spots, splenoportal milky spots seem to represent splenoid <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues.</b> Taking into account the similarity between omental and splenoportal milky spots, the deduction that omental milky spots also represent splenoid <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> may be made.

Immunohistochemical staining of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> revealed alterations {{in a number of}} immune cell populations in both transiently- and persistently-infected macaques. The precise pattern depended upon the infection status of the macaque and the marker studied.

40|$|Immunoglobulin (Ig) {{secreting}} cells {{occur in}} all <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues,</b> including {{the bone marrow}} (BM). There are important differences between the various organs {{with respect to their}} number of Ig-secreting cells and the heavy chain isotype distribution of the secreted Igs. Furthermore, both distribution patterns depend on age. Early in life most Ig-secreting cells are localized in spleen and lymph nodes. In adults, however, the majority of all Ig-secreting cells of the individual are localized in the BM. Immunization can lead to the appearance of substantial numbers of antibody-forming cells in BM. The kinetics of the BM response are different from the response in the peripheral <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues.</b> Shortly after immunization most antibody-forming cells occur in the peripheral <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues,</b> but later on, especially during secondary type responses, most antibody-forming cells are localized in the BM.

40|$|Circulation {{of mature}} {{lymphocytes}} between blood and secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> plays {{a central role}} in the immune system. Homing of lymphocytes from blood into secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> beyond high endothelial venules is highly dependent on the interaction between the chemokines CCL 19, CCL 21, CXCL 12, and CXCL 13, and their receptors CCR 7, CXCR 4 and CXCR 5. However, the molecular mechanism(s) of lymphocyte egress from secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> to lymph remained unclear. We have found a new class of immunomodulator, FTY 720 by chemical modification of vegetative wasp-derived natural product, ISP-I (myriocin). FTY 720 has been shown to be highly effective in experimental allograft and autoimmune disease models. A striking feature of FTY 720 is the induction of a marked decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes at doses that show immunomodulating activity in these models. The reduction of circulating lymphocytes by FTY 720 is caused by sequestration of lymphocytes into secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> and thymus. FTY 720 is rapidly converted to (S) -enantiomer of FTY 720 -phosphate [(S) -FTY 720 -P] by sphingosine kinase 2 in vivo. (S) -FTY 720 -P acting as a potent agonist of S 1 P receptor type 1 (S 1 P 1), induces long-term down-regulation of S 1 P 1 on lymphocytes, and thereby inhibits the migration of lymphocytes toward S 1 P. Thus, it is presumed that FTY 720 -induced lymphocyte sequestration is due to the inhibition of S 1 P/S 1 P 1 -dependent lymphocyte egress from secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> and thymus by its active metabolite (S) -FTY 720 -P. Throughout the analysis of the mechanism of action of FTY 720, it is clarified that S 1 P/S 1 P 1 interaction plays an important role for lymphocyte egress from secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> and thymus...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of cytoplasmic bodies in <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> of mammals was first described by Downey and Weidenreich (1912).

In the present study, the mode of occurrence of these bodies in imprints and sections of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> of rabbits, mice and young chickens was investigated, {{in relation to the}} functional differentiation of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> into the central and the peripheral ones. The chief findings are as follows: 1. In the peripheral <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues,</b> such as lymph nodes and spleen (splenic white pulp), cytoplasmic bodies of varying size are found in large numbers, whereas they are scanty in the central <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> such as the thymus, although in the appendix and sacculus rotundus of rabbits, {{as well as in the}} bursa of Fabricius of young chickens, they are not so few as in the thymus. 2. Cytoplasmic bodies stained red by methyl green-pyronin, after fixing in Carnoy's fluid. They are chiefly composed of pyroninophilic granules or threads. They vary greatly in size, from the size of blood platelets to that of small lymphocytes. After digestion of the samples with RNase, the pyroninophilia of these bodies disappeared completely. Feulgen reaction is negative in these bodies. 3. In the lymph nodes and spleen, which had previously been stimulated by antigen, cytoplamic bodies occurred in much greater numbers than in the unstimulated control tissues...|$|R

After transplantation donor DLs migrate rapidly from mouse cardiac allografts into the recipients's spleens. Within the spleens donor DLs associate with recipient CD 4 + T cells. Isolated cardiac DLs, like lymphoid dendritic cells, are potent stimulators of T-cell proliferation in vitro. This suggests that DLs function as passenger leukocytes by migrating from grafts into the <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> of the recipient and that sensitization to vascularized organ allografts may occur centrally within <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> rather than peripherally in the graft itself...|$|R
