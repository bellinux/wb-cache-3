Cargoes intended for Ireland were shipped to Portugal. It was up to the Irish to fetch them from there. This route, known as the Iberian Trade or the Lisbon run. Setting sail from Ireland, the ships would carry agricultural products to the United Kingdom. There they would discharge their cargo, <b>load</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> fuel, pick up a British export (often coal), and carry it to Portugal. In Portugal, usually Lisbon, Irish ships loaded the waiting American cargo, such as fertilizer or agricultural machinery.|$|E

2500|$|... 2015 Greek {{sovereign}} debt default: The publicly acrimonious discussions between Greece and EU-ECB-IMF troika {{culminated in the}} 2015 Greek referendum which massively rejected the terms for accepting bail-out money [...] {{and led to a}} surge in public support for populist political parties in Southern European countries. The suggestion of a temporary 'time-out' from the EuroZone for Greece by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble and a German Finance Ministry suggestion that Greece move titles to Greek assets - including heritage sites and islands to an [...] "external fund" [...] based in Luxembourg to serve as collateral in exchange for bail-out money from the EU-ECB-IMF troika; infuriated many policy-makers who perceived Germany's demands as humiliating punishment and refreshed memories to post-WWII reparations owed by the German government which were never fully repaid due to extensive debt-relief accorded to Germany. Pablo Iglesias, a prominent anti-austerity leader in Spain, hailed the Greek rejection of the bailout plan and expressed solidarity with Greece: [...] "We don’t want to be a German colony". In Italy, Beppe Grillo mocked Germany and the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the IMF troika of lenders saying [...] "Now Merkel and bankers will have food for thought.". Jacob Soll, professor of history and accounting at the University of Southern California, summarized the sentiment amongst academics in Germany: [...] "Germans were honest dupes and the Greeks corrupt, unreliable and incompetent.". Expressing dismay about the far-reaching geopolitical implications of Greece leaving the Eurozone, Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European studies at Oxford University, termed the German-inspired policy prescriptions as deeply flawed and possibly unachievable by Greece [...] "even with the best political will in the world." [...] and warned how the Grexit ("Greece exit") will be perceived elsewhere: [...] "EU can’t get its act together" [...] adding {{that it would be a}} [...] "huge blow for the EU particularly in the eyes of the outside world: China, India, Russia, and the U.S., not to mention closer neighbors." [...] Leading academics and analysts highlighted that EuroZone anti-deficit policies forced upon Greece by the German-backed troika to curb public spending had brought about deflationary pressure, weakened demand and led to widespread unemployment in several EuroZone countries. Paul Krugman, a Nobel economics winner, stated that he was troubled by the actions of the troika to use economics as a weapon to force a regime change in Greece. Fellow Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz squarely faulted the troika for imposing upon Greece an [...] "unconscionable torture of the present". Wharton finance professor Bulent Gultekin opined: [...] "The endless austerity measures have made it worse for the country. It's been the wrong remedy for the wrong patient at the wrong time". John Cochrane, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University pointed to the source of the current crisis : [...] "Europe should not have bailed out German and French banks and allowed Greece to default in the first instance. In a currency union, {{sovereign debt}} is like corporate debt. Corporations default — or they should — without bailouts, and don’t leave a currency zone when they do so. Europe should not have allowed and encouraged national banks to <b>load</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> national debts." [...] Francesco Caselli, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, opined that Greece should [...] "focus on structural reforms rather than austerity. Greece should have gotten meaningful debt relief and much more time to balance the deficit." [...] Olivier Chatain, strategy and business policy professor at HEC business school in Paris opined: [...] "There's a big chasm between what's asked of Greece and what they can do." [...] Mauro Guillén, Wharton management professor and director of The Lauder Institute urged an effort from the creditor nations: [...] "Wages in Germany should rise and government demand for goods and services should increase,(...) Surplus economies, like Germany and the Netherlands, who can spend more should do so". Patrick Minford, professor of economics at Cardiff University in Wales pointedly observed the destructive nature of German economic policies which result in massive trade surpluses for Germany while pauperising weaker EuroZone countries: [...] "unhealthy for Germany to run very large trade surpluses. They’re sabotaging the rest of Europe." [...] Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute assessed the current situation saying: [...] "Greece's debt cannot be paid back under any circumstances, (..) They need to undergo bankruptcy proceedings. We cannot move forward until the Germans and Dutch begin to realize this money will never get paid back and [...] are pushing the Greek economy further into depression." ...|$|E

50|$|Brander and Lewis {{proposed}} a duopoly {{model in which}} it might be rational for the managers of a corporation to <b>load</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> debt, {{to a degree that}} would be socially dysfunctional. In the model, management might deliberately incur debts in order to wed its interests to those of the shareholders and pursue with their support a risky low-margin, high-output strategy that in turn may gain market share. This gamble has a chance of success if the other duopolist is low-risk, and would rather leave the market than engage in a price-cutting war. On the other hand, if both duopolists adopt the same approach, though, the result is that they are both worse off than if neither had. Furthermore, that result will have negative social utility—the affected market will resemble the recent airline industry in North America.|$|E
