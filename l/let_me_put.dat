In May 2010, Daley {{held a press conference}} to address gun control and a pending possible adverse decision in McDonald v. Chicago. After Mick Dumke, a reporter for the Chicago Reader, questioned the effectiveness of the city's handgun ban, Daley picked up a rifle with a bayonet from a display table of confiscated weapons and told him, [...] "If I put this up your butt, you'll find out how effective it is. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>put</b> a round up your, you know."

Colbert had earlier appeared on The Daily Show, the program immediately preceding his own on the Comedy Central lineup, but had stated that his final declaration of candidacy would be made on a [...] "more prestigious show".

2500|$|Reflecting on {{his first}} six novels and his rapid writing {{turnover}} later in his career, DeLillo remarked, [...] "I wasn't learning {{to slow down and}} examine what I was doing more closely. I don't have regrets about that work, but I do think that if I had been a bit less hasty in starting each new book, I might have produced somewhat better work in the 1970s. My first novel took so long and was such an effort that once I was free of it I almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade, stopping, in a way, only at Ratner's Star (1976), which was an enormous challenge for me, and probably a bigger challenge for the reader. But I slowed down in the 1980s and '90s." [...] DeLillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his 1970s works, reflecting in 2007: [...] "I knew I wasn’t doing utterly serious work, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>put</b> it that way." ...|$|E

[...] "She's going in so hard with the R Of course, she is going to give the Pop crowd what they're looking for. But, she really is returning to R on this album. Her delivery is real confident now. It's definitely a new Kelly Rowland. She wouldn't even <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>put</b> autotune on her voice this time round. She was like 'No, I want people to really get me'." [...] The following month, Rowland told MTV News that the album would have a theme and that she had been documenting the recording process of the album for her fans to see. During an interview with Vegas magazine in June 2012, she described the album as a dedication to [...] "my ladies". She explained, [...] "I want to tell women how incredible we are, how our intuition is so spot-on. Sometimes we don't listen to it, but it is the thing that can actually make us happier." [...] Rowland cited Whitney Houston, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder as the album's inspirations.|$|E

60|$|Upon the 9th day of May, 1711, one James Welch {{came down}} to my cabin, and said, “he had orders from the captain to set me ashore.” I expostulated with him, but in vain; neither would he so much as tell me who their new captain was. They forced me into the long-boat, <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>put</b> on my best suit of clothes, which were as good as new, and take a small bundle of linen, but no arms, except my hanger; {{and they were so}} civil as not to search my pockets, into which I {{conveyed}} what money I had, with some other little necessaries. They rowed about a league, and then set me down on a strand. I desired them to tell me what country it was. They all swore, “they knew no more than myself;” but said, “that the captain” (as they called him) “was resolved, after they had sold the lading, to get rid of me in the first place where they could discover land.” They pushed off immediately, advising me to make haste for fear of being overtaken by the tide, and so bade me farewell.|$|R
5000|$|John Ajvide Lindqvist, {{author of}} Let the Right One In, who also wrote the {{screenplay}} {{for the original}} Swedish film, was pleased with <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> In. He said: I might just be the luckiest writer alive. To have not only one, but two excellent versions of my debut novel done for the screen feels unreal. Let the Right One In is a great Swedish movie. <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> In is a great American movie. There are notable similarities {{and the spirit of}} Tomas Alfredson is present. But <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> In <b>puts</b> the emotional pressure in different places and stands firmly on its own legs.
