40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} suspension system and its <b>lower</b> <b>arm.</b> These analyses were specifically applied on <b>lower</b> suspension <b>arm</b> to determine its vibration and stress behaviour during its operation. The suspension system {{is one of the}} most important components of vehicle, which directly affects the safety, performance, noise level and style of it. The main objectives are to have less stress on <b>lower</b> suspension <b>arm</b> system as well as to reduce imposed load by optimization. The optimization of imposed load on <b>lower</b> suspension <b>arm</b> system is directly related to imposed force on the vehicle created by the road. This load has a direct effect on the value of imposed force on <b>lower</b> <b>arm,</b> where the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> force will be minimized by reducing the applied load. Hence, genetic algorithms for optimization and MATLAB optimization toolbar are used, as well as, specific M-file codes have been developed into MATLAB for optimization. By determining optimized design values of suspension system for reducing road force, it is possible to survey vibration condition of <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> according to frequency respond of suspension system and its natural frequency. Therefore, frequency response of its acceleration has been determined according to the whole mass of suspension system. Using FFT technique and making transfer function for frequency response of suspension system, will present responded frequency of suspension system which is using for vibration analysis. For stress analysis, load condition of <b>lower</b> suspension <b>arm</b> system must be determined in advance. Hence, a typical model of McPherson suspension system has been selected for analysis. According to the road profile considered for analysis and the velocity of vehicle, it is possible to obtain both velocity and acceleration equations for whole components of McPherson suspension system. These values are used to determine dynamic force condition of <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> suspension system during its operation. By using dynamic forces which are governing on <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> of suspension system, in ABAQUS, the stress condition of <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> can be determined during its operation...|$|R

40|$|Pressure {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{sensitive}} factors influencing the arterial wall compliance. Pulse transit time (PTT) is one simple way to assess arterial compliance changes. This study investigated the relationship between external cuff pressure and pulse transit time. The study was performed on 10 subjects with different cuff pressures (0, 10, 20 and 30 mmHg) on the <b>lower</b> <b>arm,</b> upper arm and whole arm (with two cuffs applied simultaneously on the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> and upper arm). The overall mean pulse transit time difference with the above different cuff pressures on the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> compared with that without cuff pressure were 3. 3 ms, 6. 9 ms, 10. 1 ms. With the cuff on the upper arm, changes with increasing cuff pressure were greater, which were 3. 7 ms, 8. 5 ms and 13. 1 ms. And for the whole arm, the changes were 5. 6 ms, 11. 6 ms and 18. 0 ms, which were greater still. The mean PTT when the cuff pressure was applied to the whole arm was significantly larger (P< 0. 001) than the corresponding mean PTT when the cuff pressure was separately applied to the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> and upper arm. The mean PTT with the cuff on upper arm was also significantly larger than the corresponding mean PTT with the cuff on the <b>lower</b> <b>arm,</b> except with a cuff pressure of 10 mmHg. The sum of PTT changes with the cuff on the upper and the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> was significantly larger than that with the cuff on whole arm. A conclusion was made that when the external cuff pressure increased, arterial wall compliance increased, which was detected with increased pulse transit time. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{dual-mode}} {{input voltage}} modulation (IVM) control scheme for a three-phase zero current switching series resonant (SR) inverter-fed three-phase voltage-multiplier based X-ray power supply is proposed {{to achieve a}} quick rise of output voltage. In this control scheme, a quasi-resonant control circuit is connected at the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> of the three-phase inverter to control the effective input voltage across the inverter by raising or lowering the voltage level at the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> of the inverter. At the startup of the power supply, the quasi-resonant control circuit shorts the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> of the three-phase SR inverter to ground, causing the inverter to see maximum voltage and the output voltage to rise with maximum speed toward the target voltage. As the output voltage reaches 90 % of the target voltage, the effective input voltage across the inverter is reduced to a value that corresponds to the target output voltage by raising the voltage level at the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> of the inverter. As a result, the rise rate of the output voltage slows down and overshoot is prevented. Experimental results based on the scaled-down laboratory prototype are presented to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed dual-mode IVM control scheme...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn many field organizations, such {{as those}} in the {{industrial}} and service sectors, poor working posture is a common issue that can lead to various human body problems, particularly musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and physiological stress. Numerous tasks in the workplace, particularly in the industrial sector (i. e., manual material handling tasks), require an individual to perform in poor working conditions to meet task demands. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate musculoskeletal disorders and identify ergonomic factors related to lower back, shoulder and <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> pain in two types of manual tasks: lifting and pulling objects in supermarket warehouses. A total of 92 male workers (ages 26 – 38) participated; 45 workers performed lifting tasks (first posture) and 47 workers performed a task that involved pulling heavy objects (second posture). Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and a pain self-report chart were used. The heart rate (HR) was continuously recorded to evaluate the physiological stresses of each task posture. The results showed that lifting task highly significantly impacted low back pain among all participants. In addition, the results found a significant correlation existed between trunk, upper <b>arm</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> scores and all self-report charts of pain and discomfort in the <b>lower</b> back, upper <b>arm</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> region for all participants. Also, the pulling heavy object task posture significantly affected the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> score and reflected a highest prevalence of MSDs on wrist body part. The results presented a significant association existed between <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> and wrist scores and all self-report charts of pain and discomfort in the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> and wrist body parts of all participants. The higher HR value was associated with the lifting task posture. There was a significant difference between both task postures overall. The results of the study proved that the RULA method was a useful tool to assess the MSDs on body regions in manual lifting and pulling tasks...|$|R

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> act as a coordinative structure coupled through a higher order control system. Five healthy participants moved their hand between two targets in ten conditions via internal/external rotation of the shoulder. In eight conditions, the task required concurrent rotation of the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> (180 ° pronation/supination). Movements were stereotypical within a condition but plotting the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> angle against each other produced an asymmetrical pattern. With internal rotation, the upper arm reached peak angular velocity slower than the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> but this was reversed with external rotation. In two conditions, participants were asked to move faster and slower than their normal speed. The peak speed, time to peak speed and duration were predictable for the different tasks. Internal and external asymmetries decreased with faster movements. In addition a decrease in upper arm amplitude (from 90 ° to 30 °) removed the asymmetry. The asymmetry was unaffected by initial posture but was exaggerated when external rotation was paired with pronation rather than supination, and internal rotation combined with supination (versus pronation). However, the presence of the same fundamental pattern suggests that the asymmetry is not due to biomechanical factors but might arise because of the difficulties involved in visually monitoring the hand when it is close to the body. The results support the idea that functional coupling can occur between upper and <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> rotations and thus provides further evidence for a higher order control system which is responsible for coordination of arm segment movement. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the correlation between body mass index (BMI) and upper and <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> as well as lower leg circumferences and the frequency of correct blood pressure (BP) cuff fit. We explored recommendations for the most likely BP cuff size and location for the three BMI categories. Materials and Methods: Following IRB approval we retrospectively analyzed a research database of bariatric surgical patients with a BMI of ≥ 40 kg/m 2. Data included patients′ characteristics, upper and <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> as well as lower leg circumferences. Patients were divided into three groups based on BMI (kg/m 2, Group I: 55). Appropriate cuff fit using a standard or large adult BP cuff (CRITIKON ®, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA) on the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>arm,</b> and <b>lower</b> leg was determined. We analyzed the percent proportion of proper cuff fit for cuff sizes and locations between groups using appropriate nonparametric testing. Results: Limb circumference correlated significantly with BMI (P = 0. 01), and the upper arm correlated most closely (r = 0. 76). A standard adult BP cuff on the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> fit properly in > 90 % and > 80 % and in Groups I and II, respectively. A large cuff on the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> was appropriate in 87 % of Group III. In two participants, a large cuff fit properly on the lower leg. Discussion: Limb circumference significantly correlated with BMI. Recommendations for proper cuff fit in different BMI categories can be made...|$|R
