Due to increasing competition {{in the market for}} fertilizers and the lack of new products, company revenue fell from 570 million DM in 1985 to 370 million DM. The company posted increasing financial losses, partly due to its <b>locational</b> <b>disadvantage</b> as all raw materials and all final goods had to be transported by truck from the factory to Cologne's Rhine harbor. Another disadvantage was the location of the factory in a densely populated residential area and a decreasing acceptance of the pollution caused by the factory. Without operating profits a relocation of the factory was not feasible, and thus, without any prospects, the fertilizer production was shut down in 1989. Employment fell from 1400 employees in 1985 to 830 in 1990, with the factory only producing sodium carbonate, calcium chloride and phosphate for animal feed. Although losses were reduced to almost zero in 1990, the financial situation deteriorated in 1992 when the prices for sodium carbonate fell. The fall in prices was partly due to the lifting of anti-dumping on sodium carbonate imports from the American Natural Soda Ash Corporation (ANSAC) by the European Commission. Another factor in the worsening financial situation was an antitrust fine of US$1.38 million imposed by the European commission for participating in a sodium carbonate cartel together with Solvay and Imperial Chemical Industries.

40|$|In {{regional}} planning literature {{it is often}} argued that regional deconcentration process and urban sprawl tend {{to increase the amount}} and distance of commuting (Vandersmissen et al. 2003). Supported by improved traffic infrastructure and falling transport costs, the spatial division of labour and housing locations extends the travel-to-work areas and compensates for <b>locational</b> <b>disadvantages</b> associated with local labour markets (Moss et al. 2004). On the other hand, the contrary hypothesis is postulated, too.

The intention {{of this paper is to}} analyse the influence of spatial structure on commuting behaviour of employees.

It is argued that the real estate development process encompasses a diverse range of activities and actors.

It analyses a transactions database of European real estate markets to provide insights into the extent of, and variations in, market penetration by non-domestic real estate developers. The data {{were consistent with the}} expectation that non-domestic real estate developers from mature markets would have a high level of market penetration in immature markets. Compared to western European markets, the CEE real estate office sales by developers were dominated by US, Israeli and other EU developers. This pattern is consistent with the argument that non-domestic developers have substantial Dunning-type ownership advantages when entering immature real estate markets. However, the data also suggested some unexpected patterns. Relative to their GDP, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands and Israel accounted for large proportions of sales by developers. All are EU countries (except Israel) with small, open, affluent, highly traded economies.

40|$|Policies for {{regional}} development have undergone {{a major shift}} since the 1980 s, {{under the influence of}} changed circumstances and new thinking {{about the nature of the}} problem. In the old paradigm, development is largely a matter of getting the right combination of factors of production to achieve efficiency. There is, generally speaking, only one such combination and hence one best way of achieving efficient production. Territory in this view is important only in the sense of location, that is only as far as distance affects the costs of production. So proximity to raw materials and markets is important, and it may matter whether suppliers are near enough to users to reduce the transportation costs of intermediary goods but that is all. Regional policy thus sought to remove these <b>locational</b> <b>disadvantages</b> by a variety of mechanisms, but above all by investing in infrastructure, and diverting investment in manufacturing industry from booming regions into needy ones. More elaborate forms of policy included ‘growth poles’, a concept originally devised with a sectoral meaning but adapted to territory, in which large industries would be located in development regions with a view to stimulating the growth of suppliers and complementary producers. In this way, it was hoped, a self-sustaining growth cycle could be started. Diversionary policy has long been criticized in some quarters as expensive and ineffective and it...|$|R

There have been similar kinds of programs running in Bangladesh since the country’s independence in 1971, and people who are landless or victimized due to river bank erosion, cyclones, or floods have been relocated under the umbrella program called ‘Guchchagram’, i. e., cluster villages. Different ruling parties had used different names for the project due to the financial nature of the project, but none of them have significantly differed from the overall goals and objectives of relocated settlements and the betterment of the landless and extreme event victims.

Although macroeconomic policies {{play an important role}} in growth and poverty reduction, there has been very little work on the issue for small island economies or microstates.

40|$|The {{modernisation}} {{of production}} {{and the growth of}} output in the agricultural sector in Ireland, as in many other countries, have been associated with the adoption of many innovations which have contributed to a very significant decline in labour inputs and its replacement by mechanisation. In farming the process of mechanisation can be understood as the adoption of production methods in which human labour and draught animals are replaced to a high degree by technology which can result in greater productivity of both agricultural labour and land. It is part of a wider range of processes which result in a significant level of structural adjustment in the organisation of the total economy. Mechanisation facilitates this adjustment and enables the fewer remaining farmers to achieve higher income levels and an improved standard of living. However, farmers vary in their ability to respond to the requirements of this process {{for a variety of reasons}} including economic constraints, demographic factors and in some instances <b>locational</b> <b>disadvantages.</b> The differential impacts of these factors between fanners introduces significant temporal and spatial dimensions into the adoption and diffusion of mechanisation.

Due to this, there have been efforts to advance human understanding of social sources of vulnerability to these disasters in an attempt to reduce the high social and material costs. This study therefore explored social sources of vulnerability to natural disaster with focus on floods in informal settlements of Lagos. Lagos represents one of the cities with the fastest growing urban agglomerations in the world. About half of its population lives in informal settlements thereby exacerbating a high degree of vulnerability especially among slum dwellers. This study is based on a comprehensive household survey and key informants interviews as well as on focus group discussions. It documents the scale and frequency of flooding in informal settlements and the impacts as well as the household and community coping and adaptation mechanisms. It also explores the institutional responses and adaptations measures against the prevailing flood situation. The study also examines how factors such as lack of infrastructure, poor socio-economic and <b>locational</b> <b>disadvantages</b> contributes to the vulnerability of slum dwellers to floods. The coping and adaptation mechanisms employed in this study depended upon the diversity and accessibility of the available options, economic affordability of the households and level of social networking. From this study, social capital plays a leading role in galvanizing mutual help among neighbours and different networks. Based on the exposures and management capacities identified in this study, recommendations were also made on how to enhance capacities to reduce flood vulnerability in Lagos informal settlements. ...|$|R

Today, risk pertaining to inadequate wastewater disposal and sanitation facilities {{is one of the}} major threats faced by city dwellers. Delhi, with around 15 million populations generates more than 3, 987 million liters of wastewater per day, out of which only 47 % gets treated, using about 63 % of the total treatment capacity. About 50 % of its population lives in informal settlements with precarious sewerage and sanitation provisions grappling with numerous water and wastewater related problems. In this respect certain types and degrees of vulnerability exist, particularly among the marginalized population of the informal settlement quarters. The internal and external conditions and processes responsible for increasing defenselessness develop dynamically and need to be understood from various perspectives. This study is based on comprehensive household survey and attempts to analyse wastewater problems and related social vulnerability in different residential colonies of both formal and informal settings. It further explores the community and institutional coping responses and adaptations measures against the prevailing wastewater situation in Delhi. Inadequate wastewater management, <b>locational</b> <b>disadvantages</b> and poor socio-economic conditions finally manifest into environmental and health implications. Vulnerability is higher in informal settlements which remains invisible or only mildly perceived until it strikes as a major (disease) outbreak. People�s perception also plays an important role in understanding social vulnerability. The manner in which an individual or social group perceives existing problem influences the extent of their exposure and moulds their response towards it. Social groups take to various adaptation and coping mechanisms to deal with the wastewater problems depending upon the perception, available options and their management capabilities. The findings of the present study, which are based on empirical field work, support the theoretical hypothesis that social vulnerability is the defenselessness of certain individual/households/social groups against various stresses which impact them through harmful implications of multiple types. The degree of social vulnerability is determined by the relation between their exposure to wastewater problems, related stresses and their coping capabilities...|$|R

However, the Regulations impose strict procedural and evidentiary requirements for making a family violence claim. These laws disproportionately impact those in RRR communities by failing to account for their isolation, lack of access to services and particular vulnerabilities. As a result, immigrant women in RRR communities are restricted in their ability to access the family violence exception. This article calls for reform of the Regulations to address the <b>locational</b> <b>disadvantages</b> faced by immigrant women in RRR communities. Building on the work of the Australian Law Reform Commission, it argues for the repeal of the provisions governing evidentiary requirements for ‘non-judicially determined’ claims of family violence. In its place, it is suggested {{that there should be no}} restrictions on the types of evidence that can be provided. In addition, all non-judicially determined family violence claims would be referred to an ‘independent expert panel’ for assessment. The independent expert panel should include, at a minimum, a number of community legal centres (CLCs) and family violence centres (FVCs) around Australia. CLCs and FVCs are leveraging technology — such as Skype and teleconferencing — and integrated service responses to provide access to justice to those in RRR communities...|$|R
40|$|In {{a healthy}} community, no-one would get stuck facing {{long-term}} disadvantage. We are all challenged by life’s ‘ups’ and ‘downs’, {{but for some}} people the ‘downs’ are much deeper and longer lasting. Early, intergenerational and <b>locational</b> <b>disadvantages</b> constrain opportunities and limit social mobility. This isn’t just bad luck for the people involved; we are all worse off when our social systems don’t protect vulnerable people. This is because the impacts of poverty and disadvantage do not just fall upon the individual; the gap between social groups has a major effect upon community health. Research has shown that more unequal societies have greater problems with health, mental illness, addictions, crime and other social issues. There is also a direct negative impact on local economic growth. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. Every year, the State Budget gives the Victorian Government an opportunity to address the most pressing problems in our communities and shape {{the future of the}} state. The Salvation Army’s 2017 - 18 Victorian State Budget Submission offers a vision of healthy communities where our most disadvantaged citizens get a fair go, allowing them to break out of cycles of disadvantage. Giving priority to those left furthest behind isn’t just {{the right thing to do}} for them; it’s the way we build a society that’s better for everyone. The submission is based on a series of consultations with Victorian Salvation Army services that highlighted three key groups of people who, without adequate supports, are likely to remain in entrenched disadvantage: 	Rough sleepers with complex needs; 	Young people leaving state care; and 	People exiting prison. When they need our help the most, the services available to these groups are too few and too inadequately resourced. It is here that the gaps in our social safety nets are widening; where we have failed to live up to our own standards that give everyone in our community a fair go. When we fail groups of people such as these, we are all worse off. Ignoring long-term social disadvantage creates higher costs in tertiary systems, such as hospitals and prisons. But attending to them proactively builds social cohesion and healthier communities for everyone...|$|R
