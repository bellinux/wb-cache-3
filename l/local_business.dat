40|$|Individual {{attitudes towards}} {{multinational}} enterprises (MNEs) remains relatively understudied compared to individual attitudes towards other dimensions of globalization, particularly trade and immigration. In order to illuminate individual attitudes towards MNEs, this paper utilizes a large cross-country dataset (2003 International Social Survey Program) to examine individual {{perspectives on the}} impact of MNEs on <b>local</b> <b>businesses.</b> The paper draws on literature that studies the economic impacts of MNEs on <b>local</b> <b>businesses,</b> such as the transfer of technology from foreign affiliates to <b>local</b> <b>businesses.</b> Based on this literature the paper tests hypotheses to analyze how individuals’ skill-level (reflected in their educational attainment and occupational group) and the sector in which they work affects their perceptions of MNEs’ impact on <b>local</b> <b>businesses.</b> Conforming to expectations from the literature, the paper finds that highly skilled individuals who are senior-level managers, legislators, and officials are less likely to think MNEs are damaging <b>local</b> <b>businesses.</b> Also, private sector employees are less likely than public sector employees to see MNEs’ impact on <b>local</b> <b>businesses</b> as negative. The paper also finds variation in these attitudes across developed countries, developing countries, and formerly communist states in Central and Eastern Europe. In order to explore non-economic determinants of individual attitudes towards MNEs, the paper additionally explores how feelings of nationalism, confidence in democracy, and attitudes towards international affairs affect individual perspectives on MNEs. The paper additionally shows that retired citizens’ previous sector of employment and occupation influences their perception of the MNEs’ impact on <b>local</b> <b>businesses</b> and that type of FDI (M&A versus Greenfield investment) influences individual attitudes towards the impact of MNEs on <b>local</b> <b>businesses.</b> ...|$|R

Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues. A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews. The Federal Trade Commission received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014, most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise. According to Yelp, the Federal Trade Commission finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company.|$|E
