40|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>Spike</b> Annealing (LSA), a non-melt {{thermal process}} in the sub-millisecond time regime, has {{demonstrated}} significant advantages for ultra-shallow junction formation at the 32 nm and later nodes. A comprehensive approach for modeling multiple physical processes during <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> annealing is presented in this work. A physics-based model for optical coupling of IR and visible laser sources is developed. This model incorporates complex interplay of temperature and wavelength dependent material properties on the optical absorption of laser radiation into the substrate. An efficient finite difference simulation framework for solving the heat transport is presented. Characteristic behavior of temperature profiles during <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> annealing in 2 D (infinite beam) and 3 D (finite sized beam) is illustrated. Cornell Laser Annealing Simulation Package (CLASP), the simulation framework developed and used in this work is documented with examples. The temperature profiles obtained from the 3 D simulations were validated using experimental measurements. Thin film platinum resistors were used to directly measure temperature profiles during <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> annealing (LSA) with high spatial and temporal resolution. Observed resistance changes were calibrated to absolute temperatures using the melting points of the substrate silicon and thin gold films. Both the time-dependent temperature experienced by the sample during passage of the focused laser beam, and profiles across the spatially dependent laser intensity, were obtained with sub-millisecond time resolution and 50 micron spatial resolution. Full 3 D simulations incorporating both optical and thermal variations of material parameters were compared with these results. Accounting properly for the specific material parameters, good agreement between experiments and simulations were achieved. The undesirable effect of the high temperatures thermal stresses and dopant diffusion were studied in this work {{with the aim of}} mitigating their effects. Calibrated temperature profiles were used as inputs to in Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations to calculate thermal stresses during <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> annealing. The effect of anisotropic material properties on thermal stress was discussed, and the optimal crystallographic orientations for <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> annealing were identified. Haasens law, a macroscopic yield stress condition, was used to predict upper limits on thermal stress. It was found that a phenomenological model based on isothermal experimental observations is not valid in the dynamic temperature fields during <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> annealing. A mesoscopic dislocation dynamics based model was thus developed to model yield point in the context of <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> annealing. This model was used to predict the optimal temperature range of operation. Continuum models for studying dopant diffusion are no longer sufficient in the spatio-temporal scales in <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> annealing, and the effect of noise and variability inherent in diffusion needs to be captured. An accelerated stochastic simulation method was developed for studying the effect of noise in dopant diffusion and dynamics in particular and reaction diffusion systems in general. This accelerated method was compared to others presented in literature and its strengths were highlighted...|$|E

40|$|Shock {{ignition}} is a laser direct-drive {{inertial confinement}} fusion (ICF) scheme {{in which the}} stages of compression and hot spot formation are partly separated. The fuel is first imploded at a lower velocity than in conventional ICF, reducing the threats due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI). Close to stagnation, an intense <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> drives a strong converging shock, which contributes to hot spot formation. This paper starts with {{a brief overview of}} theoretical studies, target design and experimental results on shock ignition. The second part of the paper illustrates original work aiming at the design of robust targets and computation of the relevant gain curves. Following Chang et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 135002 (2010) ] a safety factor for high gain, IFT* (analogous to the ignition threshold factor ITF [Clark et al., Phys. Plasmas 15, 056305 (2008) ]), is evaluated by means of parametric one-dimensional simulations with artificially reduced reactivity. SI designs scaled as in Atzeni et al. [New J. Phys. 15, 045004 (2013) ] are found to have nearly the same ITF*. For a given target, such ITF* increases with implosion velocity and <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> power. A gain curve with a prescribed ITF* can then be simply generated by upscaling a reference target with that value of ITF*. An interesting option is scaling in size by reducing the implosion velocity to keep the ratio of implosion velocity to self-ignition velocity constant. At given total laser energy, targets with higher ITF* are driven to higher implosion velocity and achieve somewhat lower gain. However, 1 D gain higher than 100 is achieved at (incident) energy below 1 MJ, implosion velocity below 300 km/s, and peak incident power below 400 TW. Two-dimensional simulations of mispositioned targets show that targets with higher ITF* indeed tolerate larger displacements...|$|E

Single energy depositions show that significant transient drag reductions are obtained, due to the interaction of the heated core, created by the energy release, with the bow shock. When the deposition is repeated, cumulative effects are important and quasi-steady or unsteady flow regimes are obtained, depending on the power and repetition frequency.

40|$|A {{new concept}} for {{inertial}} confinement fusion called fast-shock ignition (FSI) is introduced as a credible scheme {{in order to}} obtain high target gain. In the proposed model, the separation of fuel ignition into two successive steps, under the suitable conditions, reduces required ignitor energy for the fuel ignition. The main procedure in FSI concept is compressing the fuel up to stagnation. Then, two high intensity short pulse <b>laser</b> <b>spikes</b> with energy and power lower than those required for shock ignition (SI) and fast ignition (FI) with a proper delay time are launched at the fuel which increases the central hot-spot temperature and completes the ignition of the precompressed fuel. The introduced semi-analytical model indicates that with fast-shock ignition, the total required energy for compressing and igniting the fuel can be slightly reduced in comparison to pure shock ignition. Furthermore, for fuel mass greater than, the target energy gain increases up to 15 percent and the contribution of fast ignitor under the proper conditions could be decreased about 20 percent compared with pure fast ignition. The FSI scheme is beneficial from technological considerations for the construction of short pulse high power laser drivers. The general advantages of fast-shock ignition over pure shock ignition in terms of figure of merit can be more than 1. 3...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{adaptive}} method of controlling parametric instabilities in laser produced plasmas is proposed. It involves fast temporal modulation of a laser pulse on the fastest instability’s amplification time scale, adapting to changing and unknown plasma conditions. These pulses are comprised of {{on and off}} sequences having at least one or two orders of magnitude contrast between them. Such laser illumination profiles are called STUD pulses for Spike Trains of Uneven Duration and Delay. The STUD pulse program includes scrambling the speckle patterns spatially in between the <b>laser</b> <b>spikes.</b> The off times allow damping of driven waves. The scrambling of the hot spots allows tens of damping times to elapse before hot spot locations experience recurring high intensity spikes. Damping in the meantime will have healed the scars of past growth. Another unique feature of STUD pulses on crossing beams is that their temporal profiles can be interlaced or staggered, and their interactions thus controlled with an on-off switch and a dimmer. A method was conceived in April-May 2009 [1] to optimally control the unbridled growth of parametric instabilities in laser-produced plasmas. It {{was a response to}} the question: How could one keep parametric instabilities in the strictly linear regime, or any other well specified regime, for that matter? This led to the realization that the answer must lie in the manipulation of the laser pulse and not in the plasma properties which are hard to know and much harder to change.

Simulations were carried out to evaluate the lowest achievable OFF-state currents (I_OFF) for Ge double-gate FETs when using such an abrupt junction.

Efficient energy coupling requires to keep the critical surface sufficiently close to the ablation front and this goal can be achieved for high laser intensities provided that the laser wavelength is short enough. Scaling laws for the ablation pressure and the other relevant magnitudes of the ablation cloud are found in terms of the laser and target parameters.

40|$|Early stage phase {{segregation}} of block copolymers (BCPs) critically impacts the material’s final structural properties, {{and understanding the}} kinetics of these processes is essential to intentional design of systems for practical applications. Using sub-millisecond lateral gradient <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> annealing and microbeam grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering, the ordering and disordering kinetics of cylinder forming poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) were determined for peak annealing temperatures up to 550 °C for dwells (anneal durations) ranging from 250 μs to 10 ms. These temperatures, far {{in excess of the}} normal thermal decomposition limit, are enabled by the short time scales of laser annealing. From initially microphase-segregated films, disordering was observed near the equilibrium order–disorder transition temperature (TODT) for dwell times above 10 ms but was kinetically delayed by diffusion for shorter time scales, resulting in suppression of observed disordering by over 70 °C. The onset of ordering from initially disordered films was also kinetically limited for short dwells. For anneals with peak temperatures well above TODT, the block copolymer fully disorders and quenches to a history-independent final state determined by the quench rate. This kinetic behavior can be represented on an effective Tg and TODT phase map {{as a function of the}} heating time scale. These results then potentially enable BCP processing to retain or intentionally modify the initial state while accelerating kinetics for other chemical or structural alignment processes...|$|E
40|$|Scaling of {{semiconductor}} devices has also driven {{a need for}} the improvement of interconnects. As feature sizes became smaller, the parasitic capacitance increased between wires resulting in unacceptable interconnection delay. To mitigate this problem, low dielectric constant materials ("low k" materials) were introduced to replace the silicon dioxide, whose k value around 4 is well outside the target value of k = 2. 0. While the incorporation of organic groups and, especially, the presence of pores in an Si-O framework material decreases the dielectric constant dramatically, it also leads to the loss of mechanical strength. Alternative processing technologies are required to improve mechanical properties of SiCOH-class materials, the current standard for low k materials, while maintaining dielectric properties. <b>Laser</b> <b>Spike</b> Annealing (LSA) is one alternative annealing process that may achieve this goal. This work explored the use of LSA to anneal porous low k ethyl-bridged organosilane films. This novel SiCOH-class material has the potential to meet targets with respect to lower dielectric constant and stronger mechanical properties. Use of LSA was explored to determine the behavior under several heating processes. The effects of LSA on this new low k film and a comparison of the results to those using other rapid annealing techniques were studied. In this thesis, we will discuss the structural and chemical evolution as a function of LSA and hotplate conditions. Second, we will link the dielectric and mechanical effects of LSA to those structural changes under a continuous temperature profile. Third, we will explore the effects of dwell time, initial structure and initial porosity on the LSA-generated results.

40|$|Microlithography and <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> {{annealing}} (LSA) are key {{techniques that}} have enabled continued dimension scaling of transistors {{used in the}} semiconductor industry. As minimum feature sizes reach sub- 20 nm scale in patterning, control of chemical reactions and their kinetics for a given lithographic material becomes critical for all thermally-activated processes. For example, current chemically amplified resist (CAR) systems require a post-exposure bake (PEB) where thermally-activated side-group cleavage reactions and acid-catalyst diffusion compete to control both pattern resolution and line edge definition. The use of LSA has been explored in this work as a potential PEB process, showing promise for multiple metrics of CAR system performance. This work explores the behavior of organic and small molecules under millisecond time frame laser-induced heating using far-infrared CO 2 laser ([lamda] = 10. 6 [MICRO SIGN]m) and nearinfrared laser diode ([lamda] = 980 nm) sources. To explore LSA heating of polymers, thin-film platinum resistors were fabricated and used to directly measure temperature profiles during LSA with high spatial and temporal resolution. Measured resistance changes were calibrated to absolute temperatures using melting points of silicon and thin-film gold dots. Effective substrate temperatures were obtained for dwell times ranging from 0. 25 to 10 ms under both CO 2 and diode laser irradiation. In addition, spatially dependent thermal profiles were obtained in sub-millisecond time frames at high spatial resolutions up to 20 [MICRO SIGN]m. LSA was used to heat thermally sensitive resist polymers at temperatures beyond their conventional limits in millisecond time frames. Due to the five orders of magnitude decrease in time from conventional heating duration, these organic systems extended their thermal stabilities by up to 800 ? C. Lithographic patterning using LSA as a PEB was explored under both deep UV (DUV) and extreme UV (EUV) exposures. Compared to conventional hot-plate PEB, high resolution (up to 50 nm lines/spaces) patterns were achieved at up to 30 % lower UV exposure doses (sensitivity) by accelerating the reaction kinetics at higher temperatures. Under these same conditions, the pattern roughness was reduced 25 % by minimizing the heating duration. The chemical reaction kinetics and pathways of a model resist system with a methyl adamantyl side-group were extensively studied over five orders of magnitude in heating duration, exhibiting non-Arrhenius behavior. The side-group cleavage kinetics were measured to follow first order at high temperatures associated with millisecond heating, while a more complex power law behavior was observed for seconds time frame heating near the polymer's glass transition. The responsible chemical change, affecting the active catalyst concentration during heating, was identified and mathematically modeled to explain the kinetic shift while providing fundamental understanding necessary for improving patterning performance. An alternative use of the laser-induced heating was demonstrated for controlling the pattern roughness by hardbaking fully developed resist profiles at peak temperatures between 295 - 450 ? C for 500 [MICRO SIGN]s. Due to polymer flow above the glass transition temperature, surface and edge smoothing up to 30 % with a < 1 nm change in pattern dimension was observed. <b>Laser</b> <b>spike</b> annealing was also used to investigate the nucleation and growth kinetics of amorphous silicon (a-Si) at temperatures above 850 ? C for sub-millisecond time frames. An explosive crystallization of a-Si was observed containing a mix of fine-grained and large-grained polycrystalline phases, along with Si propagation in its liquid state to create a feather-like threads spanning over 100 [MICRO SIGN]m orthogonal to the scan direction. Results from this work highlight the utility of laser heating technique to characterize reaction kinetics {{over a wide range}} of temperature and time, while identifying key kinetic changes and the underlying mechanisms to gain fundamental understanding. Combined with existing methods to characterize material properties, LSA is a powerful technique for investigating reaction kinetics at high temperatures on millisecond time frames, not only for conventional semiconductor materials such as Si but also for thermally sensitive organic systems. 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} 50 years, the {{electronics}} industry has profited from {{their ability to}} follow Moore’s Law, doubling {{the performance of the}} computer chip approximately every two years. Traditionally, these improvements came from reducing the size of the logic switches, or transistors, so that more could fit in a given sized computer chip. However, the electronics industry has hit a roadblock where merely shrinking components no longer improves the performance. To overcome this hurdle, manufacturers are beginning to implement non-traditional device structures and materials into computer chips. Compound semiconductors are strong candidates for materials to replace silicon based on their improved speed and efficiency with, importantly, lower power requirements. III-V materials, like InGaAs and InAs, are promising candidates to replace silicon in areas in the transistor that require high conductivity semiconductors. Low-power device architectures can be realized with GaN and other III-N materials. Although charge-carrying electrons can move much faster in these materials, a fundamental issue is getting enough free electrons into the materials through a process called doping, hence limiting the conductivity that can be achieved. This is the problem that my work addresses [...] studying how fast thermal processing could improve the electrical properties of doped III-V and III-N materials. Using sub-millisecond to millisecond <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> annealing (LSA), we can transiently reach high annealing temperatures, and, in this way, improve conductivity by achieving high active concentrations of dopants in these materials. We have broadly characterized LSA for III-V and III-N materials with a high-throughput, combinatorial processing method. With this method, we explored kinetically limited states that are inaccessible using typical heating approaches like furnace and rapid thermal annealing (RTA). We found that LSA increased the activation of high-dose implanted dopants in InGaAs to a peak concentration beyond a previously established thermodynamic limit, improving dopant activation by a highly significant 29 %. In contrast to longer timescale anneals (like those from furnace anneals or RTA), no deactivation is observed during LSA processing for InGaAs samples with dopants grown in to active positions. Our latest LSA studies of implanted GaN resulted in achieving nearly 100 % activation of dopants. In these millisecond time frames, LSA is effective for ion-implantation dopant activation and for retention of metastable as-grown dopant concentrations. Our work shows that this kind of metastable processing will be critical to future device applications that use III-V and III-N materials. 2019 - 06 - 0...|$|E

In this work, we seek to improve the electrical performance using controlled deposition and annealing techniques, and to understand the mechanisms for observed mobility improvements. We demonstrate a dual layer IGZO TFTs that addresses both stability and performance issues when compared to single layer structures. Devices consisted of a 310 oC deposited CAAC 20 nm thick channel layer capped by a second, 30 nm thick, 260 oC deposited amorphous IGZO layer. The TFT exhibits a saturation field-effect mobility of ~ 20 cm 2 /Vs; exceeding by > 30 % the mobility of 50 nm thick single layer reference TFTs fabricated with either a-IGZO or CAAC IGZO. The deposition temperature of the amorphous layer influences the mobility of the underlying CAAC transport layer. Deposited at room temperature (RT), the mobility in the 310 oC deposited CAAC layer is initially low (6. 7 cm 2 /Vs), but rises continuously with time over 58 days to 20. 5 cm 2 /Vs, comparable to the value observed when the amorphous layer was deposited at 260 oC. The {{findings are consistent with}} a hypothesis that the top amorphous layer has a higher solubility for impurities and/or structural defects than the underlying nanocrystalline iii transport layer and that these defects can equilibrate even at room temperature. The rate of equilibration is consistent with the known diffusivity of hydrogen. We demonstrate properties of IGZO TFTs fabricated using <b>laser</b> <b>spike</b> annealing (LSA) with a scanned continuous wave CO 2 laser. For peak annealing temperatures near 430 oC and a 1 ms dwell, TFTs exhibit saturation field-effect mobilities above 70 cm 2 /Vs with Von near - 3 V. This value is over 4 times higher than furnace-annealed control samples (~ 16 cm 2 /Vs). This behavior is not due to large-scale structural change of the IGZO, as X-ray data shows no change for LSA anneals up to 800 oC for 1 - 2 ms. However, the mobility of those devices decay from ~ 50 to ~ 10 cm 2 /Vs in 10 and 3 days when storing at room temperature and 50 oC, respectively. The activation energy of mobility decay constant is estimated to be ~ 0. 6 eV, which is consistent with the activation energy of hydrogen diffusion in a-IGZO. A model linking hydrogen donors which migrate to passivate and deactivate trap states associated with oxygen vacancies after the optimized LSA anneal is proposed to explain the high mobility. This mobility is also shown to be comparable to the estimated trap-free mobility in oxide semiconductors and suggests that shallow traps can be deactivated by transient thermal annealing under optimized conditions. The observed 75 cm 2 /Vs is also now a new lower limit to the trap-free mobility of IGZO. The processing enhancement may provide a path to achieve even higher performance in this promising thin-film low temperature semiconductor. i...|$|E

A further crash programme {{in support of the}} sudden military action saw multiple GR1s outfitted with the TIALD laser designation system; author Claus-Christian Szejnmann declared that the TIALD pod enabled the GR1 to [...] "achieve probably the most accurate bombing in the RAF's history". Although laser designation proved effective in the Gulf War, only 23 TIALD pods were purchased by 2000; shortages hindered combat operations over Kosovo.|$|R
40|$|Apraclonidine and {{pilocarpine}} {{have been}} shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of intraocular pressure (IOP) <b>spikes</b> following argon <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty. An additional reduction in the incidence of acute pressure rise might theoretically be expected by combining these two effective agents. In a prospective randomised study we compared the ability of apraclonidine and pilocarpine alone and in combination to prevent post <b>laser</b> pressure <b>spikes.</b> Patients receiving regular pilocarpine to either eye were excluded. Seventy five eyes received either apraclonidine (26 eyes), pilocarpine (23 eyes), or both drugs (26 eyes). Apraclonidine 1 % was instilled 1 hour before and immediately after, and pilocarpine 4 % immediately after trabeculoplasty. IOP was measured before and at 1, 2, and 3 hours following trabeculoplasty. In only two (8 %) eyes receiving combined treatment was a pressure rise observed. This frequency was significantly lower than that seen in eyes treated with apraclonidine alone (38 %), or pilocarpine alone (39 %). The mean fall in IOP at 1, 2, and 3 hours was significantly greater in those eyes receiving combined treatment than in the other two groups...|$|R
