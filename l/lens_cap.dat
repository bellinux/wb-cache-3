25|$|Congolese {{biologist}} Marcellin Agnagna led the 1983 expedition of Congolese to Lake Tele. According {{to his own}} account, Agnagna {{claimed to}} have seen a Mokèlé-mbèmbé at close distance for about 20 minutes. He tried to film it, but said that in his excitement, he forgot to remove the motion picture camera's <b>lens</b> <b>cap.</b> In a 1984 interview, Agnagna claimed, contradictorily, that the film was ruined {{not because of the}} <b>lens</b> <b>cap,</b> but because he had the Super 8 camera on the wrong setting: macro instead of telephoto.|$|E
25|$|Riis and his photographers {{were among}} the first Americans to use flash photography. Pistol lamps were {{dangerous}} and looked threatening, and would soon be replaced by another method for which Riis lit magnesium powder on a frying pan. The process involved removing the <b>lens</b> <b>cap,</b> igniting the flash powder and replacing the lens cap; the time taken to ignite the flash powder sometimes allowed a visible image blurring created by the flash.|$|E

5000|$|The non-USM {{versions}} are generally considered very low grade consumer lenses with the USM versions only slightly superior in build quality and 'feel'. None of the versions (USM or not) support full-time manual (FTM) focusing. The optics {{are similar in}} the IS USM and USM versions. Except for the USM III, the USM feature is signified by the gold [...] "Ultrasonic Motor" [...] text. The USM III is identified by a gold USM Logo and an adjacent gold marking of [...] "Ultrasonic". The original USM <b>lens</b> <b>caps</b> also says [...] "Ultrasonic" [...] although caution is advised as <b>lens</b> <b>caps</b> are often swapped {{and should not be}} counted upon as indicative of the actual lens' features. Ultrasonic lenses will have in small gold font [...] "Ultrasonic" [...] and a series of hashed lines applied completely around the lens at the forward end.|$|R

50|$|The M145 Machine Gun Optic is {{a variant}} of the C79 that was {{developed}} for the U.S. Army and is commonly mounted on M240 and M249 machine guns. The M145 is unusual when compared with other optical sights in use with the United States military in that ballistic compensation is in the mount, rather than in the reticle. The reticle is illuminated by a battery-powered LED with varying intensity settings. The mount fits directly to any MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail or receiver. Zero is retained despite repeated removal and re-attachment to the weapon. The M145 is extremely resistant to shock and water immersion and has an anti-reflection device and rubber <b>lens</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bagley {{brought his}} {{recently}} invented tri-lens camera to France, {{where it was}} used to make one vertical and two oblique images from airplanes. These images were used to overprint enemy trenches and gun emplacements over existing maps for precision targeting. An example of this camera is held at the Smithsonian Institution: [...] "This object is on display in the Boeing Aviation Hangar at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA. Fairchild Aerial Camera Corporation built the production model of the T 2 and T-2A four-lens camera, which improved upon the T-1 tri-lens mapping camera developed by Maj. James Bagley of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The T-2A had one vertical lens and three oblique lenses set at 35 degrees, which provided a 120-degree field of view at right angles to the direction of flight.

5000|$|Geophotography today takes {{numerous}} forms. At {{the most}} basic level, it can be accomplished using a film or digital Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) or [...] "point-and-shoot" [...] (compact) camera in the field or in the laboratory. In the field, special consideration is given to natural lighting of the object or feature being photographed. Scale is especially important in geophotography, and meter sticks, rock hammers, people, <b>lens</b> <b>caps,</b> coins, or other objects that are carried on-hand, are often placed in the frame to indicate {{the size of the}} feature being photographed. Images are generally cataloged automatically or manually with location information and grid reference (or latitude and longitude) data. These types of photographs are consistently used as visual aids in papers, field trip guides, reports, reviews, and posters. However, they are increasingly finding use as trackers of small-scale morphologic change, wherein photographs are repeatedly taken of particular features or places over time to show how the features or places are changing on a diurnal to annual time scale.|$|R

30|$|The area is {{underlain}} by Upper Precambrian {{sedimentary rocks}} {{known as the}} southeast Taoudeni sedimentary formations shared by Mali and Burkina Faso. These formations are essentially made of an alternation of pink siltstones and argillites with glauconite and dolomitic limestone <b>lenses</b> <b>capped</b> with silexite (Ouédraogo 1998). As in the crystalline basement areas that make up 80 % of Burkina Faso, two types of discontinuous aquifers are encountered in the study area. A shallow (5 – 20  m) aquifer located in the weathered lateritic layer, which is superimposed on a deep aquifer within the joined sandstone layers in the sedimentary sequence (CIEH 1976; BILAN D’EAU 1993). The thickness of the deep aquifer is poorly known, and it varies according to the lithology. In contrast to crystalline basement aquifers, the high permeability (1.8 [*]×[*] 106  m/s) of sedimentary rocks makes the southeast Taoudeni sedimentary formations excellent aquifers, with an estimated storage coefficient of 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 4 and significant yields up to 100  m 3 /h (Gombert 1998). That is, the only two permanent watercourses in the country (i.e., the Mouhoun and Comoé rivers) are directly fed by springs originated from sedimentary aquifers (Talbaoui 2009).|$|R
5000|$|The Venera 9 to 12 probes {{were of a}} {{different}} design. They weighed approximately five tons and were launched by the powerful Proton booster. They included a transfer and relay bus that had engines to brake into Venus orbit (Venera 9 and 10, 15 and 16) and to serve as receiver and relay for the entry probe's transmissions. The entry probe {{was attached to the}} top of the bus in a spherical heat shield. The probes were optimized for surface operations with an unusual looking design that included a spherical compartment to protect the electronics from atmospheric pressure and heat for as long as possible. Beneath this was a shock absorbing [...] "crush ring" [...] for landing. Above the pressure sphere was a cylindrical antenna structure and a wide dish shaped structure that resembled an antenna but was actually an aerobrake. They were designed to operate on the surface for a minimum of 30 minutes. Instruments varied on different missions, but included cameras and atmospheric and soil analysis equipment. All four landers had problems with some or all of their camera <b>lens</b> <b>caps</b> not releasing.|$|R
5000|$|The United States {{played an}} {{important}} role in the last months of the war, using French aircraft and modified cameras. Some techniques and equipment used in civilian surveying and mapping were developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers when the topographic engineer, James W. Bagley, transferred from the US Geological Survey to the army. Major Bagley brought his recently invented tri-lens camera to France, where it was used to make one vertical and two oblique images from airplanes. These images were used to overprint enemy trenches and gun emplacements over existing maps for precision targeting.

50|$|The two descent craft landed about 950 km apart, {{just east}} of the eastern {{extension}} of an elevated region known as Phoebe Regio. The Venera 13 lander survived for 127 minutes, and the Venera 14 lander for 57 minutes, where the planned design life was only 32 minutes. The Venera 14 craft had the misfortune of ejecting the camera <b>lens</b> <b>cap</b> directly under the surface compressibility tester arm, and returned information for the compressibility of the <b>lens</b> <b>cap</b> rather than the surface. The descent vehicles transmitted data to the buses, which acted as data relays as they flew by Venus.|$|E
50|$|The European camera of {{the year}} version(1983) had a small round brass plate on the front lefthand side of the body. This all came with a <b>lens</b> <b>cap</b> and strap with the European camera {{of the year}} insignia.|$|E
50|$|The hood of {{the lens}} is fixed and the front element {{protrudes}} extensively, forcing the <b>lens</b> <b>cap</b> to take an unconventional shape, covering the entire hood. This also does not allow the placing of a filter in the front.|$|E
50|$|The {{plate was}} then {{carried to the}} camera in a {{light-tight}} plate holder. Withdrawing a protective dark slide or opening a pair of doors in the holder exposed the sensitized surface within the dark camera and removing a cap from the camera lens began the exposure, creating an invisible latent image on the plate. Depending on the sensitization chemistry used, {{the brightness of the}} lighting, and the light-concentrating power of the lens, the required exposure time ranged from a few seconds to many minutes. After the exposure was judged to be complete, the <b>lens</b> was <b>capped</b> and the holder was again made light-tight and removed from the camera.|$|R
40|$|After the {{demonstration}} that no Châtelperronian/Aurignacian interstratifications existed at Roc-de-Combe, Le Piage, and El Pendo, the Grotte des Fées remained the single instance conceivably documenting the putative long-term regional contemporaneity {{of the two}} technocomplexes which is required by the “acculturation ” and “imita-tion ” models of the innovations (ornaments, decorated bone tools) that characterize the Châtelperronian. Based on our own inspection and study of the lithic and faunal collections and of the site itself, on consideration of the published and unpublished literature, and on the available dating evidence, we show that the putative interstrati-fied deposits reported by Henri Delporte, who last excavated at the Grotte des Fées in 1951 – 54 and 1962, are in fact 19 th-century backfill. In situ remnants may {{have been found in}} 1962, but, in the part of the site excavated at that time, Delporte failed to recognize the previously described interstratification. The stratigraphic consistency of 10 (out of the 13) radiocarbon dates available relates to the fact that those 10 dates are on samples from the conceivably in situ remnants excavated in 1962. Three samples from Level B 5 date the Châtelperronian occupation to ca 39 – 40, 000 14 C BP, while seven samples from Level B 1 – 3 relate to carnivore denning at the site throughout the ca 36, 500 – 34, 500 14 C BP interval. �ubsequent sporadic incursions by bearers of an Aurignacian � � tool-kit are documented by diagnostic material scattered from top to bottom of the backfill deposits excavated by Delporte between 1951 and 1954. Originally, that Aurignacian material must have been contained in a surficial occupation <b>lens</b> <b>capping</b> the site’s Mousterian-to-Châtelperronian stratigraphic succession...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this effort}} is to {{demonstrate}} telerobotic inspection and mainpulation of space shuttle payloads {{in the presence of}} substantial communications time delays between the operator station and the robotic work space. The processing of space shuttle payloads provides a variety of tasks which are typical of both space shuttle ground operations and Space Station in-flight operations, and communications time delays are inevitable in space operations where the operator station will be light-seconds away from the telerobot. With this demonstration we hope to show the efficacy and safety of robotic technology for ground and space operations. Our approach is to develop an experimental telerobotic system with the remote sensing, actuation and reflex portions located at KSC in Florida, while the operator control station will be located at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. The JPL portion of the system includes a high-level operator interface, intelligent spatial planning and machine vision, while the KSC portion includes the robot arm, end effectors, cameras and proximity sensors, and the necessary control and communications computers and software. The communications between JPL and KSC are over a limited-bandwidth network channel (19200 baud) with unpredictable and unrepeatable time delays. In FY 89 we integrated a basic version of the robotic, communications, and computer hardware, and we developed the software to perform an operator-supervised inspection of a PAM-D satellite upper stage rocket motor and its shuttle support cradle. The demonstration, though severely limited by the bulk of the available computer arm, showed the potential of telerobotics for inspection tasks. In the future, we plan to develop additional capabilities which will allow manipulation tasks to be performed, including removal of dust covers and <b>lens</b> <b>caps,</b> insertion of connectors and batteries, and installation of payload objects...|$|R
