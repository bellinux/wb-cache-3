40|$|Health effects {{associated}} with the Great Lakes environment were assessed in adult herring gulls (Larus argentatus) in the early 1990 s, including the size and quality of their bones. Femurs were excised from 140 individuals from 10 colonies distributed throughout the Great Lakes and 2 reference colonies in Lake Winnipeg (freshwater) and the Bay of Fundy (marine). Femurs of gulls from the Great Lakes differed from the freshwater or marine reference for 9 of 12 variables of size, composition, and strength assessed using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and biomechanical testing. Femurs of Great Lakes gulls were significantly smaller in length (- 2. 9 %), periosteal circumference (- 2. 4 %), and cross-sectional area (- 5. 4 %) than freshwater reference birds. Femurs of the Great Lakes gulls had a lower significant cortical bone mineral content (- 8. 1 %) and density (- 2 %) than the marine reference. A {{significant increase in the}} amount the bone could bend before it broke (+ 34 %) and the energy required to break it (+ 44 %) and a significant decrease (- 16. 3 %) in stiffness during three-point biomechanical bending test were also detected in Great Lakes versus the freshwater gulls. These differences are indicative of impaired mineralization. When divided into high and low 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxicity equivalent (TCDD-TEQ) colonies, the amount the bone could bend before it broke and the energy required to break it were significantly higher in the high TEQ colonies, but not high polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) colonies.

Omega- 3 fatty acids (FAs) found mainly in fish, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut and seafood including algae and krill, some plants, and nut oils. It has been drawn the attention in the scientific community due to their capability to affect several processes in the body such as neurological, cardiovascular, and immune functions, and cancer. The American Heart Association recommends eating fish (particularly fatty fish such as mackerel, <b>lake</b> trout, <b>herring,</b> sardines, albacore tuna, and salmon) at least 2 times a week. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends 8 oz. of a variety of seafood per week providing an average daily consumption of 250 mg EPA+DHA. Omega- 3 fatty acids are highly concentrated in the brain and appear to be important for cognitive (brain memory and performance) and behavioral function.

40|$|A toxicokinetic {{model was}} {{developed}} to describe polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) accumulation by herring gull (Larus argentatus) embryos during development. The model consists of two components, a bioenergetics model that predicts the lipid mass balance of embryo and yolk compartments with time and an empirical toxicokinetic model that describes PCB partitioning between lipid compartments in the egg. The model was calibrated using data on PCB and lipid partitioning between embryo and yolk + albumen at four time points during incubation in herring gull eggs injected with a PCB mixture, combined with data sets on herring gull embryo growth rates and bioenergetic demands with time. The model was validated using independent data consisting of maternally exposed, field-incubated <b>Lake</b> Superior <b>herring</b> gull eggs that varied in incubation ages over the range of 8. 5 d to pipping age (26 - 28 days). PCB concentrations in 6 - 9 d embryos were nearly {{an order of magnitude}} less than predicted by equilibrium lipid partitioning between the embryo and yolk+albumen compartments of the eggs. PCB concentrations in embryos were adequately predicted by equilibrium partitioning, however, for eggs incubated for 23 - 28 d. An empirical relationship {{was developed to}} account for the apparent non-equilibrium behaviour of PCBs during early development. The model was sensitive to the mass of yolk lipids and the mass of PCBs deposited to fresh eggs and much of the variability in embryo PCB concentrations could by explained by accounting for variability in these input parameters. Consistent with experimental data for other avian species, the model predicts that the highest PCB concentrations in the embryo/chick occur during pipping or soon after when yolk lipids have been completely resorbed by the embryo...|$|R

5000|$|The {{specific}} epithet of the bloater {{is given}} after Dr. P. R. Hoy of Racine, Wisconsin. Dr. Hoy collected the first specimens {{of this species}} in 1870 while dredging in Lake Michigan at least 16 mi off Racine, at depths of 50 to 70 fathoms (90-130 m). Hoy did not describe the fish himself, but had ichthyologist James W. Milner name the species. Milner placed it in the genus Argyrosomus, now considered a junior synonym of Coregonus, the genus in which the bloater is now placed. The generic name Coregonus, given by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturæ, is derived from Greek and means [...] "angled eye", referring to the tilted pupil of whitefishes. It {{is closely related to}} the cisco or <b>lake</b> <b>herring,</b> Coregonus artedi, and the shortjaw cisco, both of which it is known to hybridise with. The common name of the bloater comes from the swollen appearance it has after being brought up from the deep waters it inhabits. The same name is given to certain type of smoked herring in Britain, which is swelled in its preparation. The bloater is one of the several taxa in the Coregonus artedi complex of freshwater whitefishes, which sometimes all are considered to belong to a single species.|$|E
50|$|Sea {{lampreys}} {{are considered}} a pest in the Great Lakes region. The species is native to the inland Finger Lakes and Lake Champlain in New York and Vermont. Whether it is native to Lake Ontario, where it was first noticed in the 1830s, {{or whether it was}} introduced through the Erie Canal which opened in 1825 is not clear. Improvements to the Welland Canal in 1919 are thought to have allowed its spread from Lake Ontario to Lake Erie, and while it was never abundant in either lake, it soon spread to Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior, where it decimated indigenous fish populations in the 1930s and 1940s. They have created a problem with their aggressive parasitism on key predator species and game fish, such as lake trout, lake whitefish, chub, and <b>lake</b> <b>herring.</b> Elimination of these predators allowed the alewife, another invasive species, to explode in population, having adverse effects on many native fish species. The lake trout plays a vital role in the Lake Superior ecosystem. The lake trout is considered an apex predator, which means that it has no predators. The sea lamprey is an aggressive predator by nature, which gives it a competitive advantage in a lake system where it has no predators and its prey lacks defenses against it. The sea lamprey played a large role in the destruction of the Lake Superior lake trout population. Lamprey introduction along with poor, unsustainable fishing practices caused the lake trout populations to decline drastically. The relationship between predators and prey in the Great Lakes' ecosystem then became unbalanced.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{assessed}} abundance, size, {{and species}} composition of forage fish and zooplankton communities of western Lake Superior during August 1996 and July 1997. Data were analyzed for three ecoregions (Duluth-Superior, Apostle Islands, {{and the open}} lake) differing in bathymetry and limnologi-cal and biological patterns. Zooplankton abundance was three times higher in the Duluth-Superior and Apostle Islands regions than in the open lake due to {{the large numbers of}} rotifers. Copepods were far more abundant than Cladocera in all ecoregions. Mean zooplankton size was larger in the open lake due to dominance by large calanoid copepods although size of individual taxa was similar among ecoregions. Forage fish abundance and biomass was highest in the Apostle Islands region and lowest in the open lake ecoregion. <b>Lake</b> <b>herring</b> (Coregonus artedi), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and deepwater ciscoes (Coregonus spp.) comprised over 90 % of the abundance and biomass of fishes caught in midwater trawls and recorded with hydroacoustics.

40|$|Conventional surplus {{production}} models indicate that {{destruction of fish}} populations by overfishing is difficult, if not impossible, but catastrophic declines in abundance of exploited populations are common.

40|$|The exotic {{sea lamprey}} (Petromyzon marinus) contributed greatly to collapses of fish {{populations in the}} Laurentian Great Lakes in the mid 1900 s (Christie 1974). Despite {{stringent}} population control actions in the 1950 s and 1960 s, sea lamprey persist and continue to affect populations of host fishes. The relative importance of different host species to sea lamprey production is unknown. Therefore, we used stable isotope analysis to ask whether sea lamprey in Lake Superior derive most of their production from lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), as is often assumed, or from alternative hosts. The stable isotope ratio of nitrogen (δ 15 N) in a consumer’s tissues indicates its trophic level, whereas carbon (δ 13 C) indicates its base of production (Harvey et al., 2002). We collected transforming, parasitic, and spawning Lake Superior sea lamprey. Transformers and parasites came from eastern U. S. waters. Spawners as well as four potential hosts (<b>lake</b> <b>herring,</b> Coregonus artedii; bloater, C. hoyi; lean lake trout; siscowet lake trout) were captured throughout U. S. waters. We measured 63 δ 15 N and δ 13 C in sea lamprey muscle and host blood. We then compared empirical δ 15 N of sea lamprey in eastern Lake Superior to values predicted by a model, developed by Harvey et al.
