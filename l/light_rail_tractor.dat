Members of the shunting staff based at Lyttelton were trained in its use by the locomotive staff, with maintenance carried out by the traffic staff. The tractor was stored in the steam locomotive shed and was used, for the purposes of evaluation, for as much of the shunting work as possible {{to reduce the amount of}} time the steam locomotives were required for the work. Later, diesel locomotives began to make their presence felt at Lyttelton, and in 1969 four Hitachi <b>rail</b> <b>tractors</b> were assigned there.

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Economics) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. Sacramento Regional Transit {{has many}} {{plans to expand}} its <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> system. Understanding where the <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> is valued {{and where it is}} not valued should be {{beneficial}} in guiding future expansions. For this research, hedonic price models estimate how Sacramento County residents value their <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> system, how values for <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> may differ along the Blue and Gold lines, and how socio-economic and urban physical characteristics influence value for <b>light</b> <b>rail,</b> by measuring how rail proximity affects home values. Overall, immediate <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> proximity contributes to lower home-values in Sacramento that become negligible with greater separation. Furthermore, <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> proximity contributes to higher home-values along the Gold Line and lower values along the Blue Line. Some socio-economic and urban physical characteristics affect how residents value <b>rail</b> proximity. Overall, <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> is not a highly valued amenity in Sacramento, though some areas value it more than others do. Economic...|$|R
