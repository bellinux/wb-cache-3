5|$|Columbia {{scientists}} have been credited with about 175 new inventions in the health sciences each year. More than 30 pharmaceutical products based on discoveries and inventions made at Columbia are on the market today. These include Remicade (for arthritis), Reopro (for blood clot complications), Xalatan (for glaucoma), Benefix, <b>Latanoprost</b> (a glaucoma treatment), shoulder prosthesis, homocysteine (testing for cardiovascular disease), and Zolinza (for cancer therapy). Columbia Technology Ventures (formerly Science and Technology Ventures), , manages some 600 patents and more than 250 active license agreements. Patent-related deals earned Columbia more than $230million in the 2006 fiscal year, according to the university, more than any university in the world. Columbia owns many unique research facilities, such as the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information dedicated to telecommunications and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is an astronomical observatory affiliated with NASA.|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandin analogs, such as <b>latanoprost,</b> bimatoprost and travoprost, {{increase}} uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor. Bimatoprost {{also increases}} trabecular outflow.|$|E
50|$|<b>Latanoprost</b> {{exhibits}} thermal {{and solar}} instability. The concentration of <b>latanoprost</b> stored at 50 °C will decrease by 10% every 8.25 days. When stored at 70 °C the concentration will decrease by 10% every 1.32 days. Ultraviolet light, {{for example in}} sunlight, causes rapid degradation of <b>latanoprost.</b>|$|E
50|$|In animal studies, using {{four times}} the {{therapeutic}} concentration of the ophthalmic solution <b>Latanoprost,</b> {{the size of the}} palpebral fissure can be increased. The condition is reversible. <b>Latanoprost</b> is a prostaglandin F receptor agonist.|$|E
50|$|Resul invented <b>Latanoprost</b> {{along with}} Swedish chemist Johan W. Stjernschantz. <b>Latanoprost</b> is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} glaucoma, {{as the head of}} the Medicinal Chemistry Department of Pharmacia Ophthalmics, a pharmaceuticals firm in Sweden.|$|E
50|$|Interactions {{are similar}} to other {{prostaglandin}} analogs. Paradoxically, the concomitant use of <b>latanoprost</b> and bimatoprost or other prostaglandins may result in increased intraocular pressure.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce or increase the effect of <b>latanoprost.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{people with}} ocular {{hypertension}} including open-angle glaucoma (IOP ≥21 mm Hg), treatment with <b>latanoprost</b> reduced IOP levels by 22 to 39% over 1 to 12 months’ treatment. <b>Latanoprost</b> {{was more effective}} than timolol 0.5% twice daily in 3 of 4 large (n = 163 to 267) randomised, double-blind trials. <b>Latanoprost</b> demonstrated a stable long-term IOP-lowering effect in 1- or 2-year continuations of these trials, {{with no sign of}} diminishing effect during prolonged treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Latanoprost</b> and bimatoprost are {{specific}} PGF2a analogues applied topically, {{and have been}} found to lengthen eyelashes, darken hair pigmentation and elongate hair. Bimatoprost is available as treatment for eyelash growth. <b>Latanoprost</b> has shown ability to promote scalp hair density and pigmentation, and is theorized to function at the dermal papilla. A study found <b>latanoprost</b> ineffective on eyelashes in a patient with alopecia areata. It has also been found ineffective in treatment of eyebrow hair loss.|$|E
50|$|Patients who had {{elevated}} IOP despite iridotomy and/or iridectomy (including {{patients of}} Asian descent), <b>latanoprost</b> was significantly {{more effective than}} timolol in two double-blind, monotherapy trials (8.2 and 8.8 mm Hg vs 5.2 and 5.7 mm Hg for <b>latanoprost</b> vs timolol at 12 and 2 weeks, respectively).|$|E
50|$|<b>Latanoprost</b> {{is absorbed}} well through the cornea and {{completely}} hydrolysed to the active <b>latanoprost</b> acid. Highest concentrations of the acid in the aqueous humour are reached {{two hours after}} application, lowering of intraocular pressure starts after 3 to 4 hours, the highest effect is found after 8 to 12 hours, and its action lasts at least 24 hours. When <b>latanoprost</b> acid reaches the circulation, it is quickly metabolised in the liver by beta oxidation to 1,2-dinor- and 1,2,3,4-tetranor-latanoprost acid; blood plasma half life is only 17 minutes. The metabolites are mainly excreted via the kidney.|$|E
50|$|Other PGF2α analogues {{with the}} same {{mechanism}} include <b>latanoprost</b> and travoprost.|$|E
50|$|A {{single case}} report links <b>latanoprost</b> {{use to the}} {{progression}} of keratoconus.|$|E
50|$|An {{analogous}} pathway (at least {{up to the}} tetranor-metabolites) {{has been}} found for <b>latanoprost</b> and travoprost.|$|E
50|$|Like tafluprost and travoprost, <b>latanoprost</b> is an ester prodrug that is {{activated}} {{to the free}} acid in the cornea. Also like the related drugs, <b>latanoprost</b> acid is an analog of prostaglandin F2α {{that acts as a}} selective agonist at the prostaglandin F receptor. Prostaglandins increase the sclera's permeability to aqueous fluid. So, an increase in prostaglandin activity increases outflow of aqueous fluid thus lowering intraocular pressure.|$|E
5000|$|... ocular {{pigmentation}} is {{an accumulation}} of pigment in the eye, and {{may be caused by}} <b>latanoprost</b> medication.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Latanoprost</b> is an {{isopropyl}} ester, that is hydrolyzed by esterases in {{the cornea}} to the biologically active acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Latanoprost</b> {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Latanoprost</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.69 to 3.79 USD per 2.5 ml bottle. In the United States a month of treatment costs less than 25 USD.|$|E
5000|$|Prostaglandin analogs, such as <b>latanoprost,</b> bimatoprost and travoprost, {{increase}} uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor. Bimatoprost {{also increases}} trabecular outflow.|$|E
50|$|<b>Latanoprost</b> (Xalatan), a prostaglandin, may {{significantly}} reduce IOP (intraocular pressure) {{in patients with}} glaucoma associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome. <b>Latanoprost</b> is commercially formulated as an aqueous solution in a concentration of 0.005% preserved with 0.02% benzalkonium chloride (BAC). The recommended dosage of <b>latanoprost</b> is one drop daily in the evening, which permits better diurnal IOP control than does morning instillation. Its effect is independent of race, gender or age, and it has few to no side effects. Contraindications include a history of CME, epiretinal membrane formation, vitreous loss during cataract surgery, history of macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion, history of anterior uveitis, and diabetes mellitus. It is also wise to advise patients that unilateral treatment can result in heterochromia or hypertrichosis that may become cosmetically objectionable.|$|E
50|$|FP {{receptor}} agonists, specifically <b>latanoprost,</b> travoprost, bimatoprost, and tafluprost, {{are currently}} used as first-line drugs to treat glaucoma and other causes of intra-ocular hypertension (see Glaucoma#Medication).|$|E
50|$|Latanoprost/timolol (trade name Xalacom) is a {{combination}} drug used in glaucoma, consisting of <b>latanoprost</b> (increase uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor) and timolol (a beta blocker decreasing the production of aqueous fluid).|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} bimatoprost {{to be more}} {{effective}} than timolol in reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) and as least as effective as the prostaglandin analogs <b>latanoprost</b> and travoprost in reducing IOP.|$|E
50|$|Meta-analysis {{suggests}} that <b>latanoprost</b> {{is more effective}} than timolol in lowering IOP. However, it often causes iris pigmentation. While current evidence {{suggests that}} this pigmentation is benign, careful lifetime evaluation of patients is still justified.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include blurry vision, redness of the eye, itchiness, and darkening of the iris. <b>Latanoprost</b> {{is in the}} {{prostaglandin}} analogue family of medication. It works by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes through the uveoscleral tract.|$|E
50|$|Like other analogs of {{prostaglandin}} F2α such as tafluprost and <b>latanoprost,</b> travoprost is an ester prodrug of {{the free}} acid, which acts as an agonist at the prostaglandin F receptor, increasing outflow of aqueous fluid from the eye and thus lowering intraocular pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Ocular Effects of Prostaglandins and Other Eicosanoids (Ed), Special Supplement {{based on}} the 9th International PG Symposium (Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 12-13 May 1995) and the ARVO SIG Sessions on <b>Latanoprost</b> (Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 22-23 April 1996). Survey of Ophthalmology Vol. 41, Suppl 2, 1997.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} drugs can cause {{changes in the}} retina {{that can lead to}} macular edema. The effect of each drug is {{variable}} and some drugs have a lesser role in causation. The principal medication known to affect the retina are:- <b>latanoprost,</b> epinephrine, rosiglitazone, timolol and thiazolidinediones among others.|$|E
50|$|The single-nucleotide {{polymorphism}} (SNP) A/G variant, rs12731181, {{located in}} the Three prime untranslated region of PTGFR {{has been associated with}} increased risk for hypertension in individuals from southern Germany; while this association was not replicated in other European populations, it was found in a Korean population. This SNP variant reduces the binging of MicroRNA miR-590-3p to PTGFR; since this binding represses translation of this gene, the rs127231181 variant acts to increase expression of the FP receptor. PTGFR SNP variants rs6686438 and rs10786455s were associated with positive and SNP variants rs3753380, rs6672484, and rs11578155 in PTGFR were associated with negative responses to <b>latanoprost</b> for the treatment of Open-Angle Glaucoma in a Spanish population. PTGFR SNP variants rs3753380 and rs3766355 were associated with a reduce response to <b>latanoprost</b> in a Chinese population study.|$|E
50|$|Carl B. Camras (November 23, 1953 - April 14, 2009) was an American {{ophthalmologist}} {{known for}} his research on the treatment of glaucoma. He discovered {{a new class of}} drugs to treat glaucoma—prostaglandin analogues. Specifically, he developed <b>latanoprost</b> sold under the trade name Xalatan, which is the most widely used glaucoma medication.|$|E
50|$|<b>Latanoprost,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Xalatan among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat increased pressure inside the eye. This includes ocular hypertension and open angle glaucoma. It is applied as eye drops to the eyes. Onset of effects is usually within four hours, and they last {{for up to a}} day.|$|E
50|$|The FP {{receptor}} is {{the least}} selective of the prostenoid receptors {{in that it is}} responsive to PGD2 {{and to a lesser extent}} PGE2 at concentrations close to those of PGF2α. Standard prostanoids have the following relative efficacies as receptor ligands in binding to and activating FP: PGF2α>PGD2>PGE2>PGI2=TXA2. In typical binding studies, PGF2α has one-half maximal binding and cell stimulating actions at ~1 nanomolar whereas PGD2 and PGE2 are ~5- to 10-fold and 10-100-fold weaker than this. The synthetic analogs that like PGF2α act as selective receptor agonists of FP viz., cloprostenol, flupostenol, <b>latanoprost,</b> and tafluprost (acid form) have FP binding affinities and stimulating potencies similar to PGF2α while others as enprostil, sulprostone, U46619, carbacyclin, and iloprost are considerably weaker FP agonists. Fluprostenol is a widely used clinically as a selective FP receptor agonist; <b>latanoprost</b> is a suitable substitute.|$|E
50|$|Use in {{pregnant}} women is limited {{due to high}} incidence of abortion shown in animal experiments. Because of this, <b>latanoprost</b> is classified as risk factor C (adverse events were observed in animal reproduction studies at maternally toxic doses) according to United States Food and Drug Administration's use-in-pregnancy ratings. Drug excretion in breast milk is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Certain eyedrops - {{prostaglandin}} analogues (<b>latanoprost,</b> isopropyl unoprostone, travoprost, and bimatoprost) {{are used}} topically to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. A concentric heterochromia has developed {{in some patients}} applying these drugs. The stroma around the iris sphincter muscle becomes darker than the peripheral stroma. A stimulation of melanin synthesis within iris melanocytes has been postulated.|$|E
50|$|Syringe {{designed}} saline drops (e.g. Wallace Cameron Ultra Saline Minipod) {{are distributed}} in modern needle-exchange programmes {{as they can}} be used efficiently either by injection or ophthalmic (if the drug is potent in small doses) route of administer which is compared to intravenous use; By demonstration, the elimination of <b>latanoprost</b> acid from plasma is rapid (half-life 17 minutes) after either ophthalmic or intravenous administration.|$|E
5000|$|In {{medical school}} at Columbia University, Dr. Camras sought out a {{research}} adviser who {{would work with}} him on his project. After many rejections, he partnered with a renowned researcher-novelist Dr. László Z. Bitó who agreed {{to work with him}} on the project. [...] Together with the help of Johan Stjernschantz at Pharmacia, the three developed the prostaglandin analogue, <b>latanoprost,</b> which remains the leading treatment in glaucoma therapy.|$|E
5000|$|Eyedrops. This {{is usually}} the first {{treatment}} method. Eyedrops can help reduce intraocular pressure within the eye. The medications within the eyedrops can include beta blockers (such as levobunolol or timolol) which slow {{the production of the}} aqueous humor. And other medications can increase its outflow, such as prostaglandin analogues (e.g. <b>latanoprost).</b> And these medicines can be used in various combinations. In most cases of glaucoma, eyedrops alone will suffice to solve the problem.|$|E
