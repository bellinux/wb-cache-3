Except for <b>land</b> <b>transportation</b> in cities, and two loaned ships in China and the US, his modes of transportation were seldom reserved exclusively for him. He shared regularly scheduled steamships and rail transport with fare-paying passengers. On the Red Sea, he played cards and danced with other passengers. Like other tourists, he visited the white elephants of Siam, the Giza pyramid complex in Egypt, tourist sites in India, and museums in Europe. Along the way, he exceeded his original budget, went shopping anyway, and sent letters back home.|$|E
5|$|Before Michigan {{became a}} state, the first <b>land</b> <b>transportation</b> {{corridors}} were the Indian trails. The French-Indian Trail ran through southeastern Michigan between Toledo, Monroe and Detroit. The Saginaw Trail ran north from Detroit to the Saginaw area where it {{connected with the}} original Mackinaw Trail that ran roughly parallel to, and west of, the modern I-75. Another path, the Cheboygan Trail, ran parallel to the modern freeway to the east between the West Branch area and Cheboygan. In the UP, {{an extension of the}} Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie. In the 19th century, the Michigan Legislature chartered private companies to build and operate plank roads or turnpikes in the state, many of which replaced the original Indian trails. These roads were originally made of oak planks, but later legislation permitted gravel as well. By {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, only 23 of the 202chartered turnpikes were still in operation; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways. The remaining plank roads were turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early part of the century.|$|E

25|$|The {{transport}} infrastructure in New France was almost nonexistent, with few roads and canals. The canals {{would be up}} to three miles long at times and boats were thin and simple.

In the winter, when the lakes froze, both the poor and the rich travelled by sleds pulled by dogs or horses. A <b>land</b> <b>transportation</b> system was not developed in the region until the 1830s, when stretches of road were built along the river, and the Rideau Canal project was not completed until 1840.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{transportation}} {{was primarily}} by dog sleds (land) and kayaks (water).

Kayaks were used more frequently than umiaks. Traditionally, kayaking and umiaking served as water transportation and sea hunting. Dog sleds are ideal <b>land</b> <b>transportation.</b> Pedestrian transportation is on foot in summer and snowshoes in winter. Only small local road systems exist in Southwest Alaska.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impacts of new transit {{infrastructure}} projects on the <b>land</b> use <b>transportation</b> system. <b>Land</b> use and <b>transportation</b> systems are inherently interconnected and form an integrated system; and transport projects affect not just the transportation system, but also land use patterns. Current evaluation frameworks and models applied to new transport infrastructure projects usually focus on transportation system improvements, and so {{do not reflect the}} process of <b>land</b> use <b>transportation</b> interaction. To overcome this limitation, this thesis argues that the evaluation of transport projects should consider their accessibility and development impacts; and that this requires models which explicitly incorporate the interaction between <b>land</b> use and <b>transportation.</b> The Circle Line in Chicago is a proposed circumferential rail transit line which will serve the urban core of the Chicago region, and is likely to significantly affect both land use and travel patterns. (cont.) This thesis assesses how existing models can be used to quantify the accessibility and development impacts of this project; and how an existing evaluation framework, developed by the Federal Transit Administration, considers these impacts. In addition, this thesis develops a quasi-integrated <b>land</b> use <b>transportation</b> model for the Chicago region; and applies it to quantify the accessibility and development impacts of the Circle Line project. The frameworks and models developed for the Circle Line project provide an example of how to improve the current FTA evaluation methodology. by Ritesh K. Warade. Thesis (M. C. P.)
