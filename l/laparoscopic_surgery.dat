5|$|Smith {{was born}} in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire and played in the Huddersfield and District Association Football League for Lepton Highlanders. He trialled at Football League clubs Huddersfield Town and Oldham Athletic at the ages of 14 at 15 respectively. While playing for Kirkheaton he was spotted by Chesterfield and was invited for a trial match, and was {{eventually}} offered {{a place on the}} club' scholarship scheme. He began training with the first team during the 2001–02 season and was first named on the bench for Chesterfield's 1–0 victory over Reading at the Madejski Stadium on 1 December 2001. He made his debut in a Football League Trophy match against Port Vale on 22 November 2002, where he came on as a substitute in the 77th minute, and scored in the penalty shoot-out that was eventually lost 4–3. His Football League debut came on 13 September 2003 after coming on as a substitute for the injured Mark DeBolla in the 79th minute of a 1–0 defeat to Notts County. He went on to make further appearances that month against Brighton & Hove Albion and Brentford, where he played on the left wing. He was offered a two-year professional contract with Chesterfield in March 2004, effective from 2004–05. His first league start for Chesterfield came in a 1–0 defeat to Hull City on 10 October. He underwent <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> on his knee to repair cartilage damage in February 2005, which was expected to rule him out for six weeks. He made his return on 18 March after coming on as a 60th-minute substitute for Carlos Logan in a 2–2 draw with Brentford. Soon after making his return, he picked up an injury to his left ankle, which was sustained during Chesterfield's 3–2 defeat to Bournemouth. This ruled him out {{for the rest of the}} season, which he finished with 19 appearances.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Laparoscopic</b> <b>{{surgeries}},</b> {{just like}} open surgeries {{are not free}} of complications. The study aimed to identify various complications associated with <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> and their magnitude. Planning for an effective management along with prevention, Study incorporated 851 subjects in our hospital operated for various laparoscopic procedures and patients with complications in any form were followed up for a mean duration of 12 months. Major complication associated with laparoscopy port site were discharge from the wound(1. 41 %),infections (1. 02 %), bleeding (0. 70 %) subcutaneous emphysema(0. 58 %) and incisional hernia (0. 47 %.). vascular and visceral injuries are rare due to increasing expertise in trocar insertion techniques...|$|R
25|$|Groin hernias that do {{not cause}} {{symptoms}} in males {{do not need to}} be repaired. Repair, however, is generally recommended in women due to the higher rate of femoral hernias which have more complications. If strangulation occurs immediate surgery is required. Repair may be done by open surgery or by <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgery.</b> Open surgery has the benefit of possibly being done under local anesthesia rather than general anesthesia. <b>Laparoscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> generally has less pain following the procedure. A hiatus hernia may be treated with lifestyle changes such as raising the head of the bed, weight loss, and adjusting eating habits. The medications, H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors may help. If the symptoms do not improve with medications the surgery known as laparoscopic fundoplication may be an option.|$|E
25|$|Recovery time {{following}} <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> is {{shorter and}} less painful than following traditional abdominal surgery. Instead {{of opening the}} pelvic cavity with a wide incision (laparotomy), a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) and surgical instruments are inserted into the pelvic cavity via small incisions. Rectopexy and anterior resection have been performed laparoscopically with good results.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 Cochrane review {{found that}} robotic {{assisted}} surgery {{may have a}} similar complication rate when compared to conventional <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgery.</b> In addition, {{there is evidence to}} suggest that although the surgery make take longer, robotic assisted surgery may result in shorter hospital stays. More research is necessary to determine if robotic assisted hysterectomies are beneficial for people with cancer.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Recent {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} the clinical efficacy of laparoscopic colorectal surgery; however, its use has not become widespread. One {{reason for this}} is perceived economic implications. A systematic review was undertaken examining the costs of <b>laparoscopic</b> colorectal <b>surgery.</b> METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for articles comparing <b>laparoscopic</b> colorectal <b>surgery</b> and open surgery. Primary outcome measures were operating room, direct hospital, and indirect costs. Secondary outcomes were conversion rates and length of hospital stay. The percentage difference in costs was used for comparisons between studies. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles were identified in which cost data were presented (total number of patients 3, 681); the economic data in most studies was limited. Operating room costs were greater for <b>laparoscopic</b> colorectal <b>surgery</b> than open surgery in all studies (median difference, 50 percent; interquartile range, 27 - 78 percent; P < 0. 001). There was no overall difference in total hospital costs (median difference, 0 percent; interquartile range, - 17. 5 to 21 percent). Only two articles collected data on indirect costs, with both in favor of <b>laparoscopic</b> colorectal <b>surgery.</b> Hospital stay was shorter for <b>laparoscopic</b> colorectal <b>surgery</b> in all studies (median difference, 2. 8 days; interquartile range, 1. 3 - 3. 7; P < 0. 001). Median conversion rate was 7. 8 percent (mean, 14 percent; interquartile range, 6 - 21 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Operating room costs are greater for <b>laparoscopic</b> colorectal <b>surgery</b> than open surgery. Total hospital costs are similar. There may be societal benefits associated with lower indirect costs for <b>laparoscopic</b> colorectal <b>surgery.</b> Cost should not be a deterrent to performing <b>laparoscopic</b> colorectal <b>surgery...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{tracheal}} tube is always {{considered to be}} the gold standard for <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries.</b> As conventional laryngoscopy guided endotracheal intubation evokes significant hypertension and tachycardia, we have used I-gel, second generation extraglottic airway device, in an attempt to overcome these drawbacks. We conducted this study to compare haemodynamic changes during insertion, efficacy of ventilation, and complications with the use of I-gel when compared with endo{{tracheal tube}} (ETT) in <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Materials and Methods: A total of 60 American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I and II adult patients undergoing elective <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> were randomly allocated to one of the two groups of 30 patients each: Group-A (I-gel) in which patients airway was secured with appropriate sized I-gel, and Group-B (ETT) in which patients airway was secured with laryngoscopy - guided endotracheal intubation. Ease, attempts and time for insertion of airway device, haemodynamic and ventilatory parameters at different time intervals, and attempts for gastric tube insertion, and perioperative complications were recorded. Results: There was significant rise in pulse rate and mean blood pressure during insertion with use of ETT when compared to I-gel. Furthermore, time required for I-gel insertion was significantly less when compared with ETT. However ease and attempts for airway device insertion, attempts for gastric tube insertion and efficacy of ventilation were comparable between two groups. Conclusion: We concluded that I-gel requires less time for insertion with minimal haemodynamic changes when compared to ETT. I-gel also provides adequate positive-pressure ventilation, comparable with ETT. Hence I-gel can be a safe and suitable alternative to ETT for <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries...</b>|$|R

25|$|As of 2006, {{there were}} about 15 million units of blood {{products}} transfused {{per year in the}} United States. By 2013, the number had declined to about 11 million units, due to the shift towards <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> and other surgical advances and studies that have shown that many transfusions were unnecessary. For example, the standard of care reduced that amount of blood transfused from 750 to 200ml.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{surgical}} approaches are retroperitoneal (abdominal using <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgery),</b> infrainguinal/subinguinal (below the groin) and inguinal (groin using percutaneous embolization).

40|$|Background: As an {{anesthetic}} adjuvant dexmedetomidine {{has been}} shown to provide good perioperative hemodynamic stability with minimum alveolar concentration sparing effect on inhalational anesthetic agents during <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> performed under general anesthesia. Aim: The study was planned to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on attenuation of hemodynamic changes and requirements of intra-operative analgesic and inhalational anesthetic during <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> and its postoperative side effects. Materials and Methods: A total of 70 patients scheduled for elective <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> were randomized to receive bolus infusion of dexmedetomidine (group D) or saline (group S) 1 mcg/kg/h, followed by continuous infusion of the same, at the rate of 0. 5 mcg/kg/h. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide in oxygen, muscle relaxant and isoflurane. Supplementation with end-tidal isoflurane was considered when heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (BP) exceeded 20 % of the baseline value. Hemodynamics, end-tidal isoflurane concentration and adverse events were recorded. Results: Intra-operative mean HR and mean BP in group D were lower than group S (P < 0. 05) throughout the laparoscopy surgery. Requirement of intra-operative fentanyl, end-tidal isoflurane and postoperative tramadol were significantly more in group S compared to group D (P < 0. 05) Statistically significant nausea and vomiting were noted in group S. Undue sedation and other adverse effects are comparable in both the groups. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant in general anesthesia for <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> provided a stable hemodynamic profile in the perioperative period and effectively blunted pressor response to intubation and extubation, leading to minimal requirements for additional analgesics and potent inhalational agents. There were less adverse events...|$|R
30|$|Robots {{have been}} {{introduced}} to the operating theater in recent decades; the daVinci surgical system is a well-known example. The daVinci system is a multipurpose surgical robotic system designed for <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Four robotic arms {{are included in the}} system for manipulating a laparoscope and other surgical tools during surgery. Though tele-surgery is allowed with the daVinci system, the primary surgeon who operates the robot is away distant from the patient’s bedside [6] due to its large footprint. Furthermore, as the robotic arms are designed for <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries,</b> the robotic arms are generally setup to operate above the patient’s abdomen; thus, when performing laparoscopic hysterectomy, an assistant is still required to position the patient’s uterus {{from the end of the}} operating table.|$|R
25|$|Laparoscopic cyst {{decortication}} (also {{referred to}} as marsupialization) consists in the removal {{of one or more}} kidney cysts through <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgery,</b> during which cysts are punctured, and the outer wall of the larger cysts is excised with care not to incise the renal parenchyma. This procedure can be useful for pain relief in patients with ADPKD, and is usually indicated after earlier cyst aspiration has confirmed that the cyst to be decorticated is responsible for pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> are less pain, faster recovery, and smaller wounds to heal. A study {{has shown that}} patients are 70% more active {{in the first three}} days post-surgery compared to open surgery. The reason open surgery is more painful is that larger incisions are required, and the ovary needs to be pulled out of the body, which stretches and tears tissue in the abdomen (it is not uncommon for patients to react under anaesthesia by breathing faster at this point).|$|E
25|$|<b>Laparoscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> is {{performed}} using several small incisions, or ports: one to insert a surgical telescope connected to a video camera, and others to permit access of specialized operating instruments. The surgeon views the operation on a video screen. Laparoscopy is also called limited access surgery, reflecting the limitation on handling and feeling tissues and also the limited resolution and two-dimensionality of the video image. With experience, a skilled laparoscopic surgeon can perform most procedures as expeditiously as with an open incision—with the option of using an incision should the need arise.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND General Anaesthesia (GA) is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used technique for all <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries.</b> The aim is to study the attenuation of physiological changes that are associated with <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> by regional (epidural) analgesia when combined with general anaesthesia to compare the intraoperative variables after administering general anaesthesia and combined general anaesthesia with regional analgesia (epidural) in patients undergoing <b>laparoscopic</b> abdominal <b>surgeries.</b> Our aim is to compare the requirement of anaesthetic drugs between patients receiving only general anaesthesia and those receiving general anaesthesia with epidural analgesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred patients posted for <b>laparoscopic</b> abdominal <b>surgeries</b> were enrolled in this randomised controlled trial. They were randomly selected to undergo general anaesthesia or combined general anaesthesia with regional analgesia. Monitoring was done for heart rate, blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide and awareness during anaesthesia. RESULTS Cardiovascular stability (heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure) was satisfactory in the intraoperative period in both the groups. The anaesthetic and analgesic drugs required were significantly lower in the combined general anaesthesia-regional analgesia group as compared to patients receiving only general anaesthesia. CONCLUSION The combined general anaesthesia-regional analgesia group has the advantage of more cardiovascular stability, lower requirement of analgesics and general anaesthetic agents/drugs...|$|R
