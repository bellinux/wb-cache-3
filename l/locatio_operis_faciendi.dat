50|$|In South African law, the {{distinction}} between employees (or servants) and independent contractors is based on {{the distinction}} between locatio conductio operarum and <b>locatio</b> conductio <b>operis</b> <b>faciendi.</b> These categories, being contractual, “should be defined with the law of contract in mind.” In the case of employment, the employer is vicariously liable for the delictual acts of the employee committed during course of his employment. In the case of an independent contractor, the principal or locator is not delictually liable. The case of Chartaprops (Pty) Ltd & another v Silberman, highly important, illustrates this principle. Mrs Silberman was injured in casu when she slipped and fell in a shopping mall owned by Chartaprops, which had appointed a company, Advanced Planning, to do the cleaning of the mall. A slippery substance was left undetected by the employees of Advanced Planning; Silberman sustained an injury as a result, and sued both companies—Advanced Planning {{on the basis of the}} negligence of its employees in failing to detect and remove the substance, which had been lying on floor for about thirty minutes. There was evidence also that Chartaprops was in habit of checking on and inspecting Advanced Planning’s activities. But Chartaprops, too, had failed to detect the substance. In court a quo, both respondents were found to be liable, jointly and severally. They appealed, and leave to do so was granted.|$|R

50|$|In Roman law the {{equivalent}} dichotomy was that between locatio conductio operarum (employment contract) and <b>locatio</b> conductio <b>operis</b> (contract for services).|$|R
5000|$|... <b>locatio</b> conductio <b>operis,</b> or {{contract}} for the supply of services, like {{the construction of a}} building, between an employer and independent contractor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sequence}} {{of performance and}} counter-performance also depends on the contractual provisions. If, however, another intention does not appear, the contractor, in <b>locatio</b> conductio <b>operis</b> for example, must first perform.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} South Africa's modern {{contract}} of employment lie in Roman law, where a distinction was made between {{the two types of}} contracts discussed above: <b>locatio</b> conductio <b>operis</b> and <b>locatio</b> conductio operarum.|$|R
50|$|This {{has long}} been a {{difficult}} task in South Africa, as it is not always immediately apparent whether the parties have entered into the locatio conductio operarum (contract of employment) or merely the <b>locatio</b> conductio <b>operis</b> (contract of work).|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze {{legislative}} relations rising from <b>locatio</b> <b>operis</b> in construction. Work focuses on the practical problems, that rising from these obligations. I compare here the Czech and the German legal regulations. Thereinafter is mention about advantages and disadvantages the Czech legal regulation. I explain and analyze legal relations rising from implementation of the work. In a practical section were compiled checklists and were sent to construction companies. It was detected, that construction companies don´t use at closing of contract the specialized legal aid. Thereinafter was detected, that rises law suits between construction companies and customers. The main reason of these law suits are wrong getting together contracts...|$|R
5000|$|In {{contracts}} whereby reciprocal obligations are created, {{the question}} of whether the obligations are so closely linked that the principle of reciprocity applies is basically a matter of interpretation. If, however, no other intention appears, the principle applies by operation of law to certain well-known contracts, such as, for example, the contract of sale and <b>locatio</b> conductio <b>operis.</b>|$|R
50|$|As noted above, in Roman law the {{contract}} of lease (locatio conductio) had three forms: the locatio conductio rei, the <b>locatio</b> conductio <b>operis</b> and the <b>locatio</b> conductio operarum. Roman-Dutch law adopted this position, {{and it is still}} in force in South Africa. The modern {{contract of lease}} is therefore the Roman locatio conductio rei, the rental or hire of a thing.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the right}} of {{withholding}} is seen as analogous to the holding of a pledge, this would entail that a party's own performance could be withheld until the counter-performance is fully rendered. In the case of <b>locatio</b> conductio <b>operis,</b> {{it is all the}} more the case that the contractor must fully perform before he is entitled to the contract price.|$|R
50|$|Mandate (mandatum or lastgeving) is a {{contract}} {{in which one}} person, the mandatary, undertakes to perform some lawful task for another, the mandator. In Roman-Dutch law, the contract {{was said to be}} essentially gratuitous. If the parties agreed on a payment for the services rendered, the contract was one of letting and hiring of work or services: <b>locatio</b> conductio <b>operis</b> or operarum respectively. It was accepted in practice, however, that the mandator might offer a reward or honorarium, not in payment but in gratitude, for the mandatary's services. There is no objection in modern law to the remuneration of the mandatary, with the result {{that it is difficult to}} distinguish the contract of mandate from that of letting and hiring of work or services.|$|R
40|$|According to the Labour Code of 1974 the {{employment}} relationship is an obligation between a single employee and an employer. The basis {{of such a}} relationship is {{the employment}} contract concluded with each employee separately. The Polish labour legislation does not provide for the institution of so-called group employment relationships concluded by several people jointly {{on the one hand}} and an employer on the other. However, such contracts appear in connection with a new trend of introducing in state enterprises so-called group forms of work organization. By virtue of such contracts, a voluntarily established group of people assumes the obligation of performing jointly a given production task for a stated remuneration which is later divided among the members of a group by the independent decision of the whole group. According to the majority opinion of legal scholars, such contracts are not a legally separate type of contracts but are in fact only a sum of so-called „autonomous clauses", i. e. contractual stipulations which complement the contents of employment contracts concluded by an employer with each individual member of a group. The author criticizes the above view and tries to prove that the basis of employing in a group system of work is a separate contract for collective labour which may be characterized as an innominate contract concluded between an employer {{on the one hand and}} a group of employees on the other. The above contract is a source of a so-called joint obligation on the part of the members of a group. The said contract is not the employment contract yet it contains elements typical for a contract of employment as well as a contract for performing a specified task or work and — with respect to relations between the members of a group — elements similar to those appearing in the partnership contract. A complex structure of those group contracts indicates that they are mixed contracts (a type of innominate contracts) imposing the obligation to achieve a stated effect and burdening the employment with a part of the risk to carry out that task. Since the employment contract components prevail, the said contracts are subject to the labour law regulation. Hence, the members of a group enjoy full protection granted by the labour law to people employed by virtue of contracts falling under the Labour Code provisions. The author postulates to adopt the provisions regulating the said type of innominate contracts in the amendments to the Labour Code. In his way a new type of a contract — a contract for rendering collective work — would appear in the Polish labour law. The author agrees in principle that it is high time to break away from a stereotype of the employment contract as a due diligence contract (locatio conducilo operarum), radically different from a contract for performing a specified task or work (<b>locatio</b> conductio <b>operis).</b> The elimination of differences between those two kinds of contracts finds justification in the world trends to make the labour law more flexible in response to the incoming „third wave" of the civilization of our epoch.
