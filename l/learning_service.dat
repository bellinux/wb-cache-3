Ufi, which runs the Learndirect adult <b>learning</b> <b>service,</b> said continuing the deal would not “protect and enhance” its reputation. The former sponsor of the show in Scotland, Shades Blinds, retained their association with the programme although they did raise the possibility of withdrawing their sponsorship.

25|$|In the 2011–2012 school year, 100,632 K-12 {{students}} enrolled in 221 schools in the English language public school system run by the Calgary Board of Education. With other {{students enrolled}} in the associated CBe-learn and Chinook <b>Learning</b> <b>Service</b> programs, the school system's total enrolment is 104,182 students. Another 43,000 attend about 95 schools in the separate English language Calgary Catholic School District board. The much smaller Francophone community has their own French language school boards (public and Catholic), which are both based in Calgary, but serve a larger regional district. There are also several public charter schools in the city. Calgary has a number of unique schools, including the country's first high school exclusively designed for Olympic-calibre athletes, the National Sport School. Calgary is also home to many private schools including Mountain View Academy, Rundle College, Rundle Academy, Clear Water Academy, Calgary French and International School, Chinook Winds Adventist Academy, Webber Academy, Delta West Academy, Masters Academy, Calgary Islamic School, Menno Simons Christian School, West Island College and Edge School.|$|E

These learning frameworks can be constructed based on the distributed <b>learning</b> <b>services</b> and resources available in a learning Grid environment.
