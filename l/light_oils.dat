Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 24.8 million Btu/ton (29.6 MJ/kg).

30|$|In the Tahe {{oilfield}} in China, {{heavy oil}} is commonly lifted using the <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> blending technology. However, {{due to the}} lack of <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> the production of heavy oil has been seriously limited. Thus, a new compound technology of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> blending and electric heating is discussed in this paper, which aims to reduce the usage of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and maintain heavy oil production. Based on the mass, momentum and energy conservation, a pressure and temperature coupling model is developed. The heat-transfer parameters are calculated by using Hasan–Kabir method and the pressure drop is calculated by using Hagedorn–Brown method. The model also considers the blend effect of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and heavy oil, and the heating effect of electric rod. Example calculation shows that only electric heating or <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> blending technology cannot meet the requirement. The amount of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> used can be reduced by combining the electric heating technology.|$|R

2500|$|Much of Canada’s {{petroleum}} {{effort has}} focused on producing oil from the oil sands (sometimes called “tar sands”) of northern Alberta. To appreciate these resources, {{it is important to}} understand a simple concept from chemistry and physics: the [...] "gravity" [...] of crude oil and natural gas liquids. The oil industry measures the weight of oil on terms of an artificial scale known as API (American Petroleum Institute) gravity. Ten degrees API is the gravity of water. <b>Light</b> <b>oils</b> use a higher API number. Generally heavier than water, bitumen typically has an API of 8-10 degrees API.|$|E
50|$|A thermo{{hydrometer}} is a hydrometer {{that has}} a thermometer enclosed in the float section.

40|$|Two {{different}} ways, turfgrass leaf color {{observation and}} detection of mineral oils by GC/MS, {{were applied to}} determine <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> or gasoline on turfgrass (T- 419) after 15 hr treatment.

Then the leaf color was changed to a dull dark green. In the gasoline treatment, the Value was increased slightly (3. 5 → 4. 0), and the Hue was changed to yellowish dark green color (7 GY→ 5 GY). It was easy to distingish <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> or gasoline by leaf color observation.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{and compares}} {{the effect of}} {{fractional}} flow curves on the heavy <b>oil</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> recoveries in a petroleum reservoir. Fingering of flowing water {{is one of the}} serious problems of the oil displacement by water and another problem is the estimation of the amount of recover oil from a petroleum reservoir. To address these problems, the fractional flow of heavy <b>oil</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> are investigated. The fractional flow approach treats the multi-phases flow rate as a total mixed fluid and then describes the individual phases as fractional of the total flow. Laboratory experiments are implemented for two different types of oils, heavy <b>oil,</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> to experimentally obtain relative permeability and fractional flow curves. Application of the <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> fractional curve, which exhibits a regular S-shape, to the water flooding method showed that a large amount of mobile oil in the reservoir is displaced by water injection. In contrast, the fractional flow curve of heavy oil does not display an S-shape because of its high viscosity. Although the advance of the injected waterfront is faster than in <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs, a significant amount of mobile oil remains behind the waterfront...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Performances of {{a tractor}} diesel engine fueled by three {{different}} animal fats biodiesels were evaluated comparing with <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> tractor {{in terms of}} power, fuel consumption rate, exhaust gases, particulate matter amount and field work capacity. Methods: Animal fats based on pig biodiesel were manufactured manually and tested for its engine performance in the tractor diesel engine and fuel adoptability in the field works. Four different fuels, three different content of biodiesel (BD 20, BD 50, BD 100) and <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> were prepared and tested in the four strokes diesel engine. Power output, fuel consumption rate and exhaust gases of the four fuels in the diesel engine were compared and discussed. Results: Power output of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> engine was the greatest showing 5. 3 % difference between <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and BD 100, but 0. 37 % better power than BD 20 engine power. Less exhaust gases of CO 2, CO, NOX and THC were produced from animal fats biodiesel than <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> which confirmed that biodiesel is environmental friendly fuel. For fuel adoptability in the tractor, biodiesel engine tractor showed its fuel competitiveness comparing with <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> for tractor works in the faddy field. Conclusions: With four different fuel types of animal-fats biodiesel, performances of a four cylinder diesel engine for tractor were evaluated in terms of power, exhaust gases, particulate matters (PM) and field work capacity. No significant differences observed in the engine performances including power output and exhaust gases emission rate. No significant power difference observed between the various fuels including <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> on the engine running, however, amounts of noxious exhaust gases including CO 2 and NOX decreased as biodiesel content increased in the fuels.
