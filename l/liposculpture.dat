50|$|The {{corrective}} {{procedures for}} buttock augmentation and buttock repair include the surgical emplacement of a gluteal implant (buttock prosthesis); <b>liposculpture</b> (fat transfer and liposuction); and body contouring (surgery and <b>liposculpture)</b> {{to resolve the}} patient’s particular defect or deformity of the gluteal region. Moreover, in the praxis of sexual reassignment surgery, the prosthetic and <b>liposculpture</b> augmentation of the buttocks can be performed on transsexual and transgender women to enhance the anatomic curvature of the gluteal region {{in order to establish}} the markedly feminine buttocks and hips that project more (to the rear and to the side) than do masculine hips.|$|E
50|$|Reshaping the {{buttocks}} with <b>liposculpture</b> is performed {{with a small}} cannula (2 mm) specifically for contouring superficial body fat, the configuration of which (number of open ports) {{is determined by the}} type and the degree of gluteal correction to be realized. To sculpt rounded contours to square-shaped buttocks muscles, superficial <b>liposculpture</b> allows the plastic surgeon to control the injection-rate of the fat-volume. Moreover, superficial liposuction can be combined with other treatment methods for contouring the gluteal region to achieve the required functional, anatomic correction, and the aesthetic enhancement sought by the patient, such as reshaping the lateral area of {{the buttocks}} into an athletic form. The study Contouring the Gluteal Region with Tumescent <b>Liposculpture</b> (2011) indicated that effective, gluteal-region contouring is best achieved by tailoring the liposuction-reduction and the lipoinjection-augmentation techniques to the anatomic topography of the body areas to be corrected. Furthermore, the study Contouring of the Gluteal Region in Women: Enhancement and Augmentation (2011) indicated that natural contours of the buttocks and the thighs are effectively achieved with a combined gluteoplasty of selective liposuction and lipoinjection, which reduces the need for aggressive surgical procedures, decreases the risk of medical complications, abbreviates wound-recovery-time, and lessens post-operative scarring. Combined with any buttocks-correction method, superficial <b>liposculpture</b> facilitates the treatment of contour irregularities, the surgical revision of scars, and the correction of gluteal-region contour depressions.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Alfredo Hoyos {{combines}} his {{plastic surgery}} techniques with different technologies, such as Ultrasound-assisted VASER, in getting results in <b>liposculpture.</b> He invented the High Definition <b>Liposculpture</b> (HDL) and Dynamic Definition at Lipoplasty (4D) techniques {{as well as}} other advanced techniques that focus on body contouring. He has also refined techniques in fat transfer (Buttock and Pectoral Lipograft) and breast augmentation. Dr. Hoyos alongside his colleagues has performed several VHD procedures with consistent results. He continues to refine these techniques while researching and developing new applications of HD in additional anatomical regions and the field of cosmetic surgery. He has performed plastic surgeries for many celebrities including Belinda Peregrín.|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} <b>liposculpturing</b> {{technique is}} currently gaining increasing popularity. Although ultrasound is an accepted {{part of our}} diagnostic medical practice, {{the way in which}} it interacts with solid living tissue is still a complex and unsolved biophysical problem. Very few studies, if any, have followed the effects of diffusion of this intriguing technique on the fields of biosafety and interaction mechanisms. We evaluate the results of our standard ultrasound <b>liposculpturing</b> technique in order to recognize the physical mechanism - thermal, cavitational, or ''direct'' - involved in the damaging process. Our microscopic analysis of sonicated adipose tissue confirms that ultrasound is highly selective in its action, producing disruption of macromolecules and cellular structures probably through microstreaming tissue movement. The results of ultrasonic <b>liposculpturing</b> and standard suction lipoplasty are compared. The main advantages of this new technique are the possibility of a very selective destruction of adipose tissue and the prospective solution to such delicate problems as the irregularity of cellulite...|$|R
50|$|The {{removal of}} {{quantities}} of fat {{from under the}} skin allows the elastic skin to potentially retract after SAL. Good examples of this effect are seen after liposuction to the arms, stomach areas and breasts. The level of skin retraction following liposuction {{is affected by the}} age of the patient, quality of skin, presence of underlying disease or smoking and the presence of previous skin damage such as caused by childbirth and surgery. Liposuction techniques such as subdermal undermining using fine cannulas can stimulate further skin retraction but are more frequently associated with contour irregularity. While subdermal undermining may help the skin contract, patients with severe elasticity loss and heavy stretch marks prior to <b>liposculpture</b> may require removal of redundant skin by surgical means after <b>liposculpture.</b> Usually this can be performed after 6 months.|$|E
50|$|While the {{resolution}} of the defects and deformities of the gluteal region can be realized surgically, the assessment of the degree of severity of the injury organizes treatment therapies into three types: (i) buttocks augmentation, (ii) buttocks reduction, and (iii) contour irregularity treatments that combine surgery and <b>liposculpture</b> (fat-removal and fat-injection).|$|E
50|$|Gluteoplasty (Greek gloutόs, rump + plassein, to shape) {{denotes the}} plastic surgery and the <b>liposculpture</b> {{procedures}} for the correction of the congenital, traumatic, and acquired defects and deformities of the buttocks and the anatomy of the gluteal region; and for the aesthetic enhancement (by augmentation or by reduction) of the contour of the buttocks.|$|E
50|$|Historically, boned corsets {{have been}} used to reduce waist sizes. The corset reached its climax during the Victorian era. In twentieth century these corsets were mostly {{replaced}} with more flexible/comfortable foundation garments. Where corsets are used for waist reduction, it may be temporary reduction by occasional use or permanent reduction by people who are often referred to as tightlacers. Liposuction and <b>liposculpture</b> are common surgical methods for reducing the waist line.|$|E
50|$|Abdominal etching, or Ab etching, is {{a plastic}} surgery {{procedure}} invented by plastic surgeon Henry A. Mentz, III {{in the early}} 1990s that uses a special cannula to contour and shape abdominal fat pad to provide patients with a flatter stomach. The procedure selectively removes {{a small amount of}} fat around the patient's natural muscular contours and shapes or sculpts the abdomen to create a more athletic contour. It is very similar to abdominal <b>liposculpture.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{methods for}} {{reducing}} {{the size of the}} buttocks include the varieties of liposuction, such as lipectomy (with and without ultrasonic enhancement) to reduce excess body fat, and superficial <b>liposculpture,</b> to reshape, refine, and re-establish the natural contour of the body. The usual buttocks-reduction treatment is lipectomy with applied tumescence and anaesthesia, wherein the body fat is harvested by aspiration (suction) through a small-gauge cannula (2-4 mm) that is inserted through a small incision, either to the intergluteal sulcus (the butt-crack), or to the upper area of the gluteus maximus muscle proper.|$|E
50|$|The {{outcome of}} a buttocks-contouring {{procedure}} depends upon the specific defect or deformity that can be effectively corrected with <b>liposculpture,</b> ultrasonic or not. Nonetheless, depressed scars and deep morphological defects are difficult to correct because of the curvature of the buttocks as an anatomic unit, {{and because of the}} scar-contracting elements of the tissues across the gluteal curvature. In such a case, although the injection of (autologous or artificial) tissue fillers to correct the defect or the deformity might be impermanent — it usually will remedy the functional and aesthetic shortcoming(s) required by the patient, which is the therapeutic purpose of gluteoplasty.|$|E
50|$|The {{augmentation}} of the buttocks, by rearranging {{and enhancing}} the pertinent muscle and fat tissues of the gluteal region, is {{realized with a}} combined gluteoplasty procedure of surgery (subcutaneous dermal-fat flaps) and <b>liposculpture</b> (fat-suction, fat-injection). Therapeutically, such a combined correction-and-enhancement procedure is a realistic and feasible lower-body-lift treatment for the man and for the woman patient who has undergone massive weight loss (MWL) {{in the course of}} resolving obesity with bariatric surgery. In the case of the man or woman who presents under-projected, flat buttocks (gluteal hypoplasia), and a degree of gluteal-muscle ptosis (prolapsation, falling forward), wherein neither gluteal-implant surgery nor lipoinjection would be adequate to restoring the natural anatomic contour of the gluteal region, the application of a combined treatment of autologous dermal-fat flap surgery and lipoinjection can achieve the required functional correction and aesthetic contour.|$|E
5000|$|A {{facelift}} {{is performed}} to rejuvenate {{the appearance of}} the face. Aging of the face is most shown by a change in position of the deep anatomical structures, notably the platysma muscle, cheek fat and the orbicularis oculi muscle. [...] These lead up to three landmarks namely, an appearance of the jowl (a broken jaw line by ptosis of the platysma muscle), increased redundancy of the nasolabial fold (caused by a descent of cheek fat) and the increased distance from the ciliary margin to the inferior-most point of the orbicularis oculi muscle (caused by decreasing tone of the orbicularis oculi muscle). [...] The skin is a fourth component in the aging of the face. The ideal age for face-lifting is at age 50 or younger, as measured by patient satisfaction. Some areas, such as the nasolabial folds or marionette lines, in some cases can be treated more suitably with facial toning, Botox or <b>liposculpture.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{physician}} {{advises the}} patient who {{has undergone a}} surgical contouring of the buttocks with gluteal implants, that, although immediate results can be observed, the final, corrected body contour usually is observed at 6-months post-operative, and at 1-year post-operative, depending upon the tissue-healing capabilities of the patient’s body. The <b>liposculpture</b> patient usually requires approximately 6 months, and occasionally 1 year before producing the final, corrected body contour. For both procedures, at approximately 1-month post-operative, marked aesthetic improvement is noticeable in the corrected body areas, as is {{the elimination of the}} initial, post-operative weight gain caused by the body’s retention of the infiltrated, anaesthetic and tumescent, fluids. The patient is advised to wear a compression garment to contain swelling and to immobilize the corrected tissues, so that they heal as one anatomic unit of the gluteal region. Moreover, throughout the convalescence, to facilitate shrinking the skin to the new, corrected body contour, and to resolve unevenness, wrinkles to the skin, and localized swelling, the continual application of massage and (occasional) ultrasound treatments can facilitate the diminishment of the post-operative conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{surgical}} and <b>liposculpture</b> contouring of {{the human}} body presents possible medical complications such as: the psychological — unmet body image expectations of aesthetic improvement; the physical — uneven contour, local and general; the physiologic — toxic reactions to the anaesthesic and the tumescent drugs; and the nervous — paresthesia, localized areas of perduring numbness in the corrected portion(s) of the gluteal region. The medical complications possible to a surgical buttocks augmentation procedure, the submuscular emplacement of a gluteal implant, include infection, surgical-wound dehiscence that exposes the implant, revision surgery, rupture of the implant, seroma (a pocket of clear serous fluid), capsular contracture, asymmetry of the corrected area, shifting of the implant, surgical over-correction, injury to the sciatic nerve, and paresthesia (tingling skin). The medical complications possible to a liposclupture buttocks augmentation include the bodily resorption of some of the injected adipose fat, asymmetric contour of the corrected body area, an irregular contour to the body, seroma, abscess (pus enclosed by inflamed tissue), cellulitis (subcutaneous connective-tissue inflammation), and paresthesia.|$|E
40|$|Skin {{and soft}} tissue infections that usually follow minor {{traumatic}} events or surgical procedures {{are caused by}} {{a wide spectrum of}} bacteria. We describe a soft tissue infection caused by a Mycobacterium chelonae in an immunocompetent patient who underwent <b>liposculpture</b> and lipofilling of the gluteal-trochanteric region, emphasizing the importance of clinical suspicion and effective treatment of infection...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{interaction}} of ultrasonic <b>liposculpture</b> with fat tissue. The surgical technique is well established and its clinical effects are satisfactory. However, the in vivo effects on adipose tissue remain to be determined. Previous studies have shown that ultrasound waves break fat cells. The {{purpose of this study was}} to ascertain whether ultrasound waves can cause the release of fatty acids from the molecular structure of triglycerides. A double-blind study was designed with samples obtained from traditional and ultrasonic liposuction of an equivalent area in the same patient. Samples were checked for triglycerides and for free fatty acids. Triglyceride values were always higher in the sample that had undergone ultrasonic procedure. No significant differences were observed between the free fatty acid chromatograms of the two kinds of samples analyzed. Data showed that no changes occurred in the triglyceride molecule when using ultrasound waves in the experimental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación SCOPUSBackground This study {{aimed to}} design a new patientreported outcome (PRO) {{instrument}} to measure patient satisfaction after body-contouring procedures such as <b>liposculpture,</b> abdominoplasty, body-lift, thigh-lift, and arm-lift. Methods Phase 1 a involved an extensive literature review, 16 in-depth patient interviews, and expert focus groups with 5 plastic surgeons to develop a conceptual framework for the outcomes deemed important for body image and preliminary PRO instruments. In phase 1 b, the preliminary instrument was tested with a second independent sample of 29 patients with whom simple interviews were additionally performed. In the second sample, scale reliability was calculated. Results In phase 1 a, the domains identified for the conceptual framework included clothing and body image, sexual and affective life, self-image and self-esteem, social relationships, and physical symptoms. In phase 1 b, the scale internal consistency was 91. 5 %. Conclusions When psychometric evaluation is completed, the Body-Shape-Related Quality of Life instrument and its subscales will provide a reliable tool for plastic surgeons, researchers, and patients to use in measuring the impact and effectiveness of body-contouring procedures from the patient’s perspective.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the author's technique {{and experience in}} the treatment of the flaccid "unhappy buttock" form with his surgical procedure of buttock lift by suture, without incision scars. The author first presented this new operation technique on a national level at the 2 nd Annual Meeting of the National Bulgarian Society for Aesthetic Surgery and Aesthetic Medicine in Sofia on March 18, 1994 [1] and internationally at many scientific meetings over the world [2, 3, 4 …]. The result is a visual change in the buttock position to a higher one, which elongates the lower limbs and changes the proportions between lower and upper half of the body. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe a mini-invasive procedure of beautification of the buttock form without scars by creating a lifting effect on the buttock's subcutaneous tissue, using a suture that takes the inferiorly positioned deep fibrose tissue and fixes it upwards to the sacro-cutaneous fascia, discovered by the author. Aesthetic and technical considerations required properly sculpting the buttocks into a higher position, demonstrating nicely rounded form. Preoperative shape is discussed and patient evaluations, operative techniques, postoperative management and results after 4 years of experience are emphasized. 1032 female patients, and 26 male patients aged 18 - 62 years, with ptosis and cellulite on the buttocks were treated since 1993 on an outpatient basis by the "Serdev suture technique without visible scars". Important instrumentarium is a long, curved, elastic needle and Polycon semi-elastic Bulgarian antimicrobial polycaproamide long term (in 2 years) absorbable surgical threads Polycon, produced in Bulgaria. This operation has been performed either alone or after ultrasonic assisted <b>liposculpture</b> (UAL) that reduces the amount of fat and heaviness. All patients reported a high degree of satisfaction. A stable improvement in the buttock position and form was observed for the period described. In the postoperative period the complication rate was minimal and resolved in the first 4 - 5 days post operative period. The skin puncture in the perianal zone makes antibiotic prophylaxis obligatory as well as a strict follow up for the first 7 days. Some pain in the sitting position was observed for at least 5 to 10 days, but all other social and professional duties and activities were possible. This outpatient procedure is effective in the correction of buttock laxity and ptosis and creates a new form, universally accepted as "happy buttocks". </p...|$|E
