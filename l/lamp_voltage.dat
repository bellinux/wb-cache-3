25|$|A dimmer is {{a device}} used to vary the average voltage applied to an instrument's lamp. The {{brightness}} of a lamp {{is proportional to}} its electric current, {{which in turn is}} proportional to the applied <b>lamp</b> <b>voltage.</b> When the applied voltage is decreased, a lamp's electric current will also decrease, thus reducing the light output from the lamp (dimming it). Conversely, a higher voltage will cause higher lamp current and increased (brighter) light output. Dimmers are frequently found in large enclosures called racks or dimmer racks that draw significant three-phase power. They are often removable modules that range from 20-ampere, 2.4-kilowatt to 100-ampere units.|$|E

The microprocessor controller keeps the motor speed within 2% of that chosen through feedback from an alternating black and silver circle {{on the bottom of}} the turntable. The unit is designed to accept voltages ranging from 11 to 30 Volts.

Responses were received from 120 experts. The opinions of experts varied widely, both between continents and within continents. The most frequent recommendation for the test voltage under the current electrical system was 12. 8 V in North America and 12. 0 V in Europe and Asia, but values between 12. 0 and 13. 5 V found a substantial amount of support on all I continents.

40|$|Metal¿halide lamps {{have high}} efficiencies. These lamps often contain rare-earth {{additives}} (in our case dysprosium iodide) which radiate very efficiently in the visible spectrum. Colour separation {{is a problem}} in these lamps; this is caused by axial segregation of these additives as a result of diffusion and convection. To vary the effect of convection, parabolic flights were performed with micro-gravity (0 g) and hyper-gravity (∼ 1. 8 g) phases. During these flights, the atomic dysprosium density was measured by means of laser absorption spectroscopy. In addition, the <b>lamp</b> <b>voltage,</b> which is strongly influenced by the total amount of Dy in the lamp, was measured. The Dy density and axial segregation are dependent on the gravity.

5000|$|Breakdown voltage is a {{characteristic}} of an insulator that defines the maximum voltage difference {{that can be applied}} across the material before the insulator conducts.

2500|$|The [...] "emission mix" [...] on {{the lamp}} filaments/cathodes is {{required}} to enable electrons to pass into the gas via thermionic emission at the <b>lamp</b> operating <b>voltages</b> used. The mix is slowly sputtered off by bombardment with electrons and mercury ions during operation, but a larger amount is sputtered off each time the lamp is started with cold cathodes. The method of starting the lamp has {{a significant impact on}} this. Lamps operated for typically less than 3 hours each switch-on will normally run out of the emission mix before other parts of the lamp fail. The sputtered emission mix forms the dark marks at the lamp ends seen in old lamps. When all the emission mix is gone, the cathode cannot pass sufficient electrons into the gas fill to maintain the gas discharge at the designed <b>lamp</b> operating <b>voltage.</b> Ideally, the control gear should shut down the lamp when this happens. However, some control gear will provide sufficient increased voltage to continue operating the lamp in cold cathode mode, which will cause overheating of the lamp end and rapid disintegration of the electrodes (filament goes open-circuit) and filament support wires until they are completely gone or the glass cracks, destroying the low pressure gas fill and stopping the gas discharge.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- A new {{instrument}} {{for the evaluation}} of disturbances caused by variations in <b>lamp</b> <b>voltage</b> (light flicker) is proposed, based on light intensity measurements.

40|$|Background : The {{presence}} of antibiotics in water sources indicates inadequacy of conventional treatment processes for antibiotics removal. The {{objective of the}} present study is to investigate the effectiveness of the advanced oxidation process, UV/H 2 O 2, in the removal of ceftriaxone from an aqueous solution on a laboratory scale. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was conducted on a lab scale in a reactor with a capacity of 5800 ml. Aqueous solutions containing ceftriaxone with concentrations of 9, 18, and 27 mg/l were produced. The effect of different variables including the initial concentrations of the antibiotic, pH, retention time, different <b>lamp</b> <b>voltages,</b> and H 2 O 2 concentrations were investigated. The ceftriaxone concentrations were measured using HPLC method. Results: The results of the study showed that the UV/H 2 O 2 method is able to remove 75 % of a 9 mg/l concentration of ceftriaxone from an aqueous solution in 3 hours. The removal rates for ceftriaxone are affected by parameters such as pH, the initial concentration of ceftriaxone, the concentration of H 2 O 2 and the intensity of UV radiations. Acidic pH (pH= 3), low concentrations of ceftriaxone (9 mg/l), high H 2 O 2 concentrations (15 mg/l) and higher radiation levels (36 Watt) resulted in higher removal rates. Conclusion: The advanced oxidation method UV/ H 2 O 2 is able to effectively remove ceftriaxone from aqueous solutions under proper environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the behavior of}} power supplies for cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) employing piezoelectric transformers (PTs). It has been demonstrated that the non-linear equivalent lamp resistance interacts with the PT that behaves like a high-Q resonant circuit, giving rise to instabilities in the audible frequency range [Spiazzi, G. et al. 2004]. Moreover, when the PTs are driven by a voltage-fed inverter and its DC supply voltage is used to control the <b>lamp</b> <b>voltage,</b> {{the relation between the}} control variable and the lamp current can become nonmonotonic, depending also on the coupling network used between the inverter and the PT.
