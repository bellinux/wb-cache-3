40|$|Abstract: Printed {{circuit boards}} (PCBs) are being {{widely used in}} the {{electronic}} packages. Solder joints are often used to interconnect chip resistors and other components onto PCBs. The defects of solder joints will increase quality costs and deteriorate performance. If solder joints can’t be located accuracy, AOI system will not inspect solder joints at the right place of solder joints and must lead to misjudgement. Especially, the misjudgement will increase dramatically under uncertain noise disturbance to micro-size solder joints due to inaccuracy location. In this work, an eliminating uncertain noise method is proposed and a robust location algorithm for PCB’s solder joints is present. Firstly, some location windows are set based on technology parameters of chip and its solder joints, and solder joints feature image is obtained from it solder joint image based on series of image pre-processing. Secondly, the <b>layout</b> <b>frame</b> outside solder joints, which {{is viewed as a}} noise disturbance to location, is extracted as a binary image and is projected to X axis and Y axis, then the smaller region, which include solder joints but no the <b>layout</b> <b>frame,</b> is obtained based on calculating the sum features function of <b>layout</b> <b>frame.</b> Thirdly, the blob feature image of solder joints is extracted from its gray images of red, green, blue layers; it may have some noise blob around solder joints feature, then an evaluation function is develop to judge blob, which maybe belongs to noise or solder joints feature, and only solder joints feature are remained. Fourthly, with the help of setting solder joints windows, the integrated projection method is developed to locate solder joints. Finally, the proposed location method is compared with other two algorithms in the experiment. Experiment’s result illustrates that the smaller the solder joint size, the better location accuracy and efficiency is obtained than other two mothers. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{represents}} a single pole single through (SPST) analog switch designed using VLSI. An SPST switch has a sin-gle pole and can connect only one line to other network.

At first {{the layout of the}} switch has been developed whose output is then fed to a refresh circuit. The refresh circuit is used to reshape the sig-nal as it distorted due to switching effect. The output of the refresh circuit is found both in inverted and non-inverted form. A pad frame is designed in which the original circuit is imported to make a 10 pin integrated circuit (IC).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} using texture mapping with mip-mapping to render a VLSI layout. Texture mapping is used to save already rasterized areas of the <b>layout</b> from <b>frame</b> to frame, and {{to take advantage of}} any hardware accelerated capabilities of the host platform. Mipmapping is used to select which textures to display so that the amount of information sent to the display is bounded, and the image rendered on the display is filtered correctly. Ad-ditionally, two caching schemes are employed. The first, used to bound memory consumption, is a general purpose cache that holds textures spatially close to the user's current viewpoint. The second, used to speed up the rendering process, is a cache of heavily used sub-designs that are precomputed so rasterization on the fly is not necessary. An experimental implementation shows that real-time navigation can be achieved on arbitrarily large designs. Results also show how this technique ensures that image quality does not degrade as the number of polygons drawn increases, avoiding the aliasing artifacts common in other layout systems...|$|R
