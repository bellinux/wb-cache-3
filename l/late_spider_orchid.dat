5000|$|Cheriton Hill was the {{location}} of the discovery of the <b>Late</b> <b>Spider</b> <b>orchid</b> in the 19th century. At one point the number of known plants at Folkestone/Cheriton declined to just six, but with improved management of the chalk grassland by Eurotunnel and the [...] White Cliffs Countryside Project, the population is now much healthier, estimated in 2008 to be 165 plants, some 30% of the UK population.|$|E
50|$|The nationally rare <b>late</b> <b>spider</b> <b>orchid</b> (Ophrys fuciflora) {{is limited}} within the British Isles to chalk {{grassland}} between Folkestone and Wye. One {{of the two}} native British sites for the nationally rare monkey orchid (Orchis simia) is on the North Downs. The nationally scarce man orchid (Orchis anthropophora) is not uncommon on chalk grassland on the Downs in Surrey and Kent. Other scarce plant species such as early gentian (Gentiana anglica), dwarf milkwort (Polygala amarella) and bedstraw broomrape (Orobanche caryophyllacea) also occur on chalk grassland in the North Downs.|$|E
50|$|Folkestone Downs {{is one of}} {{the largest}} areas of {{unimproved}} chalk downland in Kent. The extensive flora includes many typical species found in chalk grassland including horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa), squinancywort (Asperula cynanchica) and small scabious, as well as scarce species such as bedstraw broomrape (Orobanche caryophyllacea). Many species of orchid grow on the downs notably the nationally rare <b>late</b> <b>spider</b> <b>orchid</b> (Ophrys fuciflora) as well as the nationally scarce early spider orchid (Ophrys sphegodes) and man orchid (Aceras anthropophorum). The nationally scarce burnt orchid (Neotinea ustulata) has also been recorded in the past. Folkestone Downs is also notable for its extensive lichen flora.|$|E

50|$|The {{dominant}} {{chalk grassland}} community at Park Gate Down is CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum. However, fine, less vigorous grasses are also common such as sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina). The reserve supports a rich flora including many calcicoles such as common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), small scabious (Scabiosa columbaria) and marjoram (Origanum vulgare). Notable species include slender bedstraw (Galium pumilum), adder's tongue (Ophioglossum), horseshoe Vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) and columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris).Fourteen species of orchid {{are known to}} grow at the reserve {{including some of the}} UK's rarest species. Park Gate Down is one of only three sites in the UK for the nationally rare monkey orchid (Ochis simia). The orchid was introduced to the site during the twentieth century from another Kentish site and has since flourished with over 100 plants. Park Gate Down also supports the nationally rare <b>late</b> <b>spider</b> <b>orchid</b> (Ophrys fuciflora) that in the UK is limited to the North Downs in East Kent as well as the nationally scarce lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) and musk orchid (Herminium monorchis) of which 72 were counted in 2007.|$|E
40|$|Many {{valuable}} and threatened taxons {{of the family}} Orchidaceae, including the representatives of genus Ophrys, are disappearing from semi-natural grasslands because of the advancing secondary succession. Conservation and restoration of calcareous grasslands rich in species at the Devínska Kobyla Mt. requires appropriate interventions after the traditional forms of management will be finished. Bromus erectus is the dominant species at the Devínska Kobyla Mt., hence {{it is necessary to}} choose adequate intervention aim of which would be the reduced dominance of this species. Restoration of extensive sheep grazing in this calcareous grassland is not realistic. This is the reason why it is proposed to mow every year or at least every two years (and remove the mown mass) the growths where the taxons of genus Ophrys occur. The best moment for mowing is after maturation of the Orchid Genus Ophrys seeds. With regard to the phenologic cycles of the species concerned, the following mowing terms are proposed: end of June for the locality with occurrence of Early Spider Orchid (Ophrys sphegodes), July for localities with occurrence of <b>Late</b> <b>Spider</b> <b>Orchid</b> (O. holosericea) and Fly Orchid (O. insectifera). The locality with Bee Orchid (Ophrys apifera) does not require mowing due to shallow soil (Lithosol) and vegetation that is close to Poo badensis-Festucetum pallentis association. If mowing cannot be used on the particular dates, it is proposed to mow the growths with the dominating species Bromus erectus in October. The study presents the example how the number of flowering Early Spider Orchid (Ophrys sphegodes) individuals increased after the locality was mown by the employees of the State Nature Conservation in autumn 2004. Their number more than quadrupled in 2005...|$|E
