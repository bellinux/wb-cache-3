40|$|A method {{increasingly}} used to uniquely identify objects (be they pieces of <b>luggage,</b> <b>transported</b> goods or inventory items in shops and warehouses), is Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID). One {{of the most}} important components of RFID systems is the antenna and its design is critical to the utility of such tracking systems. Design engineers have traditionally constructed small antennas using their knowledge and intuition, as there is no simple analytical solution relating antenna structure to performance. This, however, does not guarantee optimal results, particularly for larger, more complex antennas. The problem is ideally suited to automated methods of optimisation. This chapter presents an overview of the automatic design of antennas using the meta-heuristic known as Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO). Apart from a description of the necessary mechanics ACO needs to effectively solve this problem, a novel local search refinement operator and a multi-objective version of the problem are also described. The latter is used to optimise both antenna efficiency and resonant frequency. Computational results for a range of antenna sizes show that ACO is a very effective design tool for RFID antennas.

50|$|Zielona Gora Airport has two {{passengers}} terminals (T1 and T2), {{of which}} only Terminal T2 is fully functional and has large capacity. The airport possesses a passenger terminal T1 of a modest capacity of 150,000 passengers yearly. This is a medium-sized passenger terminal T1 used for deparatures. Terminal T1 {{was built in}} 1977 and is currently being used for departures (passport control and boarding). In 2015, a new passenger terminal (arrivals hall T2) was constructed, increasing the airport capacity to serve passenger traffic. Terminal T2 is used for arrivals and charter services. There is no check-in or any other airport services in Terminal T2. The old terminal, called Terminal T1, has 2 check-in desks, a basic <b>luggage</b> <b>transport</b> and sorting facility and a medium-sized departure area with 1 or 2 gates.

Comprehensive {{research in the field}} of the surface movement and scheduling of aircraft has led to technology and support systems that are in place at various airports worldwide. In contrast the coordination and optimisation of service vehicles on the aprons were investigated only insignificantly. Within two projects at the Airport Research Facility Hamburg a concept for managing the process of the <b>luggage</b> <b>transport</b> to and from the aircraft was developed. The concept is based on experiences from A-SMGCS research and implements a complete data link process as a replacement of the actual voice solution. Furthermore a first prototype of a support system was developed, implemented and technically tested at the airport. Live connection to operational systems like A-SMGCS and Airport database enabled the use of real data and first shadow mode trials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, {{automatic}} identification of components {{is one of}} the most important research fields for researchers and scientists in different arenas. RFID Technology {{is one of the}} technologies widely used in this arena. For this purpose, the present research has dealt with this technology as a means of tracking and identifying baggage automatically in a traffic control system in an airport. The specification of RFID Technology helps distinguish between man and objects with high precision. This paper makes use of this capability for identifying and tracking baggage in an airport and plane in order to increase the efficiency of <b>luggage</b> <b>transport</b> system, which, as a result, increases the precision of the system, decreases the damages arising from the missing of the luggage and its wrong transport and decreases the errors of the manpower. In order to obtain an intelligent system and automatically identify objects, a unique number is required for tracking and control each object. This research has defined a new model with four choices (that is, airline name, flight number, nature of tag and chair number) in order to develop a unique identity number. This number is stored in the tag memory. With such tags passing through RFID Readers embedded at different places including the conveyor belt or at the gates, passengers ’ luggage may be easily tracked. This way, any problem can be easily dealt with. Thanks to its adaptability, this technology can be easily used in computerized network for sending and receiving information; and an information bank has also been used to instantaneously analyze and study the information...|$|E

In the late 20th-century, with proliferation of official and unofficial long distance walking routes, walkers now are more likely to follow a long distance way, than to plan their own walking tour. Such tours are also organized by commercial companies, and can have a professional guide, or are self-guided; in these commercially organized tours, <b>luggage</b> is often <b>transported</b> between accommodation stops.|$|R
