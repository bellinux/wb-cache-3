50|$|Major {{oxidative}} {{degradation products}} of MDEA include monoethanol amine (MEA), methyl-aminoethanol (MAE), diethanolamine (DEA), amino acids bicine, glycine and hydroxyethyl sarcosine (HES), formyl amides of MAE and DEA, ammonia, and stable salts formate, glycolate, acetate, and oxalate. In an industrial plan that utilizes MDEA, oxidative degradation {{is most likely}} to shift to the cross exchanger where temperatures are greater than 70 °C. Higher temperatures and higher CO2 loading accelerate the rate of degradation, resulting in an increase of alkalinity loss as well as total formate production. While MDEA is more resistant to degradation as a standalone compared to MEA, MDEA is preferentially degraded when in an MDEA/MEA blend. Because of the formation of DEA and MAE, which could form nitroso-compounds or diethylnitrosamine and diethylnitraine, the blend could potentially have an adverse impact in terms of atmospheric admissions. In the Boundary Dam plant, emissions increased when CO2 loading of <b>lean</b> <b>amine</b> increased for the blend and MEA. However, decreasing the lean loading increases the reboiler heat duty, which results in an obvious tradeoff between emissions and heat duty or energy costs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aqueous {{absorption}} {{technology is}} one of the most feasible options for post combustion CO 2 capture. High energy requirement is the main problem for this technology. Intercooling is possibly one of the strategies that can reduce the energy consumption in some cases. It is used in other industries like oil refineries and has a promising effect on energy use reduction. However, the effect may depend on the absorbent system used and the configuration of the process. In this study, the effect of intercooling is investigated for monoethanolamine (MEA) and diethanolamine (DEA). The results show that the best location for intercooling, based on minimizing energy requirement per kg of CO 2 captured is about 1 / 4 th to 1 / 5 th of the height of the column from the bottom. The effect of different parameters like <b>lean</b> loading, <b>amine</b> concentration, cooling temperature, etc is investigated in this study. The results for MEA and DEA are compared to see the effect of solvent on intercooling performance...|$|R

30|$|Meanwhile, {{this work}} {{presents}} {{the influence of}} three operating parameters in energy savings, namely, amine concentration, stripper pressure, and loading of <b>lean</b> <b>amine</b> solvent. The study of amine concentration and lean loading in conventional process shows that the optimal lean loading increases with MEA concentration rising, but it basically keeps constant in DEA. Moreover, reboiler duty is more sensitive to lean loading in processes using MEA than DEA. Both for MEA and DEA, higher pressure is beneficial to reducing total energy consumption {{in all of the}} processes. The effect of lean solvent loading on process modifications for MEA and DEA is pretty different, and the minimum point of total equivalent work also depends on amine type and process. RSS or the variant of RSS are more efficient to DEA, and LVC and ICA is more favourable to MEA. Further work on blended amines weill be carried out latter.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} heat {{distribution}} or inter-heating {{on the total}} energy requirement for CO 2 stripping is investigated. Here we look at retrofit design of an existing column. It means the height and diameter of the stripper is given. The results show that inter-heating can have both negative and positive effects on the total energy requirement. If only one heat source at constant temperature exist, the inter-heating will increase the total energy requirement. If there are other heat sources at different temperatures, inter-heating can be beneficial. It depends on the energy price of the different heat sources and the temperature profile of the column. If there are some hot streams available to utilize the heat in the inter-heater, the total energy requirement will decrease.

40|$|There {{have been}} a lot of {{investigations}} on acid gas removal using absorption process in which different types of solvents including physical solvents, chemical solvents and hybrid solvents are used. One of these chemical solvents is a kind of tertiary amine called MDEA. The main goal of this master thesis is modeling an acid gas removal plant using MDEA. At first, a brief explanation about Natural gas chain in Norwegian continental shelf is given, then a bibliographical research was made regarding acid gas removal processes; in addition, some criteria for selection of proper acid gases removal process are discussed. Asg&# 229;rd B has an offshore absorption unit to remove selective acid gas using FLEXORB- a solvent which is used to remove selectively H 2 S. Another solvent that can be used in the absorption process to remove H 2 S selectively is MDEA. In this project, MDEA is replaced with FLEXORB to observe the solvent behavior from different angles in the Asg&# 229;rd B acid gas removal unit. For this purpose, a simulation of the process has been done in which MDEA was used as a solvent and the obtained results will be discussed. The simulation of this plant is designed based on the data collected from Statoil. Unisim software has been chosen to simulate amine based acid gas removal unit. It has also been tried to optimize the process. To do so, heat exchanger network was designed using Pinch Analysis method and the required external energy has been calculated. It helps to use heat flows of the streams in the process in order not to waste the energy. Finally, it is concluded that required recycled flow rate of MDEA is much more than FLEXORB and consequently, the required make up water for MDEA solvent will be more than required water in the process using FLEXORB. Furthermore, FLEXORB acts more selectively than MDEA in the case of H 2 S removal. Changing different parameters in the simulation shows that (i) inlet <b>lean</b> <b>amine</b> temperature entering the absorber does not affect the absorption process, (ii) increasing of heat duty in the reboiler of regenerator decreases acid gases in the treated gas, (iii) <b>lean</b> <b>amine</b> flow rate with an acceptable loading has a direct effect on the product quality. (iv) increase of trays in the absorber leads to remove bulk CO 2. </p...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the largest}} {{expenses}} in CO 2 capture is the transport and disposal of waste from the amine reclaimer, and top up of fresh amine KIP. The main {{reason for this is}} because the waste stream contains quite large amounts of fresh amine, and the sheer volume of waste. If amount of MEA in waste could be reduced, both the volume of waste would be reduced, which lowers the transport and disposal cost, and the amount of amine for top up would be reduced. In other words, the total operational cost of the system could be considerably lowered. This study investigated the possibility of reducing the amine (MEA) in the waste stream by looking at a two stage reclaiming process. A model based on the work done by Linn Christine Loe Haaversen was developed to include several new features, including a second stage. This model was the basis of cost optimization. The cost optimization took several factors into account. The cost of waste transportation and handling, top up amine cost, cost of compressing low pressure <b>lean</b> <b>amine</b> to the pressure of main system and heat input to reclaimer vessels all were included the objective function subject to minimization. The unconstrained variables in this optimization were heat entered into both stages, and pressure in second stage. From the results of the optimization, a second low pressure stage is beneficiary from an operating cost perspective. A cost minimum was detected where 63. 9...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} a theoretical {{investigation of the}} simultaneous absorption of CO 2 and H 2 S into aqueous solutions of MDEA and DEA. In this process the acid components react with the basic alkanolamine solution via an exothermic, reversible reaction in a gas/liquid absorber. The use of amine solvents for gas sweetening has been investigated using process simulation programs called HYSYS and ASPEN. We use Electrolyte NRTL and Amine Package and Amines (experimental) equation of state. The effects of temperature and circulation rate and amine concentration and packed column and murphree efficiency on the rate of absorption were studied. When <b>lean</b> <b>amine</b> flow and concentration increase, CO 2 and H 2 S absorption increase too. With the improvement of inlet amine temperature in absorber, CO 2 and H 2 S penetrate to upper stages of absorber and absorption of acid gases in absorber decreases. The CO 2 concentration in the clean gas can be greatly influenced by the packing height, whereas for the H 2 S concentration in the clean gas the packing height plays a minor role. HYSYS software can not estimate murphree efficiency correctly and it applies the same contributions in all diagrams for HYSYS software. By improvement in murphree efficiency, maximum temperature of absorber decrease {{and the location of}} reaction transfer to the stages of bottoms absorber and the absorption of acid gases increase.

40|$|AbstractA novel amine capture {{technology}} for CO 2 emissions {{has been developed}} by Huaneng/Xi’an Thermal Power Research Institute. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), {{on behalf of the}} U. S. -China Clean Energy Research Center, has evaluated the technology using location-specific economic parameters to reflect power generation loss from a coal-fired power generation plant due to amine regeneration, the necessary utility constraints and investment, and the constraints of the location. The conceptual design used for cost estimates consists of a pre-absorption cooler (cooling by injection of water directly into the flue gas was not feasible because of 100 % flue gas humidity post-flue gas desulfurizer), an absorber with a spray stage to minimize evaporative amine losses; an economizing heat exchanger and trim heaters and coolers: a stripper with a reboiler and condenser to recover absorbed CO 2; a five-stage CO 2 compression train with intercooling and water removal; and an ion exchange process to control build-up of heat-stable salts by treating a bleed stream from the <b>lean</b> <b>amine</b> stream. We conclude that Huaneng's novel amine composition, because of the use of hindered and tertiary amines, has a lower heat of regeneration and hence reduces the power generation penalty. Further, we assess that the hindered and tertiary amines are less susceptible to thermal and oxidative degradation, although they are still susceptible to degradation by reaction with CO 2. We estimate the reduced power generation penalty and reduced solvent degradation gives a modest but tangible cost advantage relative to 30 % MEA. Among the location-specific constraints we have identified are: limited ability to cool incoming flue gas by water injection because of high humidity; and poor soil conditions that would require extensive civil engineering prior to plant construction. These differences we assess will increase the cost of implementing an amine-based capture technology over costs based on assumed greenfield construction...|$|E
40|$|The main {{contribution}} of this thesis is conceptual design consideration {{to improve the}} CO 2 capture in absorption/stripping process. In the first stage the conventional configuration of capture plant is optimized. The important parameters for optimization are absorber and stripper height, rich and lean loading, stripper pressure and temperature. The intercooling studies showed that intercooling {{can be an effective}} strategy to reduce the energy requirement of the capture plant. The theoretical best place for intercooling is defined about 1 / 4 th of the column height from the bottom. Intercooling studies are done for two solvents, MEA and DEA. The effects of different parameters like lean loading, amine concentration, cooling temperature, <b>lean</b> <b>amine</b> temperature are investigated in chapter 2. In chapter 3 the effect of heat distribution or inter-heating on the total energy requirement for CO 2 stripping is investigated. The results show that inter-heating can have both negative and positive effects on the total energy requirement. If only one heat source at constant temperature exist, the inter-heating will increase the total energy requirement. If there are other heat sources at different temperatures, inter-heating is maybe beneficial. It depends on the energy price of the different heat sources and the temperature profile of the column. If some energy utilizes from hot process streams in the inter-heater, it can reduce the energy requirement. As a case study, utilizing heat from <b>lean</b> <b>amine</b> in the inter-heater is investigated. The simulation results show a saving up to 6. 4 and 11. 3 percent by one and two inter-heater respectively. In chapter 4 a techno-economic study is given for five different configurations for post combustion CO 2 capture of a flue gas with about 12 percent CO 2 on wet basis, produced by a 150 MW coal power plant. These are the conventional configuration as a benchmark, splitstream, multi-pressure stripper, vapor recompression and compressor integration. Among these, the vapor recompression is the best configuration because it had the lowest total capture cost and CO 2 avoided cost. The split-stream configuration with cooling of semi-lean amine is the second best. In chapter 5, a self-optimizing concept control structure is designed for a post-combustion CO 2 capturing plant. The focus of this work is to control of the plant with the aim of staying close to the optimal operating conditions. The cost function to be minimized is the energy demand of the plant. Firstly we define the degree of freedom and next we look for selfoptimizing variables for the remaining unconstrained variables. We found the temperature close to the top (tray no. 4) of the stripper to be a good CV for the remaining unconstrained degree of freedom. To validate the proposed structure, dynamic simulation is done and performance of the control structure is tested. The dynamic behavior of the split-stream and the vapor recompression configurations are investigated, and the plant responses are compared with the conventional configuration as a benchmark. All process configurations are operationally feasible with the proposed control configuration. From these case studies we could conclude that the conventional configuration has the best dynamic behavior and is the most stable one. The vapor recompression configuration can handle disturbances better than the split-stream configuration. Finally, a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant integrated to a chemical solvent absorber/stripping capture plant is investigated. The power plant capacity is about 430 MW. The capture ratio is 90 % and the captured CO 2 compressed to 110 bar. The study is done at both full load and part load conditions. CO 2 capture causes 7. 5 % reduction in the power plant net efficiency. 4. 6 % of energy penalty is related to the steam extraction and 2. 9 % is related to electricity consumption. The integration of the power plant with the compression section of the capture plant for preheating the water to the HRSG cannot improve the net plant efficiency. In the part load investigation, results showed the net efficiency of the variable IGVs gas turbine is about 6. 2 % higher than the efficiency of the constant IGVs gas turbine at 50 % load. Also the power plant with the throttled valve configuration for steam extraction has a better performance than the sliding configuration steam extraction.

40|$|Over 60 % of Iranian {{natural gases}} are {{contaminated}} with hydrogen sulfide or other sulfur compounds. Khangiran refinery which receives around 50  MMSCMD sour gas with 3. 35  mol% H 2 S as its GTU feed, produces around 45 % of Iranian sulfur production. Three {{of the four}} existing sulfur recovery units (SRU’s) are initially installed more than 3  decades ago. Such relatively old Claus units with no tail gas clean up facility have usually sulfur recovery efficiencies as low as 90 %, due to the low H 2 S content of the acid gas stream entering SRU process. Eliminating impurities and contaminants such as carbon dioxide form SRU feed stream via proper acid gas enrichment (AGE) process can effectively elevate the Claus combustion chamber temperature and consequently increase the overall sulfur recovery efficiency of the entire SRU process, to achieve more cleaner (SO 2 free) air and higher purity product (with brighter color). Three different enrichment schemes are compared together and {{the most effective and}} optimal scheme was selected based on their overall sulfur recovery efficiencies. Coupled use of Aspen HYSYS and Promax software was employed to simulate the entire GTU + enrichment section and SRU processes. It is shown that the third scheme can successfully enrich H 2 S in the acid gas stream from its original value of 0. 335 (mole fraction) to more than 0. 70. The optimal values of recycled acid gas split ratio, recycled <b>lean</b> <b>amine</b> split ratio and enrichment tower pressure for this scheme are found to be around 0. 8, 0. 14 and 60  psia, respectively. To further reduce the sulfur dioxide emission of the entire refining process, two scenarios of acid gas or air preheats are investigated when either of them is used simultaneously with the third enrichment scheme. The maximum overall sulfur recovery efficiency and highest combustion chamber temperature is slightly higher for acid gas preheats but air preheat is more favorable because it is more benign. To the best of our knowledge, optimization of the entire GTU + enrichment section and SRU processes has not been addressed previously...|$|E
