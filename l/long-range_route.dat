40|$|Factors {{affecting}} {{the development of}} a new generation of high-speed (supersonic/hypersonic) transports are reviewed. Market projections of growth on <b>long-range</b> <b>routes</b> indicate a potential need for faster transport aircraft by the turn of the century. A review of NASA-sponsored studies shows how both market forces and technology combine to define mission performance and vehicle design constraints. The vehicle worth and price projected for a given vehicle are shown to relate to an assumed technology level. Preliminary results from an initial set of vehicle concepts lead to the conclusion that currently projected technology will need to be enhanced with increased research to meet the first market window around the year 2000...|$|R

50|$|Following an {{unsuccessful}} {{proposal for the}} U.S. Air Force's CX-HLS (Heavy Logistics System) in 1965, Douglas Aircraft began design studies based on its CX-HLS design. In 1966, American Airlines offered a specification to manufacturers for a widebody aircraft smaller than the Boeing 747 but capable of flying similar <b>long-range</b> <b>routes</b> from airports with shorter runways. The DC-10 became McDonnell Douglas's first commercial airliner after the merger between McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and Douglas Aircraft Company in 1967. An early DC-10 design proposal was for a four-engine double-deck wide-body jet airliner with a maximum seating capacity of 550 passengers similar in length of a DC-8.

50|$|With the U.S. {{breaking}} relations (in January 1961) and {{the imposition}} of a total U.S. embargo on Cuba on 7 February 1962 (beyond the partial one imposed in October 1960), Cubana turned to the Soviet Union to obtain new aircraft. Although the Bristol Britannias were kept in service for many years, the airline's Viscounts (VV-755) and Super Viscounts (VV-818) were sold in 1961 and 1962 to other carriers (Cunard Eagle, Trans-Australia, and South African Airways). The first Soviet-built aircraft type delivered was the twin-engine, piston-prop Ilyushin IL-14 in late 1961. Soon after, Ilyushin IL-18 four-engine turboprops were delivered, and began to be used in Cubana's domestic services. They were followed by the twin-engine Antonov AN-24 and AN-26, and the four-engine AN-12, all of them turboprops. The AN-26s and AN-12s, both freighters, helped sustain and expand Cubana's cargo operations on short- and <b>long-range</b> <b>routes.</b> These aircraft replaced all of Cubana's Viscounts, Super Viscounts and U.S.-built aircraft.

25|$|The 1980s saw {{expanded}} {{services to}} United States, Canada, and additional European cities with Madrid {{becoming the first}} Hispanic city to be served by SIA. Boeing 747-300s were leased and introduced into the SIA fleet in the early 1980s and named 'Big Tops'. The 747-300s replaced the 747-200s on all trans-pacific routes {{as well as the}} prime European destinations. Again a short term affair was begun with a few Boeing 757s later followed by the addition of Airbus A310s and Airbus A300s The A310s became the Asian regional workhorse of the fleet, with the small A310-200 fleet serving until the late 1990s, and the much larger A310-300 fleet serving into the 2000s. In 1989, the first of 50 B747-400s was added to the fleet. The Airbus A340-300s augmented the 747-400s on <b>long-range</b> <b>routes</b> to Spain, Zurich, Copenhagen, San Francisco and cities not suitable for 747 service. Services extended to southern Africa in the 1990s when the airline began flights to Johannesburg in South Africa; Cape Town and Durban were later added.

50|$|Following more refinements, in 1979 the DC-10 Super 60 was {{proposed}} in three distinct versions like the DC-8. The DC-10-61 {{was designed to}} be a high-capacity medium-range aircraft. It would have a fuselage stretch of 40 ft over the earlier DC-10 models, enabling it to carry 390 passengers in a mixed class or 550 passengers in an all-economy layout, similar to Boeing's later 777-300 and Airbus A340-600. Like the DC-8, the series 62 {{was proposed}} for <b>long-range</b> <b>routes.</b> It would feature a more modest fuselage stretch of 26 ft, along with an increased wingspan and fuel capacity. It would be capable of carrying up to 350 passengers (mixed class) or 440 passengers (all-economy), similar to the later Boeing 777-200 or the Airbus A330-300/A340-300/500. Finally, the series 63 would have incorporated the same fuselage as the DC-10-61 as well as all the larger wing of the -62. After high-profile accidents in the 1970s, such as Turkish Airlines Flight 981 and American Airlines Flight 191, the trijet's reputation was seriously damaged by doubts regarding its structural integrity. For these reasons, and due to a downturn in the airline industry, all work on the Super 60 was stopped.|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{epidemics}} {{of severe}} acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 highlighted both short- and <b>long-range</b> transmission <b>routes,</b> i. e. between infected patients and healthcare workers, and between distant locations. With other infections such as tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox, {{the concept of}} aerosol transmission is so well accepted that isolation of such patients is the norm. With current concerns about a possible approaching influenza pandemic, the control of transmission via infectious air has become more important. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe the factors involved in: (1) the generation of an infectious aerosol, (2) the transmission of infectious droplets or droplet nuclei from this aerosol, and (3) the potential for inhalation of such droplets or droplet nuclei by a susceptible host. On this basis, recommendations are made to improve the control of aerosol-transmitted infections in hospitals {{as well as in the}} design and construction of future isolation facilities. © 2006 The Hospital Infection Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Ligand-receptor {{complexes}} are internalized by {{a variety}} of endocytic mechanisms. Some are initiated within clathrin-coated membranes, whereas others involve lipid microdomains of the plasma membrane. In neurons, where alternative targeting to short- or <b>long-range</b> trafficking <b>routes</b> underpins the differential processing of synaptic vesicle components and neurotrophin receptors, the mechanism giving access to the axonal retrograde pathway remains unknown. To investigate this sorting process, we examined the internalization of a tetanus neurotoxin fragment (TeNT H C), which shares axonal carriers with neurotrophins and their receptors. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} TeNT H C receptor, which comprises polysialogangliosides, resides in lipid microdomains. We demonstrate that TeNT H C internalization also relies on a specialized clathrin-mediated pathway, which is independent of synaptic vesicle recycling. Moreover, unlike transferrin uptake, this AP- 2 -dependent process is independent of epsin 1. These findings identify a pathway for TeNT, beginning with the binding to a lipid raft component (GD 1 b) and followed by dissociation from GD 1 b as the toxin internalizes via a clathrin-mediated mechanism using a specific subset of adaptor proteins...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether biotransport constitutes an entry route into pristine ecosystems for nonpersistent, nonvolatile xenobiotic compounds, extractable organically bound halogen in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from Alaska was determined {{before and after}} spawning migration. The major organohalogen compounds in the salmon were halogenated fatty acids, predominantly chlorinated species that accounted for up to 35 % of the extractable, organically bound chlorine (EOCl) in the fish tissues. The amount of chlorinated fatty acids in the salmon muscle decreased {{as a result of}} spawning migration. The decrease was correlated with that of triacylglycerols in the salmon muscle, indicating the chlorinated fatty acids to be mobilized and metabolized to approximately the same extent as the other fatty acids. Chlorinated fatty acids were also transferred to the maturing roe {{in a manner similar to}} that of the unchlorinated fatty acids. Lipids of the Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus), a fish resident to the spawning lake of the salmon, contained higher concentrations of chlorinated fatty acids than grayling in a lake without migratory salmon. This may reflect a food-chain transfer of the chlorinated fatty acids originating from the salmon, demonstrating a <b>long-range</b> transport <b>route</b> for this type of pollutants to pristine areas...|$|R

40|$|Inappropriate {{speed is}} a {{relevant}} concurrent factor in many traffic accidents. Moreover, in recent years, traffic accidents numbers in Spain have fallen sharply, but this reduction {{has not been}} so significant on single carriageway roads. These infrastructures have less equipment than high-capacity roads, therefore measures to reduce accidents on them should be implemented in vehicles. This article describes the development {{and analysis of the}} impact on the driver of a warning system for the safe speed on each road section in terms of geometry, the presence of traffic jams, weather conditions, type of vehicle and actual driving conditions. This system is based on an application for smartphones and includes knowledge of the vehicle position via Ground Positioning System (GPS), access to intravehicular information from onboard sensors through the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, vehicle data entry by the driver, access to roadside information (short-range communications) and access to a centralized server with information about the road in the current and following sections of the <b>route</b> (<b>long-range</b> communications). Using this information, the system calculates the safe speed, recommends the appropriate speed in advance in the following sections and provides warnings to the driver. Finally, data are sent from vehicles to a server to generate new information to disseminate to other users or to supervise drivers’ behaviour. Tests in a driving simulator have been used to define the system warnings and Human Machine Interface (HMI) and final tests have been performed on real roads in order to analyze the effect of the system on driver behavior...|$|R
40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Biologia (Biologia do Desenvolvimento), apresentada à Universidade de Lisboa através da Faculdade de Ciências, 2009 The {{mesoderm}} of the amphibian embryo forms {{from the}} equatorial {{region of the}} late blastula in response to signals derived from the vegetal hemisphere of the embryo. These signals include members of the transforming growth factor type ß (TGFß) family, including Vg 1, Activin, the nodal-related proteins Xnr 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, and derrière. Two significant characteristics of these signals are that they can act at long range and that they behave as morphogens, eliciting different responses at different concentrations. These properties {{raise the question of}} how such molecules exert their <b>long-range</b> effects: what <b>route</b> do they take to traverse a field of responding cells? As a representative of mesoderm inducing TGFß molecules, we have used mainly Activin for our experiments addressing questions about morphogen progression and signalling. Activin is a potent inducer of mesoderm and its patterning. We developed several different assays involving a fluorescently labelled form of the protein to visualize morphogen progression in tissue. In vivo detection of TGFß induced complex formation of signal transducers such as Smad 2 and Smad 4 by bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC) served as a direct read-out of morphogen function. The combination of both imaging techniques allowed us to observe morphogen passage and direct response in living cells. Our experiments suggest that in contrast to other morphogens, Activin does not pass through neighbouring cells by transcytosis, but appears to travel exclusively through the extracellular space. The number of cognate receptors presented on cell surfaces is crucial for the range of progression and signalling as it blocks ligand passage if presented in excess. Inhibition of endocytosis successfully blocks cellular uptake of Activin, but does not interfere with either signalling capacity or range. Furthermore, during our studies on Smad complex formation we made several important observations. Most interestingly, we found that the nuclear import of the Smad complex is developmentally regulated such that nuclear accumulation in response to a TGF stimulus does not occur before the start of zygotic transcription, indicating the presence of regulatory controls that impose temporal restrictions upon the nuclear import of Smad signalling complexes. Future elucidation of the molecular nature of these import controls may be particularly relevant {{to our understanding of the}} mid-blastula transition, as the onset of zygotic gene regulation may require the import of transcriptional regulators.
