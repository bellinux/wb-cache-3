5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the party}} {{attendees}} expressed displeasure that the strippers had delivered a very short performance despite being paid several hundred dollars apiece to perform. The team captain who had hired the strippers tried to convince the women to {{come back into the}} house and complete the performance. Both women came back into the house, but upon being approached by the player who had earlier held up the broomstick, again refused to perform and locked themselves in the bathroom. By this point, a number {{of the party}} guests had left, and the residents of the house, including David Evans, were asking the remaining guests to leave because they were concerned that the noise would cause neighbors to complain to police. When the strippers left the bathroom and the house for the second time, a resident <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> so they (and the guests who had left the house) could not get back in.|$|E

500|$|According to French and German prosecutors, {{the crash}} was {{deliberately}} {{caused by the}} co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz. Brice Robin said Lubitz was initially courteous to Captain Sondenheimer during {{the first part of}} the flight, then became [...] "curt" [...] when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing. Robin said when the captain returned from a probable toilet break and tried to enter the cockpit, Lubitz had <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The captain had a code to unlock the door, but the lock's code panel can be disabled from the cockpit controls. The captain requested re-entry using the intercom; he knocked and then banged on the door, but received no response. The captain then tried to break down the door. During the descent, the co-pilot did not respond to questions from air traffic control and did not transmit a distress call. Robin said contact from the Marseille air traffic control tower, the captain's attempts to break in, and Lubitz's steady breathing were audible on the cockpit voice recording. The screams of passengers in the last moments before impact were also heard on the recording.|$|E
500|$|Back in Scranton, {{the rest}} of the {{employees}} are going to be forced to work on a Saturday to record their own sales as the website's sales, which is, according to Ryan, [...] "a temporary procedure to increase the legitimacy of the website." [...] With no one eager to participate, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) decides to ask everyone to stay in the office late instead of coming in for the Saturday. They all agree to the plan, and after working until 9:00pm, they are shocked to find the parking lot gates locked. [...] Jim had forgotten to tell the security guard that they were staying late. They are unable to return to the office because Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> from the inside, and Dwight, miles away in New York, has both the spare and master keys. Jim repeatedly calls Hank the security guard (Hugh Dane). Pam accidentally injures Meredith by hitting her head with a football that was found in the parking lot. Sitting in the lobby area waiting for the security guard to arrive, the employees are clearly frustrated with Jim, and even vote by a show of hands that Andy and Angela are a better couple than Jim and Pam.|$|E

2500|$|While male {{prisoners were}} {{often used in}} single studies, so {{that the results of}} the {{experimentation}} on them would not be clouded by other variables, women were sometimes used in bacteriological or physiological experiments, sex experiments, and as the victims of sex crimes. The testimony of a unit member that served as guard graphically demonstrated this reality:"One of the former researchers I located told me that one day he had a human experiment scheduled, but there was still time to kill. So he and another unit member took the keys to the cells and opened one that housed a Chinese woman. One of the unit members raped her; the other member took the keys and opened another cell. There was a Chinese woman in there who had been used in a frostbite experiment. She had several fingers missing and her bones were black, with gangrene set in. He was about to rape her anyway, then he saw that her sex organ was festering, with pus oozing to the surface. He gave up the idea, left and <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> then later went on to his experimental work." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{their time}} with EMI Records the band {{consistently}} experienced troubles with their contract: upon their initial negotiations only {{three members of}} the group (Rowland, Archer and Geoffrey [...] "Jeff" [...] Blythe), called the [...] "nucleus", were signed to the label, which caused a stir within the group. They were also only being paid 6% of the royalties, whereas most bands receive 10–12%. This led to Rowland threatening to steal the album from the studio and hold it ransom until their pay was increased, which EMI laughed at. However, {{on the last day of}} mixing the record, while Wingfield was out of the studio to get a cup of coffee, the members of the group <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the studio, each taking a carton of magnetic tape and ran through the building to their getaway vehicle, a Morris Minor which belonged to Saunders' girlfriend, and drove to Rowland's parents' house in Birmingham. EMI demanded the tapes back but the band had already set off on their sell-out UK tour. The band gave the tapes back when EMI raised their pay to 9%, but they almost destroyed them by travelling through the London Underground, which could have demagnetized them and wiped everything.|$|E
2500|$|Shipman {{said that}} after arriving, {{she was aware of}} someone {{following}} her to an airport satellite parking area. When she got into her car, she heard running footsteps and quickly <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Nowak slapped the window and tried to open the car door, asked for a ride, then started crying. Shipman rolled down the window a couple of inches after which Nowak sprayed the pepper spray into the car. Shipman drove off to the parking lot booth where police were summoned. Several Orlando Police Department Airport Division officers arrived minutes later, with the first officer observing Nowak throwing a bag into the trash at a parking shuttle bus stop. Nowak was subsequently arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and destruction of evidence. In a handwritten request for a restraining order against Nowak after her arrest, Shipman referred to Nowak as an acquaintance of a boyfriend but did not identify Oefelein, and also claimed Nowak had been stalking her for two months. Nowak told investigators she was involved in a relationship with Oefelein which she described as being [...] "more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship". Citing evidence of elaborate planning, disguises and weapons, police recommended she be held without bail.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to England, he {{was head}} of the history {{department}} at Kelly College in Tavistock for five years, followed by fourteen years at Culham College of Education as principal lecturer and head of the history department. He was able to combine his love of cricket with his college duties by instituting the biannual cricket matches between the History Department and his village cricket team of North Moreton for whom he was wicketkeeper and captain. One regularly told story was that he conducted an interview out on the cricket square when one potential teaching student applied who was already on the books of Yorkshire Cricket Club! Unfortunately for Howat, the student did not take up the place which was presumably offered to him, but did go on to have a reasonably successful cricket career. He had an abrupt tutoring technique and once (at least) <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> when the time of his tutor group was due to start which left only one student in the room (at the magnificent mansion of Nuneham) to enjoy his didactic and engaging teaching style. Meanwhile, he undertook a research degree on [...] "the place of history in education" [...] for Exeter College, Oxford. He also turned his hand to the world of publishing, for a time being general editor of the Historical Division of Pergamon Press.|$|E

2500|$|During his father's {{illness and}} {{subsequent}} death, Austin {{began to see}} signs of similar mental illness in himself, now thought to be Alzheimer's disease. Austin was {{living and working in}} Seattle as a printer at the Puget Sound Dispatch when he was severely injured in a fireworks explosion on July 4, 1872. The explosion severely lacerated the lower part of his face, removing all the incisors from his lower jawbone. He had {{spent most of his life}} in San Francisco and many years traveling to seek medical treatment to restore his health, while retaining a real estate office in Seattle. Upon returning to Seattle in 1889, he made plans to erect a large brick building on the property he inherited just south of his father's hotel, since renamed the Bellevue House. On April 23, 1889, he took his nephew, William M. Coffman, on a buggy ride to share his plans. [...] The next morning, his demeanor had changed and he was suffering from indigestion. He went to his realty office as usual, <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him and shot himself in the head. A neighboring merchant heard the shot and rushed across the street to tell a pharmacist that a murder must have occurred. After summoning a doctor, several men broke down Bell's door to find him dead by his own hand. He was 35. A suicide note to Eva was discovered stating that he did not consider life with poor health worth living and expressed sorrow that he must take this way out.|$|E
