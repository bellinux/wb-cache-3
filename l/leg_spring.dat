40|$|Trotting and hopping animals use muscles, tendons and ligaments {{to store}} and return elastic energy as they bounce along the ground. We {{examine how the}} {{musculoskeletal}} spring system operates at different speeds and in animals of different sizes. We model trotting and hopping as a simple spring-mass system which consists of a <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> and a mass. We find that the stiffness of the <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> (kl e g) is nearly independent of speed in dogs, goats, horses and red kangaroos. As these animals trot or hop faster, the <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> sweeps a greater angle during the stance phase, and the vertical excursion {{of the center of}} mass during the ground contact phase decreases. The combination of these changes to the spring system causes animals to bounce off the ground more quickly at higher s p e e d s. Analysis of a wide size range of animals (0. 1 – 140 kg) at equivalent speeds reveals that larger animals have stiffer leg springs (kleg∝M 0. 67, where M is body mass), but that the angle swept by the <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> is nearly independent of body mass. As a result, the resonant period of vertical vibration of the spring-mass system is longer in larger animals. The length of time that the feet are in contact with the ground increases with body mass in nearly {{the same way as the}} resonant period of vertical vibration...|$|E

Gait {{is designed for}} a simple biped with compliant legs using the concept of hybrid zero dynamics. Simultaneous optimization of gait and <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness and optimization of gait at a fixed <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> stiffnesses is carried out. Different cost functions based on energy are considered. The influence {{of compliance}} on gait {{and the influence of}} the measure of energy on optimal compliance are investigated. It is shown that minimum actuator energy consumption is obtained if leg stiffness is subject to optimization along with gait parameters. Sum of actuator work and spring work is higher than in optimized stiff-legged gait. Depending on the choice of cost function, fundamental different gait characteristics and optimal stiffnesses are obtained. I...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Across a {{broad range}} of size and leg number, legged animals move with {{mechanics}} that resemble a simple spring mass system, consisting of a point mass bouncing forward on a virtual elastic spring leg. For polypeds (> 2 legs) the virtual leg is composed of N/ 2 legs acting in unison. Humans compensate for elastic surfaces by stiffening this virtual elastic <b>leg</b> <b>spring.</b> This has suggested spring mass models as the “control target ” used by legged organisms to run. Here we present comparative work testing the hypothesis that polypeds will use the same strategy of stiffening their virtual <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> on soft surfaces. Data from insects (six legs) with accelerometer backpacks running on an elastic latex surface, and data from dogs (four legs) show that polypeds do not stiffen their virtual leg on compliant surfaces. We speculate on likely reasons for the difference in control strategy, which include differences in dynamic stability...|$|E

A computer simulation for terrestrial running at maximal speed {{is presented in}} this study, based on a leg with the properties of non-linear spring. At maximal speed, the horizontal speed has 'been conSidered constant while the vertical component was considered zero at landing. Three non-linear springs have been considered for quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemius muscles with different stiffness coefficients.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the effect of a}} maximal stretch-shortening cycle fatigue workout on the biomechanical performance of rebound jumps that were done 15, 45, 120 and 300 seconds post-fatigue. Thirteen elite level rugby players participated in the study. Rebound jumps were done before and after the workout. All jumps were performed on a sledge and force plate apparatus. Flight time, ground contact time, peak force and <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness were the dependent variables. The results indicated that the fatigue workout significantly reduced flight time (p < 0. 001), peak force (p < 0. 01) and increased contact time (p < 0. 05) at the 15 second interval. The efficiency of the stretch-shortening cycle function was reduced. The results also indicate a potentiation effect at the 300 -second interval due to a significant increase in peak force and leg stiffness (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Both {{the linear}} <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> {{model and the}} two-segment leg model with {{constant}} spring stiffness have been broadly used as template models to investigate bouncing gaits for legged robots with compliant legs. In addition to these two models, the other stiffness <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> models developed using inspiration from biological characteristic {{have the potential to}} improve high-speed running capacity of spring-legged robots. In this paper, we investigate the effects of “J”-curve spring stiffness inspired by biological materials on running speeds of segmented legs during high-speed locomotion. Mathematical formulation {{of the relationship between the}} virtual leg force and the virtual leg compression is established. When the SLIP model and the two-segment leg model with constant spring stiffness and with “J”-curve spring stiffness have the same dimensionless reference stiffness, the two-segment leg model with “J”-curve spring stiffness reveals that (1) both the largest tolerated range of running speeds and the tolerated maximum running speed are found and (2) at fast running speed from 25 to 40 / 92 [*]m[*]s− 1 both the tolerated range of landing angle and the stability region are the largest.

40|$|In {{human and}} animal running spring-like leg be-havior is found. In a spring-mass model, running proves to be self-stable in terms of {{external}} pertur-bations or variations in leg properties (e. g. landing angle). However, biological limbs are not made of springs but, rather, consist of segments where spring-like behavior can be localized at joint level. Here, we use a two-segment leg model to investigate the effects of leg compliance originating from joint level on run-ning stability. Due to leg geometry a nonlinear relationship be-tween leg force and leg compression is found. In con-trast to the linear <b>leg</b> <b>spring,</b> the segmented leg is ca-pable of reducing the minimum speed for self-stable running from 3. 5 m/s in the spring-mass model to 1. 5 m/s for almost straight joint configurations which is below the preferred transition speed from human walk-ing to running (≈ 2 m/s). At moderate speeds the tolerated range of landing angle is largely increased (17 degrees at 5 m/s) com-pared to the linear <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> model (2 degrees). How-ever, for fast running an increase of joint stiffness is required to compensate the mechanical disadvan-tage of larger leg compression. This could be achieved by nonlinear springs enhancing joint stiffness in fast running...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA simple spring-mass {{model can}} {{provide insight into}} human running {{mechanics}} and help determine coping mechanisms for changes in running velocity, surface stiffness and surface height. However, previous research assumed that no energy was lost in each step even though most sports surfaces return {{only a fraction of}} the energy stored during the first half of impact according to their damping characteristics. When hopping on damped surfaces, humans were found to be more flexed during landing and more extended at take-off compared to undamped surfaces. This study investigated the use of this strategy during running. A spring-mass running model was developed in Matlab and analysed on a surface of fixed stiffness but variable damping. Using a range of running velocities (2 – 6 más- 1), <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness’ (5 – 50 kNám- 1) and retraction angle (50 – 80 ¼), stable regions for a surface without damping were obtained. Damping was then introduced and the new stable regions and energy losses recorded. <b>Leg</b> <b>spring</b> lengths (and hence centre-of-mass heights) at touchdown were then modified and the extent to which this strategy compensated for the energy losses associated with damping was assessed. These results have provided a theoretical insight into the energetic costs of running on damped surfaces. In future work, these results will be compared to human running to determine how accurately the model reflects human coping strategies...|$|E

This study aimed to determine some of the key strength and power predictors of speed within professional rugby union players. METHODS: Twenty professional male rugby union players participated in this study. Subjects were tested for speed (0 - 10 m sprint and a flying 10 m sprint), strength (3 repetition maximum squat), lower body power (countermovement jumps [CMJ] and drop jumps [DJ]), reactive strength and <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness. The strength and power variables were expressed as absolute values and relative values for analysis. RESULTS: Both relative strength (r=- 0. 55, P< 0. 05) and relative power (- 0. 82, P< 0. 01) were negatively correlated with 10 m time. <b>Leg</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness and DJ contact time were also related to the flying 10 m time (r=- 0. 46 and 0. 47, respectively, P< 0. 05) while reactive strength index was negatively related to both the 10 m and flying 10 m times (r=- 0. 60 and r=- 0. 62, P< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: This study provides an insight into those physical attributes that underpin sprinting performance in professional rugby union players and specifically highlights the importance of relative strength and power in the expression and development of different speed components (e. g. acceleration, maximum velocity) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{relationship}} between vertical stiffness, leg stiffness and maximal sprint speed in a large cohort of 11 - 16 -year-old boys. Three-hundred and thirty-six boys undertook a 30 m sprint test using a floor-level optical measurement system, positioned in the final 15 m section. Measures of speed, step length, step frequency, contact time and flight time were directly measured whilst force, displacement, vertical stiffness and leg stiffness, were modeled from contact and flight times, from the two fastest consecutive steps for each participant over two trials. All force, displacement and stiffness variables were significantly correlated with maximal sprint speed (p 0. 7) relationship with sprint speed, while vertical center of mass displacement, absolute vertical stiffness, relative peak force, and maximal <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> displacement had large (r > 0. 5) relationships. Relative vertical stiffness and relative peak force did not significantly change with advancing age (p > 0. 05), but together with maximal <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> displacement accounted for 96 % of the variance in maximal speed. It appears that relative vertical stiffness and relative peak force are important determinants of sprint speed in boys aged 11 - 16 years, but are qualities that may need to be trained due to no apparent increases from natural development. Practitioners may wish to utilize training modalities such as plyometrics and resistance training to enable adaptation to these qualities due to their importance as predictors of speed in youth...|$|E
