5|$|Ajay {{encounters}} Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at {{the start}} of the game, claiming that he only ever intended to help Ajay. Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen to him. If Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Ajay's father sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together, Lakshmana, which would make her Ajay's half-sister. Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale, killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> with the infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> in Ajay's hands.|$|E
5|$|Although Heuveldorp is not {{recorded}} as {{being involved in}} any more fiction film productions, Krugers went on to direct several films, including the area's first talkie, Karnadi Anemer Bangkong (1931), before <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> in 1936.

Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled it away and then committed suicide.|$|E

A clause in the Act of Settlement that forbade the British monarch from <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> without Parliament's {{permission}} was unanimously repealed in 1716.

Birkelund pointed out that he had already moved to Sweden by the time of their assassinations, while Madsen stated he was sure Leifer gave orders before <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Also, they met Frode Jacobsen in a meeting in Sweden, and he is said to have given orders from there. Birkelund {{rejected}} the idea of Jacobsen giving orders, but Madsen said the meetings were created by him to show that the resistance movements of that time had approaches different from those of their present-day counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Germany invaded both Norway and Denmark on 9 April 1940. Norway {{was very}} {{important}} to Germany for two reasons: firstly as a base for naval units to harass Allied shipping in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, and secondly to secure shipments of iron ore coming in from Sweden through the port of Narvik. During Operation Weserübung, Denmark fell in less than a day, becoming the briefest invasion in recorded military history. The Norwegians put up a stiffer resistance to the invading German forces. Nonetheless, by May the southern half of Norway was under German control. Following the German invasion of France and the Low Countries, the Allies were forced to evacuate Narvik, <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> to the Germans who would occupy it {{until the end of the}} war. After the invasion, Vidkun Quisling led the collaborationist government of Norway, based around the fascist Nasjonal Samling ("National Gathering") party.|$|E

5|$|The Bahraini Economic Vision 2030 {{published}} in 2008 {{does not indicate}} how the stated goal of shifting from an economy built on oil wealth to a productive, globally competitive economy will be attained. Bahrain has already diversified its exports to some extent, out of necessity. It has the smallest hydrocarbon reserves of any Gulf state, producing 48,000 barrels per day from its one onshore field. The bulk of the country’s revenue comes from its share in the offshore field administered by Saudi Arabia. The gas reserve in Bahrain is expected to last for less than 27 years, <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> with few sources of capital to pursue {{the development of new}} industries. Investment in research and development remained very low in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times printed two {{versions}} of the raids on its front page, one by David Halberstam implicating Nhu for the attacks, and another with the official government version. Sheehan of United Press International also claimed Nhu was responsible for the attacks, and foreign journalists had to smuggle their stories out by asking people <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> at the airport to carry documents for them. At the time, Sheehan and Halberstam were on a Ngô family hit list along with political dissidents because of their exposes of the regime's human rights abuses, and following the raids, they slept at the home of John Mecklin, a U.S. official. They also received information that the Ngos were going to plant bombs in their offices and blame the deaths on the communists.|$|E
5|$|Upon <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> Emperor Pedro I {{selected}} {{three people}} {{to take charge of}} his children. The first was his friend José Bonifácio, whom he nominated as guardian, a position which was later confirmed by the National Assembly. The second was Mariana de Verna, who had occupied the position of aia (supervisor) from the birth of Pedro II. The third person was Rafael, an afro-Brazilian veteran of the Cisplatine War. Rafael was an employee in the Palace of São Cristóvão whom Pedro I deeply trusted and asked to look after his son—a charge which he carried out during the rest of his life. São Cristóvão was Pedro II's primary residence from infancy. At the end of 1832 Princess Paula became severely ill (likely with meningitis) and died three weeks later on 16 January 1833. Her loss reinforced the sense of abandonment already felt by Pedro II and his remaining two sisters.|$|E

5|$|After the child's {{father was}} allowed to visit him during August and September 1858, two starkly {{different}} narratives emerged—one told of a boy who wanted {{to return to his}} family and the faith of his ancestors, while the other described a child who had learned the catechism perfectly and wanted his parents to become Christians as well. International protests mounted, but the Pope would not be moved. After pontifical rule in Bologna ended in 1859, Father Feletti was prosecuted for his role in Mortara's seizure, but was acquitted when the court decided he had simply followed orders. With the Pope as a substitute father, Mortara trained for the priesthood in Rome until the Kingdom of Italy captured the city in 1870, ending the Papal States. <b>Leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> he was ordained in France three years later at the age of 21. Father Mortara {{spent most of his life}} outside Italy and died in Belgium in 1940, aged 88.|$|E
5|$|As the Belgian forces, {{together}} with their French and British allies, were forced to retreat, Leopold decided that surrendering the army was the only viable course of action. On 24 May, as the government was <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> for exile in France, a group of ministers including Pierlot held a final meeting with Leopold at the Kasteel van Wijnendale. They called for him to {{follow the example of}} the Norwegian king, Haakon VII, and join them in exile as a symbol of continued resistance. Leopold refused, believing that as commander, he should surrender alongside his army, provoking real animosity. He also believed that, by leaving for France, the Belgian government would surrender its neutrality and become a puppet government. He also believed that, as a neutral power with no formal treaty of alliance with France or Britain, the Belgian army was not obliged to hold out as long as it possibly could if it incurred huge casualties and had no change of defending its own territory. On 28 May, after a brief attempt to form a new government of sympathetic politicians under Henri De Man and after denouncing Pierlot and his government, Leopold surrendered to the Germans and was made a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|The King's {{capitulation}} {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Kościuszko, who had not lost a single battle in the campaign. By mid-September 1792 he was resigned to <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> and in early October he departed from Warsaw. First he went east, to the Czartoryski family manor at Sieniawa, which gathered various malcontents. In mid-November he spent two weeks in Lwów (in Ukrainian, Lviv; in German, Lemberg), where he was welcomed by the populace; since the war's end, his presence had drawn crowds eager to see the famed commander. Izabela Czartoryska discussed having him marry her daughter Zofia. The Russians planned to arrest him if he returned to territory under their control; the Austrians, who held Lwów, offered him a commission in the Austrian Army, which he turned down. Subsequently they planned to deport him, but he left Lwów before they could do so. At {{the turn of the}} month, he stopped in Zamość at the Zamoyskis' estate, met Stanisław Staszic, then went on to Puławy.|$|E
