40|$|As {{the digital}} {{environment}} {{in which we live}} continues to change at speeds that were unfathomable two decades ago, archaic state tax systems have struggled to keep pace. Cloud computing is the latest innovation to introduce considerable complexity into the state and local tax system. Cloud computing is prevalent in many aspects of the user experience with companies such as Apple, Amazon, and Google now providing their traditional services via a cloud component. With three primary service models and countless transactional forms, cloud computing is difficult to fit into most current tax systems. Though some jurisdictions have begun to issue guidance on the taxability of cloud computing, it is generally limited to the Software as a Service (SaaS) model in the context of sales and use tax (which is imposed on all retail sales, <b>leases</b> <b>and</b> <b>rentals</b> of most goods, and taxable services). However, tax questions arise not only in the sales and use tax arena, but also in regard to income tax on a spectrum of issues such as nexus, characterization, and sourcing. The {{purpose of this article is}} to examine the primary issues facing taxpayers regarding cloud computing, from both a normative and positive perspective, in order to provide a starting point for analysis for the taxpayer, and also to give policymakers insight into the problems taxpayers face and how legislation may be formulated to bring the current tax system in line with the economic events in which it taxes...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{records the}} {{research}} into {{aspects of the}} late- 17 th century Sheffield cutlery trades. The key research resources are the 1672 Ladyday Hearth Tax returns for the parishes of Sheffield, Ecclesfield and Handsworth in the Scarsdale Hundred and the records of apprentices and freedoms of the Cutlers' Company in Hall=shire. These documents, which provide correlating evidence for the numbers and distribution of cutlers and other cutlery craftsmen, have been combined with data from probate inventories, parish records, <b>leases</b> <b>and</b> <b>rentals.</b> This particular Hearth Tax return {{is important because it}} had separate listings of the smithy hearths, because of local opposition to the tax. Although work has been done into the size of the late- 17 th century Sheffield cutlery industry, it has not previously been possible to show the occupations of the taxpayers. By correlating these two contemporary sets of records, the cutlery craftsmen have been identified and located, revealing that numbers of craftsmen did not own a smithy hearth and that some craft groups generally had multiple hearths. These factors, men with multiple smithy hearths and men without one, all indicate a manufacturing organisation more complex than the simple system of a master involved in all processes, assisted by his journeyman and apprentice. This research has refined earlier descriptions by locating the craftsmen more accurately and linking their distribution with geographical features, such as the available waterpower, or with the social influence of an existing community dominated by core families. The research presents data, which shows that by 1672, the trades were fragmenting, and many men were probably specialising in one or more manufacturing process. The reconstruction of the communities, based on the Hearth Tax returns, has shown that expansion during the 18 th century was often based on the characteristics developed in the previous century and that 19 th and 20 th century work practices had their roots in the 17 th century.

40|$|<b>Leases</b> <b>and</b> <b>rental</b> {{agreements}} {{often have}} options attached or embedded in them. These options sometimes {{depend on a}} number of economic variables such as the consumer price index (CPI), a real estate index and/or the value of real estate underlying the agreement. The evaluation of these options often involves the solution or approximation to a partial differential equation (PDE). This study analyzes the appropriate PDEs which model the situation where the lessee is granted an option to either purchase the property or to renew the lease at a price (rent) indexed to the CPI or some other readily measured economic variable. The PDEs that result from the usual contingent claim asset-pricing framework are derived and numerically solved using the finite difference method with absorbing boundaries. The value of an embedded option to renew a five year lease on class A office space in each of the ternty-five markets for which the National Real Estate Index reports quarterly rental data is estimated. An evaluation of the model’s "Greeks" confirm that the model conforms to financial intuition which provides support for the accuracy of the estimates. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. California???s Legislative Analyst Office {{recently}} pegged the state???s deficit at $ 20 {{billion for}} fiscal year 2010 - 2011. Amongst the revenue-raising proposals under consideration is {{an expansion of the}} sales tax base to include services. Due to a paucity of research on the subject, policymakers tend to use crude estimates of the additional revenue that could be raised by taxing services. This thesis is an attempt to ground and refine these estimates. I compiled a panel data set of sales and use tax revenue for 43 states over a period of 15 years in order to capture revenue fluctuations across multiple business cycles. To investigate the relationship between sales tax base and revenue, I used service base data available from the Federation of Tax Administrators and adjusted it to reflect the relative market size of each service industry in each represented state. Additionally, I controlled for a host of state-specific factors including, though not limited to, sales and use tax rate, household population, racial demographics, and per capita disposable income. For the econometric analysis, I employed a fixed effects regression model. There are three major findings. First, potential revenue yields vary greatly both within and across particular service base categories. For example, estimates for admission and entertainment services range from $ 0. 6 to $ 7. 7 billion, while taxing transportation services could raise $ 4. 8 to $ 20. 2 billion. Second, according to an alternatives matrix calculated for California, transportation, <b>lease</b> <b>and</b> <b>rental,</b> <b>and</b> automotive services offer the best combination of political feasibility and revenue returns. Third, in the short-run, tax rate increases yield more revenue than base expansions. Public Policy and Administratio...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years {{the nature of}} airport precincts has changed {{significantly}} from purely aviation services to {{a full range of}} retail, commercial, industrial and other non aviation uses. Most major airports in Australia are owned and operated by the private sector but are subject to long term head leases to the Federal Government, with subsequent sub leases in place to users of the land. The lease term available for both aviation and non aviation tenants is subject to the head <b>lease</b> term <b>and</b> in a number of Australian airport locations, these head leases are now two-thirds through their initial 50 year <b>lease</b> term <b>and</b> this is raising a number of issues from a valuation and ongoing development perspective.. For our airport precincts to continue to offer levels of infrastructure and services that are comparable or better than many commercial centres in the same location, policy makers need to understand the impact the uncertainty that exists when the current lease term is nearing expiration, especially in relation to the renewed <b>lease</b> term <b>and</b> <b>rental</b> payments.

40|$|This book is {{designed}} to complement the author’s A New Land Law,integrating with that work in its simplified terminology, and emphasising a three-fold functional classification of leases – short residential tenancies, long residential <b>leases</b> <b>and</b> commercial <b>leases.</b> Rented housing is treated as a unified whole, with particular prominence being given to shorthold arrangements. The book includes reference to the changes to the allocation and homelessness regimes proposed by Part II of the Homes Bill 2000. It also considers {{the impact of the}} Human Rights Act 1998, the changes to repossession procedures implemented by the Woolf Reforms, and the year 2000 bumper crop of decisions on housing law. Leasehold tenure is undergoing dramatic changes. The book draws a functional distinction between long residential <b>leases</b> <b>and</b> <b>rental</b> arrangements, based on the registrability of long leases, their freedom from rent controls and security of tenure, special controls of management and forfeiture, and enfranchisement rights. Extensive coverage is given to the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill 2000, introduced into the House of Lords in December 2000, and promising improvements in the enfranchisement schemes, additional management controls, and a commonhold scheme. Topics on commercial <b>leases</b> (business <b>and</b> agricultural) given special attention include the reasonable recipient principle for the construction of notices, a decision on the effect on a sub-tenant of an upwards notice to quit by his head tenant, and Law Commission proposals on the Termination of Tenancies (1999).

40|$|Secondary {{spectrum}} trading {{is an important}} approach to increase spectrum utilization. According {{to the length of}} duration of spectrum usage, it can be categorized into long-term <b>leasing</b> <b>and</b> short-term <b>rental.</b> Existing works have largely focused on one pricing scheme only. In this paper, we propose a new {{spectrum trading}} framework called HEAD for a hybrid market between spectrum owner (SO) and secondary users (SU). The entire time span is divided into multiple periods of equal length. In the long-term leasing, SUs pay a subscription fee to obtain spectrum in all future periods. In the short-term rental, SUs contend for channel usages of one period via auction. We consider the users' QoS requirements and propose statistical approximation methods to estimate the auction outcome and analyze how SO optimizes revenue. In addition, we examine the SUs' strategic choices and the equilibrium. The benefits of the proposed hybrid pricing framework are evaluated and verified through extensive simulations...|$|R
