50|$|Certain {{vessels are}} {{assigned}} timber freeboards, but before {{these can be}} assigned certain additional conditions have to be met. One of these conditions is that the vessel must have a forecastle of at least 0.07 {{the length of the}} vessel and of not less than standard height, which is 1.8 metres for a vessel 75 metres or less in length and 2.3 metres for a vessel 125 metres or more in length with intermediate heights for intermediate lengths. A poop or raised quarter deck is also required if the length is less than 100 metres. The letter L prefixes the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> <b>marks</b> to indicate a timber <b>load</b> <b>line.</b> Except for the timber winter North Atlantic freeboard the other freeboards are less than the standard freeboards. This allows these ships to carry additional timber as deck cargo, but with the facility to jettison this cargo.|$|R
50|$|Passenger ships having spaces {{which are}} adapted for the {{accommodation}} of passengers and the carriage of cargo alternatively may {{have one or}} more additional load line marks corresponding to the subdivision drafts approved for the alternative conditions. These marks show P1 for the principal passenger condition, and P2, P3, etc., for the alternative conditions, however in no case is any subdivision <b>load</b> <b>line</b> <b>mark</b> placed above the deepest load line in salt water.|$|E
50|$|In the 1860s, after {{increased}} loss {{of ships}} due to overloading, a British MP, Samuel Plimsoll, {{took up the}} load line cause. A Royal Commission on unseaworthy ships was established in 1872, and in 1876 the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act made the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> <b>mark</b> compulsory, although the positioning of the mark was not fixed by law until 1894. In 1906, laws were passed requiring foreign ships visiting British ports to be marked with a load line. It was not until 1930 (the 1930 Load Line Convention) that there was international agreement for universal application of load line regulations.|$|E
40|$|The {{safety of}} vessels {{has been of}} concern to mariners for centuries. Concepts of vessel stability, the {{possibility}} of capsizing, and structural integrity have been recognized by shipbuilders and operators {{from the beginning of}} marine shipping industry. The concepts of metacenter and restoring arm as initial stability criteria for small heel angles and practical methodologies for their evaluation were introduced in 18 th century. The oldest traceable ship safety recommendations were found in the Venetian code of maritime law (13 th century) requesting marking and inspection of the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> <b>mark.</b> After the Titanic tragedy the first International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) took place in 1913 - 1914, but its recommendations on subdivision and damage stability were not adopted until the next SOLAS meeting in 1929. The 1992 report on the ?Herald of Free Enterprise? accident identified and recommended the need for replacement of prescriptive rules with performance based regulations. The UK Marine Safety Agency, in 1993, suggested to the IMO?s Marine Safety Committee (MSC) the concept of formal safety assessment with respect to ship design and operations. The proposition was accepted and FSA became a high priority on the MSC agenda. The Formal Safety Assessment process has been defined by the IMO as: Structured and systematic methodology, aimed at enhancing maritime safety, including protection of life, health, the marine environment and property by using risk analysis and cost benefit assessment. The method is applicable to consider the safety of vessels in a global sense (all systems) or to take into account subsystems or individual aspects of safe operations. It could be applied in situations where risk needs to be reduced but required decisions are not clearly defined and need to be analysed. It can be applied during ship design stages or to analyse single operational aspects of existing vessels. The process can be used to validate existing and/or new regulations developed applying prescriptive or risk based principles. This paper discusses aspects of FSA procedures and its implementation into deployment and validation of new regulations for vessels. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
50|$|In {{accordance}} with the International Convention on <b>Load</b> <b>Lines</b> (CLL 66/88), all assigned <b>load</b> <b>lines</b> must be <b>marked</b> amidships {{on each side of}} the ships engaged in international voyages. The determinations of the freeboard of ships are calculated and/or verified by classification societies which issue International <b>Load</b> <b>Line</b> Certificates in {{accordance with}} the legislation of participating States.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fresh water}} <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is an amount equal to [...] millimetres above the summer <b>load</b> <b>line</b> where [...] is the {{displacement}} {{in metric tonnes}} at the summer load draft and T is the metric tonnes per centimetre immersion at that draft. In any case where [...] cannot be ascertained the fresh water <b>load</b> <b>line</b> {{is at the same}} level as the tropical <b>load</b> <b>line.</b> The position of the tropical fresh <b>load</b> <b>line</b> relative to the tropical <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is found {{in the same way as}} the fresh water <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is to the summer <b>load</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Once a DC {{operating}} point {{is defined by}} the DC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> an AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> can be drawn through the Q point. The AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is a straight line with a slope equal to the AC impedance facing the nonlinear device, which is in general different from the DC resistance. The ratio of AC voltage to current in the device is defined by this line. Because the impedance of the reactive components will vary with frequency, the slope of the AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> depends on the frequency of the applied signal. So there are many AC <b>load</b> <b>lines,</b> that vary from the DC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> (at low frequency) to a limiting AC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> all having a common intersection at the DC {{operating point}}. This limiting <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> generally referred to as the AC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> is the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> of the circuit at [...] "infinite frequency", and can be found by replacing capacitors with short circuits, and inductors with open circuits.|$|R
50|$|The summer <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is {{the primary}} <b>load</b> <b>line</b> and it is from this mark that all other marks are derived. The {{position}} of the summer <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is calculated from the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> rules and depends on many factors such as length of ship, type of ship, type and number of superstructures, amount of sheer, and bow height. The horizontal line through the circle of the Plimsoll mark {{is at the same}} level as the summer <b>load</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{net tonnage}} {{calculation}} {{is based on}} a number of factors, one of which is the moulded draft d. The choice of the value to use for d can be complicated. For ships subject to the International Convention on <b>Load</b> <b>Lines,</b> the Summer <b>Load</b> <b>Line</b> draft is used, with the exception of cases where that is a timber <b>load</b> <b>line.</b> For passenger ships, the draft used is the deepest subdivision <b>load</b> <b>line</b> assigned in accordance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Otherwise, if a ship has been assigned a <b>load</b> <b>line</b> by its national government, the draft for that summer <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is used. If the ship has no <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> instead, a maximum draft assigned by its national government, that value is used, if it has been assigned a maximum. Finally, for a ship to which none of the above applies, the value of d is taken as 75 per cent of the moulded depth amidships.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>load</b> <b>line</b> diagram {{at right}} {{is for a}} {{resistive}} load in a common emitter circuit.

The intersections of the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> with the transistor characteristic curves represent the circuit-constrained values of IC and VCE at different base currents.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a <b>load</b> <b>line</b> {{is to ensure that}} a ship has {{sufficient}} freeboard (the height from the water line to the main deck) and thus sufficient reserve buoyancy. The freeboard of commercial vessels is measured between the lowest point of the uppermost continuous deck at side and the waterline and this must not be less than the freeboard <b>marked</b> on the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> certificate issued to that ship. All commercial ships, other than in exceptional circumstances, have a <b>load</b> <b>line</b> symbol painted amidships {{on each side of the}} ship. This symbol is also permanently marked, so that if the paint wears off it remains visible. The <b>load</b> <b>line</b> makes it easy for anyone to determine if a ship has been overloaded. The exact location of the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is calculated and verified by a classification society and that society issues the relevant certificates. This marking was invented in 1876 by Samuel Plimsoll.|$|R

50|$|Semiconductor {{circuits}} {{typically have}} both DC and AC currents in them, with {{a source of}} DC current to bias the nonlinear semiconductor to the correct operating point, and the AC signal superimposed on the DC. <b>Load</b> <b>lines</b> can be used separately for both DC and AC analysis.
