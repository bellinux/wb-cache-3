5|$|Despite {{being more}} popular than some men's {{football}} events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, {{on the grounds that}} the game (as played by women) was distasteful. Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.|$|E
5|$|Feminism was {{challenged}} by various minority groups for not entirely addressing {{the needs of}} minority populations. It was suggested that 'mainstream' feminism was upper caste and Hindu in its orientation and did not address the concerns of minority women. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the Awaaz-e-Niswaan (The Voice of Women) in 1987 in Mumbai in largely Muslim part of the city. The Muslim community has personal laws that often were considered harmful to the rights of Muslim women. The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not Polyandry.|$|E

By August the team had no money to meet its payroll, and Sunday was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for two players and $1,000 in cash.|$|E

The tables and benches were constructed by the custodian and the music teacher from wood of horse stalls formerly on the campus.

5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E
5|$|While {{aircraft}} {{were being}} delivered, Bowen, Tizard and Watt pressed the Air Ministry to appoint someone {{to command the}} entire night fighting system, from ensuring aircraft delivery and radar production to the training of pilots and ground crew.

Peirse raised the Night Interception Unit at RAF Tangmere on 10 April 1940; it was later renamed the Fighter Interception Unit (FIU).|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the Gent–Wevelgem, Cancellara raced the Tour of Flanders. On the {{penultimate}} climb of the day, the Oude Kwaremont, Cancellara attacked and only Sep Vanmarcke was able to mark his move. The pair traveled along the course and caught the leaders {{on the road and}} the group of four then rode into the finish together. Cancellara out-sprinted the three other riders to win his third edition of the Tour of Flanders. Three days later, Cancellara raced in the Scheldeprijs. Four days following the Scheldeprijs, Cancellara began the Paris-Roubaix. He made a move in the Carrefour de l'Arbre sector and which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a lead group.
