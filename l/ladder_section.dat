40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} an extension ladder "walk-through" top design on kinetic and kinematic behaviors and the outward destabilizing forces induced on the ladder during transitioning at elevation. Thirty-two male participants performed stepping tasks between a ladder top and a roof at simulated elevation in a surround-screen virtual-reality system. The experimental conditions included a "walk-through" and a standard ladder top section supported on flat and sloped roof surfaces. Three force platforms were placed under the <b>ladder</b> <b>section</b> and in the roof to measure propulsion forces during transitions. A motion measurement system was used to record trunk kinematics. The frictional demand at the virtual ladder base was also calculated. The results indicate that under optimal ladder setup (angle 75. 52020), the frictional demand at the ladder base remains relatively small for all experimental conditions. Also, the "walk through" ladder top eased the ladder-to-roof transitions but not the roof-to-ladder transitions.

40|$|The {{design of}} a fish ladder that would operate with {{downstream}} tide fluctuations of 14 ft and upstream river fluctuations of 1 ft were developed in two hydraulic models. The hydraulic design of the ladder was developed in a 1 : 8 -scale model. Hydraulic characteristics of a false weir at the upstream end of the ladder were studied in a 1 : 4 -scale model. The ladder was intended to pass primarily shad and alewives. The initial fish ladder was of the vertical-slot type with 29 pools and a false weir above high tide level to lead fish into a steep chute to the river 6. 5 ft below. The design was hydraulically satisfactory. The design was modified to include a direct swim-through exit to the river for use during low and intermediate tides. The low tide <b>ladder</b> <b>section</b> consisted of five pools with notched weirs and a weir gate exit. The false weir exit was designed to operate with all tide levels, but fish were to be blocked from that section by a barrier rack during {{the use of the}} low tide exit. In a further modification, the notched weirs of the low tide section were replaced with a submerged screen barrier that would force fish toward the surface for better public viewing. With that plan, the false weir exit operated only when the low tide exit was closed. All the plans were satisfactory. The plan with a false weir exit and a low tide exit with submerged barrier screen was selected for construction...|$|E
40|$|Allpass {{filters are}} {{commonly}} employed in many applications to perform group delay equalisation in the passband. They are non-minimum phase by definition and are characterised by poles and zeros in mirror-image symmetry. SI allpass filters of both cascade biquad and bilinear-LDI ladder types {{have been in}} existence. These were implemented using Euler based integrators. Cascade biquads {{are known to have}} highly sensitive amplitude responses and Euler integrators suffer from excess phase. The equalisers that are proposed here are based on bilinear integrators instead of Euler ones. Derivation of these equalisers can proceed from either the s-domain, or directly from the z-domain, where a prototype is synthesised using the respective continued-fractions expansions, and simulated using standard matrix methods. The amplitude response of the bilinear allpass filter is shown to be completely insensitive to deviations in the reactive <b>ladder</b> <b>section.</b> Simulations of sensitivities and non-ideal responses reveal {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the various structures. Existing DI multirate filters have to date been implemented as direct-form FIR and IIR polyphase structures, or as simple cascade biquad or ladder structures with non-optimum settling times. FIR structures require a large number of impulse coefficients to realise highly selective responses. Even in the case of linear phase response with symmetric impulse coefficients, when the number of coefficients can be halved, significant overheads can be incurred by additional multiplexing circuitry. Direct-form IIR structures are simple but are known to be sensitive to coefficient deviations and structures with non-optimum settling times operate entirely at the higher clock frequency. The novel SI decimators and interpolators proposed are based on low sensitivity ladder structures coupled with FIR polyphase networks. They operate entirely at the lower clock frequency which maximises the time available for the memory cells to settle. Two different coupling architectures with different advantages and disadvantages are studied...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{layering}} in reservoirs {{upstream from}} hydroelectric dams can create temperature gradients in fishways used by upstream migrating adults. In the Snake River, Washington, federally-protected adult salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) often encounter relatively cool water in dam tailraces and lower <b>ladder</b> <b>sections</b> and warmer {{water in the}} upstream portions of ladders. Using radiotelemetry, we examined relationships between fish passage behavior and the temperature difference between {{the top and bottom}} of ladders (∆T) at four dams over four years. Some spring Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) experienced ∆T ≥ 0. 5 °C. Many summer and fall Chinook salmon and summer steelhead (O. mykiss) experienced ∆T ≥ 1. 0 °C, and some individuals encountered ΔT > 4. 0 °C. As ΔT increased, migrants were consistently more likely to move down fish ladders and exit into dam tailraces, resulting in upstream passage delays that ranged from hours to days. Fish body temperatures equilibrated to ladder temperatures and often exceeded 20 °C, indicating potential negative physiological and fitness effects. Collectively, the results suggest that gradients in fishway water temperatures present a migration obstacle to many anadromous migrants. Unfavorable temperature gradients may be common at reservoir-fed fish passage facilities, especially those with seasonal thermal layering or stratification. Understanding and managing thermal heterogeneity at such sites may be important for ensuring efficient upstream passage and minimizing stress for migratory, temperature-sensitive species...|$|R

50|$|A lattice delay section {{has twice}} the delay of a {{comparable}} <b>ladder</b> filter <b>section,</b> and this helps to mitigate concerns over component duplication. In any case, a lattice configuration {{can be converted}} to an unbalanced equivalent, which will reduce the component count and permit some relaxation of component tolerances. Consequently, lattice delay sections, or their bridged T circuit equivalents, are able to provide substantial time delays in a compact physical form and they make efficient use of their operational bandwidth. Although there are other ways of achieving signal delays, such as by a long length of coaxial cable, or by lumped element ladder networks, such solutions have either greater physical bulk, or they make inefficient use of a frequency band, or they have poor phase linearity.|$|R

We accept the bed in Bedknobs and Broomsticks, the Tardis in Doctor Who, the supralight speed engines of science fiction, as time/space travel devices in order to get characters from A to B, to advance their progress along the story path.

It is therefore natural that such a time/space device has continued and been reconstructed within videogames. The virtual gameworld is itself a place able to reconstruct time and space; both Juul [10] and Atkins [3] discuss how players??? perceptions of time and narrative elements within the videogame can be rearranged, but the warp, a significant ???re-arranger???, is rarely discussed further or in detail. The warp is used as a common device within videogames to transport the player from their location to somewhere else within the gamespace. Although commonly acknowledged through the hidden tunnels within Super Mario Bros, the warp is not a straightforward device, and can manifest itself in various ways during gameplay. It may be found in deliberately installed puzzles, and by the ???aberrant player??? [7]. It may be a way of avoiding danger, of ???jumping??? over sections previously achieved, or even of cheating. It may be the punishment for straying from a ???good path???, or the reward for a particular act. Whatever its use or function, the warp exists within the virtual world as a means of managing time, space and narrative. The warp turns paths experienced by the player into fixed ???tracks???, where navigational control is removed whilst in the warp sequence, and understanding the warp in this way allows us to further understand the player???s relationship with the game paths they are moving along, the stories they move within. This paper discusses the multiple characteristics of the warp by identifying its use in contrasting videogame genres. These characteristics open up ways of discussing the aesthetics of the warp experience for the player and how its use affects path structures as well as time and narrative elements within videogames. The discussion will include both the built in, deliberately installed ???puzzle-based??? warps and the ???inadvertent warps??? sought by those seeking to discover more of the games ???algorithm. ??...|$|R

40|$|We study, using a perturbative {{renormalization}} group technique, {{the phase}} diagrams of bond-aligned and diagonal Hubbard <b>ladders</b> defined as <b>sections</b> of a square lattice with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor hopping. We find that for not too large hole doping and small next-nearest-neighbor hopping the bond-aligned systems exhibit a fully spin-gapped phase while the diagonal systems remain gapless. Increasing the next-nearest-neighbor hopping typically {{leads to a}} decrease of {{the gap in the}} bond-aligned ladders, and to a transition into a gapped phase in the diagonal ladders. Embedding the ladders in an antiferromagnetic environment can lead to a reduction in the extent of the gapped phases. These findings suggest a relation between the orientation of hole-rich stripes and superconductivity as observed in LSCO. Comment: Published version.

40|$|Below we {{show how}} to add entry and exit to the continuous-time quality <b>ladder</b> model in <b>Section</b> 4 {{of the main}} paper. Recall that ωi ∈ { 1 M} {{describes}} the quality of firm i’s product. To model entry and exit, we add M + 1 to the set of firm i’s feasible states and assume that ωi =M + 1 designates firm i as being inactive in the product market game. The state space thus becomes Ω = { 1 MM + 1 }N. Once an incumbent firm exits the industry, it transits from state ωi = M + 1 to state (ω′) i = M + 1. It then becomes a potential entrant that, upon entry, transits from state ωi =M + 1 to state (ω′) i =M + 1. The transitions are {{under the control of}} firms. Specifically, incumbent firm i’s action xi = (xi 1 xi 2) is now a vector instead of a scalar, where xi 1 is incumbent firm i’s investment in quality improvements and xi 2 governs exit. It is natural to assume that a potential entrant cannot invest so as {{to improve the quality of}} its product before it has actually entered the industry. Thus potential entrant i’s action is the scalar xi 2 that governs entry. The set of feasible actions is X i(ω) = { [0 x̄ 1] × [0 x̄ 2] ωi =M + 1, [0 x̄ 2] ωi =M + 1, (A 1) where the first line pertains to an incumbent firm and the second line pertains to a po-tential entrant. As we have noted in Section 2. 1, discrete actions such as entry and exit in EP’s frame-work are computationally challenging. In the remainder of this section, we outline two possibilities for adding entry and exit to the continuous-time quality <b>ladder</b> model in <b>Section</b> 4 that avoid this difficulty. In each case, entry and exit are governed by xi 2, a continuous action. The interpretation of xi 2 varies with the formulation of entry and exit...|$|R
50|$|The {{calculation}} of transfer function becomes somewhat more complicated when the sections {{are not all}} identical, or when the popular ladder topology construction is used to realise the filter. In a <b>ladder</b> filter each <b>section</b> of the filter {{has an effect on}} its immediate neighbours and a lesser effect on more remote sections so the response is not a simple An even when all the sections are identical. For some filter classes, such as the Butterworth filter, the insertion loss is still monotonically increasing with frequency and quickly asymptotically converges to a roll-off of 6n dB/8ve, but in others, such as the Chebyshev or elliptic filter the roll-off near the cut-off frequency is much faster and elsewhere the response is anything but monotonic. Nevertheless, all filter classes eventually converge to a roll-off of 6n dB/8ve theoretically at some arbitrarily high frequency, but in many applications this will occur in a frequency band of no interest to the application and parasitic effects may well start to dominate long before this happens.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fabrication of conjugated polymer nanowires by a three stage process: (i) spin-coating a composite film comprising alternating layers of a conjugated polymer and a sacrificial material, (ii) embedding {{the film in}} an epoxy matrix and sectioning it with an ultramicrotome (nanoskiving), and (iii) etching the sacrificial material to reveal nanowires of the conjugated polymer. A free-standing, 100 -layer film of two conjugated polymers was spin-coated from orthogonal solvents: poly(2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 ′-ethylhexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV) from chloroform and poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline ladder) (BBL) from methanesulfonic acid. After sectioning the multilayer film, dissolution of the BBL with methanesulfonic acid yielded uniaxially aligned MEH-PPV nanowires with rectangular cross sections, and etching MEH-PPV with an oxygen plasma yielded BBL nanowires. The conductivity of MEH-PPV nanowires changed rapidly and reversibly by> 103 upon exposure to I 2 vapor. The result suggests that this technique {{could be used to}} fabricate high-surface-area structures of conducting organic nanowires for possible applications in sensing and in other fields where a high surface area in a small volume is desirable.

The north fish <b>ladder</b> (except entrance <b>section)</b> and a portion of ladder adjacent to the south fish counting station were studied in a 1 : 10 -scale model. A group of four typical diffusion chambers in each ladder was reproduced in a 1 : 8 -scale model. Fishway weirs with 6 -ft-long overflow crests at each end of a 12 -ft-long nonoverflow section, upstream fins, and 18 - by 18 -in. orifices at the floor were adopted. Orifice sizes in the regulating sections were adjusted to control discharge and head drops between 19 nonoverflow bulkheads for an 11 -ft range in forebay levels. Sloping floors, baffle beams at a constant elevation, and metering orifices sized to provide 60 cfs each were selected for diffusers in sloping portions of the fish ladders. Improved designs were developed for the bulkhead and weir adjacent to the north fish counting station. The addition of a third orifice in bulkheads of the regulating section (to assist passage of shad and sockeye salmon) increased turbulence at the north fish counting station.

40|$|Previous work on bone {{growth and}} {{biomechanics}} suggests that osteocytes might sense {{the requirement for}} bone remodeling and signal to cells in the basic multicellular unit that undertake this function. The present study looked for evidence of apoptosis in human osteocytes in adult, pediatric, and pathological bone to compare these situations of differing levels of turnover and considered {{the possibility of a}} functional role for this death mechanism in bone modeling and remodeling. Apoptosis was identified in bone tissue by agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA (to demonstrate DNA <b>ladders).</b> In cryostat <b>sections</b> it was possible to visualize individual cells with fragmented DNA in situ using a modified nick translation technique (NT). In addition, visualization of apoptotic morphology was undertaken using light and electron microscopy. Adult femoral head and iliac crest bone showed no evidence of DNA ladders and very small numbers of osteocytes with DNA fragmentation using NT. In contrast, samples of pediatric calvaria, adult heterotopic bone, and osteophytes all displayed characteristic laddering of extracted DNA and showed evidence of potentially apoptotic osteocytes in situ using NT. In agreement with these findings, transmission electron microscopy showed numbers of osteocytes in infant calvaria with advanced chromatin condensation and cell shrinkage indicative of apoptosis. Since all three types of positive bone are involved in rapid matrix turnover, apoptotic changes in human osteocytes in vivo might be related in general terms to the modeling and remodeling activity level of the bone sampled. It was further found that the distribution of potentially apoptotic cells in the infant and pathological bone was anatomically nonuniform, raising the intriguing possibility of a functional relationship between bone turnover and the controlled cell death of osteocytes...|$|R
50|$|Nesquehoning Creek {{encompasses}} a 34 sq mi sq-mi drainage area between Broad Mountain {{to the northwest}} and the north along the left bank of its generally eastern course and Nesquehoning Mountain to the south. It rises in the peaks flanking join of the two ridgelines in a saddle at Hometown, PA and terminates in the Lehigh River about two miles below the town of Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania {{in the shadow of}} Mount Pisgah from which several minor unnamed tributary streams descend adding their waters. All the mountains in the area are among a series of near parallel ridgelines in the region. Approximately 7.2 sq mi of the drainage basin or watershed is located in Schuylkill County while 26.7 sq mi is located in Carbon County. Nesquehoning Creek originates in two forested gullies diametrically opposed N-to-S along the east edge of Hometown, the major fork on the slopes of Broad Mountain to the north and the minor to the south on the last minor peak of Nesquehoning Ridge. From their confluence the creek flows south for about 2 mi then turns to the northeast and flows into and through Greenwood Lake, which is nearly a mile long. Approximately 600 ft downstream from the spillway, it discharges into Lake Hauto, both lakes being man-made. It then continues to the northeast in a relatively narrow valley over its steepest stretch then flattens out and slows making its way through Nesquehoning, which is a right bank town. The stream then travels down a narrow undeveloped <b>ladder</b> or rapids <b>section</b> where its elevation drops significantly to its confluence with the Lehigh River opposite and downstream from the Lehigh River Gorge around the bend from Jim Thorpe, PA formed by the roots of Mount Pisgah. Six left bank tributaries enter the stream below Hauto Dam from State Game Lands No. 141 before and west of the 1563 ft summit on Broad Mountain, the uppermost named 'Broad Run', the lower 'Deep Run' being the largest and named, the other four being short and relatively insignificant rills.|$|R
