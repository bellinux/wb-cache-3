5|$|Doctors {{initially}} told Kennedy {{the tumor}} was inoperable, but he <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> for other opinions and decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible. On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center {{in an attempt to}} remove as much of the tumor as possible. The 3½-hour operation, conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects, was deemed successful in its goals. Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy's prognosis: the surgery typically only extended survival time by a matter of months, but sometimes people lived for years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E

I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E

25|$|Having {{made his}} way into Freyja's chambers, Loki <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> {{to be sure that}} no one was awake, and found that Freyja was asleep. He landed on her bed and noticed that she was wearing the necklace, the clasp turned downward. Loki turned into a flea and jumped onto Freyja's cheek and there bit her. Freyja stirred, turning about, and then fell asleep again. Loki removed his flea's shape and undid her collar, opened the bower, and {{returned}} to Odin.|$|E
25|$|After a {{preliminary}} {{trip to the}} Cumberland {{at the end of}} which he left two of his sons to begin clearing the plot of land at the mouth of White's Creek, James Brown returned to North Carolina to fetch the rest of the family, with whom he departed Long-Island-on-the-Holston by boat in May 1788. When they passed by Tuskegee Island (Williams Island) five days later, Bloody Fellow stopped them, <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> the boat, then let them proceed, meanwhile sending messengers ahead to Running Water.|$|E
25|$|With the German {{invasion}} {{starting on}} 9 April 1940, the Luftwaffe had initially {{intended to use}} Værnes Air Station as its main stronghold for operating aircraft of the 10th Air Corps in Trøndelag. Contrary to their intelligence statements, Værnes was in a dilapidated state, lacking such amenities as a paved runway. The Luftwaffe therefore <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> for other suitable sites {{to allow them to}} continue battle in the Norwegian Campaign. All supplies would need to be flow in to Trøndelag until 13 April, and it was therefore imperative for the Wehrmacht that an air base be established in the region.|$|E

25|$|As his {{business}} grew Pao <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> for suitable new ventures and in 1955 decided to branch into shipping (still focusing on assets {{that were not}} fixed in Hong Kong) and embarked on an intensive learning process. Shipowning in Hong Kong had a poor reputation at that time with the banks and so the first vessel, a 28-year-old coal burning 8,200 tonne freighter, was purchased without finance. Having seen this and the rigorousness employed by Pao in the purchase process, the Hongkong Bank extended a loan for the second purchase, the start of long and fruitful relationship which led to Pao being appointed {{to the board of}} the bank in 1971 and later to become its vice-chairman.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b> I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
500|$|The movie's strange title {{originated}} from something said by Ringo Starr, who described {{it this way}} {{in an interview with}} disc jockey Dave Hull in 1964: [...] "We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day ...' and I <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> and saw it was dark so I said, '... night!'

500|$|While {{composing}} the song's lyrics, Martin {{could not}} find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing key word in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> the studio and saw Stephanie, a friend who happened to be present in the studio at that time. Martin later titled the song [...] "Yellow" [...] as a reference to Stephanie's yellow glow. The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. Bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line [...] "Look at the stars". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.|$|E
500|$|A similar, {{although}} more indepth, {{story of the}} recruitment of Gholston has been told by Wilcher: [...] "He {{was walking down the}} hall with a Bible in his hands," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "He was already built like a grown man; he was all cut up (like a bodybuilder). I asked him, 'Can I help you sir?' He <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> to see who I was talking to. I said, 'Are you looking for a student?' He said, 'No, I go here.' He said he was a freshman. I thought he was lying." [...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house and dragged him back into the program: [...] "I told him I didn't care if he wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to play. My only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the episode, Jack announces at a staff meeting that NBC has been bought by Kabletown, a company network from Philadelphia. Immediately, Jack and Liz exchange opinions about Philadelphia and Boston; Liz, who grew up near Philadelphia, declares [...] "Go Eagles! Philly rules! Cheesesteaks! Bobby Clarke! Will Smith! [...] sucks!". Jack, who is from Boston, responds [...] "Boston is the greatest city in the world. Boston Tea Party. Boston cream pie. Boston Rob Mariano. Birthplace of Benjamin Franklin." [...] Liz interjects [...] "Yeah, then [...] <b>looked</b> <b>around,</b> realized it sucked, and moved to Philadelphia!" [...] Jack and the New York staff then deride the city of Los Angeles, provoking an NBC executive teleconferencing in from Los Angeles to assert that [...] "LA rules: Michael Bay, freeways, Legoland—" [...] before Jack shuts off his feed. While meeting with Kabletown executives, Jack learns that they focus on adult films and sees their list of features, including Assatar, The Lovely Boners, The Hind Side, and Fresh-Ass: Based on the Novel Tush by Assfire, puns on the 2009 films Avatar, The Lovely Bones, The Blind Side, and [...]|$|E

500|$|Two riders very {{disappointed}} with their results were Michael Matthews and Fabian Cancellara. Matthews crashed {{at high speed}} shortly before the Cipressa and arrived at the finish with a bandaged right elbow. He said: [...] "Obviously I'm devastated. [...] This was everything, this was my world championships {{for the start of}} the season. [...] I was really looking forward to making a good finale, it's really unfortunate that a crash stopped me from doing that." [...] Cancellara, who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season, was held up in Gaviria's crash after having stayed in the leading group. He described his final kilometres as difficult, as he had been isolated from his teammates, saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him. Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan, who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular. He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria's crash: [...] "Then I got away with Boasson Hagen, Gaviria and someone else. Then with about 500 metres to go, Gaviria <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> because the group was coming up. He went down and I only just managed to avoid him. I stayed up but I lost a lot speed and never managed to get going again in the final metres." ...|$|E
500|$|As Christmas approaches, Akeelah {{goes out}} to buy Dr. Larabee a present, but when she meets him, he reveals that he is quitting being her coach because she reminds him of his {{deceased}} daughter Denise. Instead, he gives Akeelah 5,000 flashcards to study. Without her coach, rejected by her best friend Georgia, and feeling the pressure from her neighborhood residents to make them proud, Akeelah loses her motivation. However, Tanya tells {{her that if she}} <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> her, she would realize that she has [...] "50,000 coaches". Akeelah recruits her family members, classmates, teachers, friends, and neighbor Derrick T to prepare in earnest. After reuniting with Dr. Larabee, Akeelah goes to Washington, D.C. with him, along with Tanya, Georgia, Mr. Welch, and Devon, unaware that her coach has paid for four of their tickets. Georgia rekindles her friendship with Akeelah after she invites her. During the competition, Akeelah becomes a crowd favorite. After all the other competitors are eliminated, only Dylan and Akeelah remain. The two finalists are allowed a break, during which Akeelah overhears Dylan's father harshly pressuring him to win. Akeelah attempts to intentionally lose by deliberately misspelling [...] "xanthosis". Dylan, knowing that Akeelah knows this word, intentionally misspells it as well. Dylan tells Akeelah that he wants a fair competition, rejecting his father's obsession to win. The two then proceed to spell every word listed by the judges in the hopes of winning the championship together, with Dylan earning a share of it by correctly spelling [...] "logorrhea", much to his father's delight. Akeelah spells the last word on the list, [...] "pulchritude", and the two are declared co-champions amidst a cheering crowd.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} few months after its installation, the PDP-1 {{programming}} community at MIT focused on simpler programs to work out how to create software for the computer. The community had heard of the Spacewar concept, however, and understood that Russell would spearhead the development of it. [...] When members of the community began to feel the time was right to start work on the game, Russell, nicknamed [...] "Slug" [...] because of his tendency to procrastinate, began providing various excuses as to why he could not start programming the game. One of these was the lack of a trigonometric function routine needed to calculate the trajectories of the spacecraft. This prompted Alan Kotok of TMRC to call DEC, who informed him that they had such a routine already written. Kotok drove to DEC to pick up a tape containing the code, slammed it down in front of Russell, and asked what other excuses he had. Russell, later explaining that [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> and I didn't find an excuse, so I had to settle down and do some figuring," [...] started writing the code in December 1961. The game was developed to meet three precepts Russell, Graetz, and Wiitanen had developed for creating a program that functioned equally well as an entertainment experience for the players and as a demonstration for spectators: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game. It took Russell, with assistance from the other programmers—including Bob Saunders and Steve Piner (but not Wiitanen, who had been called up by the United States Army Reserve)—about 200 man-hours to write the first version of Spacewar, around six weeks to develop the basic game.|$|E
