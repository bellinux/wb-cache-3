Excess windup could easily lead to a broken gear in the bevel or hub gearboxes. To indicate this, white lines were painted across {{the ends of the}} hubs.

50|$|Excessive roll stiffness, {{typically}} {{achieved by}} configuring an anti-roll bar too aggressively, {{can make the}} inside <b>wheels</b> <b>lift</b> off the ground during hard cornering.

40|$|AbstractOrthogonal Latin squares (OLS) are {{fundamental}} combinatorial objects with important theoretical properties and interesting applications. OLS {{can be represented}} by integer points satisfying a certain system of equalities. The convex hull of these points is the OLS polytope. This paper adds to {{the description of the}} OLS polytope by providing non-trivial facets arising from wheels. Specifically, for each wheel of size five, we identify the variables that can be added to the induced inequality, thus obtaining all distinct families of maximally <b>lifted</b> <b>wheel</b> inequalities. Each of these families induces facets of the OLS polytope which can be efficiently separated in polynomial time...|$|R
50|$|The {{engineering}} {{needs of}} the Susquehanna Canal, were modest in comparison to many contemporary projects, and construction was timed after other more difficult projects in the system were well under way. The Susquehanna Division Canal employed 12 locks overcoming a total of just 86 ft in its 41 mis length It was begun in 1827 and was finished in 1831 in time to connect to traffic between the Union Canal and the Allegheny Portage Railroad, which <b>lifted</b> <b>wheeled</b> canal barges up on of the gaps of the Allegheny and over the Allegheny Plateau into the Allegheny-Ohio valleys.|$|R

Mrs Marrot was then directed to observe {{the rim of the}} wheel, where she saw a small chisel cutting iron curls off it just as easily, to all appearance, as a turner cuts shavings off wood--and these iron curls were not delicate; they were thick, solid, unpliant ringlets, that would have formed a suitable decoration for the fair brow of a locomotive, or, perhaps, a chignon--supposing that any locomotive could have been prevailed on to adopt such a wild monstrosity! ...|$|R
50|$|In general, all {{railroad}} vehicles have spring suspension; without springs, {{irregularities in}} the track could <b>lift</b> <b>wheels</b> off {{the rail and}} cause impact damage to both rails and vehicles. Driving wheels are typically mounted so that they have around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vertical motion. When there are only 2 coupled axles, this range of motion places only slight stress on the crank pins. With more axles, however, provision {{must be made to}} allow each axle to move vertically independently of the others without bending the rods. This may be done by hinging the side rod at each intermediate crank pin, either using the pin itself as a hinge pin, or adding a hinge joint adjacent to the pin, as shown in the illustration.|$|R
50|$|This {{system and}} its {{drawbacks}} are probably best known through the Alvis FV600 chassis and the Stalwart and family. As well as the bevel boxes in the hull, these used an epicyclic hub gear. Standard operating instructions recommend that after travelling some miles on firm ground, the vehicle should be bounced over a kerb or railway sleeper to <b>lift</b> <b>wheels</b> clear of the ground, one-by-one, {{to allow them to}} spring back and release the windup. Excess windup could easily lead to a broken gear in the bevel or hub gearboxes. To indicate this, white lines were painted across the ends of the hubs. Normally the lines should be parallel but as windup occurred they would become misaligned, indicating the need to release this.|$|R

50|$|For a long while, it {{was common}} to use 'dollies' to recover vehicles. These were cranes and underlifts as above, but mounted on a two-wheeled axle. They were {{designed}} to be towed behind a suitable towing vehicle. Another portable device was a crane, which clipped on to an articulated tractor unit's fifth wheel coupling. Popular in the seventies and eighties, they were cheap to buy (compared with a purpose-built recovery vehicle) and appealed to fleet operators, who could use them to recover their own vehicles. Total lift dollies were carried by some spectacle lifts to place under the wheels {{at the opposite end}} to the <b>lifted</b> <b>wheels,</b> thereby converting the half lift into a total lift. These are used, for example, when a vehicle has had an accident and both ends are damaged.|$|R

50|$|In {{operation}} the translifter is {{coupled with}} a universal terminal tractor with <b>lifting</b> 5th <b>wheel</b> (Fifth wheel coupling). Terminal tractors' 5th wheel connects to the translifter's Kingpin. The translifter is lowered down and driven under the cassette and then raised again with the cassette for transportation. Translifters usually have automatically steered tires which helps handling {{the combination of the}} translifter and terminal tractor.|$|R
40|$|Uniform {{seed spacing}} has been {{demonstrated}} to bea significant factor in quality and yield for somecrops such as sugarbeets. With uniform spacing,the roots can grow to a uniform size and fill the row space without being pushed out of the row by a neighboring root. This ensures that all of each root can be gathered from the row by the harvester. With uneven plant spacing, some roots may be {{too small to be}} gathered by the harvester, or some roots may be too large, and may be damaged by the topping implements, or the <b>lifting</b> <b>wheels</b> of the harvester (Jaggard, 1990). Traditional methods of sugarbeet planting have involved planting excess seed and thinning the resulting plants to obtain the desired plant population at a uniform plant spacing. Until the 1970 s nearly all the sugarbeet crop in the world, including the United States, was planted with excess seed and the resulting plants thinned to a final stand. Advancements in plant establishment practices such a...|$|R
50|$|The {{oldest and}} easternmost {{building}} is the Old Steam House (1837), which housed the original boiler and steam engine. The one-story fieldstone building has an asphalt shingle roof {{and is used}} for storage. The next oldest building, the westernmost, was built circa 1851 as the boiler house {{for the rest of}} the complex. Immediately to the east is the West Engine Building, also from 1851. The engine house contains one of the two Merrick single-cylinder steam engines. The interior of the structure is supported by cast iron columns. From the outside this appears to be a two-story structure, but is a single space inside. The East Engine Building, opposite the Wheel House, is similar in nature, but was built in 1853 or 1854. In the center, the Wheel House (1851) contains a 39 ft <b>lift</b> <b>wheel,</b> 10 ft wide, made of cypress, white oak and iron. The wheel could move 20000 gal per minute at 1.5 rpm.|$|R
