5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last for a <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|E

5|$|There {{are often}} {{substantial}} {{differences between the}} remiges and rectrices of adults and juveniles of the same species. Because all juvenile feathers are grown at once—a tremendous energy burden to the developing bird—they are softer and of poorer quality than the equivalent feathers of adults, which are moulted over a <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time (as long as several years in some cases). As a result, they wear more quickly.|$|E

5|$|Among other points, the NATO group cited {{superior}} effectiveness (27 percent greater) for the 5.7×28mm against unprotected {{targets and}} equal effectiveness against protected targets. It also cited less sensitivity to extreme temperatures for the 5.7×28mm, and cited a greater potential risk of barrel erosion with the 4.6×30mm. In addition, the group {{pointed out that}} 5.7×28mm {{is close to the}} 5.56×45mm NATO by its design and manufacture process, allowing it to be manufactured on existing production lines. The group also noted that 5.7×28mm firearms had existed for a <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time than 4.6×30mm firearms, and that the 5.7×28mm FN Five-seven pistol was already in production at that time, while the 4.6×30mm Heckler & Koch UCP pistol was a new concept.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Selvo's rule, he took over responsibility for the third construction of St. Mark's Basilica. This final and most famous version of the church, whose construction was begun by Domenico Contarini and finished by Vitale Faliero in 1094, remains an important symbol of the long periods of medieval Venetian wealth and power. The church is also {{a monument to the}} great Byzantine influence on Venetian art and culture throughout its history, but particularly in the 11th century. Though Selvo did not oversee {{the beginning}} or completion of St Mark's Basilica, his rule covered a <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> its construction than the other two Doges who oversaw the project.|$|E
5|$|Basing {{himself on}} revised data, Sampson in 1995 {{estimated}} that the layers investigated represented a <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time than the initially assumed 500,000 years: after the deposition of Gilmore's Brachyceratops quarry, 860,000 years would have passed, and after the Einiosaurus beds 640,000 years, until the maximal extent of the Bearpaw transgression. He did not adopt Horner's hypothesis of anagenesis but assumed speciation took place, with the populations splitting.

5|$|From {{the data}} he {{collected}} and documented, Aristotle inferred {{quite a number}} of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.|$|E
5|$|In case of brief incapacitation {{to execute}} {{the office of the}} President of Croatia due to absence, illness or vacations, the {{president}} may transfer his powers to the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament to act as a deputy. The president decides on the revocation of this authority and his return to the office. If the president is prevented from performing his duties for a <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time due to illness or other form of incapacitation, and especially if the president is unable to decide on a transfer of powers to a deputy, the Speaker of the parliament becomes the acting president, assuming presidential duty pursuant to a decision of the Constitutional Court, made upon request of the Government.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{hypothesize that}} another alternative growth strategy will evolve in the P. rebeli, {{in which the}} P. rebeli will parasitize the M. schencki ants for an even <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time than the slow developing larvae. Most researchers, however, find this hypothesis highly unlikely {{because it is not}} an evolutionarily stable strategy. At the rate the P. rebeli parasitizes the M. schencki ants, the host colony is unlikely to last as a viable food source {{for more than two years}} (the average lifespan of the longer polymorph of P. rebeli). Once the host colony reaches its lifespan of two years and dies, the P. rebeli loses its food source and dies as well.|$|E

5|$|SMS Hansa {{was built}} in 1868–1875, the first ironclad built in Germany; all {{previous}} German ironclads had been built in foreign shipyards. This resulted in a much <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> construction, however, as she was built by the relatively inexperienced Royal Dockyard in Danzig. She was named after the Hanseatic League, known in Germany simply as Hanse, Latinized Hansa. The ship was launched in October 1872 and commissioned into the Imperial Navy in May 1875. Designed for overseas service, Hansa was classed as an armored corvette and armed with eight 21cm guns in a central battery.|$|E
5|$|Severe thunderstorms, {{which can}} spawn tornadoes and hailstorms, require wind shear to {{organize}} the storm {{in such a way}} as to maintain the thunderstorm for a <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. This occurs as the storm's inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow. An increasing nocturnal, or overnight, low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind shear through the troposphere. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air and kills the thunderstorm.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of South Dakota's natural lakes {{are located in the}} eastern half of the state, and most are the product of the most recent ice age.

Other major natural lakes include Lake Kampeska, Waubay Lake, Lake Madison, Lake Whitewood, and Lake Herman. Additionally, two large lakes, Big Stone Lake and Lake Traverse, form part of the border between South Dakota and Minnesota. The continental divide separating the drainage basin of Hudson Bay from that of the Gulf of Mexico is situated between these two lakes.|$|E

5|$|Y Lyncis is {{a popular}} target among amateur astronomers, {{as it is a}} semiregular {{variable}} ranging in brightness from magnitude 6.2 to 8.9. These shifts in brightness are complex, with a shorter period of 110 days due to the star's pulsations, and a <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> 1400 days possibly due to the star's rotation or regular cycles in its convection. A red supergiant, it has an estimated diameter around 580 times that of the Sun, is around 1.5 to 2 times as massive, and has a luminosity around 25,000 times that of the Sun. 1 Lyncis and UX Lyncis are red giants that are also semiregular variables with complex fluctuations in brightness.|$|E
5|$|According to one theory, Shakespeare's {{main source}} is an earlier play—now lost—known {{today as the}} Ur-Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or even William Shakespeare, the Ur-Hamlet would have existed by 1589, and would have {{incorporated}} a ghost. Shakespeare's company, the Chamberlain's Men, may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, since no copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, {{it is impossible to}} compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> development—has attracted some support.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorally, domesticated pet rats are tamer {{than those}} in the wild. They are more {{comfortable}} around humans and known to seek out their owners while roaming freely. They have decreased reactions to light and sound, are less cautious of new food, and have better tolerance to overcrowding. Domesticated rats are shown to mate earlier, more readily, and for a <b>longer</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time over their lifespan. Also, domesticated rats exhibit different behaviors when fighting with each other; while wild rats almost always flee a lost battle, caged rats spend protracted amounts of time in a belly-up or boxing position. These behavioral traits are thought to be products of environment as opposed to genetics. However, it is also theorized that there are certain underlying biological reasons for why some members of a wild species are more receptive to domestication than others, and that these differences are then passed down to offspring (compare Domesticated silver fox).|$|E
