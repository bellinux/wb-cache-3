25|$|A drop lock can {{consist of}} two {{conventional}} lock chambers {{leading to a}} sump pound, or a single long chamber incorporating the sump - although the term properly applies only to the second case. As the pounds {{at either end of}} the structure are at the same height, the lock can only be emptied either by allowing water to run to waste from the sump to a lower stream or drain, or (less wastefully) by pumping water back up to the canal. Particularly in the two-chamber type, there would be a need for a bypass culvert, to allow water to move along the interrupted pound and so supply locks further down the canal. In the case of the single-chamber type, this can be achieved by keeping the <b>lock</b> <b>full</b> and leaving the gates open while not in use.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the short}} {{distances}} between the locks, most of the intervening pounds are extended sideways, {{in order to increase}} their volume, and lessen the changes in level when a <b>lock</b> <b>full</b> of water is emptied into the pound by a boat descending the flight or removed from the pound to fill the lock below as a boat ascends. The locks are built of rusticated red gritstone, and most are grade II listed structures. The listing includes the ponds to the west of each of the locks. Daintrys Road Bridge has an elliptical arch, and is built of reddish-buff ashlar gritstone, as is Peckerpool Wood Bridge. Both date from the opening of the canal. Swindalls Bridge is a farm accommodation bridge, and is also built of gritstone blocks. The aqueduct that carries the canal over the River Dane below lock 12 is 45 ft high and has a semi-circular arch with a span of 35 ft. Bosley Reservoir, the main source of water for the canal, is situated about 1 mi to the east of the flight, and a feeder supplies water to the summit pound just above the top lock.|$|E

40|$|With recent {{technological}} advances, {{shared memory}} parallel machines {{have become more}} scalable, and offer large main memories and high bus bandwidths. They are emerging as good platforms for data warehousing and data mining. In this paper, we focus on shared memory parallelization of data mining algorithms. We have developed a series of techniques for parallelization of data mining algorithms, including <b>full</b> replication, <b>full</b> <b>locking,</b> fixed <b>locking,</b> optimized <b>full</b> <b>locking,</b> and cache-sensitive locking. Unlike previous work on shared memory parallelization of specific data mining algorithms, all of our techniques apply to {{a large number of}} popular data mining algorithms. In addition, we propose a reduction-object-based interface for specifying a data mining algorithm. We show how our runtime system can apply any of the techniques we have developed starting from a common specification of the algorithm. We have carried out a detailed evaluation of the parallelization techniques and the programming interface. We have experimented with apriori and fp-tree-based association mining, k-means clustering, k-nearest neighbor classifier, and decision tree construction. The main results from our experiments are as follows. 1) Among full replication, optimized <b>full</b> <b>locking,</b> and cachesensitive locking, there is no clear winner. Each of these three techniques can outperform others depending upon machine and dataset parameters. These three techniques perform significantly better than the other two techniques. 2) Good parallel efficiency is achieved {{for each of the four}} algorithms we experimented with, using our techniques and runtime system. 3) The overhead of the interface is within 10 percent in almost all cases. 4) In the case of decision tree construction, combining diffe [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Large writes are {{beneficial}} both {{on individual}} disks and on disk arrays, e. g., RAID- 5. The presented design enables large writes of internal B-tree nodes and leaves. It supports both in-place updates and large append-only (“log-structured”) write operations {{within the same}} storage volume, within the same B-tree, and even at the same time. The essence of the proposal is to make page migration inexpensive, to migrate pages while writing them, and to make such migration optional rather than mandatory as in log-structured file systems. The inexpensive page migration also aids traditional defragmentation as well as consolidation of free space needed for future large writes. These advantages are achieved with a very limited modification to conventional B-trees that also simplifies other B-tree operations, e. g., key range locking and compression. Prior proposals and prototypes implemented transacted B-tree on top of log-structured file systems and added transaction support to log-structured file systems. Instead, the presented design adds techniques and performance characteristics of log-structured file systems to traditional B-trees and their standard transaction support, notably without adding a layer of indirection for locating B-tree nodes on disk. The result retains fine-granularity <b>locking,</b> <b>full</b> transactional ACID guarantees, fast search performance, etc. expected of a modern B-tree implementation, yet adds efficient transacted page relocation and large, high-bandwidth writes. ...|$|R
