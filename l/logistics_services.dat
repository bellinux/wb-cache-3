40|$|In {{the design}} of the {{revenue-sharing}} contract, it is critical to determine a rational revenue-sharing coefficient which affects the coordination and stability of supply chain. In order to improve the existing system, one should take into account that the current revenue-sharing coefficient study only figures out its range rather than the specific value. This paper investigates the fairest revenue-sharing coefficient when the <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> integrator and the functional <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> provider implement revenue-sharing contract under stochastic demand condition; by focusing on a two-echelon <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> supply chain composed of a <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> integrator and a functional <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> provider. Taken into consideration the non-storage property of <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> supply chain, this paper establishes a Stackelberg game model by giving priority to the <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> integrator. The interval of the revenue-sharing coefficient is obtained by revenue-sharing contract mechanism. Based on the principle of profit distribution equity, a fair entropy function is introduced and a non-linear programming model for solving the fairest revenue-sharing coefficient is established. Furthermore, this method is extended to a three-echelon <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> supply chain composed of a <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> integrator, a functional <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> provider, and a logistics subcontractor. It is assumed that the logistics subcontractor fully commits to the logistics capacity of the functional <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> provider and consequently a non-linear programming model is constructed to solve the fairest revenue-sharing coefficient of a three-echelon <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> supply chain under stochastic demand condition. The results exemplifies that the proposed method can find out the fairest revenue-sharing coefficient in a two-echelon and a three-echelon <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> supply chain, which provides an approach to revenue-sharing contract study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper, {{based on}} the {{analysis}} of the innate properties of productive activities of <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> industry, constructs input and output index based on SUPER-SBM DEA model. The paper empirically selects provincial data of China in 2008, evaluates the score of productive efficiency of <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> industry in various regions and then explores the approaches to promote productive efficiency according to related slack variables analysis. According to the analysis, the overall efficiency in <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> industry in China is comparatively low and there is a remarkable feature in its regional distribution. The efficiency in eastern regions is comparatively higher with the western regions following it and that in central regions is the worst. There exists larger input redundancy {{in the process of developing}} the <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> industry. Thus, regional coordination of the <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> industry should be emphasized and basic infrastructure investment should also be strengthened.

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to apply}} Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Modularity to <b>{{logistics}}</b> <b>service</b> design for {{third party logistics}} (3 PL) provider facing an uncertain and customized market. Research approach: Based on literature review, this paper firstly constructs an empirically grounded model for modular <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> platform, and defines a process for applying QFD methods and modular logic to <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> design. Then case study of a Chinese 3 PL company is used to illustrate the practice application of QFD for modular <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> design. Findings and Originality: The results show that QFD helps quickly transfer customer’s requirements into <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> processes and supportive management elements for specific industry, and then into <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> activities, which finally can be formed into a modular <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> platform followed modular logic normally used in product design. Furthermore, this modular <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> platform includes three levels: service, process, and activity reflecting individual customer’s requirements. This paper also shows how QFD and modularity {{can be used to}} quickly develop new service modules for new customers from new industry un-served before, and to cost effectively deliver service solutions to new customer from industry served before by combining different existed components in the service platform. Research impact: This paper provides insight for both practitioners and academics into how QFD systematically translates customer requirements into <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> design, targeting quick identifying customer requirements and creating comprehensive and modular service platform in fast-changing customization environments.

Financial information has become more and more important in strategic decision making (especially in the international context); in addition of being a measure of performance, the cost of capital is an important variable for <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> providers in decisions about investing capital and developing the appropriate strategy. In total, financial data on over 700 <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> providers for a period of 10  years were analyzed applying multiple regression analysis. Our results show that the <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> industry is rather nonvolatile from an investor’s viewpoint. Microeconomic variables significantly influence the cost of capital of <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> providers, whereas systematic risk is influenced by macroeconomic variables. In both cases, significance is strongly dependent on the services offered and financial structure of the companies, although the headquarters location is irrelevant. Main implication of our study underlines the specific interdependencies of strategic decision making and cost of capital of <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> providers. As recent research made only little efforts in linking the fields of business logistics and corporate finance, we follow a broad research approach to give a first comprehensive overview on this interdisciplinary topic.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: There is a {{widespread}} recognition {{of the importance of}} correctly modeling service processes as an effective way to provide a comprehensive understanding of the process and to enhance the service quality to clients.

Design/methodology/approach: A methodology integrating the declarative and imperative process modeling approach is proposed for modeling the <b>logistics</b> <b>service</b> processes. Through investigation of the service departments and services involved, the process is decomposed into loosely-structured parts modeled by a declarative approach and highly structured parts modeled by an imperative approach.
