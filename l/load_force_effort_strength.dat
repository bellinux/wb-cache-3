40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we examine}} grip <b>forces</b> and <b>load</b> <b>forces</b> during {{point-to-point}} arm movements with objects grasped with a precision grip. We demonstrate that grip force is finely modulated with <b>load</b> <b>force.</b> Variations in <b>load</b> <b>force</b> arise from inertial forces related to movement; grip force rises as the <b>load</b> <b>force</b> increases and falls as <b>load</b> <b>force</b> decreases. The same finding is observed in {{vertical and horizontal}} movements performed at various rates. In vertical movements, maximum grip force coincides in time with maximum <b>load</b> <b>force.</b> The maxima occur early in upward and later in downward movements. In horizontal movements, where peaks in <b>load</b> <b>force</b> are observed during both the acceleratory and deceleratory phases, grip force rises {{at the beginning of}} the movement and remains high until the end. The results suggest that when moving an object with the hand the programming of grip force is an integral part of the planning process...|$|R
40|$|In {{everyday}} life, one of {{the most}} frequent activities involves accelerating and decelerating an object held in precision grip. In many contexts, humans scale and synchronize their grip force, normal to the finger/object contact, in anticipation of the expected tangential <b>load</b> <b>force,</b> resulting from the combination of the gravitational and the inertial forces. In many contexts, grip <b>force</b> and <b>load</b> <b>force</b> are linearly coupled. A few studies have examined how we adjust the parameters - gain and offset - of this linear relationship. However, the question remains open as to how the brain adjusts grip force regardless of whether <b>load</b> <b>force</b> is generated by different combinations of weight and inertia. Here, we designed conditions to generate equivalent magnitudes of <b>load</b> <b>force</b> by independently varying mass and movement frequency. In a control experiment, we directly manipulated gravity in parabolic flights, while other factors remained constant. We show with a simple computational approach that, to adjust grip force, the brain is sensitive to how <b>load</b> <b>forces</b> are produced at the fingertips. This provides clear evidence that the analysis of the origin of <b>load</b> <b>force</b> is performed centrally, and not only at the periphery...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>loading</b> <b>force,</b> <b>loading</b> rate and {{unloading}} rate on the viscoelastic behavior of three representative polymers: poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, amorphous polymer), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, semicrystalline polymer), and epoxy (crosslinked polymer) {{have been investigated}} using nanoindentation. The {{results showed that the}} maximum indentation depth increased with the increase of <b>loading</b> <b>force,</b> and the relationship between <b>loading</b> <b>force</b> and depth became linear when the <b>loading</b> <b>force</b> is beyond 3000 μN. At the beginning, the plasticity index changed substantially with the increase of <b>loading</b> <b>force,</b> and after reaching a critical <b>loading</b> <b>force,</b> the plasticity index almost remained constant. The maximum indentation depth decreased with the increase of loading rate, which followed a power law curve. With the increase of loading rate, a plasticization phenomenon happened, and a possible reason is that the heat may accumulate and raise the local temperature. The plasticity index initially followed the power law with the increase of unloading rate and then almost remained constant. A constant, the change rate of viscoelastic properties with the unloading rate, for the three representative polymers studied in this research, around − 0. 033, has been obtained, which may be another manifestation of the phenomenon that many polymers have similar time/temperature shifts and that their WLF equation constants are approximately the same...|$|R

30|$|A human user {{perceives}} reduced heaviness while manipulating {{an object}} with power-assist [5]. The user feed-forwardly estimates the manipulative <b>force</b> (<b>load</b> <b>force,</b> grip force) to manipulate (e.g., lift) the object with the PARS depending on visually perceived {{weight of the}} object [18]. Here, the <b>load</b> <b>force</b> reflects human’s intent in manipulation that influences the motion [5]. The haptically perceived weight is smaller than the visually perceived weight [5], and thus, the applied <b>load</b> <b>force</b> estimated by the user based on the visually perceived weight is incorrect (larger than the <b>load</b> <b>force</b> actually required to lift the object to the desired position successfully) that results in harmful motion (acceleration), poor safety and lack of stability [5, 19]. As a consequence, human–robot interaction (HRI) and overall performance in manipulation become unsatisfactory that also reduce user’s trust in the robot [20, 21]. Furthermore, cognitive workload and fatigue may increase if the user undergoes a careful visual check of the prospective weights before handling objects with power-assist to realize the difference between visually and haptically perceived weights.|$|R

Compressive load relaxation was performed by deforming the lens by 10 % and measuring the force relaxation response for 100 s to obtain thickness, stiffness and relaxation of the induced <b>loading</b> <b>force</b> and Maxwell parameters for human, monkey, porcine and leporine whole and decapsulated lenses. Thickness and percentage <b>loading</b> <b>force</b> relaxation increased linearly with lens age, whereas stiffness and induced <b>loading</b> <b>force</b> increased exponentially. Human and monkey lenses aged at different rates. <b>Loading</b> <b>force</b> relaxation in a generalized Maxwell model was described by three time constants ranging from 1 to 1000 s. Compressive load relaxation is a very versatile method to study the viscoelastic properties of whole and decapsulated lenses and potentially also artificial accommodating lenses. The data presented in the study will help researchers choose the most suitable animal lenses based on the desired properties and age to be mimicked from the human lenses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

An object held in precision grip is stabilized by fine adjustments of the grip force against changes in tangential <b>load</b> <b>force</b> arising from inertia during acceleration and deceleration.

Here, we investigated the control of grip force when participants performed a targeted tapping task with a hand-held object. During the initial transport phase of the movement, <b>load</b> <b>force</b> varied smoothly with acceleration. In contrast, in the collision, <b>load</b> <b>forces</b> sharply increased to very large values. In the transport phase, grip <b>force</b> and <b>load</b> <b>force</b> were coupled in phase, as expected. However, in the collision, grip force did not parallel <b>load</b> <b>force.</b> Rather, it exhibited a stereotyped profile with maximum similar to 65 ms after peak load at contact. By using catch trials and a virtual environment, we demonstrate that this peak of grip force is pre-programmed. This observation is validated across experimental manipulations involving different target stiffness and directions of movement. We suggest that the central nervous system optimizes stability in object manipulation as in catching by regulating mechanical parameters including stiffness and damping through grip force.

40|$|Object {{manipulation}} requires {{rapid increase}} in grip force to prevent slippage when the <b>load</b> <b>force</b> of the object suddenly increases. Previous experiments have shown that grip force reactions interact between the hands when holding a single object. Here we test whether this interaction is modulated by the object dynamics experienced before the perturbation of the <b>load</b> <b>force.</b> We hypothesized that coupling of grip forces should be stronger when holding a single object than when holding separate objects. We measured the grip force reactions elicited by unpredictable load perturbations when participants were instructed to hold one single or two separate objects. We simulated these objects both visually and dynamically using a virtual environment consisting of two robotic devices and a calibrated stereo display. In contrast to previous studies, the <b>load</b> <b>forces</b> arising from a single object could be uncoupled {{at the moment of}} perturbation, allowing for a pure measurement of grip force coupling.
