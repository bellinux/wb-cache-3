5|$|In 1320 Maria married Dmitri of Tver, {{ruler of}} a Russian principality. The {{marriage}} took place soon after Mikhail Yaroslavich, Dmitri's father, was killed; his sons {{were searching for}} strong allies against Yury of Moscow, their principal competitor for the throne of Vladimir and All Rus'. After 1327 Lithuania began to supplant Tver as Moscow's chief rival for supremacy in the Rus'. When Tver sought to rival Moscow, it needed an alliance with Lithuania. Dmitri was killed in 1325 and Maria never remarried. Maria's brother-in-law, Alexander I, nevertheless maintained friendly relationships with the Grand Duchy of <b>Lithuania</b> <b>and</b> his daughter Uliana married Algirdas, the son of Gediminas, who continued the Gediminid line.

5|$|In the 18th {{century the}} Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a federal entity {{consisting}} of the Grand Duchy of <b>Lithuania</b> <b>and</b> the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, faced a period of decline due to increasingly dysfunctional internal politics.

5|$|A {{few days}} after the ultimatum, both <b>Lithuania</b> <b>and</b> Poland named their ambassadors. Kazys Škirpa was sent to Warsaw, and Franciszek Charwat was sent to Kaunas before March 31, the {{deadline}} indicated in the ultimatum. Negotiations over practical matters began on March 25, in Augustów, and by June three agreements covering rail transit, mail service, and river navigation had been concluded. The railroad, torn apart for several kilometers at the border, was repaired. A customs post was established in Vievis, and consulates were opened in Klaipėda and Vilnius. Lithuania closed the League for the Liberation of Vilnius and the Vilnius Foundation; the latter organization had given financial support to Lithuanian activities in the Vilnius Region. Nevertheless, Lithuania continued to claim Vilnius as its de jure capital. In May 1938 a new constitution was adopted, which echoed the previous constitution's statement that Vilnius was the permanent capital of <b>Lithuania</b> <b>and</b> that Kaunas was merely a temporary capital. Poland continued to suppress Lithuanian organizations in Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|After {{a request}} for {{assistance}} from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops. This prompted the League to decide {{that the future of}} Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, <b>Lithuania,</b> <b>and</b> the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite. After unsuccessful proposals by Paul Hymans to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the Klaipėda Region, the Allied Conference set the frontier between <b>Lithuania</b> <b>and</b> Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923. Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927. It was not until the 1938 Polish ultimatum that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus de facto accepted the borders.|$|E

5|$|After the Sejny Uprising, a Polish {{revolt against}} the Lithuanian {{authorities}} {{in one of the}} disputed border regions, Lithuanian intelligence intensified its investigation of the Polish minority and sympathizers in <b>Lithuania,</b> <b>and</b> uncovered the planned coup.

Later the full membership list was obtained and the PMO in Lithuania was dissolved. The coup further strained Polish–Lithuanian relations.|$|E
