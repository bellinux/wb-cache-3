5|$|American public {{education}} is operated {{by state and}} local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school {{from the age of}} six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to <b>leave</b> <b>school</b> at 16 or 17.|$|E
5|$|Brian Eaton {{was born}} in Launceston, Tasmania, on 15December 1916, to Sydney and Hilda Eaton. The family later moved to Canterbury, Victoria, and Brian was educated at Carey Grammar. His early {{ambition}} {{to be a doctor}} was curtailed when his father died and he had to <b>leave</b> <b>school</b> early. He enlisted as an air cadet in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 20January 1936, undergoing flying training at RAAF Station Point Cook.|$|E

30|$|As the ILO-STWT surveys only collect {{information}} on labor market spells {{from the time}} the individual left school, we cannot identify employment spells that happened and concluded before <b>leaving</b> <b>school</b> (although, as said, we have an indicator on whether individuals worked or not while attending school). More importantly, for each employment spell that started before <b>leaving</b> <b>school</b> but that was ongoing at the time the individual left school, the survey reports as a start date the month following the one of <b>leaving</b> <b>school.</b> 3 In practice, this means that one cannot distinguish genuine direct transitions from school to work from apparent transitions, i.e., transitions that happened before <b>leaving</b> <b>school</b> and that continued after the individual left school. For this reason, one needs to be very cautious in interpreting spells recorded as starting just after <b>leaving</b> <b>school</b> as direct transitions from school to work.|$|R
5|$|His father {{suffered}} a fall {{and a broken}} leg when Playford was thirteen. He requested permission to <b>leave</b> <b>school</b> and take over the family farm; this was granted, and the boy, even after his father had recovered, dominated {{the management of the}} farm. While out of school, Playford continued to learn; he joined the local Norton Summit Society, and took part in classes and debates in Adelaide. He won a public speaking award for a speech he made to an Adelaide literary society.|$|E

5|$|The prison {{became known}} {{around the world}} in the 19th century through the writing of the English novelist Charles Dickens, whose father was sent there in 1824, when Dickens was 12, for a debt to a baker. Forced as a result to <b>leave</b> <b>school</b> to work in a factory, Dickens based several of his {{characters}} on his experience, most notably Amy Dorrit, whose father is in the Marshalsea for debts so complex no one can fathom how to get him out.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{told the}} BBC in 1965 that {{he chose to}} <b>leave</b> <b>school</b> at 17 because he no longer wished to be a {{financial}} strain on his parents, and {{because he wanted to}} pursue his cricketing career. He worked as a clerk in the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance in Barnsley from 1958 to 1963, at the same time playing for a number of cricket clubs. Boycott captained the South Elmsall district team, and achieved a batting average of 70. He also played for the Yorkshire Federation's Under-18 team, and for Barnsley, where he was noticed by Clifford Hesketh, a member of Yorkshire's County Cricket team committee.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with research into early <b>school</b> <b>leaving.</b> A narrative interview approach was used to document and analyse the experiences, processes and decisions that {{a small sample of}} boys made prior to <b>leaving</b> <b>school,</b> in this case, before completing year 10 and 11. Data collected in 2004 indicate that schools along with students co-construct the decisions and educational pathways that many students find themselves on, pathways which sometimes lead to withdrawal, disengagement, and, finally, <b>leaving</b> <b>school.</b> On the surface, it can appear as though early <b>school</b> <b>leaving</b> is an individualised and rational phenomenon, associated perhaps with easy-to-define events that precipitate the action of <b>leaving</b> <b>school.</b> This paper suggests that early <b>school</b> <b>leaving</b> has contradictory and institutionalised histories, and that 2 ̆ 7 winnowing 2 ̆ 7 may be an apt metaphor to describe this process...|$|R

Moreover, investigating the impact of <b>leaving</b> <b>school</b> in a downturn on other non-monetary forms of compensation may provide a broader picture of the full consequences.|$|R
5|$|In 1843, {{at the age}} of 14, Stanley's father {{insisted that}} he <b>leave</b> <b>school</b> and help him in his trade. Stanley worked in his father's {{unsuccessful}} building business, becoming adept at working with metal and wood, later to obtain employment as a plumber/drainage contractor and joiner in London. He joined his father in 1849 at an engineering works at Whitechapel, working as a Pattern Maker's Improver where he invented the steel wheel spider-spokes. His father discouraged him from seeking a patent for this invention. For the following five years, he was in partnership with his maternal uncle (a Mr Warren), a builder, at Buntingford.|$|E
5|$|In January 1886 David {{spent a week}} in Auckland {{hospital}} undergoing {{surgery to}} treat stunted muscles in his left leg which had led to curvature of his spine. His mother became sick that same year, and in 1887 lost her teaching position. His mother's condition worsened and she died of cancer on 9September 1887. With a father in his seventies, the 13-year-old David was compelled to <b>leave</b> <b>school</b> so he could help his brothers to support the family. He took {{a job with a}} local stock and station agent.|$|E
5|$|Indeed, when {{financial}} circumstances forced Manning to <b>leave</b> <b>school</b> at sixteen, {{she worked}} as a typist, and spent some time as a junior in a beauty salon. A talented artist, she took evening classes at the Portsmouth Municipal School of Art, where a fellow student described her as intellectual and aloof. In May 1928, she had a painting selected for an exhibition at Southsea, and was subsequently offered a one-woman show of her works. Manning seemed to be poised for a career as an artist, but she had meanwhile continued her interest in literature, and at the age of twenty determined instead to be a writer. Her artist's eye is apparent in her later intense descriptions of landscapes.|$|E

Jones gave the boy to her sister Annie Waller and Annie's husband, Willis Waller, to adopt, and Odell {{considered}} Annie his mother. Odell completed three years of high school, but was later forced to <b>leave</b> <b>school</b> {{to work on the}} farm. From 1935 to 1938, he was convicted of seven offenses, including assault, reckless driving, bootlegging, and carrying a concealed razor. In January 1939, he married a woman named Mollie.|$|E
5|$|Ram Narayan {{was born}} on 25 December 1927 in Amber village, near Udaipur in northwestern India. His great-great-grandfather, Bagaji Biyavat, was a singer from Amber, and he and Narayan's great-grandfather, Sagad Danji Biyavat, sang at the court of the Maharana of Udaipur. Narayan's grandfather, Har Lalji Biyavat, and father, Nathuji Biyavat, were farmers and singers, Nathuji played the bowed {{instrument}} dilruba, and Narayan's mother was a music lover. Narayan's first language was Rajasthani and he learned Hindi and, later, English. At an age of about six, he found a small sarangi left by the family's Ganga guru, a genealogist, and was taught a fingering technique developed by his father. Narayan's father taught him, but {{was worried about the}} difficulty of playing the sarangi and its association with courtesan music, which gave the instrument a low social status. After a year, Biyavat sought lessons for his son from sarangi player Mehboob Khan of Jaipur, but changed his mind when Khan told him Narayan would have to change his fingering technique. Narayan's father later encouraged him to <b>leave</b> <b>school</b> and devote himself to playing the sarangi.|$|E
