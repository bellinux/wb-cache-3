2500|$|In {{recent times}} {{there have been}} two major tax reforms in Norway. The first, the tax reform of 1992, was a {{pervasive}} and principle based reform, inline with the international trend of broader tax base and lower rates. Corporate taxation was designed so that the taxable profit should correspond to the actual budget surplus. [...] This meant, among other things that different industries, forms of ownership, financing methods and investment were treated equally (neutrality) and that revenues and related expenditures were subject to the same tax rate. In the personal income tax, a clearer distinction between <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> and investment income was introduced (split - a dual income tax system). Ordinary income, income less standard deductions and deductible expenses, was taxes at a flat rate of 28%. On personal income, income from work and pensions, there were in addition levied social security contributions and surtax. To avoid that income that was taxed at the corporate level also were taxed at the individual level (double taxation), the imputation tax credit for dividends and treasury system gains was introduced.|$|E

Effort varies continuously while there is unemployment insurance funded out of taxation of <b>labour</b> <b>incomes.</b> Increasing unemployment insurance is beneficial to employment along the deterministic stationary state, and can even in some cases lead to a Pareto welfare improvement for all agents, through general equilibrium effects, by generating higher individual real <b>labour</b> <b>incomes,</b> hence larger consumptions of employed and unemployed workers, and thus a higher production. On the other hand, the local (in) determinacy properties of the stationary state are opposite to those obtained in the competitive specification of the model (GPV, 1998) : local determinacy (indeterminacy) occurs for elasticities of capitalefficient labour substitution lower (larger) than a quite small bound. Increasing unemployment insurance {{is more likely to}} lead to local indeterminacy and thus to generate dynamic inefficiencies due to the corresponding expectations coordination failures.

5000|$|The Danish {{minority}} {{government did}} propose a dual income tax {{in the spring}} of 1985, but the opposition was reluctant to give up the idea of progressive taxation of capital income. The final tax reform of 1987 included some amount of progressive taxation of capital income, but the top marginal tax rate on capital income (56 percent) was less than the top marginal tax rate of <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> (68 percent).

50|$|The dual {{income tax}} system levies a {{proportional}} tax rate on all net income (capital, wage and pension income less deductions) combined with progressive tax rates on gross labour and pension income. This implies that <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> is taxed {{at higher rates}} than capital income, and {{that the value of}} the tax allowances is independent of the income level. The dual income tax system deliberately moves away from the comprehensive income tax (global income tax) system which taxes all or most (cash) income less deductions (net income) according to the same rate schedule. The dual income tax was first implemented in the four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) through a number of tax reforms from 1987 to 1993. The dual income tax is therefore also known as the Nordic tax system or the Nordic Dual Income Tax.|$|E
