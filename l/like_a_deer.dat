500|$|During the 2010 Asia Cup, a Sri Lankan band {{performed}} [...] "O Podu" [...] at the India vs. Pakistan cricket match held in Dambulla. In July 2011, Vikram inaugurated [...] "Liver 4 Life", {{an initiative}} launched by MIOT Hospitals to create {{awareness of the}} Hepatitis B virus. As the campaign was targeted at school and college students, the organisers tweaked the term [...] "O Podu" [...] into [...] "B Podu" [...] and made it the event's tagline to capitalise on the song's immense appeal. In a comical sequence in the film, Dhamu's character claims {{to be an expert}} of a martial art form named [...] "Maan Karate" [...] (Maan means [...] "Deer"), which is actually the art of running away <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>deer</b> when in danger. The phrase became famous and was used to name the 2014 comedy film Maan Karate because whenever there is a problem in his life, the hero (played by Sivakarthikeyan) fails to face them and runs for cover instead.|$|E
2500|$|Two-time US Open Champion Tracy Austin commented, [...] "At the net she's quite {{comfortable}} displaying excellent technique. She knows where to position herself – {{a contrast to}} many other players who get up to the net and look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>deer</b> in headlights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mireille {{was invited}} to Paris by the {{impresario}} Régis Durcourt to sing on the [...] "Song Parade" [...] television program, on 19 November 1965. Stark promised to write to her, but after months of waiting she gave up on him, and accepted Durcourt's offer. The truth has never been revealed how, but Mireille was suddenly moved-up to compete live on the Sunday 21 November 1965 episode of [...] "Jeu de la Chance," [...] a talent segment of the popular French program [...] "Télé-Dimanche." [...] Stark's ex-wife Nanou Taddéi worked at Studio 102, and probably recognized Mireille, as she participated in her earlier pre-audition. Mathieu explained that [...] "Song Parade" [...] offered only one chance to sing, while [...] "Jeu de la Chance" [...] offered many chances to sing, but only if she won, and she intended to win. Both the studio audience and telephone voters gave her a slight lead over five-time winner , so the producers called it a tie. Johnny Stark officially became her manager that night, and with his longtime assistant Nadine Joubert, helped prepare Mireille to win the contest the following week and bury Georgette. Stark and Lemaire had a mutual dislike for each other. In a short film called La guerre des Piaf (War of the Sparrows) Georgette and Mireille are interviewed separately, both are small and the same height. Mireille is surrounded by her sisters Monique and Christiane, with Johnny hovering in the background as she is interviewed {{for the first time}} on camera. She appears to be uncomfortable, staring at the floor during many of the questions, even looking dumbfounded once, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>deer</b> in the headlights. Johnny finally comes to her rescue. In a later interview, she underscored the importance of the event, stating, [...] "For me, Paris was the end of the world. I never took a train or saw a camera before. I did not know what the outcome of the adventure would be." ...|$|E
60|$|Pierre, with {{nostrils}} that quivered and distended <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>deer's,</b> {{sniffed at}} the breech.|$|R

6000|$|Once {{the hungry}} Hours were hounds Which chased the day <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{bleeding}} <b>deer,</b> And it limped and stumbled with many wounds [...] 75 Through the nightly dells {{of the desert}} year.|$|R
60|$|<b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>deer</b> he ran off, {{behind a}} large roller coaster where all was dark.|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{are light}} as air,” he said, {{looking up at}} her. “It is no labour for you to walk. You almost float, so lightly do your feet rise and fall. You are <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>deer,</b> El-Soo; you are <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>deer,</b> and your eyes are like deer’s eyes, {{sometimes}} {{when you look at}} me, or when you hear a quick sound and wonder if it be danger that stirs. Your eyes are like a deer’s eyes now as you look at me.” ...|$|E
60|$|Anne {{ran down}} the clover slope <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>deer,</b> and {{disappeared}} in the firry shadows of the Haunted Wood. Mrs. Lynde looked after her indulgently.|$|E

60|$|Ziffa ran <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hunted <b>deer,</b> {{so anxious}} was she for the {{deliverance}} of her Bible instructor. On turning sharp round {{a bend in}} the track, she plunged into the bosom of Ebony.|$|R

6000|$|... "Silas, it ain't a bad plan," [...] {{broke in}} Wetzel. [...] "Betty can run <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>deer.</b> And bein' a woman they may {{let her get}} to the cabin without shootin'." ...|$|E
60|$|Jane reeled {{and would}} have fallen, had not Tarzan, {{dropping}} his burden, caught her in his arms. She did not lose consciousness, but she clung tightly to him, shuddering and trembling <b>like</b> <b>a</b> frightened <b>deer.</b>|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{he heard}} a shriek, and he flung the spade from him {{and started for the}} bridge, looking up <b>like</b> <b>a</b> startled <b>deer.</b> Ah, there was Winifred--Joyce had hurt herself. He went on up the garden.|$|R
6000|$|... "What has Ellen done, father," [...] said Asa, with {{a degree}} of spirit, which was the more {{striking}} from being unusual, [...] "that she should be shot at <b>like</b> <b>a</b> straggling <b>deer,</b> or <b>a</b> hungry wolf?" ...|$|R
60|$|But the {{half-breed}} was {{now running}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>deer</b> and {{paid no attention}} to the words. Taking hasty but careful aim at Stiger's legs, Poke Stover pulled the trigger of his gun.|$|E
60|$|Mariano, who was {{impatient}} to return, at once darted away <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>deer,</b> {{and was soon}} lost to view among the aloes and cactuses that clothed {{the slopes of the}} Sahel hills.|$|E
6000|$|... "Christ rest you!" [...] he said. [...] "I'll do your bidding or die;" [...] and, {{turning his}} horse, {{he drove the}} rowels into its sides, causing it to bound away <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E
60|$|The party was, however, {{scarcely}} uncovered {{before a}} volley {{from a dozen}} rifles was heard in their rear; and a Delaware leaping high into the air, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wounded <b>deer,</b> fell at his whole length, perfectly dead.|$|R

50|$|Common rabbuck, Ungulagus silvicultrix: a forest-dwelling rabbuck of {{temperate}} latitudes, around 2 meters high.

60|$|The {{crowd at}} once broke up and hurried away to Ulfstede in {{separate}} groups, discussing eagerly as they went, and stepping out like {{men who had}} some pressing business on hand. Alric had already darted away <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hunted <b>deer.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Guy {{laughed with}} {{something}} {{of his former}} heartiness. [...] "She was here when the man brought news of your arrival, Wulf, but she fled away <b>like</b> <b>a</b> startled <b>deer,</b> and has, I suppose, gone to put on her best kirtle in your honour." ...|$|R

60|$|Starting violently, {{the girl}} turned round, {{stretched}} out both arms, and, with intense hope expressed in every feature, {{took a step}} forward. In an instant the expression vanished.
