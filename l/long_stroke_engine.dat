5000|$|GSXR750RR (RK), the RR {{stood for}} race replica. It was {{designed}} by Takahiko Kawaguchi and its initial purpose, apart from being a [...] "straight out of the crate racer", was a bike which could be tuned easier than its short-stroke predecessor the J, and K Suzuki GSX-R750s. This was mainly to cater for the smaller racing teams as the RK's engine reverted to the long-stroke style engine fitted in the original slabside models. Racing teams which were already adept at tuning the <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> and so were more familiar with this revived long stroke design.|$|E
50|$|Slow speed: any engine with {{a maximum}} {{operating}} speed up to 300 revolutions per minute (rpm), although most large two-stroke slow speed diesel engines operate below 120 rpm. Some very <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>engines</b> have a maximum speed of around 80 rpm. The largest, most powerful engines {{in the world are}} slow speed, two stroke, crosshead diesels.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1951 a {{completely}} new Wyvern was launched, featuring a modern Ponton, three-box shape in a monocoque body. In spite of the abandonment of the old RAC horsepower tax system which favoured <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>engines,</b> the old <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> four cylinder [...] engine from the L-series was retained and permitted a claimed top speed above 62 mi/h km/h despite the car's increased size. As before, a more powerful Vauxhall Velox was available with the new body.|$|R
50|$|This {{resulted}} from {{the vagaries of the}} Treasury's tax rating formula which took no account of the length of the <b>engine's</b> <b>stroke.</b> Very <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>engines</b> such as were given the Twelve provided good low speed torque at the expense of reliability at higher rpm. Such engines were unable to make full use of better fuels and the improved engine breathing techniques that were coming available. Morris briefly promoted the series II car with the note that it performed just like a 14 horsepower car but that brought about a clash from the summer of 1936 when Morris began to supply a six-cylinder 1818cc Morris Fourteen.|$|R
5000|$|... 1955 saw {{a change}} to Matchless and finally in 1958, {{partly due to}} lack of works support from Norton, Pip moved to <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> BMW <b>engines.</b> At the time these {{machines}} were extremely expensive and he bought his first one as a half-share with Jack Beeton, another well-known and successful British sidecar racer.|$|R
5000|$|Oakleaf was {{powered by}} a four-cylinder Burmeister and Wain <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> oil <b>engine</b> capable of {{developing}} [...] driving a single controllable-pitch propeller. She also had bow and stern variable-pitch thrust propellers. Fitted with automatic power management, the vessel could be operated with her machinery spaces unmanned - as with her sister ships, her engines could be controlled from either the ship's bridge or the (air conditioned) machinery control room.|$|R
50|$|Powered by a Gardner Marine 8L3B <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> {{reciprocal}} diesel <b>engine,</b> has a {{cruising speed}} of 9 knots. One of very few vessels {{to use a}} twin rudder system, she steers from her bow whilst going astern using a fore rudder, and conventionally steers from a large stern rudder when steaming ahead. Her steering gear is operated by chains and spliced wire driving the two large cast iron quadrants from her opposing geared ships wheel, an original feature of the vessel.|$|R
40|$|The {{piston engine}} {{irregularity}} {{is a consequence}} of the uneven power supply from the engine units. As such it contains valuable information about engines units working process. Unfortunately it is strongly influenced by torsional vibration, resonance, and propeller behavior. In order to better understand the speed irregularity phenomena the instantaneous speed was recorded and its characteristic against engine mean speed was developed. Some statistical parameters: standard error and deviation as well as variance were determined. The results were compared with propulsion plant torsional vibration. The presented results show that the irregularity of the <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>engine’s</b> speed is strongly influenced by torsional vibration phenomena. The analyzed engine has a bared speed range 37 - 43 rpm. Exactly around that range the speed irregularity reaches its maximum values of 18 % of mean speed. The analysis can be considered as qualitative look into the phenomena. However even based on the presented analysis one can observe some practical inferences. The common type of electronic indicators is used to simplify the measurement by assuming that the shaft speed is equal in between the pickup pulses. In order to increase the accuracy of the indicated power determination the use of such instrument should be avoided in the speed range which is a multiple number of the barred speed. Due {{to the fact that the}} shaft speed is irregular especially in the ranges where torsional resonance may occur the piston positioning (for example for TDC determination) purpose procedure should take it into account...|$|R
40|$|A {{model was}} {{developed}} and {{used in conjunction with}} a control-volume-type engine simulation code for performance prediction of <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> uniflow-type marine <b>engines.</b> In this model it is attempted to simulate the three different regions perceived to exist inside the cylinder during scavenging, namely the air, mixing, and combustion products regions, by modeling each region as a separate control volume. Two time-varying coefficients are used to specify the rates of entrainment of the air and the burned gases into the mixing region. Results of the use of the model for predicting the performance of a large marine two-stroke engine are presented...|$|R
50|$|The unusual {{combustion}} chamber arrangement with its angled valves {{also led to}} an unusual valve train. The block-mounted camshaft operates small wedge shaped rockers, one for each valve. In early models the camshaft acts on a simple pad on the rocker, but for later models this pad {{was replaced by a}} roller follower. The exhaust rockers act directly on the valves, whilst the inlet rockers act on pushrods running up to a second set of longer flat rockers operating the inlet valves. The Rover engine, like many 1940s and earlier British designs, was a small bore, <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> (undersquare) <b>engine</b> to keep the RAC tax horsepower rating as low as possible, thus keeping the road tax as low as possible. The IOE layout enabled Rover to use larger valves than would normally be possible in a small bore engine, allowing better breathing and better performance.|$|R
50|$|Some owners {{realised}} {{that the}} <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> 2.5-litre <b>engine</b> fitted to the TR5/6 and 2.5PI {{had the same}} dimensions as the 2-litre engine, and could be fitted to the Vitesse simply by swapping the rear engine plate, input shaft bush, and clutch, then bolting on Vitesse engine mounts. In fact it was practical (and virtually undetectable!) to strip the Vitesse Mk2 engine and rebuild with 2.5 crankshaft, pistons, and cylinder head to achieve this capacity increase. Some repowered 2.5-litre cars were fitted with the original Stromberg CD150s, some with Webers or Dellortos, and some even kept the problematic but effective mechanical Lucas petrol injection system. Unfortunately the Vitesse gearbox and diff were not really up to a 150 hp 2.5 litre engine's output. Fitting the gearbox from the 2.5 was {{not as simple as}} the engine so this remained a problem for most with the 2.5.|$|R
5000|$|The Flying Ten was a {{replacement}} for the earlier Ten with the semi-streamlined look of the Standard Flying range. The side-valve 1267 cc <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> (100 mm) <b>engine</b> had a single Zenith carburettor and could produce [...] at 4000 rpm. Drive was to the rear wheels through a 3-speed synchromesh gearbox. The suspension was conventional at first with a solid front axle but this was upgraded to an independent set-up at the front with a transverse leaf spring in 1939. A top speed of around 65 mph was attainable. Brakes were cable operated using the Bendix system. In early 1941, 150 four-doors were built for the military, after civilian production had ceased.|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{would be}} started on {{gasoline}} and the tractor {{would then be}} worked until the engine was sufficiently warm to change over. At that point, the fuel valve would be turned to switch the fuel supply from the gasoline tank to the fuel tank and the heavy fuel would flow to the carburetor. Radiator shutters or curtains were typically used to keep the engine sufficiently hot for efficient operation. Coolant temperatures in the 200 degree F range were normal. John Deere two-cylinder all-fuel tractors worked well on heavy fuel, as their <b>long</b> piston <b>strokes,</b> slow <b>engine</b> speeds and low compression ratios allowed for efficient operation. Most were also equipped with thermosiphon cooling systems that used no water pumps. Natural convection allowed the water to flow {{up and out of}} the engine block and into the top of the radiator, where it cooled and dropped and fell to continue the cycle.|$|R
40|$|In a two <b>stroke</b> <b>engine,</b> piston {{control the}} intake port {{opening and closing}} that combine the intake and {{compression}} stroke in 1800 crank rotation. The operational concept of two <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> {{is applied to the}} existing four <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> cylinder head. The four <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> cycle is more fuel-efficient, clean burning and higher engine power output due to higher volumetric efficiency, higher combustion efficiency and low sensitivity to pressure losses in exhaust system. However, the four <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> is high manufacturing cost due to more components compared to the two <b>stroke</b> <b>engine.</b> The objective of this work is to study the existing base four <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> valvetrain, design and develop piston controlled intake port for the base Modenas engine.

5000|$|The name “4=8” {{was used}} for several {{versions}} of the car between 1929 and 1932 and {{was based on the}} way that on a two <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> every descent of the piston within the cylinder is driven by an explosion inside the cylinder, whereas in a four <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> only one in two of the cylinder’s descents within the cylinder is driven by an explosion ( [...] the alternate down strokes involving merely the induction - sucking in - of a combustible mixture of fuel and air). The case made by the “4=8” name was that accordingly a two <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> worked twice as hard as a four <b>stroke</b> <b>engine,</b> and the little 4 cylinder DKW was comparable, in terms of engine effort, with an 8-cylinder powered car from an automobile manufacture fitting four <b>stroke</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gasoline-engine powered {{trimmers}} {{usually have}} a minimum of 21 cc displacement motors. At this size they can easily turn 2 mm line and some have nylon blades as accessories to the line-reel. A 32 cc engine can swing a 2.75 mm line and often has metal-blade accessories. Most trimmers use two <b>stroke</b> <b>engines</b> and require gasoline mixed with oil. Due to pollution laws four <b>stroke</b> <b>engines</b> are becoming more popular {{with a number of}} commercial weed eater models now being powered by four <b>stroke</b> <b>engines.</b> For instance, Honda, MTD and Craftsman manufacture a four <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> trimmer. Other companies, such as John Deere, now carry low-emission two-stroke engine trimmers. Stihl manufactures a hybrid four <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> trimmer using a technology called 4MIX. 4MIX trimmers have no oil reservoir. This engine is lubricated using pre-mixed gasoline, like a two-stroke engine.|$|R

40|$|A Six-stroke {{diesel engine}} was {{developed}} and its performance was evaluated. This engine had second compression and second combustion strokes which were added on the four <b>stroke</b> diesel <b>engine.</b> To control the fuel injection ratio and injection timings for first and second combustion strokes independently, two fuel pumps were attached to the engine. Effect of the fuel allocation ratio between first and second combustion <b>strokes</b> on the <b>engine</b> performance was investigated. Engine performance of the six <b>stroke</b> diesel <b>engine</b> was {{compared with that of}} the four <b>stroke</b> diesel <b>engine</b> which was the base engine of the six <b>stroke</b> <b>engine.</b> As a result, NO concentration in the exhaust gas decreased with a delaying of injection timing at second combustion stroke, but the injection timing at first combustion stroke didn't influence NO concentration. NO concentration decreased with an increase of allocation fuel ratio into the second combustion stroke. A trade-off relation between NO and soot concentration was observed against the change of allocation ratio. From the comparison between six and four <b>stroke</b> <b>engine,</b> it was confirmed that the NO concentration of the six <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> becomes lower than that of the four <b>stroke</b> <b>engine...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The modern four <b>stroke</b> {{internal}} combustion <b>engine</b> {{has been widely}} applied due to excellent {{power to weight ratio}} and reliability. However, the major downside of the even most efficient modern 4 <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> is the production of significant amounts of excess heat energy, dissipated though the cylinder walls of the engine and expelled as waste energy during the exhaust stroke of the cycle. The development of a more efficient six <b>stroke</b> {{internal combustion}} <b>engine</b> for increasing the efficiency of four <b>stroke</b> <b>engine</b> for that the final two strokes designed to used of exhaust and convert it into power stroke and finally six stroke working as exhaust stroke and also batter scavenging.

50|$|The pre-war European car {{market was}} not one market. Trade {{barriers}} fragmented it into national markets, apart from luxury cars where the extra cost of tariffs could actually make cars more exclusive and desirable. The only way for a car maker to enter another national market of a major European car making country, (and their colonial markets of the time), was to open factories there. For example, Citroen and Renault opened factories in England in this period. This situation only really changed with the post-war growth of the EEC (European Community) and EFTA. The British RAC (Royal Automobile Club) horsepower taxation system had the secondary function of excluding foreign vehicles. It was specifically targeted at the Ford Model T, which the then government feared would wipe out the fledgling indigenous motor industry. It crippled car engine design in Britain in the inter-war period, causing British car makers to produce under-square, low revving, <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>engines.</b> It was abolished after World War II {{as part of the}} British export drive for desperately needed, hard foreign currency, because it made British cars uncompetitive internationally. The technologically conservative 1930s Morris Eight, Ford Eight (Ford Model Y which was related to the German Ford Köln), and Standard Eight (Standard, later became Triumph) were named after their RAC horsepower car tax rating. The Ford Model Y had replaced the Model A in Europe in 1932 and ran until 1937. It was a much smaller and lighter car weighing a third less, with an engine two thirds smaller in capacity than the Model A. The basic Model Y 'Popular' was an important milestone in British economy cars, being the first steel-bodied four-seater saloon to sell for £100; previously the only four-wheeled car to sell for that price had been the two-seater tourer model of the Morris Minor. The Model Y was reworked into the more streamlined Ford 7Y for 1938-1939. This was restyled again into the 1939 launched Ford Anglia. Initial sales in Britain actually began in early 1940. Production was suspended in early 1942, and resumed in mid-1945. Production ceased in 1948 after a total of 55,807 had been built. The Anglia was restyled again in 1948. Including all production, 108,878 were built. When production as an Anglia ceased in October 1953, it continued as the extremely basic Ford Popular entry level car until 1959. The Ford Prefect was a differently styled and slightly more upmarket version of the Anglia launched in October 1938 and remained in production until 1941, returning to the market in 1945. The car was face lifted in 1953 from its original perpendicular or sit-up-and-beg style to a more modern three-box structure. It was sold until 1961. The Anglia, Popular and Prefect sold well for a long time despite their old fashioned technology using transverse leaf springs and beam axles for front and rear suspension, side valve engines and only partly synchromeshed three speed gearboxes. They sold on price because of limited car supply on the used car market due to the Second World War, and new car market because of the British government's post war policy of exporting cars. The Morris Eight, introduced in 1935, was a deliberate close copy of the Ford and served as a lower cost, more profitable replacement for the 1928-vintage Morris Minor which had not achieved the hoped-for success. Prices for the Morris started at £112 and it offered more equipment than the Ford and a much more modern design than the ageing Austin Seven, which meant it became the UK's bestselling car by 1939.|$|R
