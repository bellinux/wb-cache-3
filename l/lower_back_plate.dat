50|$|In {{designing}} the DAF M39, Van Doorne deliberately strived for modernity. A traditional construction {{based on some}} pre-existing truck chassis was unacceptable for that reason alone. A brandnew design however, also {{had the advantage of}} being able to apply the most weight-efficient configuration. Partly this was achieved by a welded monocoque design that needed no heavy chassis girders, but also by the use of sloped armour, that could approach the ideal envelopment of a given inner space. This was most apparent with the Pantrado 2 design that used many facets to approximate the desired curvature. This would have worked even better through the use of cast armour, but casting would have been too expensive. In fact that was even true for the complex form of the Pantrado 2; the Pantrado 3 therefore showed a simplified hull shape, reducing the number of welds; a comparison has been made with the T-34 design. In cross-section the hull was essentially a hexagon and the intersection formed by the truncating glacis, or sloped frontal plate, was therefore hexagonal too. This was somewhat obscured by the fact that this glacis gradually merged with the front fenders. The front glacis connected to the bottom plate via a narrow strongly curved section. The <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> too was hexagonal but more reclined; it was at its underside joined to a <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> glacis <b>plate,</b> both forming a wedge. The upper and lower side plates also formed wedges.|$|R

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for attaching strain gages to substrates is described.

A pair of electrodes that are connected to a current source, are applied to opposite sides of the <b>backing</b> <b>plate,</b> so that heating of the structure occurs primarily along the relatively highly conductive foil of brazing material.

40|$|Brush seal dynamic {{behavior}} is {{strongly related to}} pressure and flow fields. Developments in brush seal design have led to geometric modifications to control flow field and consequent brush seal issues including blow-down, hang-up, and pressure stiffening. Some of the geometric enhancements {{have been found to}} have common use as <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> modifications. Over the two decades of brush seal evolution, many <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations have been suggested in numerous patent disclosures. Even so, literature on the effects of geometric modifications on pressure and flow fields remains limited. This study numerically investigates brush seal pressure and flow fields for such common conceptual <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations as single and multiple grooves, with and without by-pass passages. The CFD analysis presented employs a bulk porous medium approach for the bristle pack. The effectiveness of various <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations outlining important flow features is discussed. Results indicate that <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations have a decisive role in shaping seal pressure fields. In general, it has been found that all cases having bypass configuration leak more. Moreover, the major portion of the seal leakage through fence height is fed from the <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> cavity. The single <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> groove forms a constant pressure behind the bristle pack. In contrast, multiple grooves form multiple constant pressure regions...|$|R

40|$|B. Schlegel, K. Wiebusch, 2 ̆ 6 S. Otto, PhD, Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, MN In {{recent years}} {{starting}} block platforms in swimming have been modified {{to include an}} adjustable <b>back</b> <b>plate,</b> which has drawn the attention of some researchers. Beretić, Đurović, and Okičić (2012) reported that the kick-start {{with the use of}} the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> resulted in a significantly faster ten-meter swim time (p= 0. 04) compared to a traditional track start without a <b>back</b> <b>plate.</b> The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of adding a <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> to the platform of a starting block in swimming on reaction and 12. 5 -yard swim time. This study included male and female athletes from a Division III swim team. A one-sample design was used. Subjects were allowed time to familiarize themselves with both styles of starting block. They then performed three starts followed by a 12. 5 -yard freestyle swim using the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> style and three using the traditional platform style in a randomized sequence. The average of each block style was calculated and used for analysis. The independent variable was the starting block style. The dependent variables were reaction time and 12. 5 -yard swim time. Two paired sample t-tests were used to compare the difference in reaction and 12. 5 -yard swim time between the two starts. Significance was determined at the p ≤. 025 level controlling for Familywise error rate due to the multiple t-tests needed. Results revealed that there was not a significant difference in reaction time between starting block style at the p≤ 0. 025, t (24) = 1. 955, p = 0. 063. The results indicated a statistically significant difference in 12. 5 -yard time at the p ≤. 025 for the start with the <b>back</b> <b>plate,</b> t (24) = 9. 98, p = 0. 000. The mean score for the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> reaction time (0. 429 ± 0. 109) was not significantly less than the mean score for the traditional starting block reaction time (0. 464 ± 0. 099). The mean score for the 12. 5 -yard swim time from the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> (4. 823 ±. 388) was significantly less than the mean 12. 5 -yard swim time from the traditional starting block (4. 972 ±. 399). In conclusion, this study may suggest that a <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> could be utilized to improve reaction time and 12. 5 -yard swim time for collegiate swimmers. Future research might look at force generated from different starting style. IRB# 1314 - 0265. NACSM Professional Sponsor: Stephanie Ott...|$|R

40|$|Cooling in a {{centrifugal}} compressor {{can improve the}} performance and reduce the impeller temperature. In a {{centrifugal compressor}}, external walls can be cool down, which {{is known as the}} shell cooling. This method avoids undesirable effects induced by other cooling methods. Cooling can be applied on different external walls, such as the shroud, diffuser or the <b>back</b> <b>plate.</b> This paper focuses on seeking the most effective cooling place to increase the performance and reduce the impeller temperature. It is found that shroud cooling improves the compressor performance the most. Shroud cooling with 2400 W of cooling power increases the pressure ratio by 4. 6 % and efficiency by 1. 49 %. Each 500 W increase in the shroud cooling power, increases the efficiency by 0. 3 %. Diffuser cooling and <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> cooling have an identical effect on the polytropic efficiency. However, <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> cooling increases the pressure ratio more than diffuser cooling.
