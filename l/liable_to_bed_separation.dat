30|$|Building on the {{understanding}} of the formation mechanism of <b>bed</b> <b>separations,</b> <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> water, and the analysis of the influencing factors, the main technologies <b>to</b> treat <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> water in China coal mines include: (1) cutting off source of water <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>separations</b> (interception) and draining bed-separation water (diversion); (2) breaking the buffer zone; (3) grouting and backfilling the bed-separation void, etc.|$|R
30|$|The {{formation}} of bed-separation water hazards is closed related with geological and mining factors. From geological perspective, the lithological {{properties of the}} roof strata are the main constrains of the emplacement of the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> The slant angle of coal seam is the deciding factor of {{the shape of the}} <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> and the emplacement of the maximum bed-separation height. The water source to the bed-separation water {{will have an impact on}} the water volume and hydrostatic pressure in the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> Among mining factors, when full-caving rooftop management is applied, the lifecycle of <b>bed</b> <b>separation,</b> from formation, development to maturity, is largely constrained by the cyclical rock pressure. Mining height is positively correlated <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> height. The strike length and slope width of the mining working face will determine the lifespan of the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> Mining at a constant speed can slow down water accumulation in the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b>|$|R
30|$|Major {{techniques}} {{to prevent and}} treat <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> water hazards: (i) Interception. From at a long distance, grouting through directional branch drills to fully block off the water-conductive channels between the water source and the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> (ii) Diversion. Drilling on/under ground <b>to</b> drain <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> water into the caving zone. (iii) Breaking the buffer layer. By pre-blasting the weak buffer layer before mining to create more aqueducts, through which the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> water is deconcentrated and drained through caving zone. (iv) Grouting and backfilling the bed-separation void to lower the likelihood of bed-separation water burst and contain ground subsidence. (v) Properly configuring {{the dimensions of the}} mining working face and planning a measured mining progress, etc.|$|R
30|$|Source {{of water}} <b>to</b> the <b>bed</b> <b>{{separation}}.</b> Bed separation provides potential reservoir space for underground water. Water supply determines {{the volume of}} water and hydrostatic pressure in the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> Generally, the underground water in the strata above the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> is the direct water source, which quickly fills up the bed-separation void under the negative pressure, thus driving up the water pressure in the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> up <b>to</b> the level in the upper strata (apparently, if the upper strata are insufficiently water abundant, the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> would not be filled up and bed-separation water pressure would not rise {{to that in the}} upper strata). In addition to direct water source, there would be indirect source of water (such as the Quaternary pore aquifer) that replenishes the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> through inter-stratum fissures or water-conductive structure.|$|R
30|$|Bed-separation {{water is}} one of the major water hazards in coal mines. Targeted {{researches}} on the preventive technologies are of paramount importance to safe mining. This article studied the restrictive effect of geological and mining factors, such as lithological properties of roof strata, coal seam inclination, water source <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>separations,</b> roof management method, dimensions of mining working face, and mining progress, on the formation of bed-separation water hazard. The key techniques to prevent bed-separation water-related accidents include interception, diversion, destructing the buffer layer, grouting and backfilling, etc. The operation and efficiency of each technique are corroborated in field engineering cases. The results of this study will offer reference to countries with similar mining conditions in the researches on bed-separation water burst and hazard control in coal mines.|$|R
40|$|The 6163 haulage roadway in the Qidong {{coal mine}} {{passes through a}} fault zone, which causes severe {{deformation}} in the surrounding rock, requiring repeated roadway repairs. Based on geological features in the fault area, we analyze the factors affecting roadway deformation and failure and propose the concept of roadway sensitive to stress disturbance (RSSD). We investigate the deformation and failure mechanism of the surrounding rocks of RSSD using field monitoring, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulation. The deformation of the surrounding rocks involves dilatation of shallow rocks and separation of deep rocks. Horizontal and longitudinal fissures evolve <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> and fracture zones; alternatively, fissures can evolve into fracture zones with new fissures extending to deeper rock. The fault affects the stress field of the surrounding rock to ~ 27 [*]m radius. Its maximum impact is on the vertical stress of the rib rock mass and its minimum impact is on the vertical stress of the floor rock mass. Based on our results, we propose a zonal support system for a roadway passing through a fault. Engineering practice shows that the deformation of the surrounding rocks of the roadway can be effectively controlled to ensure normal and safe production in the mine...|$|R

40|$|Groundwater inflows {{into the}} {{longwall}} coal mine following the longwall development are generally well predicted by analytical and numerical methods. However, the groundwater {{movement in the}} constrained zone above the height of fracturing is less understood. It is considered that within this zone in horizontally bedded strata groundwater flow is limited to mainly horizontal flow due <b>to</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>separation</b> {{and an increase in}} horizontal permeability. This assumption does not provide any consideration for influence of lithology and how it impacts the change in hydraulic parameters. Change in hydraulic and storage parameters in the constrained zone is extremely important as this zone provides the protection for the overlaying aquifers and ultimately ecosystems in the surficial zone. This paper uses the multilevel vertical sensors and downhole geophysical data to explain the changes in hydraulic properties and consequently intrinsic vulnerability comparing pre-mining to post mining conditions. The analysis of piezometeric pressure changes in hydrostratigraphic units indicates that redistribution of pore pressures occurs within these strata, however the recovery of pressures is not uniform and it cannot be predicted unless a detailed knowledge of geology and lithology is available. Geophysical density data compared for pre and post mining conditions indicate that the change in bulk density under stress conditions induces change in pore size distribution. Increase in bulk density results in decrease in hydraulic conductivity as a result of decrease in pore size. However, for fine grained strata bulk density decreases under stress release with a change in water content. This indicates that structural changes due to compression have occurred, and that a decrease in bulk density will impact the magnitude of change. The structural changes occur throughout the full vertical profile above the longwall panel but are more significant in homogenous sandstones than layered and bedded intervals. The surficial strata (top 40 m) experiences significant increase in bulk density and loss of saturation most likely as a result of subsidence. Understanding the nature of the distribution, dependence and changes in hydraulic parameters under stress conditions is important for defining the aquifer system and to assist with assessment of intrinsic vulnerability...|$|R
30|$|Generally, <b>bed</b> <b>separations</b> {{developed}} in the caving zone and fissure zone closer to the goaf area do not require grouting and backfilling treatment. Bed separation at a great distance from the goaf area (such as the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> in the mid or {{upper part of the}} bending zone) contains less-threatening water log, making grouting and backfilling unnecessary (unless ground subsidence demands such treatment). For disastrous <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> (i.e., the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> in {{the lower part of the}} bending zone, which is over the fissure zone), grouting and backfilling is imperative.|$|R
30|$|Empirical {{experiences}} {{have shown that}} slower mining prolongs the lifespan of <b>bed</b> <b>separations,</b> conducive <b>to</b> water accumulation.

40|$|Identifying the {{properties}} of overlying rocks in underground mining operations is important to ensure the appropriate roof support design is used to maintain stability of the mine entries. Recently J. H. Fletcher & Co. developed a monitoring and control system for roof bolters for the underground mining industry. The system records the drilling parameters used during roof bolt drilling and the information can {{provide insight into the}} physical properties of the roof strata. The parameters include thrust, rotational speed, torque and velocity and the measurements are collected every 0. 1 second during the operation. The drilling parameters were analyzed to determine the application of identifying the strength of rocks being drilled from the measurements. The data was converted into the specific energy of drilling which {{is a measure of the}} amount of energy required for removing a given unit of rock during a drilling operation. The laboratory studies completed to date indicate a fairly high correlation between the specific energy of drilling and the unconfined compressive strength of :he rocks that were drilled. Additionally, the drilling parameters were shown to be effective for identifying the presence of fractures or <b>bed</b> <b>separations</b> between rock layers. The thrust, torque and specific energy of drilling were all good indicators for identifying the fractures or separations. Regardless of the drilling parameters used during the drilling experiments, the location of the fractures were identified. In order to determine the application of the drilling parameters for identifying roof rock properties, two series of experiments were conducted. The first series of experiments used three "manufactured" roof layers that had various rock samples embedded in concrete blocks. The rock samples included three types of sandstone, marble, and argillite. Another concrete block was poured with foam inserts <b>to</b> simulate large <b>bedding</b> <b>separations</b> (2 <b>to</b> 8 -in). Two other manufactured blocks were constructed using high-strength concrete with cardboard layers embedded to simulate smaller fractures or <b>bedding</b> <b>separations.</b> The size of the cardboard layers varied from 1 / 8 - to 1 -in thick. One of the blocks had the cardboard layers embedded at an inclined angle to determine the effect of the orientation on the drilling parameters. A series of experiments was conducted with the rotational speed and the penetration rate held constant and the thrust and torque allowed to vary. The information collected from the experiments is used to determine the application of the drilling parameter measurements for identifying rock properties, fractures and <b>bedding</b> <b>separations...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{lifespan}} of <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> is {{a dynamic}} process from formation, development, and stabilizing to closing up. Grouting is often executed in the formation stage. To obtain the optimal effects, {{it is best to}} grout before the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> height reaches the maximum and before the key strata rupture, which are the two critical factors when determining the desired location of drills and timing of grouting.|$|R
30|$|Mining {{activities}} {{disrupt the}} stress and strain balance in the roof rocks and drive them to slide downward. Under normal conditions, the roof rock is composed of rock strata with varying thicknesses and hardnesses. As mining proceeds, the strata move down at different speeds, creating a void called <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> In its definition, <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> is also expressed by the deflection difference of the two contiguous strata. The underground water accumulated in the bed-separation void is thus called bed-separation water (Gui et al. 2017). The consequences of bed-separation water accidents would range from production halt to geological calamities such as rock burst, further resulting in equipment destruction and human casualties. Therefore, the formation of <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> water and hazard control are now closely studied by Chinese mining experts.|$|R

40|$|Two {{examples}} of en echelon mining-induced fractures seen in hard-rock mines provided {{a basis for}} inferring that fracture zones and <b>bedding</b> plane <b>separations</b> immediately surrounding mine openings are promoted by oblique shear into the openings. It is hypothesized that initial fractures or separations form {{at the corners of}} openings as a result of high stress and physical constraint on the rock's ability to deform elastically toward the opening. These conditions result in a locally preferred direction of shearing. The shearing, in turn, generates tensile stress that initiates a progression of systematically offset fractures approximately parallel to the direction of greatest compressive stress. The fractures or <b>bedding</b> <b>separations</b> create tabular rock layers that amplify shearing displacement through bending and dilation. Such shearing effectively reduces and redistributes the compressive stress, but significant dilation is an inevitable consequence. The combination of dilation and shearing and the progressive development of fracture zones have important implications with respect to ground support. The concept of mining-induced fractures forming as a result of shear is illustrated by two examples from coal mines. First, fractures seen at longwall faces probably result from shear associated with subsidence. The fracture zone that develops approximates or possibly defines the draw angle of subsidence. As the face advances, fractures extend downward along the lower edge of the fracture zone, while upper extensions of the fractures are pressed closed. Fracture zones in entry roofs provide a second practical example. Here, mining-induced fractures typically follow bedding planes. The shear zone model suggests that the first <b>bedding</b> <b>separations</b> develop near the edges of the roof and successive separations progress upward and toward the center. However, if the direction of greatest stress is inclined with respect to the roof, a fracture or <b>bedding</b> <b>separation</b> zone may propagate from one side only and also extend higher. Because coal ahead of the face provides some support against lateral shear deformation, <b>bedding</b> <b>separation</b> is inhibited near the face. Rock bolts installed close to the face ultimately become more strained and bent than bolts installed a few meters from the face, and bolts installed through the more remote part of a separation zone may ultimately experience the greatest tensile and bending strains. This model is supported by field data documenting progressive bolt failures that rapidly propagated downward across the roof during face advance...|$|R
