25|$|Every {{electrochemical}} capacitor has two electrodes, mechanically {{separated by}} a separator, which are ionically connected to each other via the electrolyte. The electrolyte {{is a mixture of}} positive and negative ions dissolved in a solvent such as water. At each of the two electrodes surfaces originates an area in which the <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> contacts the conductive metallic surface of the electrode. This interface forms a common boundary among two different phases of matter, such as an insoluble solid electrode surface and an adjacent <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte.</b> In this interface occurs a very special phenomenon of the double layer effect.|$|E

In addition, the group also prepared a quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte with a 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN)-based <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> that was solidified by a photochemically stable fluorine polymer, polyvinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP).|$|E
25|$|Lifetimes {{are also}} {{dependent}} on the operating voltage, because the development of gas in the <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> depends on the voltage.

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{tantalum}} electrolytic capacitors were developed in 1930 by Tansitor Electronic Inc. USA, for military purposes. The basic construction of a wound cell was adopted and a tantalum anode foil was used together with a tantalum cathode foil, separated with a paper spacer impregnated with a <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte,</b> mostly sulfuric acid, and encapsulated in a silver case.|$|E
25|$|These wet cells used liquid electrolytes, {{which were}} prone to leakage and {{spillage}} if not handled correctly.

Cyclic voltammetry results showed that large oxidation-reduction current of the copper foil appeared in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate solutions, while a much smaller current in the room temperature ionic <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolytes</b> decreased gradually, indicating that the copper foil was anodically stable. Further study by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that an unstable product was composed mainly of the carbonate and carbonyl species {{on the surface of}} the copper foil after the electrochemical measurement in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate solutions, leading to the dissolution of the copper foil. While a better passivating film from the reduction of the anions in the room temperature ionic <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolytes</b> covered the surface of copper foil and protected the copper foil from being oxidized even in a higher potential.

25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolyte {{are the most}} inexpensive type and also those with widest range of sizes, capacitance and voltage values. They are made with capacitance values from 0.1µF up to 2,700,000µF (2.7F), and rated voltages values from 4V up to 630V. The <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> provides oxygen for re-forming or self-healing of the dielectric oxide layer.

30|$|Solid {{electrolytes}} {{are able}} to provide advantages over <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolytes</b> in terms of safety, reliability, and simplicity of design, but the ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes are generally {{lower than those of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolytes.</b> Although some solid electrolytes have the highest conductivity, they have some disadvantages over other potential electrolytes, such as in mechanical strength or electrode compatibility. It is necessary to select a suitable solid electrolyte for a particular battery application based on the factors of operating parameters (such as voltage range and temperature) and battery design (such as rigid and flexible).|$|R
25|$|The {{enhanced}} performance {{may arise from}} a decrease in solvent permeation across the sealant due to {{the application of the}} polymer gel electrolyte. The polymer gel electrolyte is quasi-solid at room temperature, and becomes a viscous liquid (viscosity: 4.34 mPa·s) at 80°C compared with the traditional <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> (viscosity: 0.91 mPa·s). The much improved stabilities of the device under both thermal stress and soaking with light has never before been seen in DSCs, and they match the durability criteria applied to solar cells for outdoor use, which makes these devices viable for practical application.|$|E
25|$|Since supercapacitors do {{not rely}} on {{chemical}} changes in the electrodes (except for those with polymer electrodes), lifetimes depend mostly on {{the rate of evaporation}} of the <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte.</b> This evaporation in general is a function of temperature, of current load, current cycle frequency and voltage. Current load and cycle frequency generate internal heat, so that the evaporation-determining temperature is the sum of ambient and internal heat. This temperature is measurable as core temperature {{in the center of a}} capacitor body. The higher the core temperature the faster the evaporation and the shorter the lifetime.|$|E

After dark heating and light soaking, 90% of the initial photovoltaic efficiency was maintained – the first time such excellent thermal stability has been observed for a <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> that exhibits such a high conversion efficiency. Contrary to silicon solar cells, whose performance declines with increasing temperature, the dye-sensitized solar-cell devices were only negligibly influenced when increasing the operating temperature from ambient to 60°C.|$|E

40|$|The {{rechargeable}} Li-O- 2 battery {{has attracted}} much attention over the past decades owing to its overwhelming advantage in theoretical specific energy density compared to state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries. Practical application requires non-aqueous Li-O- 2 batteries to stably obtain high reversible capacity, which highly depends on a suitable electrolyte system. Up to now, some critical challenges remain in developing desirable non-aqueous electrolytes for Li-O- 2 batteries.

25|$|The lifetime, service life, load life or {{useful life}} of {{electrolytic}} capacitors {{is a special}} characteristic of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors, whose <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> can evaporate over time. Lowering the electrolyte level influences the electrical parameters of the capacitors. The capacitance decreases and the impedance and ESR increase with decreasing amounts of electrolyte. This very slow electrolyte drying-out depends on the temperature, the applied ripple current load, and the applied voltage. The lower these parameters compared with their maximum values the longer the capacitor's “life”. The “end of life” point {{is defined by the}} appearance of wear-out failures or degradation failures when either capacitance, impedance, ESR or leakage current exceed their specified change limits.|$|E
25|$|The oldest form of {{rechargeable}} battery is the lead–acid battery, which {{are widely used}} in automotive and boating applications. This technology contains <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte</b> in an unsealed container, requiring that the battery be kept upright and the area be well ventilated to ensure safe dispersal of the hydrogen gas it produces during overcharging. The lead–acid battery is relatively heavy {{for the amount of}} electrical energy it can supply. Its low manufacturing cost and its high surge current levels make it common where its capacity (over approximately 10 Ah) is more important than weight and handling issues. A common application is the modern car battery, which can, in general, deliver a peak current of 450 amperes.|$|E
25|$|The major {{disadvantage}} to the DSSC {{design is}} the use of the <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolyte,</b> which has temperature stability problems. At low temperatures the electrolyte can freeze, ending power production and potentially leading to physical damage. Higher temperatures cause the liquid to expand, making sealing the panels a serious problem. Another disadvantage is that costly ruthenium (dye), platinum (catalyst) and conducting glass or plastic (contact) are needed to produce a DSSC. A third major drawback is that the electrolyte solution contains volatile organic compounds (or VOC's), solvents which must be carefully sealed as they are hazardous to human health and the environment. This, along {{with the fact that the}} solvents permeate plastics, has precluded large-scale outdoor application and integration into flexible structure.|$|E

In addition, there are two main problems that hinder the development of <b>liquid</b> <b>electrolytes.</b> First, formation of the lithium dendrites on electrodes leads to serious danger due to the potential possibility of internal short circuits.
