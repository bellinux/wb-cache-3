40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to provide}} {{a better understanding of}} the technology <b>licensing</b> practices of academic research institutions. The study identifies time durations in <b>licensing</b> and incorporates these into a model to evaluate <b>licensing</b> performance. Performance is measured by the efficiency of an institution 2 ̆ 7 s technology <b>licensing</b> process and efficiency changes over time, using Association of University Technology Managers annual survey data from 1991 to 2007. Organizational characteristics influencing the <b>licensing</b> performances of 46 U. S. research institutions also are explored. The study resulted in a new approach that integrates the identification of time lags in <b>licensing,</b> analysis of efficiency change, and exploration of the influence of organizational characteristics on efficiency change. A super-efficiency variable returns to scale data envelopment analysis (DEA) model was applied to the time-lag neutralized <b>licensing</b> data, to measure the efficiency of U. S. research institutions 2 ̆ 7 <b>licensing</b> performance over time. The study also includes an innovative approach to resolving issues with the super-efficiency DEA model, including mathematical infeasibility and zero-data issues. The <b>licensing</b> mechanisms included in the study are disclosure, patent applications, patents issued, <b>licenses</b> and options executed, start-ups, and <b>licensing</b> income. The time duration from expenditure to <b>licensing</b> income, including all intermediating <b>licensing</b> processes, ranged from 2 to 27 years. The study identified the organizational characteristics related to <b>licensing</b> practice. Academic prestige and research quality are positively related to disclosure, patents granted, and start-up. The resources of a technology <b>licensing</b> office influences the number of <b>licensing</b> agreements, whereas <b>licensing</b> office experience has a positive relationship with start-ups. Increased <b>licensing</b> resources improve the efficiency of <b>licensing</b> practices, and a research institution with more dedicated <b>licensing</b> staff has improved <b>licensing</b> productivity. Private institutions improved their <b>licensing</b> practice more than public ones during the study period. On the other hand, institutions with a medical school demonstrated low efficiency. This dissertation fills a gap in the understanding of <b>licensing</b> practice and the organizational characteristics related to <b>licensing</b> performance. In addition, the study contributes to research methodology by providing a new approach to identifying time lags and improving the DEA method. The results, grounded in comprehensive observations over multiple time durations, provide an insight into the <b>licensing</b> practices of U. S. research institutions. The dissertation presents recommendations for research institutions based on the relationships identified among academic prestige, research intensity, organizational characteristics of the technology <b>licensing</b> office, and <b>licensing</b> performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} the optimal <b>licensing</b> {{contract}} in firms having different cost structures is studied when the innovator is a producing patent holder who has three alternative <b>licensing</b> strategies, namely, the fixed-fee, royalty rate, and auction strategies.

This finding differs from that of Kabiraj (2004) where the auction <b>licensing</b> method is the optimal <b>licensing</b> strategy when the innovator is a non-producing patent holder. However, when we only compare two of the <b>licensing</b> methods, namely, the fixed-fee <b>licensing</b> method and the royalty <b>licensing</b> method, we conclude that if the inside innovator <b>licenses</b> to only some of the firms, then the royalty <b>licensing</b> method will be the best strategy.
