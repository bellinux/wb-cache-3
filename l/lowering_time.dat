40|$|Around 180 genes {{have been}} found in Arabidopsis that control <b>lowering</b> <b>time</b> based on {{analysis}} of transgenic plants [1]. Most of these genes take part in the six main pathways controlling flowering; the photoperiod, vernalization and the ambient temperature pathways that respond to environmental conditions, while the age-dependent, autonomous, and gibberellin pathways involve a response to endogenous signals [2]. Flowering Locus T (FT) is a major gene involved in flowering in plants because FT encodes mobile florigen for floral induction. Mutation of the FT gene can result in delayed flowering. Using a transient CRISPR-Cas 9 expression system mediated by virus expression, it is possible to do gene-editing in plants without incorporation of exogenous DNA. We aim to develop these approaches to manipulate flowering time in plants. ...|$|E

After a fast introduction to such models, {{we start with}} the mesh building (necessary to fit the models) and show the application to a toy example with details. In the following examples we presents some funcionalities to fit more complex models, including non-Gaussian models, survival and those with two likelihoods, such as semi-continuous, missaligned and preferential sampling, where we joingly model the point pattern process. Also, we introduce non-stationary SPDE models, and show hot wo fit some space-time models, including point process, <b>lowering</b> <b>time</b> dimention and dynamic spatio-temporal regression model.

40|$|The {{enactment}} of the Clean Water Act in 1972 required that states assess and report water quality conditions biennially to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Rapid bioassessment (RBA) methods were developed to identify impaired streams in a timely and cost efficient manner. With disagreements regarding the accuracy of rapid protocols and the perceived need to standardize across programs, states began to implement more expensive and complex protocols. In 2000, California established the Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program (SWAMP), a standardized, statewide monitoring program that requires the collection, assessment and interpretation of samples at an expert/professional level, adding significant amounts of time and costs to the protocol. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine (1) if a simpler, modified RBA method produced a similar classification of impairment as the more resource-intensive SWAMP method, and (2) if identification of macroinvertebrates in the laboratory improved the accuracy of the field-based modified RBA method. I hypothesize that the modified RBA method will produce similar classifications of impairment as the SWAMP method while <b>lowering</b> <b>time</b> and costs of the entire assessment process. I performed a modified RBA method at 12 sites on urban streams in the eastern San Francisco Bay Area that had previously been sampled with the SWAMP method, and identified macroinvertebrates in the field (mField) and in the lab (mLab). Candidate biological metrics were screened against a human disturbance index (HDI) I developed that incorporated water quality conditions, an assessment of physical habitat, and a GIS analysis of land use. Four metrics were included {{in each of the three}} Indices of Biotic Integrity (hereafter, IBI). There was no significant difference in IBI scores among the three methods. IBI scores were strongly correlated between mField and mLab and moderately correlated between the modified RBA protocols and the SWAMP protocol. Condition classifications were very similar between the SWAMP and mLab IBIs. The mField IBI produced the most similar condition classifications (i. e., good, fair, bad) to the HDI. The results of this study support my hypothesis that the modified RBA methods produce similar classifications of impairment as the SWAMP method while <b>lowering</b> <b>time</b> and costs of the entire assessment process...|$|E

In this study, we aimed at estimating pollen-mediated gene flow between cultivated sunflower and a weedy conspecific sunflower population growing in the same field and at quantifying, how it {{is affected by the}} weeds' flowering time. For that purpose, we extended an existing mating model by including a temporal distance (i. e. flowering time difference between potential parents) effect on mating probabilities. Using phenological and genotypic data gathered on the crop and on a sample of the weedy population and its offspring, we estimated an average hybridization rate of approximately 10 %. This rate varied strongly from 30 % on average for weeds flowering at the crop flowering peak to 0 % when the crop finished flowering and was affected by the local density of weeds. Our result also suggested the occurrence of other factors limiting crop-to-weed gene flow. This level of gene flow and its dependence on flowering time might influence the evolutionary fate of weedy sunflower populations sympatric to their crop relative...|$|E

40|$|This letter {{introduces}} {{a study to}} precisely measure what an increase in spike timing precision can add to spike-driven pattern recognition algorithms. The concept of generating spikes from images by converting gray levels into spike timings is currently at the basis of almost every spike-based modeling of biological visual systems. The use of images naturally leads to generating incorrect artificial and redundant spike timings and, more important, also contradicts biological findings indicating that visual processing is massively parallel, asynchronous with high temporal resolution. A new concept for acquiring visual information through pixel-individual asynchronous level-crossing sampling has been proposed in a recent generation of asynchronous neuromorphic visual sensors. Unlike conventional cameras, these sensors acquire data not at fixed points {{in time for the}} entire array but at fixed amplitude changes of their input, resulting optimally sparse in space and time—pixel individually and precisely timed only if new, (previously unknown) information is available (event based). This letter uses the high temporal resolution spiking output of neuromorphic event-based visual sensors to show that <b>lowering</b> <b>time</b> precision degrades performance on several recognition tasks specifically when reaching the conventional range of machine vision acquisition frequencies (30 – 60  Hz). The use of information theory to characterize separability between classes for each temporal resolution shows that high temporal acquisition provides up to 70 % more information that conventional spikes generated from frame-based acquisition as used in standard artificial vision, thus drastically increasing the separability between classes of objects. Experiments on real data show that the amount of information loss is correlated with temporal precision. Our information-theoretic study highlights the potentials of neuromorphic asynchronous visual sensors for both practical applications and theoretical investigations. Moreover, it suggests that representing visual information as a precise sequence of spike times as reported in the retina offers considerable advantages for neuro-inspired visual computations...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} their competitiveness, numerous companies are trying to implement the Lean manufacturing concept in their production or office areas. However, {{the first step of}} Lean implementation is to explore the non-value added activities that exist in the current environment; normally, the tool used in industry is Value Stream Map (VSM). Conventional VSM only presents the situation observed and recorded manually by participants. This is only one data set and is prone to create mistake. It may not represent a real situation and may be time-consuming and labor intensive. The main focus of this research was to develop a system that is able to use RFID technology to track the material flow in production systems, automatically generating and providing VSM to users with real time data and then allowing users to remotely supervise the performance of their production facility. The development of the system is described in two papers. The first paper, The Development of an On-Line RFID-Based Facility Performance Monitoring (ORFPM) System, proposes a system which provides long term, real time lead time in each process and transportation time within two processes by using current RFID technology, and automatically uploading collected data to generate the VSM. It also combines the wireless technology to allow the use of laptops and allows users to supervise the performance of the system when they are unable to attend the shop floor. After successful development of the system, it is tested in a laboratory setting to ensure its functionality. Since laboratory testing was successful, development of the system continued. The second paper, Applications of ORFPM System for Lean Implementation in a Small Company, presents the application of ORFPM system, which assists a Lean implementation in a small manufacturing facility. The ORFPM was run {{for an extended period of}} time so that the production lead time and transportation time could be used to ensure an accurate representation of the current VSM. Moreover, kaizen events were held so that the production system can be improved in order to eliminate the non-value added activities and the production variation. The result indicates using of and ORFPM system can successfully track performance variations affecting production while <b>lowering</b> <b>time</b> consumption and labor intensity...|$|E
40|$|Stocking density {{serves as}} a sub-clinical {{stressor}} impacting natural behavior and affective state of dairy cows. However, cows rarely experience stocking density as an isolated stressor. Understanding the effects of stocking density with additional management stressors such as low-fiber diets or feed restriction {{is the next step}} in alleviating stress and improving the well-being of lactating dairy cows housed in freestall barns. The overall goal of this dissertation was to evaluate the interaction of stocking density and the feeding environment on short-term production, behavioral, ruminal fermentation, and stress responses of lactating dairy cattle. The first two studies (Chapter 2 and 3) served as preliminary research for the main studies of this dissertation. The first study objective was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} using chopped wheat straw to reduce sub-acute ruminal acidosis (SARA) in order to formulate diets for the first main study. Treatments were low straw (0 kg dry matter (DM) /d; LS) and high straw (1. 36 kg DM/d; HS). High straw appeared to effectively reduce SARA by <b>lowering</b> <b>time</b> below pH 5. 8 with minimal impact on feed intake and rumination. The second study objective was to evaluate the effect of type of blood collection tube on haptoglobin concentration across two commercially-available haptoglobin assays and evaluate assay agreement in order to determine haptoglobin concentrations for the main studies. Lithium heparinized, sodium heparinized, and K 2 -EDTA plasma resulted in increased haptoglobin concentrations compared to serum using the Tri-Delta colorimetric assay, but no differences were observed using the Life Diagnostics ELISA assay. However, there was a lack of agreement between assays and further identification of a gold-standard assay is needed before analyzing haptoglobin for the main studies. The third study (Chapter 4) investigated the interaction of stocking density (100 % and 142 % of freestalls and headlocks) and source of forage fiber (no added straw and added straw at 3. 5 % ration DM). Treatments did not impact feed intake, but straw diets tended to reduce milk production. Increasing stocking density reduced lying time but increased efficiency of stall use. Though feeding and rumination times were unaffected, overstocking shifted the location of rumination away from the freestall. Increased stocking density tended to increase stress responses. Both greater stocking density and no straw diets increased SARA, and the combination of these stressors tended to exacerbate this pH response. Adding straw to the diet reduced the negative impacts of overstocking on ruminal pH. The fourth study (Chapter 5) evaluated the interaction of stocking density (100 % and 142 %) and feed access (5 -h reduced feed access and no reduced feed access). Treatments had minimal impact on short-term feed intake and production. Overstocking affected behavior similar to responses observed in Chapter 4. Reducing feed access decreased feeding time, though cows altered feeding and rumination responses to maintain daily rumination. Both treatments shifted priorities for feeding and lying behavior, though increased stocking density had the larger impact. Though reduced feed access did not impact ruminal pH, an exacerbated response was observed when combined with increased stocking density. The combination of stocking density and feeding environment stressors exacerbate negative effects on biological function and should be avoided...|$|E
