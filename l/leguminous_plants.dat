5|$|Sandgrouse are principally seed eaters. Other {{food items}} eaten include green shoots and leaves, bulbs and berries. Insect food such as ants and {{termites}} may be eaten {{especially during the}} breeding season. The diet of many sandgrouse is highly specialised, with the seeds of {{a small number of}} plant species being dominant. This may depend on local availability but in other cases it reflects actual selection of favoured seeds over others by the sandgrouse. Seeds of <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants</b> are usually {{an important part of the}} diet. In agricultural areas oats and other grain are readily taken. Seeds are either collected from the ground or directly from the plants. Foraging techniques vary between species that coexist which reduces competition; in Namibia, double-banded sandgrouse feed slowly and methodically whilst Namaqua sandgrouse feed rapidly, exploring loose soil with their beaks and flicking it away sideways. Grit is also swallowed to help grind up food in the gizzard.|$|E

In the UK wild and {{cultivated}} clovers (Trifolium) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) are favourites; less frequently, common bird's-foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus is eaten.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of species within many genera of <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants,</b> e.g. Astragalus, Coronilla, Hippocrepis, Indigofera, Lotus, Securigera and Scorpiurus, produce {{chemicals}} that derive from the compound 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA, beta-nitropropionic acid). The free acid 3-NPA is an irreversible inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, and thus the compound inhibits the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This inhibition caused by 3-NPA is especially toxic to nerve cells and represents a very general toxic mechanism suggesting a profound ecological importance due to the big number of species producing this compound and its derivatives. A second and closely related class of secondary metabolites that occur in many species of <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants</b> is defined by isoxazolin-5-one derivatives. These compounds occur in particular together with 3-NPA and related derivatives {{at the same time}} in the same species, as found in Astragalus canadensis and Astragalus collinus. 3-NPA and isoxazlin-5-one derivatives also occur in many species of leaf beetles (see defense in insects).|$|E

25|$|A. mearnsii {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the ecosystem in its native Australia. As a pioneer plant it quickly binds the erosion-prone soil following the bushfires that are common in its Australian habitats. Like other <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants,</b> it fixes the atmospheric nitrogen in the soil. Other woodland species can rapidly use these increased nitrogen levels provided by the nodules of bacteria present in their expansive root systems. Hence they play a critical part in the natural regeneration of Australian bushland after fires.|$|E
25|$|During the larval stages, {{caterpillars}} feed on <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants</b> of {{the genus}} Crotalaria. These plants contain large amounts of toxins, particularly pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), which are found in high concentrations in the seeds. Bella moth caterpillars sequester these toxins and use them as a deterrent for predators. Since PAs are an extremely valuable resource, individual larvae compete with one another to colonize an entire pod, an elongated seed-containing pouch from the food plant. Larvae that are unable to take ownership of a pod must obtain the chemicals from leaves, where they are found at much lower densities. These caterpillars sequester smaller amounts of PAs and {{are more susceptible to}} predation.|$|E
25|$|The {{hemolymph}} toxins {{originate from}} autogenous de novo biosynthesis by the Chrysomelina beetle. Essential amino acids as valine serve as precursors {{for the production}} of the hemolymph toxins of Chrysomelina leaf beetles. The degradation of such essential amino acids provides propanoyl-CoA. This compound is further transformed into propanoic acid and β-alanine. The amino group in β-alanine is then oxidized to yield either an oxime or the nitro-toxin 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA). The oxime is cyclized to isoxazolin-5-one, which is transformed with α-UDP-glucose into the isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. In a final step, an ester is formed by transesterification of 3-nitropropanoyl-CoA to the 6´-position of isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. This biosynthetic route yields high millimolar concentrations of the secondary isoxazolin-5-one and 3-NPA derived metabolites. Free 3-NPA and glucosides that derive from 3-NPA and isoxazolin-5-one also occur in many genera of <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants</b> (Fabaceae).|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{resulting from}} mutual symbiosis of rhizobia and cultivated legume plants is therefore critical to food security as it directly affects agricultural production. Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF) {{can be an}} important factor in sustainable agriculture. The isolation and identification of different slow growing and fast growing rhizobial strains from the nodules of two <b>leguminous</b> <b>plant</b> species. Symbiotic nitrogen fixing Rhizobium spp. was isolated from (Lablab purpureus and Vigna sinensis). Nodules samples were collected from plants growing in different Districts of Bangladesh and the Glucose-Peptone Agar (GPA), Congo red, Yeast Mannitol Agar (YMA) containing 2 % NaCl were employed to make presumptive decisions on the recognition and classification of the isolated bacterial strains. All the isolates were found with poor absorption of dye Congo red and little or no growth on the media of GPA and without altering the pH. Almost all of the isolates exhibit growth on 2 % NaCl, poor growth on GPA, thus confirming the rhizobia. After biochemical tests like catalase test and citrate utilization test isolates were confirmed as Rhizobia.

2500|$|<b>Leguminous</b> <b>plants</b> such as peas, {{beans or}} lucerne {{live in a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship with certain bacteria that produce nodules on their roots. [...] The bacteria extract nitrogen from the air and convert it to nitrogenating compounds that benefit the legume. [...] When the legume dies or is harvested, its rotting roots nitrogenate the soil. Nitrogen stimulates plant growth, but overapplication softens the plant tissues, makes them more vulnerable to pests and disease, and reduces resistance to frost. It may be added by nitrogen-fixing crops, but many farmers prefer artificial fertilisers, which are quicker. The negative side-effects of adding nitrogen are mitigated by phosphates.|$|E

60|$|Bignonia speciosa.--The young shoots revolve irregularly, making narrow ellipses, spires or circles, {{at rates}} varying from 3 hrs. 30 m. to 4 hrs. 40 m.; but they show no {{tendency}} to twine. Whilst {{the plant is}} young and {{does not require a}} support, tendrils are not developed. Those borne by a moderately young plant were five inches in length. They revolve spontaneously, as do the short and non- sensitive petioles. When rubbed, they slowly bend to the rubbed side and subsequently straighten themselves; but they are not highly sensitive. There is something strange in their behaviour: I repeatedly placed close to them, thick and thin, rough and smooth sticks and posts, as well as string suspended vertically, but none of these objects were well seized. After clasping an upright stick, they repeatedly loosed it again, and often would not seize it at all, or their extremities did not coil closely round. I have observed hundreds of tendrils belonging to various Cucurbitaceous, Passifloraceous, and <b>Leguminous</b> <b>plants,</b> and never saw one behave in this manner. When, however, my plant had grown to a height of eight or nine feet, the tendrils acted much better.

60|$|At {{the outset}} you will soon find {{yourself}} involved in chemical and meteorological questions: as, for instance, when you ask--How {{is it that}} I find one flora on the sea-shore, another on the sandstone, another on the chalk, and another on the peat-making gravelly strata? The usual answer would be, I presume--if we could work it out by twenty years' experiment, such as Mr. Lawes, of Rothampsted, has been making on the growth of grasses and <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants</b> in different soils and under different manures--the usual answer, I say, would be--Because we plants want such and such mineral constituents in our woody fibre; again, because we want {{a certain amount of}} moisture at a certain period of the year: or, perhaps, simply because the mechanical arrangement of the particles of a certain soil happens to suit the shape of our roots and of their stomata. Sometimes you will get an answer quickly enough; sometimes not. If you ask, for instance, Asplenium viride how it contrives to grow plentifully in the Craven of Yorkshire down to 600 or 800 feet above the sea, while in Snowdon it dislikes growing lower than 2000 feet, and is not plentiful even there?--it will reply--Because in the Craven I can get as much carbonic acid as I want from the decomposing limestone: while on the Snowdon Silurian I get very little; and I have to make it up by clinging to the mountain tops, {{for the sake of the}} greater rainfall. But if you ask Polopodium calcareum--How is it you choose only to grow on limestone, while Polypodium Dryopteris, of which, I suspect, you are only a variety, is ready to grow anywhere?--Polypodium calcareum will refuse, as yet, to answer a word.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Clark further {{remarks on}} the desperate {{struggle}} for existence which characterises the bordering fertile zones, where rivers and marshy plains permit a more luxuriant and varied vegetable and animal life. After describing how the river sometimes rose 30 feet in eight hours, doing immense destruction, and the abundance of the larger carnivora and large reptiles on its banks, he goes on: [...] "But it was among the flora that the principle of natural selection was most prominently displayed. In such a district--overrun with rodents and escaped cattle, subject to floods that carried away whole islands of botany, and especially to droughts that dried up the lakes and almost the river itself--no ordinary plant could live, even on this rich and watered alluvial debris. The only plants that escaped the cattle were such as were either poisonous, or thorny, or resinous, or indestructibly tough. Hence we had only a great development of solanums, talas, acacias, euphorbias, and laurels. The buttercup is replaced by the little poisonous yellow oxalis with its viviparous buds; the passion-flowers, asclepiads, bignonias, convolvuluses, and climbing <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants</b> escape both floods and cattle by climbing the highest trees and towering overhead in a flood of bloom. The ground plants are the portulacas, turneras, and cenotheras, bitter and ephemeral, on the bare rock, and almost independent of any other moisture than the heavy dews. The pontederias, alismas, and plantago, with grasses and sedges, derive protection from the deep and brilliant pools; and though at first sight the 'monte' doubtless impresses the traveller as a scene of the wildest confusion and ruin, yet, on closer examination, we found it far more remarkable {{as a manifestation of}} harmony and law, and a striking example of the marvellous power which plants, like animals, possess, of adapting themselves to the local peculiarities of their habitat, whether in the fertile shades of the luxuriant 'monte' or on the arid, parched-up plains of the treeless pampas." ...|$|E
