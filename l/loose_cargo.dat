50|$|In 1957, a {{few weeks}} after the tragic loss of Pamir in mid-Atlantic and shortly after having been {{severely}} hit by a storm, Passat was decommissioned. She had almost experienced the same fate as the Pamir when her <b>loose</b> barley <b>cargo</b> shifted.|$|R
50|$|On a ship, cargo must be stowed evenly so {{that the}} ship sits upright. All ships are {{vulnerable}} to cargo shifting, causing the ship to develop a list to one side. However sailing ships are particularly vulnerable because the ship naturally heels over {{in reaction to the}} force of the wind on the sails. If the cargo is not adequately secured the cargo may fall to the leeward side of the ship. <b>Loose</b> <b>cargos</b> (e.g. grain) flow downhill like water if not adequately secured (e.g. by shifting boards) and are particularly prone to shifting. If a large quantity of cargo shifts the ship may develop such a heavy list that she capsizes. A catastrophic cargo shift caused the loss of the tall ship Pamir in 1957.|$|R
60|$|We {{found it}} very easy to sell here {{to the value of}} one hundred and thirty {{thousand}} pieces of eight, in all sorts of China and East-India goods; for still, though we had some of the English <b>cargo</b> <b>loose,</b> we let none of it be seen. We took most of the money in gold uncoined, which is got out of the mountains in great quantities, and of which we shall have occasion to speak more hereafter.|$|R

5000|$|Conventional vessels have a {{traditional}} cargo operation with top opening hatches and cranes/derricks. On such ships, when facing wet weather, the hatches {{need to be}} closed to prevent heavy rain from flooding the holds.

40|$|Molecular motors are {{involved}} in key transport processes inside actin-based cellular protrusions. The motors carry cargo proteins to the protrusion tip which participate in regulating the actin polymerization, and {{play a key role}} in facilitating the growth and formation of such protrusions. It is observed that the motors accumulate at the tips of cellular protrusions, and in addition form aggregates that are found to drift towards the protrusion base at the rate of actin treadmilling. We present a one-dimensional driven lattice model, where motors become inactive after delivering their cargo at the tip, or by <b>loosing</b> their <b>cargo</b> to a cargo-less neighbor. The results suggest that the experimental observations may be explained by the formation of traffic jams that form at the tip. The model is solved using a novel application of mean-field and shock analysis. We find a new class of shocks that undergo intermittent collapses, and on average do not obey the Rankine-Hugoniot relation. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
6000|$|For Bryan I now got a young {{gentleman from}} Oxford, the Rev. Edmund Lavender, who was {{commissioned}} {{to teach him}} Latin, when the boy was in the humour, and to ground him in history, grammar, and the other qualifications of a gentleman. Lavender was a precious addition to our society at Hackton. He was the means of making a deal of fun there. He was the butt of all our jokes, and bore them with the most admirable and martyrlike patience. He was one {{of that sort of}} men who would rather be kicked by a great man than not be noticed by him; and I have often put his wig into the fire {{in the face of the}} company, when he would laugh at the joke as well as any man there. It was a delight to put him on a high-mettled horse, and send him after the hounds,--pale, sweating, calling on us, for Heaven's sake, to stop, and holding on for dear life by the mane and the crupper. How it happened that the fellow was never killed I know not; but I suppose hanging is the way in which HIS neck will be broke. He never met with any accident, to speak of, in our hunting-matches: but you were pretty sure to find him at dinner in his place at the bottom of the table making the punch, whence he would be carried off fuddled to bed before the night was over. Many a time have Bryan and I painted his face black on those occasions. We put him into a haunted room, and frightened his soul out of his body with ghosts; we let <b>loose</b> <b>cargoes</b> of rats upon his bed; we cried fire, and filled his boots with water; we cut the legs of his preaching-chair, and filled his sermon-book with snuff. Poor Lavender bore it all with patience; and at our parties, or when we came to London, was amply repaid by being allowed to sit with the gentlefolks, and to fancy himself in the society of men of fashion. It was good to hear the contempt with which he talked about our rector. 'He has a son, sir, who is a servitor: and a servitor at a small college,' he would say. 'How COULD you, my dear sir, think of giving the reversion of Hackton to such a low-bred creature?' ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} perspectives {{as to what}} is actually considered LTL. Full Truck Load carriers can put anywhere from 2 to 6 different people's shipments on a trailer and since each shipment is technically “less than a truckload” they would consider that to be LTL. There are also freight companies who do not specialize in truck loads, but rather, consolidate larger volume shipments from about 2 to 12 pallets (or about 4000 to 24000 pounds) and consider themselves LTL Carriers. Finally, the most commonly referenced LTL is shipped via “common” carriers who handle freight above what would normally ship via FedEx Ground, or UPS or U.S. Mail parcel services (about 150 pounds) to just under what would usually be considered a Truck Load at about 20,000 pounds or more than 14 pallets. LTL common carriers {{are also more likely to}} accept <b>loose</b> (non-palletized) <b>cargo</b> than the other two. LTL shipments typically weigh between 151 and 20000 lb. Less than Truckload carriers use [...] "hub and spoke" [...] operations where small local terminals are the spokes ('end of line') and larger more central terminals are the hubs (also called Distribution Centers or DC's). Spoke terminals collect local freight from various shippers and consolidate that freight onto enclosed trailers for transporting to the delivering or hub terminal where the freight will be further sorted and consolidated for additional transporting (also known as linehauling). In most cases, the end of line terminals employ local drivers who start the day by loading up their trailers and heading out to make deliveries first. Then when the trailer is empty they begin making pickups and return to the terminal for sorting and delivery next day. Because of the efficiency of this order of operations most deliveries are performed in the morning and pickups are made in the afternoon.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, Raahe was a port city. In {{the late}} Age of Sail, 1850s and on, {{shipping}} companies in Raahe owned Finland's largest fleet of sailing vessels, 60 in total at their height. Currently, {{the port of}} Raahe is the sixth busiest port in the country, with 700 ships visiting each year. Cargo that is transported through the port includes raw materials and <b>loose</b> <b>cargo,</b> steel, lumber, containers and contract-shipped goods.|$|E
50|$|Dollies for loose baggage {{are used}} for the {{transportation}} of loose baggages, oversized bags, mail bags, <b>loose</b> <b>cargo</b> carton boxes, etc. between the aircraft and the terminal or sorting facility. Dollies for loose baggage are fitted with a brake system which blocks the wheels from moving when the connecting rod is not attached to a tug. Most dollies for loose baggage are completely enclosed except for the sides which use plastic curtains to protect items from weather. In the US, these dollies are called Baggage Cart, but in Europe Baggage Cart means passenger baggage trolleys.|$|E
50|$|Also {{important}} is knowing {{the condition of}} the spare tire, jack and lug wrench upon purchase of a used car. This, among other things, is one very important item many used car buyers overlook when inspecting a potential purchase. If the vehicle is missing any of the items that go with a spare tire, it's possible to purchase them again from the manufacturer's dealership. It's also possible to buy the tools used, or from a junkyard, though if one chooses this route it is of utmost importance that {{the condition of the}} items be inspected thoroughly before storing them in your car. It's also possible to purchase a jack and a universal lug nut wrench (usually shaped like a + sign) from an auto parts store or the automotive section of a department store, though these items will likely not fit in the vehicles designated spare tire tool storage location and will likely require that the items remain <b>loose</b> in the <b>cargo</b> area. It is worth bearing in mind that, in an attempt to decrease theft, numerous cars on the road today (especially those with alloy wheels) may use one or more security caps or nuts on a wheel. These can only be removed with a specific tool which should be present in the car's tool kit. Without this tool {{it will be difficult to}} remove a wheel.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a small scale}} rescue of part of a boat subject to river erosion, with quite unexpected implications for three areas of enquiry: {{the evolution of the}} Oxford Thames from commercial waterway to leisure activities; the challenge of reconstructing a possibly unique river craft from small areas of its inner hull; and reflections on the geomorphology {{of one of the most}} closely studies flood plains in England. The story started in 2003 when cabling works on the east bank f the Thames at Medley exposed a boat eroding from the bank, notified to Oxford City Council 2 ̆ 7 s archaeologist. The boat was of clench bolt construction and its exposed remains presented a risk to bathers, stock and navigation. In the context of Port Meadow 2 ̆ 7 s protected status and the uncertain age of the vessel it was clear that any investigation would have to be carefully designed so as not to compromise the vessel or its surroundings. With the aid of the English Heritage Maritime Team and students of the OUDCE MSc in Landscape Archaeology course, the boat was investigated in early June 2004 along with a topographical, geophysical and environmental survey of the surrounding area. The boat was tentatively established as a punt-like vessel approximately 20. 6 m. long by 2 m. wide. Its hull construction had similarities to a canal narrow boat, but the exposed end, whether bow or stern, was squared. No tree 0 ring date could be recovered from the fast-grown timbers, but the historical evidence would support a late 18 th or 19 th-century date for its abandonment. Auger survey of the river bank suggests it was abandoned in riverside reed beds rather than in a separate channel. Its form is such that is may have been used for transporting <b>loose,</b> heavy <b>cargo,</b> such as sand or gravel along the Thames and would have been robust enough to navigate flash locks like the one that functioned at Medley from 1790 to 1926. This report draws on archaeological, historical and ecological research to better understand the remains of the boat in context of the protected meadow, and so promotes a strategy for its conservation and any further investigation...|$|R
