25|$|The Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field in}} southeastern British Columbia consists of numerous small, basaltic volcanoes and extensive lava flows. Many individual volcanoes {{in the field}} have been active for the last 3 million years during which time the region was covered by thick glacial ice at least twice, prior to the well known Fraser Glaciation (also known as the Wisconsin Glaciation). The origin of the volcanism is yet unknown but is probably related to crustal thinning. The last eruption in the field was at Kostal Cone in 1500. Volcanism within the field has also created the -high Helmcken Falls, which is the fourth highest waterfall in Canada. It owes its foundation to the deposits of volcanic rock that were placed down in the wide valley of the Murtle River. <b>Layer</b> <b>upon</b> <b>layer</b> of fresh lava created flat areas, over which enormous floods flowed during the last ice age.

Almost universally praised, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay, About a Boy (2002) {{was determined by the}} Washington Post to be [...] "that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure, prickly independence over fetishised coupledom, and honesty over typical Hollywood endings." [...] Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "The acid comedy of Grant's performance carries the film [...] gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs," [...] while Roger Ebert observed that [...] "the Cary Grant department is understaffed, and Hugh Grant shows here that he is more than a star, he is a resource." [...] Released a day after the blockbuster , About a Boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful Grant films, making all of $129million globally. The film earned Grant his third Golden-Globe nomination, while the London Film Critics Circle named Grant its Best British Actor and GQ honoured him as one of the magazine's men of the year 2006. [...] "His performance {{can only be described as}} revelatory," [...] wrote critic Ann Hornaday, adding that [...] "Grant lends the shoals <b>layer</b> <b>upon</b> <b>layer</b> of desire, terror, ambivalence and self-awareness." [...] The New York Observer concluded: [...] " [...] gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. In the end, the film comes over as a messy delight, thanks to the skill, generosity and good-sport, punching-bag panache of Mr. Grant's performance." [...] About a Boy also marked a notable change in Grant's boyish look. Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman took note of Grant's maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it [...] "looked good on him." [...] He added that Grant's [...] "pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with 'love me' cuteness now betray a shark's casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it's not just his surface that's more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so, he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency." ...|$|E

2500|$|Empson {{is today}} {{best known for}} his {{literary}} criticism, and in particular his analysis of the use of language in poetical works: his own poems are arguably undervalued, although they were admired by and influenced English poets in the 1950s.

Empson's best-known work is the book Seven Types of Ambiguity, which, together with Some Versions of Pastoral and The Structure of Complex Words, mines the astonishing riches of linguistic ambiguity in English poetic literature. Empson's studies unearth <b>layer</b> <b>upon</b> <b>layer</b> of irony, suggestion and argumentation in various literary works, applying a technique of textual criticism so influential that often Empson's contributions to certain domains of literary scholarship remain significant, though they may no longer be recognized as his.
