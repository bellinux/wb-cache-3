40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the derivation of <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> and confidence bounds for problems involving overdetermined linear systems with noise in all measurements, {{often referred to}} as total-least-squares (TLS). It has been shown previously that TLS provides maximum likelihood estimates. But rather than being a function solely of the variables of interest, the associated <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> increase in dimensionality with the number of equations. This has made it difficult to derive suitable confidence bounds, and impractical to use these probability functions with Bayesian belief propagation or Bayesian tracking. This paper derives <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> that are defined only on the parameters of interest. This has two main advantages: first, the <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> are much easier to use within a Bayesian framework; and second it is straightforward to obtain a reliable confidence bound on the estimates. We demonstrate the accuracy of our confidence bound in relation to others that have been proposed. Also, we use our theoretical results to obtain <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> for estimating the direction of 3 d camera translation. 1...|$|R

25|$|In statistics, Whittle {{likelihood}} is an approximation to the <b>likelihood</b> <b>function</b> of {{a stationary}} Gaussian time series. It {{is named after}} the mathematician and statistician Peter Whittle, who introduced it in his PhD thesis in 1951.|$|E
25|$|ABC methods {{bypass the}} {{evaluation}} of the <b>likelihood</b> <b>function.</b> In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} Statistics in Medicine paper, Warn, Thompson and Spiegelhalter (WTS) made a {{comparison}} between the Bayesian approach to the meta-analysis of binary outcomes and a popular Classical approach that uses summary (two-stage) techniques. They included approximate summary (two-stage) Bayesian techniques in their comparisons in an attempt undoubtedly to make the comparison less unfair. But, as this letter will argue, there are techniques from the Classical approach that are closer-those based directly on the likelihood-and they failed to make comparisons with these. Here the differences between Bayesian and Classical approaches in meta-analysis applications reside solely in how the <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> are converted into either credibility intervals or confidence intervals. Both summarize, contrast and combine data using <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions.</b> Conflating what Bayes actually offers to meta-analysts-a means of converting <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> to credibility intervals-with the use of <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> themselves to summarize, contrast and combine studies is at best misleading...|$|R
50|$|The {{mathematical}} {{foundations and}} the first rigorous analysis of these particle algorithms are due to Pierre Del Moral in 1996.

The unbiased particle estimator of the <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> {{presented in this article}} is used today in Bayesian statistical inference.|$|R
25|$|Lastly Bayes theorem is coherent. It is {{considered}} the most appropriate way to update beliefs by welcoming the incorporation of new information, as is seen through the probability distributions (see Savage and De Finetti). This is further complemented {{by the fact that}} Bayes inference satisfies the likelihood principle, which states that models or inferences for datasets leading to the same <b>likelihood</b> <b>function</b> should generate the same statistical information.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Peter Diggle and Richard Gratton {{suggested}} using {{a systematic}} simulation scheme to approximate the <b>likelihood</b> <b>function</b> {{in situations where}} its analytic form is intractable. Their method was based on defining a grid in the parameter space and using it to approximate the likelihood by running several simulations for each grid point. The approximation was then improved by applying smoothing techniques to the outcomes of the simulations. While {{the idea of using}} simulation for hypothesis testing was not new, Diggle and Gratton seemingly introduced the first procedure using simulation to do statistical inference under a circumstance where the likelihood is intractable.|$|E
500|$|Logarithms {{are used}} for maximum-likelihood {{estimation}} of parametric statistical models. For such a model, the <b>likelihood</b> <b>function</b> depends {{on at least one}} parameter that must be estimated. [...] A maximum of the <b>likelihood</b> <b>function</b> occurs at the same parameter-value as a maximum of the logarithm of the likelihood (the [...] "loglikelihood"), because the logarithm is an increasing function. The log-likelihood is easier to maximize, especially for the multiplied likelihoods for independent random variables.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of how to choose between di#erent <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> for motion estimation. To this end, we formulate motion estimation as a problem of Bayesian inference and compare the <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> generated by various models for image formation. In contrast to alternative approaches which focus on noise in the measurement process, we propose to introduce noise on the level of the velocity, thus allowing it to vary around a given model. We show that this approach generates additional normalizations not present in previous <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions.</b> We numerically evaluate the proposed likelihood in a variational framework for segmenting the image plane into domains of piecewise constant motion. The evolution of the motion discontinuity set is implemented using the level set framework...|$|R

2500|$|Approximate Bayesian {{computation}} (ABC) {{constitutes a}} class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based [...] statistical inference, the <b>likelihood</b> <b>function</b> is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the <b>likelihood</b> <b>function</b> can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the <b>likelihood</b> <b>function</b> might be computationally very costly to evaluate.|$|E

Four distinct informational situations of particular relevance to search phenomena are identified, each one corresponding to different data-availability conditions.

40|$|<b>Likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> {{of spatial}} autoregressive models with normal but heteroskedastic {{disturbances}} have been already derived [Anselin (1988, ch. 6) ]. But {{there is no}} implementation for maximum likelihood estimation of these <b>likelihood</b> <b>functions</b> in general (heteroskedastic disturbances) cases. This {{is the reason why}} less efficient IV-based methods, 'robust 2 -SLS' estimation for example, must be applied when disturbance terms may be heteroskedastic. In this paper, we develop a new computer program for maximum likelihood estimation and confirm the efficiency of our estimator in heteroskedastic disturbance cases using Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R
