She studied law at Stockholm University and carried out her studies in Uppsala where she, in 1970, {{successfully}} defended her dissertation in Commercial Law; Studies in the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sale</b> of Goods (Studier i Köprätt).

Focus was put on those special considerations relevant to the right of rescission which depended on how far performance had proceeded when the question of rescission came up. Five years later, in 1975, Anna Christensen was appointed Professor in Private Law at the Faculty of Law at Lund University.|$|E

50|$|The {{time and}} place of {{performance}} are usually stipulated in the contract. The first port of call, therefore, {{is to examine the}} contract and determine whether or not it stipulates a particular place for performance. If there is no specific stipulation, the type of contract generally determines the place for the requisite performance. In the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> for instance, it is the buyer's obligation to fetch the item from the seller.

50|$|The {{legal effect}} of suspensive {{conditions}} in the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> {{is a matter of}} some controversy, but effectively the position is this: Unlike other contracts, a contract subject to a suspensive condition only becomes a contract of sale once the condition is fulfilled. Since this is contrary to the common-law position (and, indeed, to logic), the significant types of contracts with the character of a sale, and subject to suspensive conditions, have been covered by legislative amendments, so that the anomaly does not apply. Most of its significant effects in practice have been ameliorated by legislation.|$|E

50|$|The South African law of lease {{is an area}} of {{the legal}} system in South Africa which {{describes}} the rules applicable to a contract of lease (or letting and hiring, Lat locatio conductio, Afrik huur en verhuring). This is broadly defined as a reciprocal agreement between two parties, the lessor and the lessee, in terms of which one, the lessor, binds himself to give the other, the lessee, the temporary use and enjoyment of a thing, in whole or in part, or of his services or those of another person; the lessee, meanwhile, binds himself to pay a sum of money as compensation, or rent, for that use and enjoyment.

40|$|Since {{the title}} passage rule evolved out <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> {{commercial}} <b>sales,</b> {{it is appropriate}} to question contemporary judicial and administrative reliance on the concept of title, which, in the modern <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales,</b> exists largely as an historical footnote. It would be logical at this time to incorporate into source analysis changes in the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> commercial <b>sales</b> and to recognize explicitly that the passage of risk of loss from the seller to the buyer ought to determine the source of gains in international <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> personal property. The purpose of this Article is (1) to examine the role of the title passage rule in U. S. taxation of multinational enterprises in light <b>of</b> international <b>law</b> and jurisdictional legal principles; (2) to urge that any Congressional reexamination of the rule take into full account both the historical context in which the rule was created and the policy forces that contributed to its maturation; and (3) to reconcile judicial opinions and administrative pronouncements in the tax area with the abandonment of the title concept in commercial law. It is time for the courts to explicitly recognize both the centrality of risk of loss passage and the irrelevance of passage of title and to apply a risk of loss passage rule when determining the source of gains in international <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> personal property. If Congress reexamines the statutory rules for sourcing gains from <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> inventory property, it must recognize that the title passage rule encompasses a risk of loss passage rule under which determinations of source of income reflect the economic substance <b>of</b> the underlying <b>sales</b> transactions, and, therefore, a total repeal of the title passage rule is not warranted...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} {{to what extent the}} Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 (CPA) influences the common <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> in South Africa. “Common law of sale” refers to the essentialia of sale (the minimum characteristics that parties must have consensus on to conclude a valid sale). The parties must have consensus on the intention to buy and sell, the things sold and the purchase price. The common <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> also refers to the common law duties of the parties, the duties of the seller in particular (conversely therefore the rights of the buyer). The primary duties of the seller which will be investigated are: a. the duty of safe-keeping (including and investigation into the passing of benefit and risk doctrine); b. the duty of delivery and transfer of ownership; c. the warranty against eviction; and d. the warranty against latent defects. The primary common law duties of the buyer to pay the purchase price and accept the thing sold are included in the investigation as well. The formalities required in certain sale agreements, that wording must be in plain language as well as the buyer’s cooling-off rights are also investigated. An investigation into the influence of the CPA on the common <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> in South Africa warrants a systematic framework and modus operandi which are: a. an investigation into the historical background of the common <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> and its principles in the Roman law and Roman-Dutch law; b. a critical analysis of the position where the CPA is not applicable (the common law position); c. an extensive analysis and critical evaluation of the relevant provisions of the CPA and the influence thereof on the common law of sale; d. a comparative analysis of the appropriate provisions in Scotland and Belgium; e. a conclusion of the influence of the CPA on the common <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> (whether the particular common <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> principle is confirmed, amended or excluded in terms of the Act); and f. recommendations (taking into account the comparative analysis) regarding the rectification of uncertainties and ambiguities that arose {{as a result of the}} investigation. It is also important to remember that the existing principles of the common <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> will still be applicable for transactions and agreements which fall outside the application of the Act. The golden rule to keep in mind when investigating the influence of the CPA on the common <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> is to determine which approach and interpretation will be most beneficial to the consumer.

40|$|Ernst Rabel’s book The <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sale</b> of Goods, a {{study in}} {{comparative}} law, celebrated the 70 th birthday in 2006, {{one year after the}} 50 th anniversary of the death of the greatest German legal comparativist. This jubilee, in conjunction with the 80 th anniversary of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut, now the Max Planck Institute for Comparative and International Private Law in Hamburg, calls for a reflection on the reception of Rabel’s most famous work in German and its importance today. Rabel, who helped found the Institute and served as its first director, laid the groundwork for a worldwide <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> of goods with his oeuvre. He himself had proposed the conception of such an international <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> of goods in 1928 and published a Draft of a Uniform <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sale</b> of Goods in 1935. His ideas did not come to fruition until 1964, when the Uniform Law on the Formation of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Hague Formation Convention) and the Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the International Sale of Goods (Hague Sales Convention) was passed. But the success of these conventions was limited; they attracted only very few ratifications. Their successor, however, the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) of 1980, has achieved much greater significance: two thirds of international and foreign trade are governed by the CISG. Furthermore, Rabel, who is seen as the founder of modern legal comparison in Germany, also {{had an impact on the}} German Civil Code (BGB) : when the BGB was modernised in 2002 (also to implement several EC directives), the CISG and Rabel’s suggestions were partly used as a model. For example, the rules on warranty (Gewährleistungsrecht) as well as impossibility were integrated into the general rules on breach of contract, as he had proposed...|$|E
