And whatever that queer creature understands, he understood absolutely his lord's two fixed ideas: first, that the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> is everything; and second, that he himself was to have the gold of Glengyle.

As a traveller, Lady Mary engaged in the contemplation of cultural landscapes: she attempted to understand the social logic of the communities she met and to assess the cultural distance between the English society and the local customs of the countries she visited. Within this large social and cultural framework, the focus of her keen spirit of observation is represented, in many <b>of</b> her <b>letters,</b> by gender dynamics and the status of women, thus allowing a feminine configuration of the map of continental Europe and the Ottoman Empire and a comparative understanding of femininity and expected feminine behaviour. Therefore, the contention of this paper is that, in Lady Mary’s letters, the female-traveller’s gaze ends in meditation and self-contemplation, and functions as a means of comparing and reassessing female identity...|$|R
