5|$|Russian customs {{officials}} twice {{refused to let}} the target enter the country because of missing or incomplete paperwork. Over the span of a few days, the target traveled over the Atlantic Ocean five times. On its arrival in Russia in June 2009, the berkelium was transferred to Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (RIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Ulyanovsk Oblast, where it was deposited as a 300-nanometer-thin <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> titanium film. In July 2009, it was then transported to Dubna, where it was installed in the particle accelerator at JINR. The calcium-48 beam was generated by chemically extracting the small quantities of calcium-48 present in naturally occurring calcium, enriching it 500 times. This work {{was done in the}} closed town of Lesnoy, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia.|$|E
25|$|The reflector, {{made out}} of vapourised {{aluminum}} deposited in an extremely thin <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> metal, glass or plastic substrate, can become dirty, oxidised, or burnt, and lose its specularity. This can happen if water enters the headlamp, if bulbs of higher than specified wattage are installed, or simply with age and use. Reflectors thus degraded, if they cannot be cleaned, must be replaced.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows that}} the total {{capacitance}} of the capacitor Ce-cap is mainly determined by the anode capacitance CA when the cathode capacitance CK is very large compared with the anode capacitance CA. This requirement is given when the cathode capacitance CK is approximately 10 {{times higher than the}} anode capacitance CA. This can be easily achieved because the natural oxide <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cathode surface has a voltage proof of approximately 1.5V and is therefore very thin.|$|E

500|$|The second {{method of}} {{recovering}} older rock {{is through the}} drilling of deep core samples; however, the cores have proved difficult to date, and several samples from depths of around [...] that suggested dates as old as 450,000 years have since been found erroneous. More reliable paleomagnetic dating, limited to rocks dating from after Kīlauea's emergence from the sea, has suggested ages of around 50,000 years. Exposed flows above sea level have proved far younger. Some of the oldest reliably dated rock, 43,000 years old, comes from charcoal sandwiched beneath an ash <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fault scarp known as Hilina Pali; however, sampled dated from higher up the scarp indicate ash deposition at an average rate of [...] per thousand years, indicating the oldest exposed flows, {{from the base of}} the feature, could date back as far as 70,000 years. This date is similar to that of the oldest dated extant lava flow, a southwestern rift zone flow with an uncorrected radiocarbon dating of approximately 4650 BC.|$|E
500|$|Experiments {{are being}} {{performed}} on the Avogadro Project's silicon spheres to determine whether their masses are most stable when stored in a vacuum, a partial vacuum, or ambient pressure. However, no technical means currently exist to prove a long-term stability any better {{than that of the}} IPK's because the most sensitive and accurate measurements of mass are made with dual-pan balances like the BIPM's FB2 flexure-strip balance (see External links, below). Balances can only compare the mass of a silicon sphere to that of a reference mass. Given the latest understanding of the lack of long-term mass stability with the IPK and its replicas, there is no known, perfectly stable mass artifact to compare against. Single-pan scales, which measure weight relative to an invariant of nature, are not precise to the necessary long-term uncertainty of [...] parts per billion. Another issue to be overcome is that silicon oxidizes and forms a thin layer (equivalent to [...] silicon atoms) of silicon dioxide (quartz) and silicon monoxide. This layer slightly increases the mass of the sphere, an effect that must be accounted for when polishing the sphere to its finished dimension. Oxidation is not an issue with platinum and iridium, both of which are noble metals that are roughly as cathodic as oxygen and therefore don't oxidize unless coaxed {{to do so in the}} laboratory. The presence of the thin oxide <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> silicon-sphere mass prototype places additional restrictions on the procedures that might be suitable to clean it to avoid changing the layer's thickness or oxide stoichiometry.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{industrial}} and medical applications exist for silane and functionalized silanes. For instance, silanes {{are used as}} coupling agents to adhere fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers to certain polymer matrices, stabilizing the composite material. In other words, silane coats the glass fibers to create better adhesion to the polymer matrix. They {{can also be used}} to couple a bio-inert <b>layer</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> titanium implant. Other applications include water repellents, masonry protection, control of graffiti, applying polycrystalline silicon layers on silicon wafers when manufacturing semiconductors, and sealants. The semiconductor industry used about 300 metric tons per year of silane in the late 1990s. More recently, a growth in low-cost solar photovoltaic module manufacturing has led to substantial consumption of silane for depositing hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on glass and other substrates like metal and plastic. The PECVD process is relatively inefficient at materials utilization with approximately 85% of the silane being wasted. To reduce that waste and the ecological footprint of a-Si:H-based solar cells further several recycling efforts have been developed.)". , [...]|$|E
