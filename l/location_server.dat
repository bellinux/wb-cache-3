However, such routing protocols are heavily dependent {{on the existence of}} scalable location management services. In this paper, we present a novel scheme to perform scalable location management. With any location management schemes, a specific node, A, in the network trusts a small subset of nodes, namely its <b>location</b> <b>servers,</b> and periodically updates them with its location. Our approach adopts a similar strategy, but a different and original approach to select such <b>location</b> <b>servers.</b> The main contributions of the paper are: First, we present a selection algorithm used to designate <b>location</b> <b>servers</b> of a node by its identifier. Second, we propose a hierarchical addressing model for mobile ad-hoc networks, where node locations could be represented at different accuracy levels. With this approach, different <b>location</b> <b>servers</b> may carry <b>location</b> information of different levels of accuracy and only a small set of <b>location</b> <b>servers</b> needs to be updated when the node moves. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we are able to show that the control message overhead is bounded under our scheme.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new distributed location management strategy for cellular mobile systems. Its salient features are fast location update and query, load balancing among <b>location</b> <b>servers,</b> and scalability. The strategy employs dynamic hashing techniques and quorums to manage location update and query operations. The proposed strategy {{does not require}} a home location register (HLR) to be associated with each mobile node. Location updates and queries for a mobile node are multicast to subsets of <b>location</b> <b>servers,</b> which change with time depending on the location of mobile node/querying node and load on the servers. Simulation experiments demonstrate that such dynamism prevents situations of heavy load on some <b>location</b> <b>servers</b> when mobile nodes are not uniformly distributed in space, or when some mobile nodes have their location updated or queried more often than others. Also, queries return the latest location information of a mobile node with a very high probability. The proposed scheme requires at most one unicast and two rounds of message multicasting for location update and query operations. All multicast messages have a small payload and are restricted to the high bandwidth wired part of the mobile network resulting in low communication overhead. Moreover, if a quorum of <b>location</b> <b>servers</b> gets overloaded, part of its load can be transferred to another lightly loaded quorum using dynamic hashing techniques...|$|R

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{have been}} deployed for environment monitoring and surveillance. A message delivery service {{is one of the}} most fundamental services for WSNs, thus making its efficiency and effectiveness important. A widely-adopted protocol for message delivery in WSNs is a geographic forward routing (GFR), in which messages are greedily forwarded to their destinations. In this thesis, we develop network services complementary to the existing GFR for efficient and secure message delivery in WSNs. We first develop a distributed location service protocol (DLSP) for message delivery to mobile nodes. Since GFR represents destinations of messages with destinations' geographic locations, the knowledge of location of mobile nodes is necessary to ensure correct message delivery. In DLSP, mobile nodes select some sensor nodes as their <b>location</b> <b>servers,</b> and publish the mobiles' location information to the <b>location</b> <b>servers.</b> Sensor nodes contact those <b>location</b> <b>servers</b> to retrieve the current location of mobile nodes when needed. DLSP provides systematic methods for mobile nodes to select <b>location</b> <b>servers</b> and publish their <b>location</b> to those <b>servers,</b> and for sensor nodes to query mobiles' location. We then design an algorithm called Traverse for hole boundary detection and geographic forward routing with hole avoidance (GFRHA) for efficient message routing. Traverse identifies boundaries of holes, i. e., areas without any functioning sensor node. GFRHA then utilizes the identified hole information to route messages around holes while being forwarded before they encounter holes. This way, the message path lengths, and subsequently the message delay and energy consumption, can be significantly reduced, depending on hole shapes and source and destination locations. We also develop attack-resilient collaborative message authentication (ARCMA) for message delivery. ARCMA is designed to tolerate node-capture attacks, in which attackers obtain valid keys by compromising physically-exposed sensor nodes, and use the keys to generate forged messages. To defend against such attacks, in ARCMA, messages are collaboratively authenticated by a set of sensor nodes rather than by one node. The security of ARCMA does not degrade unless attackers simultaneously compromise more than a certain number of sensor nodes...|$|R

40|$|Heterogeneous {{wireless}} {{networks are}} capable of providing customers with better services while service providers can offer more applications to more customers with lower costs. To provide services, some applications rely on existing servers in the network. In a vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) some mobile nodes may function as servers. Due to high mobility of nodes and short lifetime of links, server-to-client and server-to-server communications become challenging. In this paper we propose to enhance the performance of server selection by taking link reliability into consideration in the server selection mechanism, thereby avoiding extra client-to-server hand-offs and reducing the need of server-to-server synchronization. As a case study we focus on location management service in a heterogeneous VANET. We provide a routing algorithm for transactions between <b>location</b> <b>servers</b> and mobile nodes. We assume that <b>location</b> <b>servers</b> are vehicles equipped {{with at least one}} long- range and one short-range radio interfaces, whereas regular nodes (clients) are only equipped with a short-range radio interface. The primary goal of our design is to minimize hand-offs between <b>location</b> <b>servers</b> while limiting the delays of location updates. Taking advantage of vehicle mobility patterns, we propose a mobility-aware server selection scheme and show that it can reduce the number of hand-offs and yet avoid large delays during location updates. We present simulation results to show that proposed scheme significantly lowers the costs of signaling and rate of server hand-offs by increasing the connection lifetimes between clients and servers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In partially-trusted system environments {{like the}} WWW, the {{management}} of private user positions is a great challenge. On the one hand, location-based services of different partially-trusted providers have to be provided with position information. On the other hand, <b>location</b> <b>servers,</b> which are responsible for {{the management of}} user positions, might as well be operated by only partially-trusted providers. Therefore, in order to protect his privacy, a user might only want to store position information of limited precision on <b>location</b> <b>servers,</b> and also provide location-based services with position information of limited precision. In this position paper, we sketch a novel position sharing approach that enables the user to tightly control the precision of position information stored on servers and provided to location-based services. This approach is based on the idea of distributing position information among a set of servers of different providers such that a compromised server only reveals information of strictly limited precision.
