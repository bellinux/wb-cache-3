40|$|This work proposes and validates {{experimentally}} a model-based {{scheme for}} the compensation of environmental vibrations affecting load cell measurements in automatic <b>weighing</b> <b>machines.</b> <b>Weighing</b> <b>machines</b> are often {{adversely affected by}} low frequency vibrations which may arise from the coupled effects of machine frame flexibility and the excitation induced by internal (inertial) or external (impact) vibration sources. These vibrations are generally named “environmental vibrations”, since they seem to arise from the environment around the machine. Environmental vibrations have a detrimental effect on load cell responses and can in turn deteriorate machine performances. It is usually ineffective to try overcoming this problem by low-pass filtering load cell measurements: low cut-off frequencies usually downgrade machine speed by both introducing delay and increasing filtered signal rise time. Since automatic <b>weighing</b> <b>machines</b> need to operate at ever increasing speed, alternative approaches must be investigated. In this work it is suggested {{to make use of}} the mechanical models of the <b>weighing</b> <b>machine</b> and the load cells to process supplementary accelerometer measurements and compute an effective compensation of the effect of environmental vibrations on load cell response. The technique is here applied to a multi-head <b>weighing</b> <b>machine</b> in order to prove its effectiveness and implementability in industrial devices with real-time controllers...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{will be a}} risk {{analysis}} of a RFID-system for a logistical application. The system works as follows: Around Karlstad in Sweden there are three new <b>weighing</b> <b>machines</b> for lorries. The load weight will be measured {{for the police to}} control overweight and for logistical reasons such as issuing invoices and optimising the supply chain. The lorries do not have to stop to be weighed. They have to drive slowly over the <b>weighing</b> <b>machine,</b> so the loss of time is minimal. The lorries will be identified via RFID-tags. So every time a lorry will be driven over the <b>weighing</b> <b>machine,</b> the identification number and the measured weight will be logged and send to a database. In the future it is planed to store the weight on the tag itself. The task is now to analyse the RFID-communication and the transmission to the database. The thesis will contain several parts. First RFID in general and how RFID will be used in the application-scenario will be described. Next sections will be about the security and privacy requirements and the risks in detail. Then possible solutions are outlined and concrete suggestions are presented. Finally a conclusion will be drawn, which will show that the application has a low level of security...|$|R
