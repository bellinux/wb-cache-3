40|$|ABSTRACT This report {{documents}} {{an exploratory}} development effort {{to produce a}} 6 -inch diameter, lightweight, high strength, collapsible, <b>layflat</b> <b>hose</b> using aramid yarn as the hose reinforcing material. The design goals were to produce a hose with a 100, 000 -pound tensile strength and 1, 800 -psi burst pressure. The project had three phases: (1) a feasibility study, (2) manufacturing trials with 4 -inch hose, and (3) the design and fabrication of 6 -inch hose on the production line. The work failed to produce the desired hose primarily because of strength losses incurred in the aramid during the manufacturing pro-cess. However, the project did produce a relatively high performance polyester reinforced hose (47, 000 -pound tensile strength) that may have applications for fuel transfer. D T I...|$|E
