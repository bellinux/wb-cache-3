5000|$|Nevertheless, the {{start-up}} process commenced with the Night Lead Operator on the March 22 {{with the initial}} filling of the splitter tower. The <b>level</b> <b>transmitter</b> was designed to indicate the raffinate level within a 5 ft span {{from the bottom of}} the splitter tower to a 9 ft level, i.e., 72% level indication would be 7.6 ft from the bottom, but it was common practice to fill up to an indicated level of 99%, even though the procedural requirement was stated as 50%. The Day Supervisor arrived late for work and did not have a hand-over with the night shift. During the morning meeting on March 23, it was discussed that the heavy raffinate storage tanks were nearly full and, therefore, the second Day Supervisor was told that {{the start-up}} procedure should not continue, but this information was not passed on. The start-up procedure resumed just before 9:30 a.m. under instructions from the other Day Supervisor. Before recommencing the tower refill and circulation process, heavy raffinate was drained {{from the bottom of the}} tower via the level control valve into the heavy storage tank and was then shut off in [...] "manual" [...] mode and not the required [...] "automatic" [...] mode, with a 50% flow rate. The circulation process was restarted just before 10 a.m. and raffinate was once again fed into the tower, even though the level was already too high. Since the level control valve was shut and, therefore, there was no circulation out of the tower, i.e. no heavy raffinate being transferred to the storage tank, the splitter tower inevitably began to fill up. The defective <b>level</b> <b>transmitter</b> continued to show the level at less than 100%, and since the external sight glass was opaque, a visual check to verify the level in the splitter tower was not possible.|$|E
50|$|By 12:42 p.m., the {{furnaces}} {{had been}} turned down and the level control valve was finally opened, draining heavy raffinate from the splitter tower. The operators believed the <b>level</b> <b>transmitter</b> reading which was now down to 78% (7.9 ft) but the fluid level in the 170 ft tall splitter tower had now reached 158 ft. Although the raffinate flow {{into and out of}} the tower were now matching (as the heated raffinate was now leaving the bottom of the tower), heat from this outflow was being transferred via a heat exchanger back into the liquid flowing into the tower from the feed pipe, raising the average temperature inside the column close to the liquid's boiling point. The liquid, already close to the top of the tower but continuing to expand due to the heat, finally entered the overhead vapor line and flowed into the relief valve system.|$|E
50|$|After works {{had been}} {{completed}} on the raffinate splitter, consideration {{was given to the}} impending start-up of the plant. One of the primary safety critical steps in the prestart-up process was the use of the BP Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) procedure. The purpose of the review was to ensure that complete and thorough technical checks were carried out and that all non-essential personnel were clear during the start-up operation. Once completed, the PSSR would be signed off by refinery operations and safety managers, authorising the start-up work but this essential safety procedure was not completed. In addition, {{there were a number of}} serious issues with items of safety critical equipment which had not been resolved prior to the start-up commencing including an inoperative pressure control valve (PV-5002), a defective high level alarm in the splitter tower (LSH-5102), a defective sight glass used to indicate fluid levels at the base of the splitter tower and the vital splitter tower <b>level</b> <b>transmitter</b> had not been calibrated.|$|E

5000|$|Burners in {{the furnace}} were turned on to pre-heat {{raffinate}} {{going into the}} tower and to heat the raffinate in the tower bottom, two more were lit at 11:16am. The required temperature for the tower reboiler return flow was 135 C at [...] per hour but the procedure was not followed. During this start-up, this return flow temperature reached 153 C with a rate increase of [...] per hour. The erroneous 93% reading from the defective <b>level</b> <b>transmitter</b> still indicated an ongoing safe level condition in the tower {{but there was still}} no flow of heavy raffinate from the splitter tower to the storage tank as the level control valve remained closed; instead of the hydrocarbon liquid level being at 8.65 ft, i.e. 93% level, as indicated, it had actually reached 67 ft. Just before midday, with heat increasing in the tower, the actual fluid level had risen to 98 ft. Pressure started to build up in the system as the remaining nitrogen in the tower and associated pipework became compressed with the increasing volume of raffinate. The operations crew thought that the pressure rise was a result of overheating in the tower bottoms as this was a known start-up issue, so the pressure was released.|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} for the profiling of movable sediment beds in laboratory experiments is presented. It couples a triangulation laser sensor and an ultrasonic <b>level</b> <b>transmitter,</b> and allows a non-intrusive, fast and accurate measurement of bed topography without stopping the experimental runs. The {{distortion of the}} laser beam due to the refraction at the water surface is corrected by contemporaneously measuring the elevation of the water surface through the ultrasonic <b>level</b> <b>transmitter</b> and taking advantage of geometrical relations involving the water depth, distance of the sensors from the water surface, and the angles that the emitted laser beam forms with the vertical before and after refraction. Several tests, under either still- or flowing-water conditions, as well as increasing/decreasing water surface elevation, were carried out to evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} measurements. These tests indicate that good-quality measurements are obtained for flow depths in the range 0 < D < 60 mm, typical of morphodynamic laboratory experiments. Finally, two relevant applications to movable bed experiments carried out under either lagoonal or fluvial conditions are presented that show the effectiveness of the proposed profiling techniqu...|$|E

40|$|Communication amongst field devices, {{control unit}} and {{programming}} unit in industrial automation networks {{is essential for}} bulk production, but largely consists of wired networks that can sometimes be bulky and substantially lack mobility as at times there can arise {{a need for a}} field device to be moved either for maintenance purposes or for rearrangement. There was therefore a need for wireless communication and PROFIBUS networks that can provide the minimum movement to field devices or the programing computer. Although wireless communication technology has penetrated the commercial network, it is still inadequately utilised in industrial settings due to electromagnetic induction and other forms of interferences due to industrial machinery. This dissertation introduced wireless communication in a PROFIBUS network where the MPI section was replaced with the wireless link. The PROFIBUS network technology is a hybrid of protocols where the PROFIBUS DP employs RS 485 technology with a transmission rate of 45 kbps and above while the PROFIBUS PA employs Manchester Encoded Bus Powered (MBP) technology at a fixed rate of 31. 25 kbps. In RS 485 technology, data is transmitted as a voltage difference between the two wires while in MBP data is transmitted as transitions in current signal and data and power are transmitted on the same conductors. The PROFIBUS data is also transmitted in the form of telegrams which further puts a strain on any form of intermediate processing and hence the need for high speed processing. In this research task the PROFIBUS PA <b>level</b> <b>transmitter</b> measures the pressure of the fluid in the Blend Chest and sends it to the PLC. The <b>level</b> <b>transmitter</b> was installed and wired to the PROFIBUS DP/PA coupler. The PROFIBUS network, consisting of the PLC, variable speed drives, variable speed pumps, delivery pump and <b>level</b> <b>transmitter,</b> was configured and commissioned for controlling and monitoring from the programing computer. The program for the PLC was written using Siemens Step- 7, compiled and downloaded to the PLC. The control and monitoring was done using the variable table. The wireless communication channel was then simulated using Matlab and Simulink. The wireless devices were then integrated into the PROFIBUS network and the MPI cable linking the programing computer and the PLC was then replaced by the wireless channel and the network was controlled and monitored from the programing computer over the wireless channel. On successful completion of this research task the research plant at MUT was controlled and monitored from the programing computer over the wireless channel and the researchers and demonstrators can now access the PLC and the PROFIBUS network using the wireless communication.

The average noise power was measured to be − 58.64 dBm. To increase the signal <b>level,</b> <b>transmitter</b> amplifier gain was varied by 1 dB increments. Due to USRP hardware imperfections and limitations, the average signal level was amplified from 0.8 to 1.1 dB with transmitter amplifier gain increments. Because of the USRP amplifier non-linear gain and measurement inaccuracy, the measured average power interval for BER performance analysis was set to 2 dB.|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} about {{controlling}} {{the patterns of}} a smart antenna (switched-beam) {{in order to achieve}} better radiation. We used three different control algorithms:Power (gain) maximization algorithm, Cost algorithm and Signal to interference ratio maximization algorithm. The importance of antennas is rapidly increasing as the communicationsystems are affecting everyone life. Moreover, smart antennas have been considered as an evolution in the world of communication systems, because smart antennas improved the quality of radiation widely. Furthermore, smart antenna is classified into switched-beam and adaptive arrayantennas. Specifically the project will deal with switched-beam smart antennas. This project is about controlling the patterns of a smart antenna (switched-beam) in order to achieve better radiation. We used three different control algorithms:Power (gain) maximization algorithm, Cost algorithm and Signal to interference ratio maximization algorithm. These algorithms were programmed by Matlab in order to select the best pattern. In the first algorithm (power maximization) different transmitter angles were applied. In the second algorithm (cost algorithm) different values of gain, Maximum side lobe <b>level,</b> <b>transmitter</b> angle and null depth were applied andexamined. In the third algorithm (signal to interference ratio maximization) the interferer angle was varied with fixed transmitter angle. In every single experiment there were figures representing the pattern selected by the algorithm used. A comparison has been made between the three algorithms using the signal to interference ratio values when applying the same transmitter and interferer angles. {{as a result of the}} comparison, the signal to interference ration maximization algorithm was the best algorithm...|$|E

30|$|Even {{though we}} {{consider}} a feedback-based adjustment using a centralized control to coordinate both the transmit power and carrier {{phase of the}} transmitters, a distributed method for achieving the phase coherence of transmitters was also proposed. In [21], the phase alignment for distributed transmit beamforming was independently performed at each transmitter using minimal feedback from the receiver. Through feedback based on the SNR from the receiver, each transmitter decides whether their applied random phase is kept or not, and this iterative process is repeated until all transmitters converge to phase coherence. In [10], a carrier phase adjustment scheme that attempts to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance among the constellation points was proposed for multiple access networks with multi-packet reception capability. Because this scheme simply assumes that the received power <b>levels</b> from multiple <b>transmitters</b> are the same at the receiver, it adjusts the carrier phase offsets of transmitters, but does not coordinate the transmit power <b>levels</b> of <b>transmitters.</b>|$|R
