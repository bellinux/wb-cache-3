40|$|The Ibex Hills, in {{southern}} Death Valley, California, are composed mainly of Late Proterozoic sedimentary rocks overlying middle Proterozoic basement that are complexly deformed by Mesozoic contractional structures overprinted by Neogene extensional/transtensional structures. Detail mapping of the Ibex Hills reveals evidence of several deformational events. Brittle deformation of both extensional and strike-slip origin are recognized throughout the mapped area, {{but the main}} structure identified is a <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> {{at the base of}} the Noonday Dolomite, Sentinel Peak member, herein called the Noonday Fault. This <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> is dipping toward the east-northeast and has a curved geometry that resembles a previously mapped fault ∼ 4 km west of the study area. The Noonday Fault accounts for missing section in the upper Crystal Springs Formation, Becks Springs Formation, and the Kingston Peak Formation. The Noonday Fault contact places the Sentinel Peak member on the middle Crystal Springs Formation. This fault is the most continuous feature in the area until terminating into the eastern bounding fault of the area. This eastern bounding fault is observed as a steeper normal fault dipping to the east with a dextral slip component. These Neogene structures overprint a complex Mesozoic deformation that includes at least two generations of folds. Overprinting has led to a general noncylindrical geometry for these folds, but the associated cleavages are also refolded complexly suggesting at least three phases of fold systems, sheath fold development or both. ...|$|E
30|$|Tectonic {{diagenesis}} is {{a common}} and important geological phenomenon. We can fully understand the diagenesis of compressional basins through studying tectonic diagenesis. In this paper, we presented the tectonic diagenetic characteristics in the Kuqa area of the Tarim Basin by integrated method of geological analysis and paleotectonic stress. The {{results showed that the}} Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectonic diagenesis affected sandstone compaction evolution mainly through physical mechanisms. It showed characteristics of abrupt change and nonthermal indicator (it means that sandstone compaction can not be explained by thermal diagenetic compaction alone because actual sandstone compaction was larger than thermal compaction), which were different from the thermal and fluid diagenesis. Compared with thermal diagenesis, tectonic diagenesis had a typical tectonic compaction in very short time, and many phases of tectonic deformation showed multiple abrupt changes of compaction. There are obvious differences between tectonic and thermal diagenetic compaction, leading to sandstone compaction being larger than the thermal compaction under the same thermal evolution stage in the areas where tectonic deformation happened. The stronger the tectonic deformation, the more obvious the difference. Tectonic process changed the stress distribution through changing the tectonic deformation styles, resulting in different tectonic diagenesis effects. Therefore, tectonic diagenesis of Mesozoic-Cenozoic in the Kuqa area can be divided into four types including rigid rock restraint, fault ramp, <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> slippage, and napping.|$|E

From NW to SE they are: a) the Ebro Basin, whit a 33 km thick continental crust wich remained almost undeformed during the Cenozoic and is very reflective in its lower part; b) the Continental Margin, made up of the Catalan-Valencian Domain and the Balearic Promontory with a thin (12 to 30 km thick) continental crust wich was deformed during the Cenozoic, extensional structures predominating the first domain and contractional structures in the second; and c) the Algerian Basin, with a 9 km thick oceanic crust. The oldest Cenozoic structures registered in the profile are contractional. During the Palaeogene, these structures affected the NW part of the Catalan-Valencian Domain and enabled this domain to be thrust over the Ebro Basin. During the Early and Middle Miocene, The extensional structures of the Catalan-Valencian Domain were formed in association with crustal thinning. At the same time, the contractensional structures were produced {{in the southern part of}} the Balearic Promontory in association with the formation of the oceanic crust. The displacement of the observed extensional faults is not sufficient to explain the crustal thinning. This implies that, during the Cenozoic, either crustal volume decreased or there were important faults that cannot be observed. It is suggested that a <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> of great displacement, that crosses the whole upper crust, may have existed prior to the Middle and Upper Miocene sediments.

40|$|Habanero is an {{enhanced}} geothermal system (EGS) in the Cooper Basin, northeast South Australia, operated by Geodynamics Limited. The geothermal reservoir is water-saturated, naturally fractured basement granite. The reservoir is interpreted to be a fault zone and its permeability has been effectively enhanced by stimulation. There is approximately 3650 m of sedimentary cover above the granite which provides effective thermal insulation {{on top of}} the heat producing granite. A series of flow tests and stimulations were conducted from October to December 2013. A total volume of 36. 5 ML of fresh water was injected into the Habanero reservoir during the stimulations. The seismicity commenced around Habanero 4 well and grew elliptically but was constrained by an apparent boundary along its eastern edge. The state of stress at reservoir depth has been numerically modeled using wellbore breakouts indicating that the least horizontal stress, Shmin is intermediate between SHmax and Sv. Fracture geometry was analyzed using image logs and was used to predict slip likelihood depending on the orientation of the structures in the recent stress field at reservoir depth using the Coulomb Failure Criterion. Pressure response on failure proven by seismic events is well documented over the stimulation interval. Permeability thickness was increased fivefold up to 10 Dm after stimulation and injectivity was up to 4 times higher than achieved in the wells drilled before Habanero 4. The reservoir is confined to a critically stressed <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> zone which is prone to slip triggered by injection. A fracture network within the granite succession is proven by image logs but it does not contribute to production.

40|$|THESIS 8015 The {{island of}} La Palma, {{in the western}} Canary Archipelago, is formed by a {{partially}} dismantled and eroded Plio-Pleistocene strato-shield volcano (Taburiente/Cumbre Nueva) that is overlapped and elongated to the south by an active rift-centred volcano - Cumbre Vieja. Stratigraphic measurements were used to systematically profile the basal part of the giant Quaternary landslide escarpments that form prominent morphological features on the island. An exhumed detachment fault was discovered in the process. The escarpments, which are 45 km in perimeter and up to 1 km high, are interpreted {{in the light of}} this discovery to have developed by synchronous lateral collapses that were preceded by a geologically significant period of gravitational spreading. The detachment occupies the position of what has been classified in contemporary studies as an erosional unconformity, separating an uplifted Pliocene seamount from the subaerial volcanic successions forming the Taburiente/Cumbre Nueva strato-shield. The Cumbre Nueva Detachment, as it is named herein, together with the overlying pyroclast-rich collapse breccias (herein named the Tenerra Collapse Breccia), have not been the subject of any previous academic studies. Both of these units are separated by the detachment plane which geometrically emulates the domal topography of the seamount basement. Together they provide an opportunity to increase our understanding of the geometry and mechanisms of giant landslides on La Palma, past and future. The present study is unique in that it describes field kinematic evidence for the development and exhumation of a <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> zone that penetrates the exhumed intrusive core of an isolated volcano. Such data are rare in volcanic environments, irrespective of the wealth of observations of exhumed detachments in continental/orogenic environments.

40|$|The E 31 copper-gold {{prospect}} is one {{of several}} porphyry or porphyry related prospects that occur adjacent to the Northparkes Mines site in the Goonumbla district of central N. S. W. The prospect is hosted by trachyandesitic lavas, volcaniclastic breccias and volcaniclastic sandstones which have been intruded by a biotite monzonite at depth. Intrusive breccias are recognised associated with monzonite dykes intruding the volcanic sequence. A post mineralisation low angle north dipping fault terminates occurs adjacent to the contact of the monzonite with volcanics. Three major stages of hydrothermal alteration and veining are recognised. Pre-mineralisation biotite alteration was the first phase. Extensive K-feldspar flooding and vein style alteration was associated with bornite and chalcopyrite mineralisation. Sericite-carbonate(± chlorite) alteration with pyrite± chalcopyrite was associated with minor faults and shears. Regional low grade metamorphism, localised albitisation, and late stage carbonate veinlet alteration have also been recognised. Detailed analysis of geochemical data indicates that Cu/Au mineralisation is associated with Ag, Te, Hg, and Se. An asymmetric Zn and Mn "halo" anomaly occurs in the hanging wall of the mineralisation which {{could be used as a}} vector to the mineralisation.

40|$|Recent seismological studies {{contribute}} {{to better understand}} the first order characteristics of earthquake occurrence in Italy, identifying the potential sites for moderate to large size earthquakes. Ad hoc passive seismic experiments performed in these areas provide information to focus on the location and geometry of the active faults more closely. This information is relevant for assessing seismic hazard and for accurately constraining possible ground shaking scenarios. The area around the Città di Castello Basin, in the Northern Apennines (Central Italy), is characterized by the absence of instrumental seismicity (M > 2. 5), it is adjacent to faults ruptured by recent and historical earthquakes. To better understand the tectonics of the area, we installed a dense network of seismic stations equipped with broadband and short period seismometers collecting data continuously for 8 months (October 2000 -May 2001). The processing of ~ 900 Gbyte of data revealed a consistent background seismicity consisting of very low magnitude earthquakes (ML < 3. 2). Preliminary locations of about 2200 local earthquakes show that the area can be divided into two regions with different seismic behaviour: an area to the NW, in between Sansepolcro and Città di Castello, where seismicity is not present. An area toward the SE, in between Città di Castello, Umbertide and Gubbio, where we detected a high microseismicity activity. These findings suggest a probable different mechanical behaviour of the two regions. In the latter area, the seismicity is confined between 0 and 8 km of depth revealing a rather well defined east-dipping, <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>fault</b> 35 km wide that cuts through the entire upper crust down to 12 - 15 km depth.

Models using single localised weak seeds produce symmetric narrow rifts, irrespective of whether or not strain-softening is included, while models that include regions of diffuse weaknesses produce a wide rift mode.

Their throw has been sufficient to reset a normal stratigraphic superposition (young layers overlying old ones), but insufficient to erase the inverse metamorphic relationship. However, the combined action of backfolding and normal faulting can locally lessen, or even cancel, the inverse metamorphic superposition. After deduction of the normal fault translation, the vertical component of the original thrust displacement through stratigraphy is 400 m, which is a value far too low to explain the temperature difference between the two units. The horizontal component of displacement is therefore far more important than the vertical one. The regional distribution of metamorphism within the Zangla unit points out to an anchizonal front and an epizonal inner part. This fact is in agreement with nappe tectonics...|$|R

This tour {{includes}} views of the gorge of the Ausable River, cut through Late Cambrian Potsdam Sandstone, and the geology of the Champlain Thrust <b>Fault,</b> a <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> thrust <b>fault</b> formed as the proto-Atlantic Ocean closed during the Taconic Oregeny. When it was still connected to the ocean, Lake Champlain was home to whales, whose fossils are now entombed in the lake sediments. The tour also includes classroom activities for students.
