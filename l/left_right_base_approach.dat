40|$|There is an {{emerging}} movement within the international development community {{to subscribe to}} a human <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> to development. Most countries have signed the principle international human rights covenants and have begun to modify their national legislative frameworks accordingly. The World Bank has thus far not directly endorsed a human <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> to development, but has argued that it contributes to their realization through tangible development outcomes {{as well as through}} support for governance and public sector reforms. In addition, in recent years the World Bank has supported “social accountability ” initiatives which share many features with <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches</b> to development. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the common features and linkages between <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches</b> to development and social accountability initiatives as well as suggest how social accountability initiatives can be strengthened by taking into account the principles of a <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> more explicitly. The first section of the paper presents an overview of both <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches</b> to development and social accountability. The section also outlines five principles of <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches</b> to development, namely: • The poor should be placed at the center of the design, control, oversight and evaluation of the development projects that affect them. • The institutions responsible for implementing development programs should be fully accountable for their actions. • Non-discrimination, equality and inclusiveness should underlie the practice of development. • Citizen participation and voices should be “scaled up ” and linked with national and international policy processes and international rights frameworks. • An active linkage should be made between development and the legal institutionalization of human rights. The second section analyses four specific cases of social accountability initiatives which have served a...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} benefits, risks, and {{limitations}} of human <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches</b> to development, which can be catalogued {{on the basis of}} the institutional mechanisms they rely on: global compliance based on international and regional treaties; the policies and programming of donors and executive agencies; rights talk; and legal mobilization. The paper briefly reviews the politics of the first three kinds of human <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches</b> before examining constitutionally based legal mobilization for social and economic rights in greater detail. Litigation for social and economic rights is increasing in frequency and scope in several countries, and exhibits appealing attributes, such as inclusiveness and deliberative quality. Still, there are potential problems with this form of human <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> mobilization, including middle class capture, the potential counter-majoritarianism of courts, and difficulties in compliance.

40|$|The thesis {{intends to}} {{investigate}} how {{and the extent}} to which human rights NGOs in Zimbabwe undertake human <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches</b> that arguably set and contribute to increased political salience of legal human rights edicts and the movement of a state from commitment to compliance with human rights. Going beyond the norms talk and applying the concept of political salience, the study is able to account for broader areas of influence, other than legalization, and a broader definition of activities where the NGOs may be having an effect. Building on the insights of social constructivist norms theory (Risse et al 1999, 2013), Wong’s application of the concept of political salience (2012) and the typology of human <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches,</b> as proposed by Gauri & Gloppen (2012) and drawing on qualitative empirical first-hand data from nine human rights NGOs in the least likely case of Zimbabwe, the study demonstrates that the human rights NGOs undertake a combination of the global compliance approaches, programming and rights talk approaches and the legal mobilization approaches, albeit to varying extents. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that these undertakings contribute to mechanisms and processes that allow for the conditions needed, according to (Risse et al 1999, 2013), for increased political salience of legal human rights edicts. It is concluded that by using human <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches,</b> human <b>right</b> NGOs in a repressive state can be influential in setting and contributing to the conditions needed to increase the political salience of legal human rights edicts...|$|R

25|$|Authors such as White and Cliffe drew {{attention}} {{to the way in which}} the 'broadening of aid objectives from pure survival support towards rehabilitation, development and/ or peace-building' led to the 'dilution of commitment to core humanitarian principles'. Furthermore, many humanitarian organisations have sought to develop rights-based approaches to assistance strategies which challenge the apolitical approach of traditional humanitarianism. <b>Rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches</b> view poverty and vulnerability as rooted in power relations – specifically, the denial of power, which is itself related to the denial of human <b>rights.</b> Hence <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches</b> to humanitarian action relate the achievement of security for marginalized people to the realization of their human rights and often to broader social change. Multimandate humanitarian organisations that seek more inclusive and participatory forms of citizenship and governance and the achievement of broader social rights outcomes therefore risk enmeshing apolitical humanitarian responses in advocacy programmes that push for broader social changes.|$|R

Specifically, how a human <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> can help support the fulfillment {{of the right to}} adequate housing. The research begins discussing a ‘human <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> approach’, ‘the <b>right</b> to housing as a legal human right’, and a ‘HRBA to housing’. An attempt will be made to create legal and conceptual clarification, culminating with the meaning and content of a HRBA to housing.

The thesis provides case studies on a <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> to in-situ upgrading and social housing-cooperative initiatives. It discusses how current development practices have often led to human rights violations and the exclusion of the poor, showing a scary resemblance to its apartheid past.

The thesis also goes into other development obstacles including power and economic and political restraints.

40|$|<b>Rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches</b> to {{environmental}} conflict resolution {{should be viewed}} from the wider public law context. For example, Martin Loughlin maps {{the transition from a}} liberty focused constraint on law based on jurisdiction, to a rights focused approach to “intensive” judicial review based on legality. This sesismic shift away from common law (customary or practical) reasoning adopts a constitutional or statutory approach to describing liberties normatively using the “language of rights”, and builds upon the academic tradition that seeks to aid understanding by setting “forth the law as a coherent whole” and “reducing the mass of legal rules to an orderly series of principles”. This paper will explore and critically analyse the effect of these trends on environmental conflict resolution from a trans-national New Zealand perspective. The underlying thesis of this paper is that the possibilities and tensions experienced by the courts in crafting a principled approach to human rights jurisprudence provides a transparent methodology for determing polycentric issues, {{and that there is a}} legitimate role for <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approaches</b> to resolving environmental conflict...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: The article uses an analytical/philosophical approach. Findings: Hearne includes both “means” and “ends” among the rights, and it is argued thatthe rights should only be formulated in terms of ends. In the Swedish cases the commonfeature is that tenants are living in rent‐regulated apartments with low rent and thensomething happens that withdraws this opportunity. It is argued that society is alwayschanging and no one has an unconditional right to continue to live in the same way asbefore. The main rights should be formulated in terms of access to “reasonable” alternativesand as right to a time to adjust to the new situation. Practical/social implications: How one looks at the rights in the situations described will bethe foundation for the type of legal rules that should be implemented.

40|$|The {{universality}} {{of all human}} rights cannot be denied. The discourse on human rights includes, reproductive rights, which have emerged to be controversial in African countries. This controversy has been exacerbated by economic, social, religious and political factors. The key issues posed in this thesis are, debates about whether adolescent girls {{should have access to}} dual protection methods, dual information measures, the right to education on sexuality and the right to participation in reproductive health programmes. This has led to the need to engage in Human <b>Rights</b> <b>Based</b> <b>Approaches</b> to Development (herein referred to as RBAD.) This {{is due to the fact}} that human rights, human development and development have proved to be mutually dependent concepts. This work demonstrates that civil, political, economic and social rights are interdependent, interlinked, interrelated and indivisible. I argue that due to the indivisibility of human rights, governments should not prioritize any single category of rights. As evidenced by the Zimbabwean case study which shows the existence of a hierarchy of rights where civil and political rights are given primacy over economic and social rights. Religious and cultural norms greatly influence adolescent girls` enjoyment of reproductive rights. National laws should not be used to go against the “democratic genesis” of international and regional human rights law. These practices should be abolished because Zimbabwe has ratified human rights conventions dealing with adolescent girls` right to information, protection measures, education and participation without any reservations. In this instance, treaty law is binding and Zimbabwe has to enforce the treaties in good faith. Finally I point that the <b>Rights</b> <b>Based</b> <b>Approach</b> to Development contribute to the politics of governance, service provision and shapes the policy making discourse. Zimbabwe should use the <b>rights</b> <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> in shaping its agenda for political, economic, social and religious governance.
