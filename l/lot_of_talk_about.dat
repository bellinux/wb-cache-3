500|$|Hillenburg {{enjoyed the}} process of making the film: [...] "The TV {{schedule}} is tight, and you don't always {{have a lot of time}} to work on your drawings." [...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. [...] "There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story." [...] The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's {{thematic}} content, Daniel Rossen noted, [...] "There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> negotiating {{distance from}} people in your life. We were dealing with that in various forms, learning {{what it means to}} be alone, learning {{what it means to be}} close to somebody, certain things coming to a head. It just feels like a major difficulty in life." [...] Droste elaborated, [...] "There's a desire to be autonomous, but there's also this great fear of being alone, and there's this constant feeling of, 'How do you reconcile this?' There's this need for space, but there's also this, 'Come closer come closer.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|By August 1999, {{the band}} had {{recorded}} over 30 songs for the album, tentatively titled 2000 Intentions. During a 1999 interview with MTV's Kurt Loder, Rose announced {{the title of}} the upcoming album to be Chinese Democracy, stating [...] "there's a lot of Chinese democracy movements, and it's something that there's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> and it's something that will be nice to see. It could also just be like an ironic statement. I don't know, I just like the sound of it." [...] Rose also mentioned the album would feature [...] "lot of different sounds. There's some heavy songs, there's a lot of aggressive songs, but they're all in different styles and different sounds. It is truly a melting pot." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{afterward}} he winced, [...] "If that white worm {{had the nerve}} to try to drag me back to the Old Church Home, then the holy outfit must have been doing a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> me, too." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "At the time, {{there was}} a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Sandinistas, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fuss in Colombia, Peru ... For me, 'Tekila - Gerila' was a nice way of seeing those things. Besides, I wanted a good excuse to do Latin music." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{level of}} preposterous {{is just too}} high, {{and the level of}} fun and {{excitement}} far too low.

2500|$|Donegal's defence {{of their}} All-Ireland title began against Tyrone on 26 May 2013. The match was billed in advance as the toughest contest Donegal would face in Ulster, with the winner thought {{likely to become}} Ulster champions. Donegal brushed aside Tyrone with {{relative}} ease. McGuinness said afterwards: [...] "In {{the last two years}} the exact same thing was said. The only difference this year was that we were relegated [...] There was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> putting all the eggs into one basket, but it was the same last year and the same the year before. That's what we do – it's championship football. It will be no different next year. It was a media spin that got the whole debate going. Next year we will put all our eggs in that basket again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the opening}} tip, Bryant and O'Neal did not talk, but did greet {{each other by}} bumping forearms. During the game, Bryant was fouled by O'Neal several times but the {{contacts}} were not excessive. O'Neal fouled out late {{in the fourth quarter}} but the Heat still won the game in overtime, led by up-and-coming star, Dwyane Wade. Bryant missed a potentially game-winning shot as time expired. When asked about the brick wall comment, Bryant said, [...] "I knew there was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the brick wall and all that. But I think that was kind of just to hype the game. Hopefully, this is all behind us now." [...] O'Neal shared a similar tone, saying [...] "I'm over it. It's old news to me." [...] Bryant and O'Neal met on the court twice more during the season, once during the NBA All-Star Game and once more when the Lakers played the Heat on March 17, 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Gandhi {{insisted that}} the {{conviction}} did not undermine her position, despite having been unseated from the lower house of parliament, Lok Sabha, by order of the High Court. She said: [...] "There is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [...] parties were forming governments". And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her. After news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty. Indian High Commissioner BK Nehru said Gandhi's conviction would not harm her political career. [...] "Mrs Gandhi has still today overwhelming support in the country," [...] he said. [...] "I believe {{the prime minister of}} India will continue in office until the electorate of India decides otherwise".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is it, sir," [...] said Mr. Portman. [...] "You know there's a rising in Cuba, and there was <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{filibustering}} before we left. I expect the people thought that the ladies were going on shore {{the same as the}} parsons." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dean Dodrill {{stated in}} an interview, [...] "I will revisit {{the story of}} Dust sometime, {{it will be a}} while, because I want to do {{something}} unique, and different for a while. But I do have ideas for the next couple games. Like one we've done a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> and how we want to approach it".|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{nonsense}} <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> {{that sort}} <b>of</b> thing. Women don't really care; it's only what's put into their heads." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came to see}} if Béla {{was still}} here," [...] said Andor, {{as soon as the}} door had closed on Leopold Hirsch. [...] "One or two chaps whom I met awhile ago {{told me that he had}} not been seen in the barn this hour past, and that there was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it.

6000|$|... 'I {{am glad to}} hear it,' said Bounderby. 'Now, {{you have}} heard a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the work in our mills, no doubt. You have? Very good. I'll state the fact of it to you. It's the pleasantest work there is, and it's the lightest work there is, and it's the best- paid work there is. More than that, we couldn't improve the mills themselves, unless we laid down Turkey carpets on the floors. Which we're not a-going to do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is taking}} it hard {{and she is}} fond of him--deuced fond of him, poor girl," [...] thought the Colonel; but aloud he said, [...] "My dear Miss Fregelius, I never {{believed}} the stories. As for the principal one, common sense rebels against it. All I said to your father was that {{there appears to be}} a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the place, and, under the circumstances of my son's engagement, that he might perhaps give you a friendly hint." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{am writing}} a play," [...] Chekhov {{wrote to his}} friend Suvorin from Melikhovo in October 1896, [...] "which I will finish no earlier than the end of November. I am not writing it without pleasure, {{although}} I am violating all the conventions of playwriting. It is a comedy, three female roles, six male roles, four acts, a landscape (a view over a lake), a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> literature, little action, and five poods of love.". [...] The play was The Seagull.|$|R
2500|$|In 1997, Scientology {{administrator}} Peggy Crawford said in {{a statement}} to The Commercial Appeal: [...] "We definitely believe in God and we believe in individuals as spiritual beings." [...] Professor Paul Blankenship of the Memphis Theological Seminary studied Scientology and commented on this view, saying [...] "They do not do a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> God or Jesus. It's more getting your mind cleared, and I could see how they could say that that could be compatible. Scientology has not really developed into a complete religious tradition. They may very well develop." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the meeting, {{the group}} began {{developing}} Arnold, creating his personality and evolving him from claymation to cel animation. Bartlett stated: [...] "We did a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> who Arnold is. We {{came up with}} a reluctant hero who keeps finding himself responsible for solving something, making the right choices, doing the right thing." [...] After creating ideas for Arnold, Bartlett began work on the supporting characters, drawing influence from his childhood: [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the characters are an amalgam of people I knew when I was a kid. The girls in Hey Arnold! are girls that either liked or didn't like me when I was in school." ...|$|R
60|$|He faced about and, {{standing}} between the awnings, {{held out his}} right hand at arm's length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes: completely. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun's disk. Must be the focus where the rays cross. If I had black glasses. Interesting. There was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> those sunspots {{when we were in}} Lombard street west. Looking up from the back garden. Terrific explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn some time.|$|E
6000|$|... "You know, Grig," [...] she said, {{when her}} cousin was seated, [...] "your letter was rather disturbing. Her {{separation}} from Captain Bellew has caused such a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> here. Yes; it's very common, I know, {{that sort of}} thing, but Horace is so----! All the squires and parsons and county people we get about here are just the same. Of course, I'm very fond of her, she's so charming to look at; but, Gregory, I really don't dislike her husband. He's a desperate sort of person--I think that's rather, refreshing; and you know I do think she's a little like him in that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He wasn't {{clear on}} that point at all. The {{impression}} he gave me was of a sort of vague, intermediate state, a special reserve for souls too non-existent for anything so positive as either sin or virtue. I don't know. He was much too egotistical and unobservant to give me any clear idea {{of the kind of}} place, kind of country, there is on the Other Side of Things. Wherever he was, he seems to have fallen in with a set of kindred spirits: ghosts of weak Cockney young men, who were on a footing of Christian names, and among these there was certainly a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> 'going haunting' and things like that. Yes--going haunting! They seemed to think 'haunting' a tremendous adventure, and most of them funked it all the time. And so primed, you know, he had come." ...|$|E
40|$|Where is Egypt heading and {{how does}} this {{correspond}} with popular expectations? It seems that political parties {{and the people of}} Zimbabwe are unwilling to go to the polls. There is <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Africa’s rapid economic growth, but is it trickling down to the continent’s people? The infrastructural crisis in Nigeria has made innovators of the people as they cope with the demands of everyday life.
