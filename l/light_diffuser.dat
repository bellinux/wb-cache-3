40|$|Holographic glass light-shaping {{diffusers}} (GLSDs) are optical {{components for}} use in special-purpose illumination systems (see figure). When properly positioned with respect to lamps and areas to be illuminated, holographic GLSDs efficiently channel light from the lamps onto specified areas with specified distributions of illumination for example, uniform or nearly uniform irradiance can be concentrated with intensity confined to a peak a few degrees wide about normal incidence, over a circular or elliptical area. Holographic <b>light</b> <b>diffusers</b> were developed during the 1990 s. The development of the present holographic GLSDs extends the prior development to incorporate sol-gel optical glass. To fabricate a holographic GLSD, one records a hologram on a sol-gel silica film formulated specially for this purpose. The hologram is a quasi-random, micro-sculpted pattern of smoothly varying changes in the index of refraction of the glass. The structures in this pattern act as an array of numerous miniature lenses that refract light passing through the GLSD, such that the transmitted light beam exhibits a precisely tailored energy distribution. In comparison with other <b>light</b> <b>diffusers,</b> holographic GLSDs function with remarkably high efficiency: they typically transmit 90 {{percent or more of}} the incident lamp light onto the designated areas. In addition, they can withstand temperatures in excess of 1, 000 C. These characteristics make holographic GLSDs attractive {{for use in}} diverse lighting applications that involve high temperatures and/or requirements for high transmission efficiency for ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light. Examples include projectors, automobile headlights, aircraft landing lights, high-power laser illuminators, and industrial and scientific illuminators...|$|R
40|$|Holograms make {{transmission}} {{recordings of}} aerodynamic events which are real-illuminated with ground-glass <b>light</b> <b>diffusers</b> {{and with no}} requirements for precision. The three-dimensional interferograms can be recorded by stored-beam, double-exposure, and double-plate techniques. Weak traveling shock waves, generated by rotating blade rows of an aircraft fan compressor, can be visualized by rapid double-exposure holograms recorded with a ruby laser. The same laser technique can also determine flow velocities from holograms of small flow-entrained particles. Particles larger than one-quarter millimeter are recorded under rear diffuse illumination conditions. Smaller particles can be recorded by their own forward scattering of laser light through {{the sensitivity of the}} holographic process for weak signals. Since the holographic apparatus can be path-matched, both particle and flow interferograms can be recorded with lasers of short coherence length...|$|R

30|$|Optical path {{lengths of}} the rays through are {{different}} {{depending on the}} angles between the rays and surface of PiGs; therefore, blue rays that pass through {{the edge of an}} LED device have longer path length and experience higher absorption that leads to higher intensity of yellow light than do rays that pass through in the perpendicular direction. As a result, white light rays from one LED chip are close to white at the center, but increasingly yellowish toward the periphery; the result is the â€˜yellow-ring effectâ€™ [8, 9]. This can be reduced with adjusted shape of color converting elements and LED package structure [10 â€“ 13]. Diffuser layers were used to diffuse blue rays so that optical path lengths in all direction become similar. This adverse effect was alleviated in polymer-based white LEDs by using <b>light</b> <b>diffuser</b> layer coating [14 â€“ 16].|$|E
40|$|Large surface area, thin, polymer {{optical waveguides}} are an {{emerging}} technology that enable {{a wide variety}} of light collection and illumination systems to be created for passive lighting, solar collectors, and safety lighting for motorized vehicles. This research builds on design of rigid concentrator and diffuser waveguides, proposing and evaluating modifications for the design of a flexible waveguide combining both concentrating and diffusing functionalities. The waveguides are thin, mechanically flexible sheets with thicknesses in the range of mm, and active surfaces from a few cm 2 to several m 2. Regions of the functional surface are designed to act as <b>light</b> concentrators, <b>light</b> <b>diffusers,</b> <b>light</b> transmission conduits or some combination thereof. This research examines how the geometry and spatial distribution of micro-optical features patterned on a bi-layered thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) waveguides can be used to guide captured light rays through flat and flexible configurations. Zemax OpticStudio software simulation tool is used to investigate the design parameters and their impact on concentrator and diffuser performance. A multi-functional concentrator-diffuser waveguide is modelled and analysed in a study which shows the flat waveguide has an overall efficiency of over 94 %, however when it is modelled as a flexible waveguide, less than 1 % of the incident light is successfully guided. Various design modifications are considered to mitigate these losses, and the efficiency of the flexible waveguide is improved to nearly 60 %.

40|$|Elaborating {{reliable}} and versatile strategies for efficient light coupling between free space and thin films is of crucial importance for new technologies in energy efficiency. Nanostructured materials have opened unprecedented opportunities for light management, notably in thin-film solar cells. Efficient coherent light trapping {{has been accomplished}} through the careful design of plasmonic nanoparticles and gratings, resonant dielectric particles and photonic crystals. Alternative approaches have used randomly-textured surfaces as strong <b>light</b> <b>diffusers</b> to benefit from their broadband and wide-angle properties. Here, we propose a new strategy for photon management in thin films that combines both advantages of an efficient trapping due to coherent optical effects and broadband/wide-angle properties due to disorder. Our approach consists in the excitation of electromagnetic modes formed by multiple light scattering and wave interference in two-dimensional random media. We show, by numerical calculations, that the spectral and angular responses of thin films containing disordered photonic patterns are intimately related to the in-plane light transport process and can be tuned through structural correlations. Our findings, which are applicable to all waves, are particularly suited for improving the absorption efficiency of thin-film solar cells and can provide a novel approach for high-extraction efficiency light-emitting diodes...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”This {{investigation}} {{demonstrates a}} novel light-emit-ting system {{with an array}} of blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Unlike a conventional lighting system that is constructed from white LEDs, the proposed planar lighting system uses blue LEDs to excite a YAG Ce yellow phosphor film remotely, yielding a high lumen efficiency with uniform and planar light-emission. The phosphor film herein acts as a wavelength converter and a <b>light</b> <b>diffuser</b> simultaneously. The optical properties of the pro-posed lighting system, angular color deviation and light-emitting uniformity, are studied. Eventually, a high lumen efficiency (73. 0 lm/W) and thin lighting module (7. 5 mm-thick) was demonstrated without the use of any conventional diffuser plate or light guiding plate (LGP). A low color deviation and a high light-emitting uniformity were achieved. Hence, the proposed lighting system exhibited superior optical performance using a compact module.

40|$|Herein, a {{diffusive}} material presenting optical {{disorder is}} introduced, which represents {{an example of}} a Mie glass. Comprising spherical crystalline TiO nanoparticles randomly dispersed in a mesoporous TiO matrix, it is proved that the scattering of light in this inhomogeneous solid can be predicted in an unprecedented manner from single-particle considerations employing Mie theory.

40|$|Here, {{we present}} a concept based on the {{realization}} that a complex medium {{can be used as}} a simple interferometer. Changes in the wavefront of an incident coherent beam can be retrieved by analyzing changes in speckle patterns when the beam passes through a <b>light</b> <b>diffuser.</b> We demonstrate that the spatial intensity correlations of the speckle patterns are independent of the light diffusers, and are solely determined by the phase changes of an incident beam. With numerical simulations using the random matrix theory, and an experimental pressure-driven wavefront-deforming setup using a microfluidic channel, we theoretically and experimentally confirm the universal sensitivity of speckle intensity correlations, which is attributed to the conservation of optical field correlation despite multiple light scattering. This work demonstrates that a complex media is a simple interferometer, and presents opportunities to replace complicated reference-beam-assisted interferometers with a simple and compact scattering layer in various applications in metrology, analytical chemistry, and biomedicine...|$|E
40|$|Recently, disordered {{photonic}} {{media and}} random textured surfaces have attracted increasing attention as strong <b>light</b> <b>diffusers</b> with broadband and wide-angle properties. We report the first experimental realization of an isotropic complete photonic band gap (PBG) in a two-dimensional (2 D) disordered dielectric structure. This structure is {{designed by a}} constrained-optimization method, which combines advantages of both isotropy due to disorder and controlled scattering properties due to low density fluctuations (hyperuniformity) and uniform local topology. Our experiments use a modular design composed of Al 2 O 3 walls and cylinders arranged in a hyperuniform disordered network. We observe a complete PBG in the microwave region, in good agreement with theoretical simulations, and show that the intrinsic isotropy of this novel class of PBG materials enables remarkable design freedom, including the realization of waveguides with arbitrary bending angles impossible in photonic crystals. This first experimental verification of a complete PBG and realization of functional defects in this new class of materials demonstrates their potential as building blocks for precise manipulation of photons in planar optical micro-circuits and has implications for disordered acoustic and electronic bandgap materials...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{developed}} several strategies to enhance solar cells {{which lead to}} stronger sunlight absorption with less active material and thereby also reducing costs. This is accomplished through utilizing nanoscale architectures, which geometry can be tailored to modify the flow of light for optimal absorption. Since sunlight comprises of photons with {{a broad range of}} wavelength (colors), ensuring a complete absorption requires sophistications in the nanostructure design due to its wavelength dependent interaction with light. To address this challenge we utilized combinations of different periodic nanostructures with one another and also with disordered rough <b>light</b> <b>diffusers.</b> Aside from our absorption enhancement work, we also investigated light emission enhancement utilizing periodically placed metal nanoantennas. We demonstrate how hybrid plasmonic-photonic modes that arise in such system can be used to control and enhance emission over an extended spatial region. This is relevant in solar cell enhancement schemes which convert the unused portion of sunlight into the color range suitable for optimal usage. Having investigated various light management schemes to enhance solar cells, we proceeded to examine the limiting factors which hinder efficient electrical current extraction from polycrystalline silicon thin film solar cells of a few micrometers thick. We identified the conditions in which this more economical material gives the desired solar cell performance...|$|R

However, fundus cameras are often costly and rely on separate computers for viewing and transmission of fundus photographs. In addition, adoption of electronic clin-ical record systems is expected to increase the demand for simple and cost-effective alternatives to the fundus camera that will allow the doctors to capture fundus images themselves during a medical examination. We describe a novel modified technique using slit-lamp biomicroscopy with a noncontact lens, which enables simple and convenient color fundus imaging.
