40|$|This paper describes, the {{experimental}} {{performance of a}} fabricated single grooved Parallel Coupled Microstrip Bandpass Filter (PCMBF) on a low cost <b>laminate</b> <b>board,</b> with improved passband response and first harmonic suppression for various operating bandwidth. The suppression of the first harmonic spurious response is possible through transmission zero frequency realignment method. A single groove of specific dimensions located {{at the center of}} the parallel coupled line has been employed for the realignment of the transmission zero and first harmonic frequencies. An implemented single-stage bandpass filter with various coupling gaps, on a low cost <b>laminate</b> <b>board,</b> showed excellent harmonics suppressions with optimized groove. Then, two-stage bandpass filters of different operating bandwidth were designed for optimized groove. It was then implemented on a low cost <b>laminate</b> <b>board</b> and tested.

The procedure to design the LPFKA with three different numbers of iterations {{in order to reduce}} the antenna size is discussed.

40|$|Packaging cartons, nowadays, are an {{integral}} part of food items for their storage and transportation. These are normally made from paper <b>laminate</b> <b>board.</b> However changing European Union (EU) regulations are forcing carton manufacturers to use thinner recycled materials. The packaging machinery manufacturers industry in the UK is dominated by small and medium enterprises where machines designs are normally developed through empirical knowledge. There is little known about the effects of changing carton materials on the overall carton process. Thus change in material properties for the cartons is affecting the carton erection process. This research work is aimed at establishing the best machine settings for erecting cartons so that the carton buckling can be reduced by incorporating the ideal machine settings irrespective of the materials used for the cartons. Techniques from the design of experiments are used here to predict the best settings for the machine. The settings thus predicted are finally validated by practical experimentation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a flip-chip-on-board (FCOB) packaging technology using a Rogers RO 3210 laminate for microwave applications. Compared {{to the conventional}} microwave packaging architecture, the proposed FCOB technology skips one level of the ceramic package and thus results in lower reflections and manufacturing costs. To fulfill the small dimension requirement on printed circuit boards, the coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission line and flip-chip bump were fabricated on a high-k RO 3210 board (epsilon(r) = 10. 2) with photolithography and electroplating. The GaAs chip patterned with the CPW line was then flip-chip-mounted onto the RO 3210 <b>laminate</b> <b>board.</b> This structure displayed excellent performance from dc to 50 GHz with a return loss S- 11 greater than 18 dB and insertion loss S- 21 less than 0. 5 dB. Meanwhile, the flip-chip bonding of the in-house-fabricated In 0. 52 Al 0. As- 48 /In 0. 6 Ga 0. 4 As metamorphic high-electron-mobility transistor devices on RO 3210 also displayed excellent gain performance with a small degradation of 1 dB from dc to 40 GHz, showing the potential of implementing microwave integrated circuits on RO 3210. To enhance the mechanical reliability, an epoxy-based underfill was injected into the flip-chip assemblies. Thermal cycling tests were performed to test the interconnect reliability, and {{the results indicated that}} the samples passed the thermal cycling test at least up to 600 cycles, showing excellent reliability for commercial applications. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the use of the RO 3210 laminate for microwave flip-chip in open literature...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{development}} of telecommunication devices, operating speeds are getting faster and more power is being consumed by those devices. Therefore, {{there is a big}} concern on how to prolong the battery life in order to fit consumers’ needs. Power amplifiers (PA) at the front end of wireless equipment have drawn a big concern from engineers because of their large power consumption in the system. There is a lot research conducted on PA solutions for improving power-added efficiency (PAE) of amplifiers. PAE is a figure of merit representing how efficient the PA converts DC power to RF power. With PAE increased, the device is able to output the same amount of power with less DC power consumed. Non-linear Class-F and Class-F- 1 PAs have drawn the most attention among all different classes of PAs from engineers because of their capability of outputting high power and providing good PAE. Class-F boosts up PAE by controlling the harmonic content at the output. Advanced Design System (ADS) from Agilent is used for design and simulation based on the ADS model of Cree’s CGH 40010 high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). A high efficiency power amplifier is fabricated on RT/duroid 5870 high frequency <b>laminate</b> <b>board.</b> In this design, the harmonics at the input are controlled as well as the harmonics at the output. An input wave-shaping network is designed to shape the waveforms at the gate. In this case, the PAE is boosted 30 % higher than the PA with only the output wave-shaping network. By terminating harmonics with proper impedances at the output, a square voltage waveform and a half-sine current waveform are obtained at the transistor drain terminal. The overlapping area between the voltage and current waveforms can be reduced as well as the active device power consumption. The final design operating at 1 GHz produced a PAE of 89 % with 38. 35 dBm output power in simulation and PAE of 78 % with 38. 7 dBm output power {{as the result of the}} IEEE PA design contest. The thesis has shown the effectiveness of the Class-F PA to boost up PAE by preventing the 2 nd and 3 rd harmonic power from delivering to the load and shaping the waveforms at the transistor terminals. It also shows the benefit of using radial stubs in wave-shaping networks over open-circuit stubs...|$|E

40|$|The wood {{industry}} applies hard metal tools which combine good performance with high final cutting surface quality. Possibilities {{for increasing the}} performance of hard metal tools are surface hardening by thermo-chemical treatments or covering with hard coatings. A promising technique for wood-working tools is gas boronizing because of increasing the surface hardness {{as well as the}} corrosion resistance against aggressive organic components in wood.
