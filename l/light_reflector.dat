There, several thousand square feet of highly flammable painted canvas scenery flats were hung. The stage manager tried to lower the asbestos fire curtain, but it snagged. Early reports state that it was stopped by the trolley-wire that carried one of the acrobats over the stage, but later investigation showed that the curtain had been blocked by a <b>light</b> <b>reflector</b> which stuck out under the proscenium arch.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known artifact containing bismuth bronze is an Inca {{knife from}} Peru, found in 1912.

Webster developed two bismuth-tin-bronze alloys. One alloy was developed as an early attempt at producing corrosion-resistant bronze, and was described as [...] "hard, tough, and sonorous." [...] Webster also indicated that this particular alloy was also well suited to piano wires. Another early Webster alloy was described as [...] "durable and bright" [...] and later used in kitchenware due to its luster and slow tarnishing.

40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} of improved road light design for drivers and pedestrians {{with the use}} of a ray- or reverse ray-tracing method. Many existing road lights are unsuitable for drivers and pedestrians because of serious problems such as glare effect or randomicity of illuminated areas. This situation has arisen because in customary design methods the emphasis has been on simple factors such as luminance or electrical power. However a high luminance or electrical power consumption, alone, do not guarantee bright and good road lighting. So we have applied a ray-tracing method to the design of a road <b>light</b> <b>reflector</b> with the goals of ensuring that illuminated objects on the road can be seen more clearly and that the illuminating light is more comfortable for the eyes of drivers and pedestrians. We have set design targets for factors such as the uniformity of lighting on the road area per road light, the shading angles and the continuous luminance uniformity on long lengths of road. For set heights of the eyes of drivers and pedestrians eyes we have calculated a design guideline for the achievement of the above design targets. Then we designed a road <b>light</b> <b>reflector</b> using the reverse ray-tracing approach. Also we have achieved the same luminance on the road with almost half the power consumption, through the reduction of lighty loss. In an ideal design optimum parameters are suggested to be a shading angle of 75 degrees and a luminance uniformity of 0. 5 on the road area. This reflecto...|$|E

40|$|Body {{parts that}} can reflect highly {{polarized}} light {{have been found}} in several species of stomatopod crustaceans (mantis shrimps). These polarized <b>light</b> <b>reflectors</b> can be grossly divided into two major types. The first type, usually red or pink in color to the human visual system, is located within an animal’s cuticle. Reflectors of the second type, showing iridescent blue, are located beneath the exoskeleton and thus are unaffected by the molt cycle. We used reflection spectropolarimetry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to study the reflective properties and the structures that reflect highly polarized light in stomatopods. For the first type of reflector, the degree of polarization usually changes dramatically, from less than 20 % to over 70 %, with a change in viewing angle. TEM examination indicates that the polarization reflection is generated by multilayer thin-film interference. The second type of reflector, the blue colored ones, reflects highly polarized light to all viewing angles. However, these reflectors show a slight chromatic change with different viewing angles. TEM sections have revealed that streams of oval-shaped vesicles might be responsible for the production of the polarized light reflection. In all the reflectors we have examined so far, the reflected light is always maximally polarized at around 500 nm, which is close to the wavelength best transmitted by sea water. This suggests that the polarized <b>light</b> <b>reflectors</b> found in stomatopods are well adapted to the underwater environment. We also found that most <b>reflectors</b> produce polarized <b>light</b> with a horizontal e-vector. How these polarized <b>light</b> <b>reflectors</b> are used in stomatopod signaling remains unknown...|$|R
