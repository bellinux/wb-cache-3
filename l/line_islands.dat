5|$|Caroline Island {{remained}} uninhabited and undisturbed through World War II and afterwards. It remained under British jurisdiction, repossessed by the British Western Pacific High Commission in 1943 and governed {{as part of}} the Central and Southern <b>Line</b> <b>Islands.</b> In January 1972, the Central and Southern <b>Line</b> <b>Islands,</b> including Caroline, {{were joined}} with the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, which had become autonomous in 1971 as part of British decolonization efforts.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island or Caroline Atoll (also {{known as}} Millennium Island and Beccisa Island), is the easternmost of the {{uninhabited}} coral atolls which comprise the southern <b>Line</b> <b>Islands</b> {{in the central}} Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The atoll is {{currently}} {{designated as a}} wildlife sanctuary. In 2014 the Kiribati government established a 12-nautical-mile fishing exclusion zone around each of the southern <b>Line</b> <b>Islands</b> (Caroline (commonly called Millennium), Flint, Vostok, Malden, and Starbuck).|$|E

5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then became home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface. Although these geological processes are poorly understood, the orientation of the <b>Line</b> <b>Islands</b> (roughly north-south) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the Pacific Plate changed its direction of travel. The same hotspot more recently gave rise to the Tuamotu Archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Kiritimati (Christmas Island) in the <b>Line</b> <b>Islands</b> is the world's largest atoll. Based on a 1995 {{realignment}} of the International Date Line, the <b>Line</b> <b>Islands</b> {{were the}} first area {{to enter into a}} new year, including year 2000. For that reason, Caroline Island has been renamed Millennium Island. The majority of Kiribati, including the capital, is not first, for example New Zealand (UTC+13 in January) has an earlier new year.|$|E

25|$|The Phoenix Islands and <b>Line</b> <b>Islands,</b> most {{of which}} are part of Kiribati, are {{geographically}} Polynesian islands, but they had no permanent settlements until European colonization.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{eventually}} {{incorporated the}} Northern Line into its territories {{and did the}} same with the Phoenix Islands which lie between Kiribati and the <b>Line</b> <b>Islands</b> including Howland, Jarvis, and Baker islands, thus, bringing about a territorial dispute. This was eventually resolved and they became part of Kiribati as part of the Treaty of Tarawa. This was signed shortly after independence and ratified in 1983, the United States relinquishing all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix Islands and those of the <b>Line</b> <b>Islands</b> that are part of Kiribati territory.|$|E

50|$|The MTR Corporation Limited (MTRC) {{submitted}} {{its first}} {{proposal for the}} South <b>Island</b> <b>Line</b> and West <b>Island</b> <b>Line</b> in May 2002. The new lines were intended to promote tourism in Aberdeen. The West <b>Island</b> <b>line</b> would be {{an extension of the}} <b>Island</b> <b>Line.</b>|$|R

25|$|There are a {{total of}} 21 {{inhabited}} islands in Kiribati. Kiribati {{is divided into three}} island groups, including a group that unites the <b>Line</b> <b>Islands</b> and the Phoenix Islands (ministry at London, Kiritimati) Island. The groups have no administrative function.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the 1995 change, Kiribati's easternmost territory, the <b>Line</b> <b>Islands,</b> including the inhabited island of Kiritimati (Christmas Island), started the year 2000 before any other country, a feature the Kiribati government capitalized upon as a potential tourist draw.|$|E
25|$|The islands {{became the}} crown colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands in 1916. The <b>Line</b> <b>Islands,</b> {{including}} Christmas Island (later spelled Kiritimati) and Fanning Island (Tabuaeran), {{were added to}} the colony in 1919 and the Phoenix Islands were added in 1937.|$|E

25|$|Such {{settlements}} probably began around 1000 BC, when eastern Melanesians travelled north. Later {{settlement and}} contact by Polynesians {{is evident in}} archaeological digs revealing basalt artifacts originating in Samoa, the Marquesas, and the Cook Islands which were transported to the Phoenix and <b>Line</b> <b>Islands</b> during the 12th–14th centuries AD.|$|E
25|$|Neither the Phoenix nor <b>Line</b> <b>Islands</b> {{are served}} by the {{domestic}} carriers. The only served airport by any airline is Cassidy International Airport on Kiritimati. Fiji's national carrier Fiji Airways provides an international service from Fiji's main airport, Nadi International Airport to Cassidy Airport {{as well as to}} Bonriki Airport.|$|E
25|$|Ka Lae, {{the southernmost}} {{point in the}} 50 States of the United States, is on Hawaii. The nearest {{landfall}} to the south is in the <b>Line</b> <b>Islands.</b> To the northwest of the island of Hawaii is the island of Maui, whose Haleakalā volcano is visible from Hawaii across the Alenuihaha Channel.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} the South <b>Island</b> <b>Line</b> and West <b>Island</b> <b>Line</b> {{encompasses}} a number of proposals which were made for extending the Hong Kong MTR metro system {{to the south and}} west of Hong Kong Island, which were not serviced by any rail transport before 2014. The West <b>Island</b> <b>Line</b> opened {{as an extension of the}} <b>Island</b> <b>Line</b> on 28 December 2014. The South <b>Island</b> <b>Line</b> has completed construction and commenced service on 28 December 2016. The proposed South <b>Island</b> <b>Line</b> (West) is still in the planning phase and is expected to begin in 2021.|$|R
25|$|The IDL circumscribes Kiribati by {{swinging}} {{far to the}} east, almost reaching the 150°W meridian. Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern <b>Line</b> <b>Islands</b> south of Hawaii, have the most advanced time on Earth, UTC+14 hours. South of Kiribati, the IDL returns westwards but remains east of 180°, passing between Samoa and American Samoa.|$|E
25|$|Overfishing and {{pollution}} have impacted {{on the ocean}} surrounding the island. In the ocean surrounding uninhabited islands of the Northern <b>Line</b> <b>Islands,</b> Sharks comprised 74% of the top predator biomass (329 g m-2) at Kingman Reef and 57% at Palmyra Atoll (97 g m-2), whereas low shark numbers have been observed at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that the indigenous name for the Gilbert Islands proper is Tungaru (e.g., see Arthur Grimble, 1989). However, the name Kiribati {{was chosen as the}} name of the new independent nation by local consensus, on such grounds that it was modern; and to acknowledge the inclusion of islands (e.g., the Phoenix Group and <b>Line</b> <b>Islands),</b> which were never considered part of the Tungaru (or Gilberts) chain.|$|E
