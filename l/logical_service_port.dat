30|$|As {{discussed}} in Section 1, {{we know that}} well-known Ports, which range between 0 to 1023, and are closely bound to some specific <b>services.</b> Registered <b>Ports,</b> port numbers range from 1024 to 49151, they are used by processes of procedures and executed programs of common users. Ephemeral Ports, most implementations use port numbers between 1024 to 5000. Reserved Ports: port numbers larger than 5000 are reserved for other services. We can divided 65536 ports into four types: Well-known Ports, Ephemeral Ports, Registered Ports, Reserved Ports. The role of Well-known <b>port</b> is <b>service</b> <b>port.</b> The role of Ephemeral Port is client port. Registered Ports and Reserved Ports are linked to <b>service</b> <b>port</b> in a local host.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in the integration of mechanized reasoning systems such as automated theorem provers, computer algebra systems, and model checkers. State-of-the-art reasoning systems {{are the result of}} many man-years of careful development and engineering, and usually they provide a high degree of sophistication in their respective domain. Yet they often perform poorly when applied outside the domain they have been designed for. The problem of integrating mechanized reasoning systems is therefore being perceived as an important issue in automated reasoning. In this paper we present the Logic Broker Architecture, a framework which provides the needed infrastructure for making mechanized reasoning systems interoperate. The architecture provides location transparency, a way to forward requests for <b>logical</b> <b>services</b> to appropriate reasoning systems via a simple registration/subscription mechanism, and a translation mechanism which ensures the transparent and provably sound exchange of <b>logical</b> <b>services.</b> ...|$|R

30|$|IrLMP {{operates}} above IrLAP and {{is responsible}} for providing upper layers with a multiplexing scheme over IrLAP, {{as well as a}} link control mechanism and a service discovery mechanism. IrLMP in fact comprises two separate entities, the Link Management Multiplexer (LM-MUX), which {{is responsible for}} link control and data multiplexing and (b) the Link Management Information Access Service (IAS) that maintains information about the services that have been registered at the local station. IrLMP communicates with upper layers and the IAS through multiple <b>Logical</b> <b>Service</b> Access Points (LSAPs). Each LSAP is assigned with a unique identifier that is called the <b>Logical</b> <b>Service</b> Access Point Selector (LSAP-Sel), and source/destination LSAP-Sel pairs are used to multiplex/demultiplex traffic from multiple IrLMP connections in LM-MUX. Moreover, LSAP-Sels of local services are registered in IAS to facilitate service discovery. Remote devices access the IAS by means of a simple command-response protocol (Information Access Protocol--IAP); the LSAP-Sel of IAS itself is well known and equals 0 × 00.|$|R

40|$|Existing {{classification}} of the Croatian seaports {{does not fit}} the level and {{meet the needs of}} the economic development of the Republic of Croatia, particularly after the Republic of Croatia joined the European Union. Equalizing public service offered by a port with the purpose of the port itself (general purpose – port open for public traffic, special purpose – port not open for public traffic) limits the economic development and aggravates the implementation of the basic market policies of the EU. Therefore, modernisation of the basic {{classification of}} ports in the Croatian legislation is suggested.

In this paper, the concept and characteristics of the <b>port</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem is discussed, a hierarchical model of the <b>port</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem is constructed. As an extended logistic model, Lotka-Volterra model is applied to study the competitive co-evolution and mutually beneficial co-evolution of enterprises in the <b>port</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem. This paper simulates the co-evolution of enterprises in the <b>port</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem by using MATLAB programming. The simulation results show that the breadth of the niche of the enterprises is changing with the change of the competition coefficient and the coefficient of mutual benefit in the <b>port</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem. Based on that, some proposals are put forward to ensure the healthy and orderly development of the <b>port</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem...|$|R
