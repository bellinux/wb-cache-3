40|$|BACKGROUND: Troponin T (TnT) is {{valuable}} for short- and long-term risk stratification {{of patients with}} acute coronary syndromes (ACS). It also may predict which ACS patients will benefit from glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa blockade. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively studied 1160 patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS randomized in PARAGON-B to receive <b>lamifiban,</b> an intravenous GP IIb/IIIa antagonist, or placebo. TnT levels were obtained before study treatment began and 24 to 72 hours later; assays were performed by a blinded core laboratory. At baseline, 40. 2 % of patients were TnT-positive (>/= 0. 1 ng/mL); these patients were older and more often male or smokers. Patients positive at baseline had a significantly higher rate of the primary end point (composite of death, myocardial [re]infarction, or severe recurrent ischemia at 30 days; odds ratio, 1. 5; 95 % CI, 1. 1 to 2. 1) {{than those who were}} TnT-negative. <b>Lamifiban</b> was associated with significant reduction in the primary end point (from 19. 4 % to 11. 0 %, P= 0. 01) among TnT-positive patients but not among TnT-negative patients (11. 2 % for placebo versus 10. 8 % for <b>lamifiban,</b> P= 0. 86; P= 0. 08 for test of interaction between TnT status and treatment assignment). This pattern held for the end points of death alone and death or myocardial (re) infarction at 30 days. Peak TnT level at 48 hours did not differ with <b>lamifiban</b> treatment. CONCLUSIONS: TnT predicts poor short-term outcomes in non-ST-segment elevation ACS. Treatment benefit with <b>lamifiban</b> is limited almost exclusively to TnT-positive patients, reducing 30 -day adverse outcomes to a rate nearly identical to that of negative patients. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} assess the effect of {{glycoprotein}} (GP) IIb/IIIa blockade on myocardial platelet and polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation and on infarct size after coronary injury and transient coronary occlusion (CO) in pigs. BackgroundIt {{has been suggested that}} platelet GP IIb/IIIa blockade might reduce the severity of microvascular damage after reperfusion. MethodsSixteen thiopental-anesthetized, open-chest pigs, in whom platelets had been labeled with technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) on the previous day, were submitted to catheter-induced left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) injury followed by 55 min of CO and 5 h of reperfusion. Five minutes before reflow, the animals were blindly allocated to receive <b>lamifiban</b> (intravenous bolus of 250 μg/kg body weight and continuous infusion of 3 μg/kg per min) or saline. ResultsLamifiban had a rapid and potent platelet anti-aggregatory effect, as demonstrated by significant prolongation of the bleeding time and profound (∼ 90 %) inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation, and completely prevented the development of cyclic flow reductions of the LAD (0 vs. 5 ± 1, one of them followed by re-occlusion, in control animals, p = 0. 005). However, compared with animals receiving placebo, those treated with <b>lamifiban</b> had a similar (p = NS) content of 99 mTc platelets in the reperfused myocardium (288 ± 40 % vs. 205 ± 27 % of the value in the control region, respectively) and similar myeloperoxidase activity (0. 50 ± 0. 17 U/g vs. 0. 47 ± 0. 17 U/g, respectively) and infarct size (46. 8 ± 12. 0 % vs. 49. 8 ± 10. 5 % of the area at risk, respectively). Arteriolar platelet thromboemboli were very rarely seen on histologic analysis. <b>Lamifiban</b> did not modify platelet P-selectin expression in additional studies. ConclusionsPlatelet GP IIb/IIIa blockade has a potent antithrombotic effect at the culprit lesion, but does not significantly reduce the magnitude of microvascular platelet accumulation or myocardial damage after transient CO...|$|E

40|$|Beside {{the major}} effect of acute {{thrombus}} formation, {{little is known}} about the interaction of platelets with the coronary endothelium in an ischaemia–reperfusion situation. The present study was designed to investigate, separately, the consequences of platelet adhesion and degranulation during myocardial reperfusion. Methods: Isolated guinea pig hearts perfused with Krebs–Henseleit buffer and performing pressure–volume work were used. We infringed myocardial function by imposing ischaemia (20 min of low-flow perfusion with 1 ml/min and 10 min of global ischaemia) and reperfusion (15 min with 5 ml/min). During low-flow perfusion, the coronary endothelium was stimulated by thrombin before and during infusion of a bolus: 108 washed human platelets±the Arg–Gly–Asp (RGD) analogon <b>lamifiban,</b> the supernatant of 108 thrombin-stimulated platelets, fibrinogen (2 μM), <b>lamifiban</b> (2 μM) or Tyrode’s solution (control group). The parameter external heart work (EHW), determined pre- and postischaemically, served as criterion for recovery of myocardial function. Additionally, the formation of capillary transudate was measured during the reperfusion phase to assess coronary permeability. Coronary perfusion pressure was monitored continuously and myocardial production of lactate and consumption of pyruvate were measured. Electron microscopy of hearts was performed after platelet application to verify platelet adhesion in the coronary system. Results: Recovery of EHW by hearts without platelet application was 64 ± 3 % and was significantly reduced to 49 ± 5 % by platelet infusion (n= 8 each). Infusion of supernatant of thrombin-stimulated platelets did not impair recovery of heart work. In the reperfusion phase (6 th– 10 th min), hearts that either had received platelets or supernatant of platelets exhibited a significantly reduced production of capillary transudate (70 μl/min vs. 180 μl/min for the controls). Intracoronary bolus application of fibrinogen or <b>lamifiban</b> also reduced coronary leak. Coronary perfusion pressure and metabolic parameters were not statistically different between the groups at any time. Conclusions: Platelet adhesion to the coronary endothelium in a situation of myocardial ischaemia impairs cardiac recovery, whereas constituents released by platelets may have beneficial effects on the integrity of the coronary endothelium. In particular, fibrinogen seems to contribute to the permeability reducing effect, possibly by interaction with endothelial receptors recognising the RGD sequence. ...|$|E
40|$|As the {{glycoprotein}} GPIIb/IIIa receptor is {{the final}} common pathway in platelet aggregation, antagonists of this receptor cause a profound inhibition of aggregation induced by any agonist. The short-term efficacy and safety of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty was demonstrated with murine 7 E 3 Fab, but this antibody was immunogenic. Abciximab is a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody that is less immunogenic. The first major trial with a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist was the EPIC trial with abciximab, which showed that abciximab reduced the ischemic complications of coronary balloon angioplasty and atherectomy in high-risk patients, but increased the risk of bleeding. Subsequent studies showed that using less concurrent heparin reduced bleeding. Abciximab also reduced the rate of revascularization. Further {{studies have shown that}} the benefits of abciximab extended to all patients undergoing angioplasty (EPILOG), including patients with unstable angina (CAPTURE) and acute myocardial infarction (RAPPORT). Clinical trials with eptifibatide and tirofiban have failed to demonstrate benefit, at the doses used, in angioplasty. Abciximab and eptifibatide, but not oral xemilofiban, improve the safety of the coronary stenting procedure. Shortterm intravenous treatment with <b>lamifiban,</b> eptifibatide or tirofiban is beneficial in acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, non-Q wave myocardial infarction). Orally active GPIIb/IIIa antagonists are being developed for use in acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction. However, no benefit has been shown with lefradafiban in acute coronary syndromes and sibrafiban and orbofiban are harmful. Eptifibatide, <b>lamifiban</b> and abciximab improve coronary patency in myocardial infarction, and long-term trials of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists are being conducted in acute myocardial infarction. Abciximab can cause thrombocytopenia, and all the GPIIb/IIIa antagonists increase the incidence of bleeding, but there is no excess of intracranial hemorrhage. (C) 2001 Prous Science.

40|$|Several {{platelet}} aIIbb 3 integrin antagonists {{have been}} designed as preventive agents against the formation of arterial thrombi. Although the potency of these compounds in inhibiting platelet aggregation is in the nanomolar range, their specificity on other integrins that can bind ligands through an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif {{is far from being}} well established. For instance, some cyclic RGD peptides can also interact with avb 3 integrin.

40|$|The {{first step}} in the {{formation}} of an arterial platelet thrombus consists of the interaction between collagen-bound VWF and the platelet glycoprotein Ib/IX/V complex. This event results in a further interaction of the collagen receptors with the damaged vessel wall, leading to platelet activation and platelet aggregation, a process mediated by the platelet GFIIb/IIIa receptor. Current antiplatelet agents interfering with platelet activation steps (e. g., acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel) or blocking the GPIIb/IIIa receptor (e. g., abciximab, eptifibatide, <b>lamifiban,</b> tirofiban) have proven their clinical usefulness. However, their efficacy is not optimal and therefore the search for new antiplatelet drugs continues. Here we review data on a new approach for preventing arterial thrombosis, i. e., by blocking the initial platelet adhesion step.

40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{development}} and evaluation of a screening assay for combinatorial libraries on solid-phase by means of fluorescence labelled monoclonal antibodies as well as {{the development and}} optimisation of a linker method for mass spectrometry of short peptides on one single bead is described. In a screening-assay the antibody, which has been raised against an antagonist of a receptor serves as a substitution of the receptor. Since it represents sort of a template of the receptor it is utilised as a screening agent. On the basis of <b>Lamifiban,</b> a GPIIbIIIa-receptor antagonist from Roche, and the anti-Lamifiban monoclonal antibody LMF- 2, a screening system for compound libraries on solid phase was developed and optimised. This was then employed for the selection of active tetrapeptides from Split&Mix-libraries {{as well as for the}} stepwise optimisation of Lamifibanmimetics in Parallel Synthesis. Besides, the quality of the antibody-assay was validated with several compounds having varying activity from the GPIIbIIIa-project. By means of three different approaches, using a monoclonal antibody that was raised against <b>Lamifiban,</b> the principle, the applicability and the efficacy of an antibody as a receptor substituent and as a screening tool was evaluated: Ten compounds with various IC 50 -values descending from the Lamifiban/GPIIbIIIa-project were examined with an antibody screening assay. The compounds were coupled onto PEGA resin, incubated with fluorescence labelled mAB and analysed with the fluorescence microscope and a suitable image processing software. Afterwards their light intensity values were analysed statistically. The statistical evaluation resulted in a good correlation with the IC 50 -values of the compounds against the receptor as well as with the KD-values measured with BiaCore. With this investigation the evidence was provided that the monoclonal antibody LMF- 2 recognises <b>Lamifiban</b> and related compounds tendentiously in the same manner as the GPIIbIIIa receptor does. By the use of tetrapeptide libraries on solid phase which were produced with Split&Mix methodology, other peptide inhibitors for the GPIIbIIIa-receptor were supposed to be found. The very first screening with the mAB and the subsequent analysis by Edman-sequencing led to some short peptide sequences which then were synthesised in milligramme scale. More thoroughly testing of the affinities of these peptides against the antibody by BiaCore resulted in only very weak binding (lower mM range). Also in the receptor-assay these peptides showed only a marginal inhibition. The most active peptides (His-Ile-Phe-Phe-Gly and His-Ile-Ile-Phe- Gly) showed a IC 50 -value of 2. 6 mM against the receptor. Thus they are appx. 700 times less active than the natural substrate RGDS (IC 50 = 3. 7 μM). A synthesis sequence on Solid Phase was developed to produce Lamifiban-analogues. The compounds should have been analysed individually, analogous to the peptides. However, the Single-Bead-analysis turned out not to be realisable, whereupon a statistical evaluation method was applied. In order to optimize the Lamifiban-mimetics backbone, an iterative approach was chosen. The different building blocks were optimised sequentially and analysed with monoclonal antibody on each step. The subsequent synthesis of the compounds in a larger scale however proved to be very difficult and the products were not stable. The compounds whose affinity against the antibody was measured with BiaCore quantitatively, showed only a low affinity against the antibody. The most active compound showed a KD-value of 300 μM. Yet, the statistical evaluation of each variation showed tendentiously a match between the active building blocks and the building blocks of <b>Lamifiban,</b> the hapten of the antibody. A further part of the work included the analysis and the sequencing of short peptides on solidphase- beads. Therefore, different linker-systems (acid labile linkers and photolabile linkers) were utilised and tested. However, for Single-Bead analysis they were found to be unsuited. Thus a linker- and cleavage-method based on a disulfide linker was developed and optimised, which allowed doing reproducible mass spectrometric analysis of the compounds on one single bead. The cleavage of the compounds from the solid support over different mechanisms is achieved by treatment with basic or reductive media (Figure 1). It was possible to reproducibly analyse several short peptides (tetra- up to heptapeptides) on single beads and to determine their sequences. Furthermore several variations for an optimisation of the linker synthesis directly on the solid support were realised and tested successfully. The concept of a monoclonal antibody as a receptor substitution seems to work and indeed some peptides and non-peptide compounds were identified, which really have an affinity against the monoclonal antibody and the receptor. However, the problem that will have to be solved is the big variation/standard deviation of the light intensities within the same bead-species. Due to the narrow bandwidth of the available scale, this leads to a considerable source of error. That is also the reason why this screening-method is problematic regarding to Split&Mix-libraries. The light intensity on one single bead is not representative enough to make a prediction about the compound on the bead. Another problem is the quality of the utilised reactions. Even small differences in the turnover of the reaction lead to a substantial corruption of the result. Therefore, the utilised reactions for this approach should have turnovers comparable to those in peptide chemistry...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{platelets}} in {{the process}} of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention is not fully understood. After vascular injury there is extensive platelet activation, adhesion, aggregation and secretion. Through the liberation of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, and surface expression of cell adhesion molecules, such as the glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa integrin, platelets appear to be a pivotal mediator of the vascular injury response. Experimental models have demonstrated that profound, prolonged thrombocytopenia, or blockade of the Ilb/IIIa receptor, may reduce neointimal hyperplasia after arterial balloon injury. However, multiple clinical trials testing conventional or new platelet agents have not yielded any salutary effects. The recent finding that abciximab, a monoclonal antibody fragment directed against Ilb/IIIa, reduced clinical restenosis after coronary angioplasty by 26 % in patients raises questions about the mechanism of benefit. The αvβ 3 vitronectin receptor is responsible for binding endothelial cells to platelets, and it also has a key role in modulating smooth muscle cell migration. It is possible that the antibody fragment exerts its effect on restenosis by means of αvβ 3, because abciximab fully cross-reacts to this integrin owing to the shared β 3 subunit. To date, the other platelet glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa inhibitors, including Integrelin, Tirofiban, <b>Lamifiban</b> and Xemilofiban, are specific in binding to this particular integrin. Considerable further study is necessary to unravel the effects of platelets on the restenosis process...|$|E
40|$|Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors {{represent}} a new promising class of antiplatelet medications. Their use in acute coronary syndromes and for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention {{has been the}} subject of a number of large controlled trials using both the intravenous and the oral forms. In this review, we present a systematic overview of these trials. Keywords coronary artery disease, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary interventions Platelets play a pivotal role in acute coronary syndromes [1, 2]. Plaque rupture exposes highly thrombogenic components that induce platelet activation and initiate coagulation cascade. Platelet activation involves a conformational change in the membrane glycoproteins (GP) that are receptors for adhesive proteins [3]. The recent development of a new class of drugs that allow direct inhibition of platelet GP IIb/IIIa receptors, the ‘final common pathway ’ of platelet activation, has raised the possibility that these potent agents may reduce thrombotic complications after percutaneous coronary interventions or in acute coronary syndromes [4]. In the following review, we summarize the trials conducted to evaluate the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in these clinical settings, and discuss issues of efficacy and safety.

Intravenous agents directed against this receptor include the chimeric monoclonal antibody fragment abciximab, the peptide inhibitor eptifibatide and nonpeptide mimetics tirofiban and <b>lamifiban.</b> Over 33, 000 patients have been evaluated in 11 large-scale, placebo-controlled trials of these agents. During percutaneous coronary intervention, an absolute reduction of 1. 5 % to 6. 5 % in the 30 -day risk of death, myocardial infarction or repeat urgent revascularization has been observed, with some variability in treatment effect among the agents tested (abciximab, eptifibatide and tirofiban). Treatment effect is achieved early with every modality of revascularization and is maintained over the long-term (up to three years). Increased bleeding risk may be minimized by reduction and weight-adjustment of concomitant heparin dosing. In the acute coronary syndromes without ST segment elevation, absolute 1. 5 % to 3. 2 % reductions in 30 -day rates of death or myocardial (re-) infarction have been achieved with two to four day courses of eptifibatide or tirofiban.

Methods and Results—Transient (60 -minute) adhesion of thrombin-prestimulated platelets enhanced HUVEC expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and membrane type- 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT 1 -MMP) (reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry) and secretion of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and MMP- 1 (ELISA) and induced proteolytic activity via MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 (gelatin zymography).

We assessed unfractionated heparin infusion regulation by bedside, whole-blood aPTT testing and computerized, algorithmic infusion adjustment, and further evaluated the relationship of achieving the target aPTT with clinical outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 1, 275 patients randomized to unfractionated heparin in PARAGON-A, which tested <b>lamifiban</b> with or without unfractionated heparin versus unfractionated heparin. All patients had baseline and 6 -hour blinded, bedside aPTTs, then aPTTs per algorithm. A central computer translated encrypted values to algorithmic dose-adjustment commands. We assessed the ability to achieve and maintain aPTTs of 50 - 70 seconds and associations of 6 - and 12 -hour aPTTs and time-to-target with 30 -day outcomes. Overall, the median 6 -hour aPTT was 50 - 70 seconds and remained so throughout infusion. Individually, only 33. 6 % of patients achieved 6 -hour target-range aPTTs, and only 40 % of all aPTTs were in-range. After achieving target, only 42 % of subsequent measures were in-range. Thirty-day death or myocardial infarction (death/MI) increased non-significantly as time-to-target increased (p = 0. 08). Thirty-day mortality was similar if target aPTT was reached, regardless of timing. Death/MI trended lower if target aPTT was reached by 8 hours (p = 0. 10). The best clinical outcomes were associated with in-range aPTTs. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the most systematic monitoring and regulation of unfractionated heparin anticoagulation to date.
