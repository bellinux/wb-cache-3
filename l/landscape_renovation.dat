The allée received a terminus at each end in subsequent years: Henry Moore’s Draped Reclining Woman at the north end, and a bas relief by Jacques Lipchitz at the south. As part of a <b>landscape</b> <b>renovation</b> conducted by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, Inc. of Cambridge, MA, the Honey Locust allée was replanted in the Spring of 2008.

The rural infrastructure backwardness causes its overall look backward, losing its local cultural characteristics. It uses landscape planning to realize the optimization of basic rural construction {{and the beauty of}} the environment. It focuses on developing the core landscape [...] village cultural square and village ecological corridor, using square and corridor segmentation and reasonable layout of village land to optimize the rural landscape. One, Foreword In recent more than a dozen years, China has developed with high-speed, and the economic construction has also accelerated. The rural landscape and rural style have also ushered in the great changes. Reasonable planning of rural land use and landscape pattern, maintaining the rural ecological security, and protecting the integrity and character of rural landscape are currently the top priority of the new rural construction in China. Stone vicious village new rural landscape planning and design practice belongs to China's typical rural environment in Hubei province. Through the necessary rural construction after the improvement of its economic level, the scientific layout and planning of rural landscape will provide reference basis for Chinese rural <b>landscape</b> <b>renovation</b> practice in Hubei province and the southern provinces...|$|E
40|$|Land {{consolidation}} is {{an instrument}} {{contributing to the}} improvement of the various problems associated with agricultural holdings. These problems constitute an obstacle for the rational and effective utilisation of agricultural land. The main research question of this study is regarding the effects of land consolidation with Cyprus as the current site. Problems associated with agricultural holdings are a common feature all around the world. However, Cyprus is of special interest due to its location and land tenure structure characterized by small, irregularly shaped plots being highly dispersed as well as the lack of road access and multiple ownership, all problems imposing obstacles for efficient farming. Land consolidation is a measure used to promote rational, sustainable agricultural development and to create and protect areas of natural beauty and cultural significance. The aim {{of this study was to}} look at four different types of effects that may develop as a result of land consolidation measures, each research question representing one effect. The first out of four research questions was to look at social effects describing how land consolidation measures affects the relationship between the participants, and the relationship between the owners and their property. The second one is regarding the economic effects in order to find out how land consolidation contributes to changes in productivity, wealth and incomes. My two last research questions are associated with visual effects including the design of plots, infrastructure and effects on the cultural landscape. Land consolidation implementation in Cyprus is based on cooperation between the owners and the Land Consolidation Service with a main focus on the owners and their relationship to property. Social effects have more focus in Cypriot land consolidation compared to many other countries. Participants show signs of being satisfied due to the possibilities for participation, the abolishment of multiple ownership, bigger parcels and ownership areas. Today there are conditions facilitated for every single owner to be a full-time farmer. It turns out that owners are less attached to their land due to incomes being achievable on other markets as well. Land consolidation in Cyprus is a cost- and time-consuming process. Completing one project takes often up to 6 - 10 years. Systems and technology is not in place to adequately support the planner, no standard methodology for measuring land fragmentation is developed. Land consolidation has a distance-reducing effect on farming operation, resulting in a decrease in traveling-time and transportation costs. Increased specialization, use of mechanisation and a diversity of crops, do all contribute to improvements in the already existing conditions, a higher income and welfare. Efficient farming and an interest for full-time farming are achieved by the possibilities for increased incomes and productivity. Structural changes are done to the Cypriot land tenure structure. As a result of land consolidation measures, are irregularly, small, inefficient parcels with more or less no road access replaced by bigger parcels with a design more practical for efficient farming. In 2013 the enlargement of plot size more than doubled, amounted to be an increase of 103, 13 %. An increase of 198, 18 % of additional road network was stated the same year where every single plot had a road connected to their property. Pollution is still identified as a negative effect of the increased road network. Parcels under Turkish ownerships were earlier excluded from land consolidation measures but are today included in all projects resulting in more complete results. Mechanisation, specialisation and an increase in labour inputs have resulted in significant visual changes in the cultivation of the Cypriot landscape. Crop diversity and crop scheduling are identified as positive effects due to land consolidation implementation. Implementations of new irrigation systems are probably the most significant reason for these positive changes evolving. In 2010, olive trees contributed with 49, 2 % of the total area for permanent crops with citrus fruits following with 15, 9 %. <b>Landscape</b> <b>renovation</b> plans and plans for protection of the environment are developed in order to protect flora and fauna, biotopes, cultural and physical features of the rural landscape. Land consolidation measures have contributed to a significant development within the agricultural sector in Cyprus. To find answers to my research questions a study trip to Cyprus was conducted in order to do observations and get access to documents, a visit resulting in exciting findings. These will be presented in the following chapters...|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} use of plant materials for an array of objectives including conservation, restoration, <b>renovation,</b> <b>landscaping,</b> and bioremediation requires knowledge of the adaptation of each species and, more specifically, knowledge of the adaptation of cultivars, strains, accessions, or ecotypes of a species to specific sites or regions. For agronomic and horticultural plants, specific adaptation information has been {{and continues to be}} developed by extensive testing. Rangeland, grassland, park, and restoration project managers often lack the resources to determine adaptation areas for plant materials because of the large number of species that are used and the extensive geographical areas that are serviced. Problems often arise in delineating adaptation areas for plant materials of both native and introduced species. Since ecoregion and plant hardiness zone classification systems integrate many climatic and geographic variables that determine plant adaptation, these 2 systems can be combined to develop Plant Adaptation Regions (PARs). A PAR map of the contiguous United States was developed by merging a widely used ecoregion map with the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone map, and is available in GIS format. Based on their geographic origins and/or test results, plant materials and their general areas of adaptation can be classified using PARs...|$|R
50|$|In April 2010, a Puget Sound Energy began a US$200 {{million project}} to {{rehabilitate}} and upgrade the power plant. The project included retrofitting {{the first four}} of the generators in Plant 1 and replacing the fifth. A turbine-generator would be replaced in Plant 2 as well. The weir was lowered to 16 ft in height, lengthened by 37 ft and the water-intake structure was replaced. Lowering the weir will help reduce flood waters upstream of the falls. The penstocks, which feed the power plants with water, were to be upgraded as well. Finally, automatic shut-off and bypass valves were installed for Plant 2. The shut-off valves will better prepare the plant for emergencies and the bypass valves will allow water to flow downstream in the case that Plant 2 is offline. To promote tourism, recreation and culture, several upgrades to include new visitor centers, hiking trails, a boardwalk and improved <b>landscaping</b> were implemented. <b>Renovations</b> on Plant 2 were completed in April 2013.
