Besides, the super <b>light</b> <b>trapping</b> architectures and morphology of the wing scales were characterized by FESEM.

At last, the reflectance spectroscopy of SiO 2 negative replica and a flat plate was measured. The SiO 2 negative replica was not only stable but also corrosion resistant due to the complex super <b>light</b> <b>trapping</b> architectures and inert SiO 2 material, which made it a promising super <b>light</b> <b>trapping</b> surface for various fields such as photoelectrical devices, photo-induced sensors and solar cells.

In this work we introduce an advanced bi-periodic back-side structure with promising <b>light</b> <b>trapping</b> properties. The structure combines high coupling efficiency of light to oblique travelling modes with the ability of keeping the light within the solar cell for multiple reflections between the front and the rear side.
