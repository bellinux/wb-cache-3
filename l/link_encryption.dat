40|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} volume of information over wireless medium, security has assumed an important dimension. The security of transmitted data over a wireless channel aims at protecting {{the data from}} unauthorized intrusion. Wireless network security is achieved using cryptographic primitives. Some properties that give encryption mechanism their cryptographic strength also make them very sensitive to channel error as well. Therefore, security for data transmission over wireless channel results in throughput loss. Trade-off between security and throughput is always a major concern in wireless networks. In this paper, a <b>Link</b> Adaptive <b>Encryption</b> scheme is evaluated that adapts to channel variations and enhances the security level of WLANs without making any compromise with the network performance. Numerical results obtained through simulation are compared with the fixed block length encryption technique in two different modes of operation- Electronic Code Book (ECB) & Cipher Block Chaining (CBC). Optimal block length is also computed, which {{is assumed to be}} the effective strength of the cipher. It has been observed that security attained with link adaptive scheme operating in ECB mode of cipher is a better solution for security and throughput trade-off. However, it is found that if computational security is a major concern, link adaptive scheme in CBC mode should be preferred. Comment: 14 pages; IJSPTM, AIRCC, 201...|$|R
40|$|Secure and {{reliable}} communication {{is very important}} for a lot of different use cases. One major area of application is Network Enabled Capabilities (NEC). Security and reliability are even harder to achieve for the tactical domain, when different nations with a variety of communication technologies have to form a heterogeneous ad hoc network. CoNSIS (Coalition Networks for Secure Information Sharing) is a multinational project which aims at developing, implementing, testing, and demonstrating technologies and methods that will facilitate the participants' abilities to share information and services securely in ad-hoc coalitions, and between military and civil communication systems, within the communications constraints of mobile tactical forces. Based on the results obtained from the field tests, this paper proposes an enhanced model for the interaction between a tactical router and a security gateway. Our integrated approach uses encrypted tunnels for the security gateway which are set up automatically by the routing instance. Furthermore, multicast traffic is encrypted separately without tunneling, whereas forwarding is done by the operating system kernel {{on the basis of the}} tunnel devices. This approach can be seen as a generic <b>link</b> layer <b>encryption</b> with ad hoc capabilities based on IPsec.

To prevent adversaries from compromising the anonymity by learning the forwarding path, ANON incorporates {{a suite of}} countermeasures, including non-malleable, semantically secure <b>link</b> <b>encryption</b> and link padding. To lower the bandwidth cost of padding traffic, two novel algorithms are suggested: ondemand link padding and probabilistic link padding. To prevent inband denial of service (DoS) attacks through the anonymizing infrastructure itself, ANON uses rate limiting. Finally, ANON makes use of fault-tolerant transport networks to enhance its resilience against failures and outband attacks. 1...|$|E
40|$|When {{the network}} is homogeneous, {{choosing}} the cipher type for a packet telephony application is simple. It is clear that stream ciphers perform better than block ciphers over landline, circuit-switched networks, since loss is negligible in these networks but corruption is not. Likewise, {{it is also clear}} that block ciphers perform better than stream ciphers over landline, packet-switched networks, since corruption is negligible in these networks but loss is not [9]. However, the choice of cipher is not so clear for a heterogeneous internetwork containing a mix of packet and circuit-switched networks. Additionally, this issue becomes even more confounded when heterogeneous internetwork also consists of wireless <b>links.</b> Existing <b>encryption</b> systems will degrade performance in a heterogeneous internetwork because such internetworks have appreciable loss and corruption. Thus, the error properties would degrade the subjective quality of the packet telephony application. In this paper we present an experimental results of comparing block and stream ciphers when used to secure VoIP in terms of end-to-end delay and subjective quality of perceived voice. We proposed a new technique, which provides automatic synchronization of stream ciphers on a per packet basis, without the overhead of an initialization vector in packet headers or without maintaining any state of past-encrypted data.
