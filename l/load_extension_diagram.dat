The analysis was performed using Johnson-Cook model based ABAQUS software. The infrared thermography was used to quantify deformation localization zones, also to relate the temperature changes of the specimen, continuously recorded by thermography, with the <b>load</b> <b>extension</b> <b>diagram.</b> The {{aim of the research}} was to specify and test the mechanical properties during numerical simulation. The experimental test results for the mechanical properties of the studies are presented with a large description of the testing facilities. The test results were used to determine the temperature dependencies of the mechanical properties, yield strength, modulus of elasticity and thermal elongation...|$|E

The elongation can be read with precision {{with the aid of a}} micrometer device and an indicator which has an attach-ment for practically eliminating parallactic errors. Read-ings are taken in the state of substantial equilibrium of load-versus-extension. With this machine it is possible to give special consideration to such critical points as the yield point. The instrument lends itself readily, further-more, to the determination of hysteresis loops and also to the investigation of crimp in yarns. Reliable data are given of <b>load</b> <b>extension</b> curves of representative synthetic yarns. In addition to taking the stretch-versus-tension diagrams, as such, the hysteresis loops are determined for various points of the load-strain curve and their theoretical and practical importance is discussed. The measurements taken of textile yarns are compared to the <b>load</b> <b>extension</b> characteristics of metals and the results are discussed in exact physical terms.

40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} {{undrained}} and drained triaxial {{tests were conducted}} to investigate the yielding behavior of anisotropically consolidated reconstituted Shanghai clay under triaxial compression and <b>extension</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. The soil was consolidated with K of 0. 5, where K is the ratio of cell pressure to axial pressure. The tests included drained constant η (=q/p′) loading tests and undrained and drained triaxial compression and extension shear tests on anisotropically consolidated specimens. It {{was found that the}} anisotropically consolidated Shanghai clay obeys Rendulic’s principle under compression loading, but not under <b>extension</b> <b>loading,</b> and that the yield surface inclined inside the state boundary surface under <b>extension</b> <b>loading.</b> Moreover, the pre-yield behavior and the post-yield behavior were found to be very different under these two loading conditions (compression and <b>extension</b> <b>loading).</b> The test results confirm the validity of the sloping elastic wall theory, and the influence of anisotropic parameter β on the shape of the yield curve in the p′−v plane was also studied in the paper.

40|$|Background: Some {{cross-sectional}} {{studies have}} suggested that the prevalence of low back pain (LBP) may be high among endurance athletes with repetitive back loading, but there are no large, prospective cohort studies addressing this issue. Purpose: To compare the prevalence of symptoms of low back pain (LBP) among former endurance athletes with different loading characteristics on the lumbar region: cross-country skiing (flexion <b>loading),</b> rowing (<b>extension</b> <b>loading),</b> and orienteering (no specific loading), as well as a nonathletic control group. Conclusion: Low back pain was not more common among former endurance athletes with specific back loading compared with non-athletes. The results indicate that years of prolonged and repetitive flexion or <b>extension</b> <b>loading</b> in endurance sports does not lead to more LBP. However, a large training volume in the past year and previous episodes with LBP are risk factors for LBP. Comparing the sports of rowing, cross-country skiing, and orienteering, it appears that whereas orienteering is protective, rowing can provoke LBP...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} percentages of elastane and Nylon yarn on the dimensional and physical properties of elastanelNylon Locknit warp knitted fabrics are investigated. In order {{to investigate the}} properties ofthe fabric, four different samples were knitted by selecting four different run-in ratios of elastane and Nylon. Elastane yarn was kept at a constant elongation of 65 % for all four samples. Two samples were produced keeping constant run-in of nylon yarn and changing the run-in length of elastane yarn. Then elastane yarn run-in was kept constant and produced two other samples. The sample with minimum run-in length of elastane yarn and the highest run-in ratio has the highest value of load at 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % extensions in length direction and the lowest values of load at 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % extensions in width direction. This {{is due to the}} fact that low run in of elastane yarn increases the strain on the yarn and it increases the tightness factor value of the sample and contributes higher <b>load</b> at <b>extension</b> along the length direction of the greige sample. Nylon yarn runner length influences the relaxation behavior of elastane yarn and it leads to reduce the <b>load</b> at <b>extension</b> along the width direction of the sample. Changing of Nylon yarn runner length influence the relaxation behavior of elastane yarn and it has an effect on the <b>load</b> at different <b>extension</b> in width direction and course density of the greige fabric. Results revealed that the effect of elastane content of the sample is more on the <b>load</b> at <b>extension</b> values than the effect of run-in of the Nylon yarn...|$|R
40|$|Diagram (or BPD) is {{included}} in all general UML modeling tools. The BPD diagram allows business users and business analysts to design business processes with business process modeling notations. Some papers review that exporting BPMN to BPEL feature is a significant feature of communication between business and technical uses over their requirements. However, as we investigated, there are some limitations on exporting BPMN to BPEL. This implies that exporting BPD diagram to BPEL files {{is not the end}} solution for business and technical users. This paper proposes to establish mapping between BPMN notations in the BPD diagram and BPEL notations in the BPEL diagram to ensure smooth operation between the two groups. It also shows that the BPEL designer diagram is useful for business users with technical skill, who plan to design business process to be integrated as an <b>extension</b> <b>diagram</b> in UML modeling tools.

40|$|The Rheotens {{experiment}} is a quasi-isothermal fibre spinning experiment. A polymer melt presheared in a capillary die is stretched under {{the action of}} a constant drawdown force until rupture of the filament. The experiment results in an <b>extension</b> <b>diagram</b> which describes the elongational behaviour of a polymer melt and therefore is relevant for many polymer processes like blow moulding, film blowing, and fibre spinning. Also, the rupture stress of a polymer melt can be calculated, which is of importance for these industrial applications. As {{an extension of the}} experiment, the local velocity distribution along the fibre can be measured with a Laser-Doppler Velocimeter (LDA). From this, the shape of the deformed filament as well as local elongation rates can be derived. In general, melt strength and drawability depend on the material properties of the melt and on the processing conditions of the experiment. The existence of Rheotens mastercurves allows to separate the polymer melt properties from the processing conditions and thus simplifies the description of elongational behaviour under constant force deformation. The Rheotens mastercurve reflects structural differences of polymer melts...|$|R

One of the primary goals of a computer architect is the design and construction of machines, that support the efficient execution of the programs that will run on them. The simplicity of the instruction set provides a number of implementation advantages that can substantially enhance the performance of the machine. The use of fixed length instructions and a few formats permits simpler hardware, faster instruction execution and low power consumption. These advantages are influenced by the usage of LERI instruction. The number of ALU operations executed in AE 32000, using the integer only instruction set, are greatly reduced compared to the mixed instruction set architecture like ARM.

40|$|The {{application}} of the nonsteady Lax-Wendroff technique to problems with asymptotically periodic solution which offers a potentially powerful method for {{the investigation of the}} interaction of rotating and stationary blade rows in turbomachinery is reported. A technique for specifying boundary conditions with phase lag was developed to accomplish this. A complete nonlinear analysis is carried out numerically to determine the entire flow field without recourse to the assumption of small disturbances of linear equations which underlie the previous acoustic theories. The result, obtained for the case of equal number of rotor and stator blades shows that transonic flow can be handled without difficulty.
