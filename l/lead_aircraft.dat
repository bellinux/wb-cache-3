5|$|On 16 December 1982, B-52G 57-6482, {{assigned}} to 328th BS, 93rd BW, Castle AFB, California, was {{participating in a}} Minimum Interval Take-Off (MITO; 12 seconds between each aircraft on takeoff) from Mather AFB, CA. The incident aircraft was in the number two position of a three-ship group. The B-52G was equipped with water injection to give additional thrust for take-off, but the <b>lead</b> <b>aircraft</b> was not equipped with this system. After takeoff the aircraft began to rapidly overtake the lead, so the pilot retarded the throttles rapidly, causing flameout of four engines. The aircraft then stalled and crashed. Nine crew members were killed.|$|E
5|$|Only two Fortresses {{had left}} Bedek's storage {{facility}} {{by the time}} hostilities commenced on October 29, 1956. The squadron had not flown a single training sortie before fighting began and had only two full crews ready for battle. Israeli piston-engined aircraft flew few missions {{in the first two}} days of the war, but on October 31, 69 Squadron received an order to bomb Rafah in support of IDF Brigade 27 operations. Arriving over the target early on November 1, the aircraft could not tell the location of friendly troops and without being able to communicate with the forces on the ground, were forced to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean. The B-17s were back in action the following night, to attack retreating Egyptian forces. A repeat of the previous night's lack of communications with Israeli forces operating in the same area once again prevented the strike, and the bombers dropped their loads on the outskirts of Gaza. With the threat of Egyptian air power curtailed by Anglo-French strikes against Egyptian air bases, the B-17s began flying daylight operations. On November 2 the squadron supported the Israeli push towards Sharm el Sheikh, on the southern tip of the Sinai. Two aircraft bombed the local barracks but were met with effective anti-aircraft fire which damaged the <b>lead</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The damaged aircraft managed to return to Ramat David, just as the third B-17 returned from storage at Bedek. Two aircraft were therefore available for the B-17s' final combat sorties with the IAF, another failed strike on Sharm el Sheikh on November 4.|$|E
25|$|On 21 April 1945 {{at around}} 0630 local time 137 B-24 bombers from the 466th Bombardment Group {{departed}} from their {{air force base}} near Norfolk, England to bomb a railway bridge in Salzburg, Austria. Within the formation, Black Cat led the third squadron. However once the target was reached four hours later, the mission had to be abandoned due to the heavy cloud and thunderstorms covering the area. The <b>lead</b> <b>aircraft</b> flew a return course over Regensburg. This decision was queried by several navigators in the formation because Regensburg was a heavily bombed and defended city: it was home to the Messerschmitt factory which had been the Eighth Air Force's first major bombing target {{of the war in}} August 1943.|$|E

25|$|In 1954 under Project Cherry, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{obtained}} five {{newly built}} P2V-7 and converted these into P2V-7U/RB-69A variants by Lockheed's Skunk Works at Hangar B5 in Burbank, California, for the CIA's own private fleet of covert ELINT/ferret aircraft. Later, {{to make up}} for P2V-7U/RB-69A operational losses, the CIA obtained and converted two existing US Navy P2V-7s, one in September 1962, and one in December 1964 to P2V-7U/RB-69A Phase VI standard, and also acquired an older P2V-5 from the US Navy as a training aircraft in 1963. Test flights were made by <b>lead</b> <b>aircraft</b> at Edwards AFB from 1955 to 1956, all the aircraft painted with dark sea blue color but with USAF markings.

25|$|Tactically, a Marine {{aircraft}} squadron is task-organized for {{a specific}} mission that may call for from one aircraft to the entire squadron. This tactical organization is temporary and fluid and rarely lasts with the same aircraft/aircrews {{for more than one}} mission. This continual reorganization occurs as aircraft and aircrews are rotated onto the flight schedule per aircraft availability, crew rest, and other considerations. A general tactical organizational scheme is: sortie - one aircraft on one mission, under the command of a designated aircraft commander (multi-pilot/crew aircraft only); section - two or three aircraft, under the command of a designated section leader; division - two or three sections under the command of a designated division leader, squadron - two or three divisions, under the command of the squadron commander or his designated representative (e.g., executive officer, operations officer, etc.). Traditionally, the <b>lead</b> <b>aircraft</b> belongs to the commanding officer.|$|E

The first SNODGRASS round was launched on 14 July with its warhead replaced by an instrument package and launched against a 350-knot Q2A Ryan Firebee I drone. A similar test on 17 July against a 300-knot Q2A destroyed the target with the T45. A dual-launch followed on 24 July, with the first round destroying its target with the T45, and the second with the instrument package flying one second behind. A similar test on 29 July launched two missiles against three F-80 Shooting Star drones flying in formation, the first missile destroyed the <b>lead</b> <b>aircraft</b> while the second passed within lethal range of a second.

40|$|Aircraft {{are complex}} {{machines}} consisting {{of tens of}} thousands of parts and assemblies. Due to special engineering requirements, processes, and materials, the lead time for many of the parts can be several months resulting in a long <b>aircraft</b> <b>lead</b> time. During periods of high demand long <b>aircraft</b> <b>lead</b> time is less of a concern since manufacturers often have a large backlog, which is greater than the lead time, allowing them to build the aircraft to order. However, during periods of low demand, manufacturers may need to forecast demand and make the decision to start building aircraft before having a committed customer order. The longer the lead time of the aircraft, the further out into the future the manufacturer has to forecast, which leads to greater uncertainty and variability. In this environment it becomes essential to focus on lead time reduction to allow for better forecasting. Shorter <b>aircraft</b> <b>lead</b> times also have the added benefits of increasing flexibility in production and capacity planning, and lowering inventory holding costs and work in process. Reducing <b>aircraft</b> <b>lead</b> time can often be a difficult task. However, a structured approach to lead time reduction can be very powerful. This paper presents a framework for lead time reduction that is composed of a lead time reduction chart, which provides the correct areas of focus; a strategy flowchart, which identifies the components, strategies, and actions that can be implemented to reduce <b>aircraft</b> <b>lead</b> time; and a summary of reduction strategies that are focused on low rate, complex parts. While the framework is detailed toward <b>aircraft</b> <b>lead</b> time reduction, it is general enough to apply to most supply chain and manufacturing situations. This framework was used during a six month <b>aircraft</b> <b>lead</b> time reduction study at Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, and analysis reveals that this structured approach was effective at reducing average <b>aircraft</b> <b>lead</b> time by 12. 7 %. by John Andrew Marsh.

25|$|When {{the use of}} paratroops was {{contemplated}} for Operation Torch, Williams was given the task of organizing and commanding the 51st Troop Carrier Wing. The headquarters of the 51st Troop Carrier Wing arrived in Scotland on 1 September 1942 and {{was assigned to the}} Eighth Air Force. Williams was given all three of the troop carrier groups in the theater: the 60th Troop Carrier Group, the 62nd Troop Carrier Group and the 64th Troop Carrier Group. None of them had their full complement of 52 C-47 aircraft and many of the personnel of their air and ground crews were fresh out of training schools. Nonetheless, they constituted the entire Allied troop carrier force in the North African Theater of Operations operating in support of US and British airborne operations in North Africa. Williams reached North Africa by air on 15 November 1942. On 28 November Williams personally led forty-forty aircraft of the 62nd and 64th Troop Carrier Groups carrying 530 paratroops of the British 2nd Parachute Battalion. The battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Dutton Frost rode with Williams in the <b>lead</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Williams picked his landmarks carefully and successfully navigated his way to Depienne Airfield, dropping the paratroops nearby. All his aircraft returned safely. Frost and his paratroops were not so lucky; half of them were killed or captured fighting their way back to Allied line.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{above and}} beyond the call of duty. On 1 August 1943, he served as pilot of the <b>lead</b> <b>aircraft</b> in his group in a daring low-level attack against enemy oil refineries and installations at Ploesti, Rumania. Although he had completed more than his share of missions and was no longer connected with this group, so high was his conception of duty that he volunteered to lead the formation in the correct belief that his participation would contribute materially to success in this attack. Maj. Jerstad led the formation into attack with full realization of the extreme hazards involved and despite withering fire from heavy and light antiaircraft guns. Three miles from the target his airplane was hit, badly damaged, and set on fire. Ignoring {{the fact that he was}} flying over a field suitable for a forced landing, he kept on the course. After the bombs of his aircraft were released on the target, the fire in his ship became so intense as to make further progress impossible and he crashed into the target area. By his voluntary acceptance of a mission he knew was extremely hazardous, and his assumption of an intrepid course of action at the risk of life over and above the call of duty, Maj. Jerstad set an example of heroism which will be an inspiration to the U.S. Armed Forces.|$|E

500|$|Typical of most early jets, the Thunderjet's takeoff {{performance}} left {{much to be}} desired.

500|$|Preliminary {{designer}} Dick Scherrer requested possible shapes {{upon which}} he could base his low radar cross-section (RCS) design.

I said 'Well, it's simple, you just {{make it out of}} flat surfaces, and tilt those flat surfaces over, sweeping the edges away from the radar view angle, and that way you basically cause the energy to reflect away from the radar.'" [...] Scherrer subsequently drew a preliminary low-RCS aircraft with faceted surfaces.

500|$|According to the 25th Infantry Division's Tropic Lightning Museum, 14 {{different}} American {{pilots were}} able to take off during the surprise attack and record 10 Japanese aircraft kills. Air Corps records credit Welch with four kills and Taylor with two, yet new research of Japanese combat reports confirms Taylor got four kills (when the two probable kills are included). Taylor claimed in an interview: [...] "I know for certain I shot down two planes or perhaps more; I don't know." [...] On the 13th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, the United States Air Force stated that they could not determine which of the two pilots shot down the first Japanese bomber: [...] "Each of them in his first attack shot down an enemy bomber, so the difference in time would have been but a few seconds in any case." [...] While in the air during the dogfight, the two pilots agreed that whoever survived the battle would claim credit to the title for the first kill. However, both pilots survived and because Welch outranked Taylor (he was a 41A, Taylor a 41C) and was the <b>lead</b> <b>aircraft</b> in the fight, he was credited with the first kill. The efforts of the two pilotsâ€™ dogfights {{were able to}} divert the Japanese from destroying the Haleiwa air field, which the Japanese intelligence did not know about prior to the attack.

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 29 November, the 530strong {{battalion}} boarded 44 transport aircraft and took off, bound for Oudna. Because there had been insufficient time to conduct an aerial reconnaissance of the airfield, Lieutenant Colonel Frost was forced to choose a landing zone for the battalion from his position in the <b>lead</b> <b>aircraft,</b> fortunately locating a clear, open space near the airfield. The airfield had been abandoned by the Germans, and the landing for the battalion was scattered but unopposed, although it incurred seven casualties during the drop, {{one of which was}} fatal. The airfield was secured after the battalion had rallied; a platoon from 'C' Company remained at the airfield to guard the wounded and the discarded parachutes, and at midnight the rest of the battalion moved out towards Oudna. As the battalion advanced the only transport available to it were a few handdrawn mule carts, which made the unit look, {{in the words of one}} paratrooper, [...] "like a fucking travelling circus rather than a parachute battalion." [...] By 11:00 on 30 November the battalion had reached a position that allowed it to overlook the Oudna airfield, and at 14:30 it began to advance and reached the airfield, only to find that it, too, had been abandoned. The battalion was then counterattacked by a number of German tanks supported by fighters and Stuka divebombers. The Germans were repelled, but at dusk Frost pulled the battalion back westwards to a more defensible position, hoping to await the arrival of advance units from British First Army. These, however, were not to arrive; in a wireless message received at dawn on 1 December, Frost was informed that the Allied drive towards Tunis had been postponed.|$|E
