5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The level {{of access to the}} 5' cap and poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates <b>less</b> <b>if</b> the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes that seem to be involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E
5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far <b>less</b> <b>if</b> pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E
5|$|Old Kazran is soon {{visited by}} {{holographic}} {{images of the}} ship's crew in the present. After observing the effects of Abigail's singing, the crew is singing Christmas carols, the sound frequencies of which are helping to stabilise the ship but cannot prevent it from crashing. Amy appears to Kazran and implores his help, but he waves away the holograms. The Doctor appears, and Kazran surmises that he is there to show Kazran his future, {{but he could not}} care <b>less</b> <b>if</b> he dies old and alone; he reveals that Abigail had an incurable disease on entering cryostorage and will only have one more day to live. As he cannot decide which day that should be, Kazran chastises the Doctor for believing he could change his mind. Unbeknownst to Kazran, the Doctor has brought young Kazran with him; the realisation of how much his bitter future self now resembles his feared father causes a change of heart in Kazran (making his own memory of his future self the show's version of the ghost of Christmas yet to come), and he quickly agrees to release the controls to save the ship.|$|E

25|$|With {{increasing}} depth underwater, sunlight is absorbed, and {{the amount}} of visible light diminishes. Because absorption is greater for long wavelengths (red end of the visible spectrum) than for short wavelengths (blue end of the visible spectrum), the colour spectrum is rapidly altered with increasing depth. White objects at the surface appear bluish underwater, and red objects appear dark, even black. Although light penetration will be <b>less</b> <b>if</b> water is turbid, in the very clear water of the open ocean less than 25% of the surface light reaches a depth of 10 m (33feet). At 100m (330ft) the light present from the sun is normally about 0.5% of that at the surface.|$|E

25|$|It is {{also found}} that the rate of trophallactic feeding depends on the number of ants per nest, and the quality of food available. When the number of donors is kept constant, but the number of total {{individuals}} in increased, more individuals test positive for the food marker. This indicates that more individuals are eating, but the amount they eat is <b>less.</b> <b>If</b> the number of donors was doubled, {{and the size of the}} overall population increased, the number of individuals receiving food more than doubled, again indicating that the number of individuals fed increased, but that the per capita amount of food consumed decreased. The ants prefer sugar and protein food sources over lipids, and this preference did not change seasonally. When specific sugar sources were studied the ants preferred sucrose over other sugars, such as fructose and glucose.|$|E
25|$|Distribution of {{voltage-gated}} sodium channels {{along the}} dendritic membrane plays {{a crucial role}} in a dendrites ability to propagate a signal. High dendritic membrane thresholds often make it harder for initiation of dendritic spikes. However, increased density of voltage-gated sodium channels may reduce the amplitude of a signal needed to initiate a spike. Clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels have been observed at the synapses of the globus pallidus neuron. It has also been demonstrated through dendritic computational models that the threshold amplitude of a synaptic conductance needed to generate a dendritic spike is significantly <b>less</b> <b>if</b> the voltage-gated sodium channels are clustered at the synapse. The same type of voltage-gated channels may differ in distribution between the soma and dendrite within the same neuron. There seems to be no general pattern of distribution for voltage-gated channels within dendrites. Different neuronal dendrites exhibit different density patterns which are subject to change during development and can be modulated by neurotransmitters.|$|E
25|$|The LCA {{had a long}} central {{well section}} fitted with three benches, one centre, one each port and starboard, for seating troops. The side benches were covered by the top deck. The well was divided from the bow by a {{bulkhead}} fitted with two vertically hinged doors.

Two rollers on the leading outboard edge providing some freedom of movement for the ramp when it was grounded.

The shelter was protected on all four sides by non-magnetic bulletproof plate surmounted by a hinged double-door roof. Most LCAs were fitted with a compass.|$|E
