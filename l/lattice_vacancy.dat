40|$|<b>Lattice</b> <b>vacancy</b> {{effects on}} {{electrical}} conductance of nanographite ribbon are investigated {{by means of}} the Landauer approach using a tight binding model. In the low-energy regime ribbons with zigzag boundary provide a single conducting channel whose origin is connected with the presence of edge states. It is found that the chemical potential dependence of conductance strongly depends on the difference (Δ) of the number of removed A and B sublattice sites. The large <b>lattice</b> <b>vacancy</b> with Δ≠ 0 shows 2 Δ zero-conductance dips in the single-channel region, however, the large <b>lattice</b> <b>vacancy</b> with Δ= 0 has no dip structure in this region.

40|$|In {{the present}} study density {{functional}} theory calculations {{have been used to}} calculate the binding energies of clusters formed between lattice vacancies, oxygen and isovalent atoms in germanium. In particular we concentrated on the prediction of binding energies of A-centers or oxygen interstitials that are at nearest and next nearest neighbor sites to isovalent impurities (carbon, silicon and tin) in germanium. The A-center is an oxygen interstitial atom near a <b>lattice</b> <b>vacancy</b> and is an important impurity-defect pair in germanium. In germanium doped with carbon or silicon, we calculated that most of the binding energy of the cluster formed between A-centers and the carbon or silicon atoms is due to the interaction between the oxygen interstitial atom and the carbon or silicon atoms. For tin-doped germanium most of the binding energy is due to the interaction of the oversized tin atom and the <b>lattice</b> <b>vacancy,</b> which essentially provide space for tin to relax. The nearest neighbor carbon-oxygen interstitial and the silicon-oxygen interstitial pairs are significantly bound, whereas the tin-oxygen interstitial pairs are not. The results are discussed in view of analogous investigations in isovalently doped silicon...|$|E

Interestingly, we predict that the A-center is more bound in isovalent-doped and, in particular, tin-doped silicon.

There are more defects and dislocations in the anatase structures than other crystalline structures[38, 39]. Al and V atoms had an atomic radius different from Ti atom. Thus, Al and V doping could produce more <b>lattice</b> <b>vacancy</b> to capture electrons and accelerate the electron change which is beneficial for the chemical adsorption of hydrogen {{at the surface}} and therefore enhance the hydrogen sensitivity. Furthermore, an increased operating temperature of the nanofilm sensor could accelerate the diffusivity of the hydrogen atoms {{to the surface of}} the nanofilms and thus lead to a higher sensitivity.|$|E

Moreover, the solubility of Ar in different samples of a particular mineral run in the same experiment varied more than the solubility in the same sample run in different experiments, suggesting that noble gases are held in <b>lattice</b> <b>vacancy</b> defects.

25|$|Despite {{its wide}} band gap of about 8.35 eV at 80 K, caesium {{chloride}} weakly conducts electricity, and the conductivity is not electronic but ionic. The conductivity has {{a value of}} the order 10−7 S/cm at 300°C. It occurs through nearest-neighbor jumps of <b>lattice</b> <b>vacancies,</b> and the mobility is much higher for the Cl− than Cs+ vacancies. The conductivity increases with temperature up to about 450°C, with an activation energy changing from 0.6 to 1.3 eV at about 260°C. It then sharply drops by two orders of magnitude because of the phase transition from the α-CsCl to β-CsCl phase. The conductivity is also suppressed by application of pressure (about 10 times decrease at 0.4 GPa) which reduces the mobility of <b>lattice</b> <b>vacancies.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{electronic}} spin relaxation {{effect in the}} hole-doped monolayer and bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides {{in the presence of}} the crystal defects. We consider realistic models of the <b>lattice</b> <b>vacancy</b> and actually estimate the spin relaxation rate using the multi-orbital tight-binding model. In the monolayer, the spin-relaxation time is found to be extremely long compared to the momentum relaxation time, and this is attributed to the fact that the spin hybridization in the band structure is suppressed by the mirror reflection symmetry. The bilayer TMD has a much shorter spin relaxation time in contrast, and this is attributed to stronger spin hybridization due to the absence of the mirror symmetry. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

The use of Rapid Thermal Processing {{to install}} <b>lattice</b> <b>vacancy</b> {{profiles}} into silicon wafers {{for the purpose}} of forming a template for the nucleation and ideal control of oxygen precipitation has become an important materials engineering tool for the microelectronics industry.

Also discussed are recent discoveries about the critical role of the other intrinsic point defect, the self-interstitial and the development of oxygen precipitates and their distributions post-nucleation and the critical importance of what has become to be called the “ninja transformation ” in the switching-on of gettering efficiency of oxygen precipitate systems...|$|E

40|$|Phase {{transformations in}} 2 xxx series {{aluminium}} alloys (Al-Cu-Mg) are investigated with an off-lattice atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulation incorporating {{the effects of}} strain around misfitting atoms and vacancies. Vacancy diffusion is modeled by comparing the energies of trial states, where the system is partially relaxed for each trial state. Only a limited precision {{is required for the}} energy of each trial state, determined by the value of k{sub B}T. Since the change in the relaxation displacement field caused by a vacancy hop decays as 1 /r{sup 3 }, it is sufficient to determine the next move by relaxing only those atoms in a sphere of finite radius centered on the moving vacancy. However, once the next move has been selected, the entire system is relaxed. Simulations of the early stages of phase separation in Al-Cu with elastic relaxation show an enhanced rate of clustering compared to those performed on the same system with a rigid lattice.
