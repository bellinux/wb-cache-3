40|$|Many nucleic acid-binding {{proteins}} and the AAA+ family form hexameric rings, but {{the mechanism of}} hexamer assembly is unclear. It is generally believed that the specificity in protein/RNA interaction relies on molecular contact through a surface charge or 3 D structure matching via conformational capture or induced fit. The pRNA of bacteriophage phi 29 DNA-packaging motor also forms a ring, but whether the pRNA ring is a hexamer or a pentamer is under debate. Here, single molecule studies elucidated a mechanism suggesting the specificity and affinity in protein/RNA interaction relies on pRNA static ring formation. A combined pRNA ring-forming group was very specific for motor binding, but the isolated individual members of the ring-forming group bind to the motor nonspecifically. pRNA did not form a ring prior to motor binding. Only those RNAs that formed a static ring, via the interlocking loops, stayed on the motor. Single interlocking <b>loop</b> <b>interruption</b> resulted in pRNA detachment. Extension or reduction of the ring circumference failed in motor binding. This new mechanism was tested by redesigning two artificial RNAs that formed hexamer and packaged DNA. The results confirmed the stoichiometry of pRNA on the motor was the common multiple of two and three, thus, a hexamer...|$|E
40|$|The tumor {{microenvironment}} {{is critical to}} cancer growth and therapy resistance. We previously characterized human ovarian carcinoma-associated mesenchymal stem cells (CA-MSCs). CA-MSCs are multi-potent cells that can differentiate into {{tumor microenvironment}} components including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and adipocytes. We previously reported CA-MSCs, compared to normal MSCs, express high levels of BMP proteins and promote tumor growth by increasing numbers of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). We demonstrate here that ovarian tumor cell-secreted Hedgehog (HH) induces CA-MSC BMP 4 expression. CA-MSC-derived BMP 4 reciprocally increases ovarian tumor cell HH expression indicating a positive feedback <b>loop.</b> <b>Interruption</b> of this loop with a HH pathway inhibitor or BMP 4 blocking antibody decreases CA-MSC-derived BMP 4 and tumor-derived HH preventing enrichment of CSCs and reversing chemotherapy resistance. The impact of HH inhibition was only seen in CA-MSC-containing tumors, indicating {{the importance of a}} humanized stroma. These results are reciprocal to findings in pancreatic and bladder cancer, suggesting HH signaling effects are tumor tissue specific warranting careful investigation in each tumor type. Collectively, we define a critical positive feedback loop between CA-MSC-derived BMP 4 and ovarian tumor cell-secreted HH and present evidence for the further investigation of HH as a clinical target in ovarian cancer. 1 -R 01 -CA 163345 - 01 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesDP 200440377 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United StatesP 30 CA 046592 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States 26755648 PMC 487275...|$|E

40|$|The {{modified}} Mayr arc model, {{in which}} the arc time constant and arc power loss are dependent on the arc conductance transition near current zero, were investigated. The interrupting capability and phenomena are much affected by the index parameters of the equation between the arc time constant and the arc conductance.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method of {{reconstruction}} after pancreaticoduodenectomy consisting of a double Roux en Y on the same jejunal <b>loop</b> without <b>interruption</b> of the mesentery and a third anatomical Roux en Y to reconstitute the alimentary tract. The construction of the double Roux en Y draining pancreas and bile ducts separately, requires a linear Stapler 3 - 4 centimeters from the biliary anastomosis. In this way, by employing the same <b>loop</b> without mesenteric <b>interruption,</b> two functional excluded loops will be â€™obtained. The rationale of the suggested model {{is based on the}} separation of biliary and pancreatic secretions. This makes it possible to avoid a stagnant cul-de-sac coinciding with the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis and to obtain in the case of leakage, a pure biliary and/or pancreatic fistula as far as is possible. 99 mTc HIDA scans demonstrated the efficiency, of the biliopancreatic limbs of the reconstruction, showing normal emptying time for the gastric remnant and the absence of radionuclide stagnation or any alkaline enterogastric reflux.

40|$|The arc models sumulating the {{interrupting}} phenomena near current {{zero and}} ebaluating the loop current interrupting capability were investigated. The evaluation using the various arc models, {{such as the}} Mayr model. Cassie-Mayr switching model, showd different performance {{in the case of}} the large arc time constant. This suggests the arc model used for the evaluation of the interrupters with newly developed gasses of large arc time constant is to be reviewed as the interrupting condition.

50|$|The {{biochemical}} {{mechanism of}} action of general anaesthetics is not well understood. To induce unconsciousness, anaesthetics have myriad sites of action and affect {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) at multiple levels. Common areas of the central nervous system whose functions are interrupted or changed during general anesthesia include the cerebral cortex, thalamus, reticular activating system, and spinal cord. Current theories on the anaesthetized state identify not only target sites in the CNS but also neural networks and <b>loops</b> whose <b>interruption</b> is linked with unconsciousness. Potential pharmacologic targets of general anaesthetics are GABA, glutamate-activated ion channels, NMDA receptor families, voltage-gated ion channels, and glycine and serotonin receptors.|$|R
50|$|PPRHs can be {{designed}} for virtually any gene in the genome by searching for polypirimidine stretches in the sequence of the desired gene. Optimal lengths for each domain of the PPRHs are within 20-30 nucleotides. The total length of a typical PPRH is 55 nucleotides considering two domains of 25 bases plus 5T for the linking <b>loop.</b> If purine <b>interruptions</b> are encountered (up to three) within the polypirimidine target, the highest affinity of PPRH binding is achieved by placing in the hairpin the complementary base (a pyrimidine) {{in front of the}} purines (Wild type-PPRH).|$|R
