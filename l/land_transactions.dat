5|$|Before {{turning to}} the {{district}} court's rulings, we must acknowledge a certain awkwardness in deciding whether the Act encompasses the Tribe without considering {{at the same time}} whether the Act encompasses the controverted <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> with Maine. Whether the Tribe is a tribe within the Act would best be decided, under ordinary circumstances, along with the Tribe's specific land claims, for the Act only speaks of tribes {{in the context of their}} land dealings.|$|E

5|$|Malone took up {{the study}} of law, {{becoming}} a solicitor in 1894 and a barrister five years later. In 1903, {{the same year that}} he and his family moved to New Plymouth, he formed a partnership dealing mostly with <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> with James McVeagh and W. D. Anderson. The partners would open several law offices around the Taranaki region.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 President Andrew Jackson had vetoed a rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States, an {{institution}} which he felt extended credit to northeastern commercial tycoons {{at the expense}} of the ordinary frontiersmen of the Old Southwest, a region with which Jackson, a Tennessean, strongly identified. In 1836 Jackson had issued an executive order called the Specie Circular which demanded that all <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> in the United States be conducted in cash. Both of these actions, combined with the economic depression following the Panic of 1837 (caused partly by Jackson's fiscal policies) increased the domestic need for minted money.|$|E
5|$|Key figures {{mentioned}} in inscriptions {{from rural areas}} were the Gavundas (officials) or Goudas. The Gavundas belonged to two levels of economic strata, the Praja Gavunda (people's Gavunda) and the Prabhu Gavunda (lord of Gavundas). They served the dual purpose of representing the people before the rulers as well as functioning as state appointees for tax collection and the raising of militias. They are {{mentioned in}} inscriptions related to <b>land</b> <b>transactions,</b> irrigation maintenance, village tax collection and village council duties.|$|E

5|$|The first {{division}} of the county occurred in 1814 when the northern portion of the county was separated to become Washington County. The county was again divided in 1818 with {{the western part of}} the county being separated to become Crawford County. A third division occurred in 1819 when Floyd County was created out of the eastern part of the county. Harrison County's eastern border has had minor adjustments through <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> with Floyd County; the last change occurred in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The head of {{the legal}} system was officially the pharaoh, who was {{responsible}} for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major <b>land</b> <b>transactions,</b> and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.|$|E
25|$|The equal-field {{system did}} not allow large <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> and thus during the early Tang estates {{remained}} small.

25|$|The World Bank {{concludes that}} governments and feudal elites {{extending}} {{to the poor}} the right to the land that they live and use are 'the key to reducing poverty' citing that land rights greatly increase poor people's wealth, in some cases doubling it. Although approaches varied, the World Bank said the key issues were security of tenure and ensuring <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> costs were low.|$|E

25|$|Fruela and Estefanía {{were most}} active in {{acquiring}} property (gananciales) through private transactions between 1088 and 1113. With twenty-three such exchanges having left records, their case {{is one of}} the best preserved of its kind: private <b>land</b> <b>transactions,</b> especially aristocratic purchases from peasants, increased dramatically in Spain between the late tenth and early twelfth century. Some of the couple's early, eleventh-century property gains were of the form of loan repayments, though this type of transaction disappears from the record altogether in the twelfth century.|$|E
25|$|Profit {{income from}} {{ordinary}} land sales, for example, {{is not included}} in official value-added, since <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> do not result in additional land (See also gross fixed capital formation, differential and absolute ground rent and land grabbing). Official fixed capital aggregates exclude the value of land, and no very reliable official estimates exist for the value of land, because of problems with credibly valuing land in a standard way for measurement purposes. If the world market prices for farm products rise, profit rates on land sales and commercial land values will increase; even if the number of land sales stays constant, the profit on land sales will increase.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} of New Orleans {{as a commercial}} center was reinforced when the United States Federal Government established {{a branch of the}} United States Mint there in 1838, along with two other Southern branch mints at Charlotte, North Carolina, and Dahlonega, Georgia. Although there was an existing coin shortage, the situation became much worse because in 1836 President Andrew Jackson had issued an executive order, called a specie circular, which demanded that all <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> in the United States be conducted in cash, thus increasing the need for minted money. In contrast to the other two Southern branch mints, which only minted gold coins, the New Orleans Mint produced both gold and silver coinage, which perhaps marked it as the most important branch mint in the country.|$|E
