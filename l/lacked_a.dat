5|$|A new species, Podoserpula miranda, was {{proposed}} in 2009 {{by a group}} of New Caledonian mycologists for a species of that South Pacific archipelago. The name was provisional (not validly published), however, as the description was in French (the code of nomenclature mandates Latin) and <b>lacked</b> <b>a</b> required designation of a type specimen. It was validly published in 2013.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the rifle}} corps were re-established in late 1942 and the {{previous}} organization of artillery at the corps level was reintroduced.

5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the typical species in several ways: var. magna grew among fallen leaves under balsam fir trees, or among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; it <b>lacked</b> <b>a</b> stem, and was instead broad and rounded underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E
5|$|In his 1931 study, Mavrodinov {{also writes}} {{that at the}} time, the church <b>lacked</b> <b>a</b> roof.

According to that story, the Circassians sought to pull down the church's roof. However, one of them fell to his death inside the church, so they fled in horror. The church was thoroughly reconstructed in 1937 by a team under architect Rashenov.|$|E

Alexander's election had been secured by promising that he would confirm the unconfirmed French bishops.

5|$|Of the season's five {{tropical}} cyclones, three reached hurricane status.

Only one storm left significant impact, which was the second hurricane. It brought flooding and strong winds to Texas, resulting in severe damage in some areas. A tornado spawned by the storm also caused five fatalities.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Commonwealth, under king John II Casimir Vasa since 1648, {{experienced}} a crisis resulting {{both from the}} Cossack Khmelnytsky Uprising in the southeast and from the paralysis of the administration due to the internal quarrels of the nobility, including feuds between the king and the Lithuanian hetman Janusz Radziwiłł and feuds among disagreeing sejmiks who {{had been able to}} stall each other's ambitions with the liberum veto since 1652.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To examine {{why people}} <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> regular source of {{ambulatory}} care (RSAC) and explore whether this commonly used access measure accurately identifies population subgroups {{at risk for}} barriers to continuity care. METHODS: Using data from a 1986 national telephone survey, we performed a content analysis of subjects' verbatim reports {{as to why they}} <b>lacked</b> <b>an</b> RSAC (n = 5, 748). RESULTS: The 16. 4 percent of respondents who <b>lacked</b> <b>an</b> RSAC gave the following reasons: 1) financial problems, 8 percent; 2) local resource inaccessibility, 5 percent; 3) not wanting a regular source of ambulatory care, 61 percent; and 4) transitory loss of their regular source of ambulatory care, 18 percent. However, some sociodemographic subgroups reported substantially more problems with access barriers, and these disparities were often not detected by the global measure, RSAC. The poor were not more likely than the non-poor to <b>lack</b> <b>an</b> RSAC (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 8; 95 % confidence interval, [0. 6, 1. 1]), but {{were much more likely to}} <b>lack</b> <b>an</b> RSAC for financial reasons (OR = 5. 2 [2. 6, 10. 6]). Similarly, rural respondents were not more likely than urban dwellers to <b>lack</b> <b>an</b> RSAC, but were more likely to <b>lack</b> <b>an</b> RSAC because of local resource inaccessibility (OR = 5. 8 [2. 8, 11. 9]). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the global measure, RSAC, is not an accurate indicator of whether population subgroups have access barriers to obtaining a source of continuity care...|$|R

Simmons and Stanley, feeling that the group <b>lacked</b> <b>a</b> unifying musical vision, began forming a new band in late 1972. Adopting a more straightforward, harder rock sound and an emphasis on stage theatrics, they became the band Kiss in early 1973.|$|E
