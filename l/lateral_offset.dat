500|$|Many erratic surface {{fractures}} {{were generated}} in the San Joaquin Valley along the White Wolf Fault. The cracks were not well-defined, and {{were the result of}} the disturbance of the alluvium that makes up the valley floor, rather than cracking along the fault trace. Northeast trending cracks ranging from hairline-width to near five inches wide were seen between Arvin and California State Route 166, and some showed clear <b>lateral</b> <b>offset,</b> but those were determined to be localized effects. Some of the fractures in the ground were aligned with the fault, and some were perpendicular to the general trend, but the more significant breaks were believed to be a direct result of faulting at depth. This was true in the mountainous areas as well, but some of the breaks at the higher elevations were probably related to slumping. The northeast trending breaks were described in a report from the State of California (that was prepared by well-known geologists and seismologists) as [...] "thrusting of the southeast block up and over the northwest block, and/or a lateral movement of the southeast block to the northeast".|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} to the static convergence and purity problems {{is a set of}} color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection yoke assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their magnetic fields parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field vector can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [...] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{legibility}} of {{train station}} name signs was analyzed with parallel (0 °) and perpendicular (90 °) installations regarding different speeds, different <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets,</b> and different widths of the signs. The theoretical analysis {{resulted in the}} superiority of perpendicular installations for short <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets</b> from the platform edge (3  m), and a superiority of parallel installations for large offsets (50  m). Sign width effected legibility nearly proportionally, higher speed reduced legibility inversely proportional. In the empirical part, {{the superiority of the}} perpendicular installation at short <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets</b> was supported. From a moving train, legibility of perpendicular signs is superior while during a full stop, parallel installations are advantageous. Thus, as a compromise, parallel installations should be used within the inner circle of a train station while at the entry and exit where trains are still moving, perpendicular signs should be preferred...|$|R
50|$|RNAV {{systems may}} provide the {{capability}} for the flight crew to specify a <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> from a defined route. Generally, lateral offsets can be specified in increments of 1 NM up to 20 NM. When a <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> is activated in the RNAV system, the RNAV aircraft will depart the defined route and typically intercept the offset at a 45° or less angle. When the offset is cancelled, the aircraft returns to the defined route in a similar manner. Such offsets can be used both strategically i.e. fixed offset {{for the length of}} the route, or tactically i.e. temporarily. Most RNAV systems discontinue offsets in the terminal area or at the beginning of an approach procedure, at an RNAV hold, or during course changes of 90° or greater.|$|E

50|$|The {{three basic}} types of gap loss are angular {{misalignment}} loss, <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> loss, and longitudinal displacement loss.The losses {{tend to be}} proportional to {{the ratio of the}} core radius {{to the size of the}} gap or displacement.

50|$|Strategic <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> {{procedure}} (SLOP) is {{a solution}} to a byproduct of increased navigation accuracy in aircraft. Because most now use GPS, aircraft track flight routes with extremely high accuracy. As a result, if an error in height occurs, there is a much higher chance of collision. SLOP allows aircraft to offset the centreline of an airway or flight route by a small amount, normally to the right, so that collision with opposite direction aircraft becomes unlikely.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{excavation}} and new radiocarbon {{dates of}} sediments at Pallett Creek {{are the basis}} for new conclusions regarding the late Holocene history of the San Andreas fault. Systematic dissection of a 50 -m-long, 15 -m-wide, 5 -m-deep volume of earth, centered on the fault, enables documentation in three dimensions of fault patterns, <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets,</b> and vertical deformation associated with large earthquakes of the past. The excavations expose evidence for 12 earthquakes that occurred between about 260 and 1857 A. D., with an average recurrence interval of about 145 years. Prehistoric slip events that occurred in 1720 ± 50, 1550 ± 70, 1350 ± 50, 1080 ± 65, and 845 ± 75 A. D. have <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets</b> that are {{comparable to those of}} the most recent great earthquake of 1857. Thus all of these events represent earthquakes of large magnitude. The <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets</b> of two other events, in 935 ± 85 and 1015 ± 100 A. D., are an order of magnitude smaller and may be interpreted in several ways with regard to the size of these events. The new data constrain the average recurrence interval for large earthquakes at this site to between 145 and 200 years but suggest a monotonic decrease in individual intervals to below this range during the past 900 years. On the basis of these data, the probability of a large earthquake with surficial fault rupture at this site is between 0. 2 and 5 % during 1984 and 7 and 60 % by the year 2000...|$|R

50|$|Consequently, a major {{limitation}} of linear referencing is that specifying points {{that are not}} on a linear feature is troublesome and error-prone, though not entirely impossible. Consider for example a ski lodge located 100 meters {{to the right of}} the road, traveling north. The linear referencing system can be extended by specifying a <b>lateral</b> <b>offset,</b> but the absolute location (i.e. coordinates) of the lodge cannot be determined unless coordinates are specified for the road; that process is prone to error particularly on curved roads.|$|E
50|$|Additionally from 10 June 2004 the {{strategic}} <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> procedure (SLOP) {{was introduced to}} the North Atlantic airspace {{to reduce the risk of}} mid-air collision by spreading out aircraft laterally. It reduces the risk of collision for non-normal events such as operational altitude deviation errors and turbulence induced altitude deviations. In essence, the procedure demands that aircraft in North Atlantic airspace fly track centreline or one or two nautical mile offsets to the right of centreline only. However, the choice is left up to the pilot.|$|E
50|$|The {{component}} of the Sun's motion seen by an earthbound observer caused by the revolution of the tilted axis - which, keeping the same angle in space, is oriented toward or away from the Sun - is an observed daily increment (and <b>lateral</b> <b>offset)</b> of the elevation of the Sun at noon for approximately six months and observed daily decrement for the remaining six months. At maximum or minimum elevation, the relative yearly motion of the Sun perpendicular to the horizon stops and reverses direction.|$|E
50|$|Performance-based flight {{operations}} {{are based on}} the ability to assure reliable, repeatable and predictable flight paths for improved capacity and efficiency in planned operations. The implementation of performance-based {{flight operations}} requires not only the functions traditionally provided by the RNAV system, but also may require specific functions to improve procedures, and airspace and air traffic operations. The system capabilities for established fixed radius paths, RNAV or RNP holding, and <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets</b> fall into this category.|$|R
50|$|Strike-slip {{tectonics}} {{is associated}} with the relative lateral movement of parts of the crust or the lithosphere. This type of tectonics is found along oceanic and continental transform faults which connect offset segments of mid-ocean ridges. Strike-slip tectonics also occurs at <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets</b> in extensional and thrust fault systems. In areas involved with plate collisions strike-slip deformation occurs in the over-riding plate in zones of oblique collision and accommodates deformation in the foreland to a collisional belt.|$|R

50|$|This 75 km long curved fault {{segment is}} mapped {{on the floor}} of the Cook Strait before {{crossing}} the Wellington peninsula through Long Valley and along the northwestern edge of Wellington Harbour, past Lower Hutt terminating near Kaitoke. This segment has had a lateral slip-rate of 6.0 - 7.6 mm per year for at least the last 140,000 years, from the progressive offset of dated river terraces. The most recent rupture event along this section is constrained to 150 - 450 yrs BP. This section is interpreted to give rise to characteristic earthquakes involving rupture of the entire fault segment, with a single-event displacement of 3.8 - 4.6 m. The recurrence interval is 500 - 770 years. The Kaitoke basin is a small pull-apart basin formed at the 2 km <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> between this segment and the Tararua segment, near Kaitoke.|$|E
50|$|The Chrysler Slant-6 {{engine was}} a clean-sheet design, led by Willem Weertman, later Chrysler's chief engine designer. Its {{characteristic}} 30° inclination of cylinder block {{gives it a}} lower height overall engine package. This enabled vehicle stylists to lower hoodlines, and also made room for the water pump to be mounted with a <b>lateral</b> <b>offset,</b> significantly shortening the engine's overall length. The slanted cylinder block also provides space in the vehicle's engine bay for intake and exhaust manifolds with runners of longer and more nearly equal length compared to the rake- or log-style manifolds typical of other inline engines. The Slant-6 manifold configuration gives relatively even distribution of fuel mixture to all cylinders, and presents less flow restriction. This, in turn, provides for relatively good airflow through the engine despite the intake and exhaust ports being {{on the same side}} of the head rather than in a crossflow arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Several {{cases are}} {{possible}} for an upright diver at the surface. This attitude is stable {{only when the}} centre of buoyancy is nearer the head then the centre of gravity, and on the same vertical line. Otherwise the diver will tend to rotate forwards or backwards until the centre of buoyancy is directly above the centre of gravity.In almost all cases the centre of buoyancy is nearer the head than the centre of gravity, and buoyancy compensators are all designed to provide this as the default condition, as an inverted diver floating at the surface is at risk of drowning. The <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> of centre of buoyancy from centre of gravity is generally insignificant unless the diver has been weighted asymmetrically between the sides, which is unusual, and seldom intentional, though it can occur when weights are ditched or lost from one side only.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Compared {{with total}} {{shoulder}} arthroplasty (TSA), total shoulder surface replacement (TSSR) may offer {{the advantage of}} preservation of bone stock and shorter surgical time, possibly {{at the expense of}} glenoid component positioning and increasing <b>lateral</b> glenohumeral <b>offset.</b> We hypothesized that in patients treated for osteoarthritis with a sufficient rotator cuff, TSA and TSSR patients have comparable functional outcome, glenoid component version, and <b>lateral</b> glenohumeral <b>offset.</b> METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. Patients in the TSA and TSSR groups received a cemented, curved, keeled, all-poly glenoid component. A cemented anatomical humeral stem was used in TSA. TSSR involved a humeral surface replacement (all components from Tornier Inc., St Ismier, France). Patients were assessed for functional outcome. Radiographs were assessed for radiolucent lines. Glenoid component position and <b>lateral</b> glenohumeral <b>offset</b> were assessed using computed tomography images. RESULTS: After 29 and 34 months of mean follow-up, respectively, TSA (n = 29) and TSSR (n = 20) groups showed similar median adjusted Constant Scores (84 % vs. 88 %), Oxford Shoulder Scores (44 vs. 44), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores (22 vs. 15), and Dutch Simple Shoulder Test scores (10 vs. 11). Glenoid components showed similar radiolucent line counts (median, 0 vs. 0), similar anteversion angles (mean, 0 degrees vs. 2 degrees), and similar preoperative to postoperative increases in <b>lateral</b> glenohumeral <b>offset</b> (mean, 4 vs. 5 mm). One intraoperative glenoid fracture occurred in the TSSR group. CONCLUSION: Short-term functional and radiographic outcomes were comparable for TSA and TSSR...|$|R

50|$|Some {{fractures}} {{that look}} like joints are actually shear fractures, which in effect are microfaults, instead of joints. Shear fractures do not form {{as the result of}} the perpendicular opening of a fracture due to tensile stress, but through the shearing of fractures that causes lateral movement of its faces. Shear fractures can be confused with joints, because the <b>lateral</b> <b>offset</b> of the fracture faces is not visible at the scale of outcrop or hand specimen. Because of the absence of diagnostic ornamentation or the lack of any discernible movement or offset, they can be indistinguishable from joints. Shear fractures occur in sets of planar parallel fractures at an angle of 60 degrees and can be of the same size and scale as joints. As a result, some conjugate joint sets may actually be shear fractures. In case of such joint sets, it might be possible to distinguish joints from shear fractures by looking for the presence of slickensides, which are products of shearing movement parallel to the fracture surface. The slickensides are fine-scale, delicate ridge-in-groove lineations that are found on the surface of fracture surfaces.|$|E

The desired formation is modeled as a virtual structure evolving curvilinearly along a centerline, and vehicle configurations are expressed as curvilinear relative longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>offsets</b> from the virtual center. At high-level, the trajectory generation of the virtual center is achieved through an MPC framework, which allows various on-road driving constraints {{to be considered in}} the optimization.
