The <b>LAX</b> {{control tower}} mistakenly tells the pilot to turn left instead of right to {{head over the}} ocean. BR 15 instead headed north and was maintaining 5000 feet as it headed towards 5700 foot peak Mt. Wilson. EVA was forced to climb to 6000 feet. Air Canada Flight 788, also from <b>LAX</b> was taking the same route BR 15 was. Air Canada Flight 788 was forced to climb to over 10000 feet to avoid hitting BR 15. It took almost two minutes for the pilot to make a 180 degree turn to go southbound. An investigation is being held and EVA Air also did not comment.|$|E
5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended at Slammiversary by then-champions The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide; <b>LAX)</b> against Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray).

40|$|This study investigates high vowel <b>laxing</b> in the Louisiana French of the Lafourche Basin. Unlike Canadian French, {{in which}} the high vowels /i, y, u/ are {{traditionally}} described as undergoing <b>laxing</b> (to [I, Y, U]) in word-final syllables closed by any consonant other than a voiced fricative (see Poliquin 2006), Oukada (1977) states that in the Louisiana French of Lafourche Parish, any coda consonant will trigger high vowel <b>laxing</b> of /i/; he excludes both /y/ and /u/ from his discussion of high vowel <b>laxing.</b> The current study analyzes tokens of /i, y, u/ from pre-recorded interviews with three older male speakers from Terrebonne Parish. We measured {{the first and second}} formants and duration for high vowel tokens produced in four phonetic environments, crossing syllable type (open vs. closed) by consonant type (voiced fricative vs. any consonant other than a voiced fricative). Results of the acoustic analysis show optional <b>laxing</b> for /i/ and /y/ and corroborate the finding that high vowels undergo <b>laxing</b> in word-final closed syllables, regardless of consonant type. Data for /u/ show that the results vary widely by speaker, with the dominant pattern (shown by two out of three speakers) that of lowering and backing in the vowel space of closed syllable tokens. Duration data prove inconclusive, likely due to the effects of stress. The formant data published here constitute the first acoustic description of high vowels for any variety of Louisiana French and lay the groundwork for future study on these endangered varieties...|$|R

Later, Styles held Homicide in a small package pin attempt until Salinas distracted the referee, allowing Guerrero to enter the ring and readjust Styles and Homicide to make the pin in LAX's favor.

Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes {{to be placed in}} the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (<b>LAX).</b> To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward <b>LAX.</b>|$|E
