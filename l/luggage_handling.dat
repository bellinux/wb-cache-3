In 2015, an automatic check-in counter lane was introduced, where people traveling via Korean Air, Asiana Airlines and China Southern Airlines can use. Instead of having airport staff at the counter, there is a machine where travelers input their flight information, scan their passports, receive their flight tickets and lastly, load the luggage onto the conveyor.

40|$|Arabic	Language Airports Security is {{becoming}} an important issue, because of the increasing of air piracy incidents, which use a number of tricks and methods, and this requires actions for safety and fluency of air traffic, {{as well as to}} increase the efficiency of the airport traffic. This book talks about Airport Security. It deals with the reasons of hijacking; it also delivers specific recommendations, orientations and policies about the necessary security procedures to face such incidents. The book points to the declining of hijacking because of the restricted inspections and sorting of suspected people. It also shows three general ideas related to the inspection process before getting on board, first; the cleaned junction which finds a central point for inspection in the beginning of each junction which can serve several gates where X-Ray can be used to inspect the luggage. Second, the boarding area to the cleaned plane, it’s considered as an alternative arrangement when the cleaned junction is not practical, and it’s distinguished by the inspection and sorting are done upon the travelers’ arrival to the exit gate to the plane. Third, the passengers’ sorting at the exit gate to the plane, the traveler who is spotted by the metal detector should go aside for further inspections where every metal object can be removed then go through the metal detector again. In addition to the previous, the book clarifies the security in dealing with <b>luggage,</b> how to <b>handle</b> a bomb threats, emergency plans and training the plane crew to cope with the emergency situations...|$|R
60|$|At Tenway Junction {{there are}} half-a-dozen long platforms, on which {{men and women}} and luggage are crowded. On one of these for a while Ferdinand Lopez walked {{backwards}} and forwards as though waiting for the coming of some especial train. The crowd is ever so great that a man might be supposed to walk there from morning to night without exciting special notice. But the pundits are very clever, and have much experience in men and women. A well-taught pundit, who has exercised authority {{for a year or two}} at such a station as that of Tenway, will know within a minute of the appearance of each stranger what is his purpose there,--whether he be going or has just come, whether he is himself on the way or waiting for others, whether he should be treated with civility or with some curt command,--so that if his purport be honest all necessary assistance may be rendered him. As Lopez was walking up and down, with smiling face and leisurely pace, now reading an advertisement and now watching the contortions of some amazed passenger, a certain pundit asked him his business. He was waiting, he said, for a train from Liverpool, intending, when his friend arrived, to go with him to Dulwich by a train which went round the west of London. It was all feasible, and the pundit told him that the stopping train from Liverpool was due there in six minutes, but that the express from the north would pass first. Lopez thanked the pundit and gave him sixpence,--which made the pundit suspicious. A pundit hopes to be paid when he <b>handles</b> <b>luggage,</b> but has no such expectation when he merely gives information.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a master's thesis that has been made in {{corporation}} between Swedavia AB and Luleå University of Technology. Background and ambition The airport is always in pursuit of smart solutions for automating work types which has work environmental problems and demands a lot of resources. The airport today has a well-developed automated baggage handling system which has limitations regarding dimensions and weight. Luggage that doesn’t fulfill these limitations are considered to be special luggage and needs to be handled separately. This procedure is handled manually by personnel when the luggage is dropped and when sorting. The evaluation of luggage is done subjective by personnel. This evaluation and <b>handling</b> of special <b>luggage</b> is time consuming and demands great number of personnel. The ambition of this master´s thesis is to develop a applicable solution for Terminal 5, Arlanda Airport. This will make the evaluation procedure more objective, less personnel demanding and decrease the number of special luggage. This will lead to a faster and more efficient check-in process. Method and implementation The master´s thesis was devided into six parts, pre-study, analysis, concept generation, detail study, evaluation and presentation. The pre-study was made with empirical and analytic methods on Arlanda airport, but above all on Terminal 5. Thereafter concepts were generated with creative methods. After this the concepts were improved according to different product developing methods. These concepts were evaluated with regards of demands and wishes. The result became elaborate concepts. During this assignment all collected information was documented and analyzed. Results The work has resulted in two groups, validation/luggage drop-off and modification of special luggage. Every concept is unique and aims to reduce queues, make the process more even, increase the speed of the process, reduce personnel, simplify usage for travellers and to reduce the amount of special luggage. The concepts for validation/luggage drop: Alldrop Travellers leaves checked-in normal luggage on a common use rolling hoop with integrated weight and dimension control. Travellers with special luggage use a separate check-in process and are from there directed to the accurate special luggage drop-off. Photo recognition/scanner Checked-in luggage is left for validation and weighting on a hoop which connects to the automated sorting system. The luggage type is validated with photo recognition or a scanner. If the luggage is validated as special it is directed to the accurate special luggage drop. Trusted bag In this concept a validation application is mounted inside the luggage which communicates with the sorting system. This leads to a direct approval or disapproval of the luggage when it is dropped. Special <b>luggage</b> is <b>handled</b> in a separate check-in process. Special luggage station Travellers with special luggage are directed to a nearby station for special luggage. The luggage tags are scanned for registration and will then be directed to the accurate special luggage drop. The concept for modification: Bag with elastic opening Special luggage that falls into the allowed frame of weight and dimensions in the automated sorting system can be modified with a bag containing an elastic opening. This will solve problems with straps and other loose hanging objects that may get stuck in the sorting system. Validerat; 20110222 (anonymous...|$|R
