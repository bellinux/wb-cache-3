50|$|Delaporte {{was born}} in Paris in 1909. In 1929, at age 20, he began painting.

5000|$|The RPC12 {{has been}} {{declined}} into three sub-types: the original version, called [...] "Type A" [...] (comprising Fréhel and Saire), {{was designed as}} a dual-purpose tugboat capable of supporting shipping operations both in harbours and off the coast. After the two first units, the design was simplified, while retaining most functionalities, to reduce cost, yielding the [...] "Type B" [...] (comprising Armen, La Houssaye, Kéréon, Sicié and Taunoa). The nine remaining units constitute the RP12 type, which is further simplified to operate only within harbours (comprising Lardier, Giens, Mengam, Balaguier, Taillat, Nividic, Port Cros, <b>Le</b> <b>Four</b> and Eckmühl).

40|$|While this Saccharomyces cerevisiae SIN 4 {{gene product}} is a {{component}} of a mediator complex associated with RNA polymerase H, various studies suggest the involvement of Sin 4 in the alteration of higher-order chromatin structure. Our previous analysis of a sin 4 mutant suggested that the mechanisms of transcriptional repression by Sin 4 (medi-ator) and the Tupl-Ssn 6 complex (general repressor) are different- To elucidate {{the way in which}} these two repression systems are interrelated, we isolated mutants that exhibit enhanced transcription of a reporter gene harboring the upstream activation sequence (UAS), but still are subject to Tupl-Ssn 6 -mediated repression. Besides sin 4, rgrl, tupl, and ssn 6 mutants, we also obtained new mutants that enhance basal transcription even from a core promoter without UAS. Such mutants, designated rbt for regulator of basal transcription, can be classified into at least six complementation groups, <b>Le.,</b> <b>four</b> single (rbtl to rbt 4) and two apparently double (rbt 5 rbt € and rbt? rbt 8) mutations. The pheno-type of rbt mutants is dependent on the TATA box and not specific to the integration site or kind of core promoter.

40|$|Background: Autoimmune {{encephalitis}} {{associated with}} antibodies against γ-aminobutyric acid B receptor (GABA B R) {{in patients with}} limbic encephalitis (LE) was first described in 2010. We present a series of Han Chinese patients for further clinical refinement. Methods: Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients referred to the program of encephalitis and paraneoplastic syndrome of Peking Union Medical College Hospital were tested with indirect immunofluorescence. Clinical information of patients with anti-GABA B R antibody positivity was retrospectively reviewed, and descriptive statistical analysis was performed. Results: All eighteen anti-GABA B R antibody-positive cases had limbic syndromes, and electroencephalogram (EEG) or neuroimaging evidence fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of <b>LE.</b> <b>Four</b> patients had additional antibodies against Hu in serum and one had anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antibody in both sera and CSF. Seventeen (17 / 18) patients presented with new-onset refractory seizure or status epileptics. Twelve (12 / 18) patients had memory deficits, 11 (11 / 18) patients had personality change, 7 (7 / 18) patients had disturbance of consciousness, and 3 (3 / 18) patients showed cerebellar dysfunction. One patient with LE had progressive motor and sensory polyneuropathy. Lung cancer was detected in 6 (6 / 18) patients. Ten (10 / 18) patients showed abnormality in bilateral or unilateral mediotemporal region on magnetic resonance imaging. Ten (10 / 18) patients had temporal lobe epileptic activity with or without general slowing on EEG. Seventeen patients received immunotherapy and 15 of them showed neurological improvement. Four patients with lung cancer died within 1 - 12 months due to neoplastic complications. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that most Han Chinese patients with anti-GABA B R antibody-associated LE have prominent refractory epilepsy and show neurological improvement on immunotherapy. Patients with underlying lung tumor have a relatively poor prognosis. Testing for anti-GABA B R antibodies is necessary for patients with possible LE or new-onset epilepsy with unknown etiology...|$|E
