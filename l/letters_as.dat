5|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on <b>letters</b> <b>as</b> well as arms. She {{was inspired by the}} example of her father-in-law, King Francis I of France, who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her Medici ancestors. In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late French Renaissance culture in all branches of the arts.|$|E
5|$|Dysarthria is {{the most}} common {{communication}} problem in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), however, significant difficulties with speech and intelligibility are uncommon. Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity and the presence of intention tremor, and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly. Visual impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning systems, large-print text, or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and <b>letters</b> <b>as</b> they are typed.|$|E
5|$|In early 1996, former FBI hostage {{negotiator}} {{and criminal}} profiler Clinton R. Van Zandt was contacted by an investigator working with Bisceglie. Bisceglie asked Van Zandt {{to compare the}} manifesto to typewritten copies of handwritten letters David had received from his brother. Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person had written the <b>letters</b> <b>as</b> well as the manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood that the letters and the manifesto were {{the product of the}} same author. He recommended that Bisceglie's client immediately contact the FBI.|$|E

5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause {{in terms of}} social psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its <b>letters.</b> <b>As</b> early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|Faulkner's Dublin Journal, a {{newspaper}} established in 1725, featured many articles written by Swift or inspired by writings of Swift. Between 1727 and 1730, Faulkner published many works attributed to Swift, but many were actually written by others. After 1730, {{only one of}} those works printed by Faulkner under Swift's name {{turned out to be}} written by someone besides Swift, which suggests to some critics that Swift was working with Faulkner to ensure that only authentic works were printed under Swift's name. He was the first to publish The Answer to the Craftsman, Swift's final defense of the Irish economy from England's policies. Faulkner was also the first to publish the collected Drapier's <b>Letters</b> <b>as</b> Fraud Detected on 2 October 1725. Faulkner also helped edit An Epistle upon an Epistle around December 1729.|$|E
5|$|Georgian scripts {{are unique}} in their {{appearance}} and their exact origin {{has never been}} established; however, in strictly structural terms, their alphabetical order largely corresponds to the Greek alphabet, {{with the exception of}} letters denoting uniquely Georgian sounds, which are grouped at the end. Originally consisting of 38 letters, Georgian is presently written in a 33-letter alphabet, as five letters are currently obsolete in that language. The number of Georgian letters used in other Kartvelian languages varies. The Mingrelian language uses 36, 33 of which are current Georgian letters, one obsolete Georgian letter, and two additional letters specific to Mingrelian and Svan. That same obsolete letter, plus a letter borrowed from Greek (making 35 letters total), are used in writing the Laz language. The fourth Kartvelian language, Svan, is not commonly written, but when it is, it uses Georgian <b>letters</b> <b>as</b> utilized in Mingrelian, with an additional obsolete Georgian letter and sometimes supplemented by diacritics for its many vowels.|$|E

The competition was held outdoors on a half-sized court during the special Inside the NBA show prior to the All-Star Saturday Night events. The objective of this competition is to accrue as few of the five <b>letters</b> <b>as</b> possible. A player is given a letter every time they fail to duplicate the shot of another player. Each player was given 24 seconds to make or duplicate the shot (dunking was prohibited). Each player who fails to duplicate five shots was eliminated from the competition. An NBA referee was assigned to rule whether the shot was done properly.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson's herbarium, {{which is}} now held in the Houghton Library at Harvard University, was {{published}} in 2006 as Emily Dickinson's Herbarium by Harvard University Press. The original work was compiled by Dickinson during her years at Amherst Academy, and consists of 424 pressed specimens of plants arranged on 66 pages of a bound album. A digital facsimile of the herbarium is available online. The town of Amherst Jones Library's Special Collections department has an Emily Dickinson Collection consisting of approximately seven thousand items, including original manuscript poems and letters, family correspondence, scholarly articles and books, newspaper clippings, theses, plays, photographs and contemporary artwork and prints. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College has substantial holdings of Dickinson's manuscripts and <b>letters</b> <b>as</b> well as a lock of Dickinson's hair and the original of the only positively identified image of the poet. In 1965, in recognition of Dickinson's growing stature as a poet, the Homestead was purchased by Amherst College. It {{opened to the public}} for tours, and also served as a faculty residence for many years. The Emily Dickinson Museum was created in 2003 when ownership of the Evergreens, which had been occupied by Dickinson family heirs until 1988, was transferred to the college.|$|E
5|$|In {{connection}} with the dispute over the royal election, Haakon's mother Inga had to prove his parentage through a trial by ordeal in Bergen in 1218. The result of the trial strengthened the legal basis for his kingship, and improved {{his relationship with the}} church. The saga's claim that Haakon already had been generally accepted as king in 1217/18 has however been contested by modern historians such as Sverre Bagge. Skule and Haakon increasingly drifted apart in their administration, and Skule focused mainly on governing Eastern Norway after 1220, which he had gained the right to rule in 1218 as his third of the Norwegian kingdom. From 1221 to 1223, Haakon and Skule separately issued <b>letters</b> <b>as</b> rulers of Norway, and maintained official contacts abroad. In 1223 a great meeting of bishops, clergy, secular nobles and other high-ranking figures from all across the country was held in Bergen to finally decide on Haakon's right to the throne. Other candidates to the throne were present either personally or through attorneys, but Haakon was in the end unanimously confirmed as King of Norway by the court.|$|E

5|$|The list {{of former}} Registrars {{published}} by the university in the 19th century begins with John London, who died in 1508. Records show {{that there were people}} before London carrying out similar tasks in the 15th century, and the university regards the role as having a 550-year history. There is a record of a resolution by the university, of uncertain date in the 15th century, that a registrar or scribe should be appointed to draft letters, record the university's public acts, copy its documents, and record the names of graduates. The position carried an annual salary of four marks (£2 13 shillings and 4 pence); fees had to be paid to the Registrar by individuals obtaining their degrees or recording other permissions granted by the university. In 1448, a John Manyngham signed a letter for the university, and was permitted in 1451 to have a scholar make transcripts in the university's library; one historian of the university says that Manyngham may have been Oxford's first Registrar. John Farley, who signed his name in Greek <b>letters</b> <b>as</b> a sign of his erudition, carried out the duties from 1458 to 1464.|$|E
5|$|The old king's estrangement {{from his}} three daughters {{from his first}} {{marriage}} (Princesses Louise, Stéphanie, and Clémentine) spurred Leopold to keep or give as much wealth away as possible in order to disinherit the girls. An Austrian newspaper claimed that right before he died, Leopold personally gave Caroline his large collection of personal <b>letters</b> <b>as</b> well as documents detailing information about various European royal figures, which greatly worried his eldest daughter. After his death, the three princesses sued his estate for several million francs, although this was only a very small portion compared with the fortune he accumulated. The fortune was so large that the princesses were still attempting to recover some of Caroline's wealth four years after their father's death, claiming that Caroline and Durrieux had speedily ransacked one of Leopold's properties in Paris and seized important financial documents before the Belgian envoy to France appeared. A trust of $10,000,000 the king had placed in Caroline and their two sons' names became a target of the princesses; they and the Belgian government argued that the trust formed part of Leopold's private estate, and thus all three girls and the government had a right to their share, as its funds had derived from the Congo Free State. The Belgian government's lawsuit succeeded, allowing them to collect the entire trust, but it also diminished the share the princesses received (as each collected a comparatively meager $1,000,000). Belgian statesman Emile Vandervelde later charged in an open letter that Leopold had given Caroline $6,000,000 worth of Congo bonds which had been found to be previously missing when Belgium annexed the colony.|$|E
5|$|The vacancy {{may also}} have {{occurred}} because Wilfrid, who {{was at that point}} having problems in Northumbria, desired to become Archbishop of Canterbury. A contemporary biographer of Wilfrid, Stephen of Ripon, says that Theodore had wished for Wilfrid to succeed Theodore at Canterbury. Æthelred of Mercia may have supported Wilfrid's translation to Canterbury also, but despite these desires, the translation did not happen. Berhtwald was consecrated on 29 June 693, having travelled to France for his consecration as archbishop of Canterbury by Godwin, Archbishop of Lyon. Berhtwald went to the continent for consecration probably because he feared that his election was not supported by all of the kings and bishops. After his consecration, Berhtwald travelled to Rome to obtain the support of Pope Sergius I, who wrote to a number of Anglo-Saxon kings and bishops in support of the archbishop. Two of these letters survive, and their authenticity has been doubted, mainly because they are only preserved as part of the post-Norman Conquest Canterbury-York dispute. Historians have since come to regard the two <b>letters</b> <b>as</b> genuine. Sergius also gave Berhtwald a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority.|$|E

25|$|The most {{frequent}} disagreement {{of the letter}} reversals has been over the Haha–Hung pair.
