5|$|The Red River Trails {{are less}} well known today than many other pioneer trails and trade routes in North America, and do not occupy as large a place in {{folklore}} as the great western trails in the United States and the fur-trading canoe routes of Canada. They were neither fought over nor the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> battles (with {{the exception of the}} Dakota War of 1862), and although hazardous at times, other trails presented greater dangers. It may be that this relative lack of attention {{is due to the fact}} they did not lead to annexation of any territory to either of the nations in which the trails were located.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a gene {{continues}} to be refined as new phenomena are discovered. For example, regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions, and coding regions can be split into several exons. Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs. Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of a gene is any discrete <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> heritable, genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression.|$|E
5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership {{as to the}} best method by which Hanoi (the perceived <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> the insurgency) could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie {{in the application of}} air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern insurgency. The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the military men were more concerned with breaking its will.|$|E

5|$|The decades {{running up}} to 1381 were a rebellious, troubled period. London was a {{particular}} <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> unrest, and {{the activities of the}} city's politically active guilds and fraternities often alarmed the authorities. Londoners resented the expansion of the royal legal system in the capital, in particular the increased role of the Marshalsea Court in Southwark, which had begun to compete with the city authorities for judicial power in London. The city's population also resented the presence of foreigners, Flemish weavers in particular. Londoners detested John of Gaunt because he was a supporter of the religious reformer John Wycliffe, whom the London public regarded as a heretic. John of Gaunt was also engaged in a feud with the London elite and was rumoured to be planning to replace the elected mayor with a captain, appointed by the Crown. The London elite were themselves fighting out a vicious, internal battle for political power. As a result, in 1381 the ruling classes in London were unstable and divided.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the draft}} order had been issued, the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> the process {{moved from the}} Potteries to London with the Local Government Provisional Order (No. 3) Bill {{introduced}} in the House of Commons in July 1908 by the Select Committee on Private bills chaired by Sir George White. The bill received its third reading on 31 July 1908 but had undergone significant amendment during its passage through the House of Commons, most notably in {{the introduction of a}} complex, differential rating system for a period of 10 years. Few of the interested parties were pleased with the proposal and, although the differential system was welcomed, a period of 20 years was preferred with the complicated valuation required of all public assets proving unpopular. As a result, Tunstall withdrew its support for the order leaving only Hanley and Longton to promote the bill in the House of Lords. Neither council was particularly in favour of the financial settlement but felt honour bound to promote the bill, having been the initial instigators of the scheme. Petitions objecting to the bill were submitted to the House of Lords by Staffordshire County Council, Burslem, Fenton, Stoke, and Tunstall councils, the Longton Justices, the North Staffordshire Railway Company, and individual Tunstall ratepayers.|$|E

25|$|Various scales {{have been}} {{developed}} to assess both attributional style and <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control. <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> control scales include those used by Rotter and later by Duttweiler, the Nowicki and Strickland (1973) <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> Control Scale for Children and various <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control scales specifically in the health domain, most famously that of Kenneth Wallston and his colleagues, The Multidimensional Health <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> Control Scale.

25|$|Work <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control {{can also}} be a {{contributing}} influence. An individual with an internal <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control orientation believes that they have control over their destiny. They feel the only way to bring about a desired outcome is to act. Individuals who see their lives as being controlled by outside forces demonstrate an external <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control (Robbins, 2005). Kassing's (2001) study demonstrated that employees with an internal <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control used articulated dissent whereas an employee with an external <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control preferred to use latent dissent.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the scales}} {{reviewed}} by Furnham and Steele (1993) relate to health in more specific domains, such as obesity (for example, Saltzer's (1982) Weight <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> Control Scale or Stotland and Zuroff's (1990) Dieting Beliefs Scale), mental health (such as Wood and Letak's (1982) Mental Health <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> Control Scale or the Depression <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> Control Scale of Whiteman, Desmond and Price, 1987) and cancer (the Cancer <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> Control Scale of Pruyn et al., 1988). In discussing applications of the concept to health psychology Furnham and Steele refer to Claire Bradley's work, linking <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control to the management of diabetes mellitus. Empirical data on health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control {{in a number of}} fields was reviewed by Norman and Bennett in 1995; they note that data on whether certain health-related behaviors are related to internal health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control have been ambiguous. They note that some studies found that internal health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control is linked with increased exercise, but cite other studies which found a weak (or no) relationship between exercise behaviors (such as jogging) and internal health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control. A similar ambiguity is noted for data on the relationship between internal health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control and other health-related behaviors (such as breast self-examination, weight control and preventative-health behavior). Of particular interest are the data cited on the relationship between internal health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control and alcohol consumption.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} tropical dual {{numbers as}} an extension of tropical semiring. By this innovation, one can work with honest ideals, instead of congruences, and recover the Euclidean topology on affine tropical spaces similar to Zariski's approach in classical algebraic geometry. The bend <b>loci</b> <b>of</b> an ideal over tropical dual numbers coincides with the bend <b>loci</b> <b>of</b> a congruence over tropical semiring and this enables tropical dual numbers to serve as an algebraic structure for tropical geometry.

25|$|They {{also argue}} that health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control is better at {{predicting}} health-related behavior if studied in conjunction with health value (the value people attach to their health), suggesting that health value is an important moderator variable in the health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control relationship. For example, Weiss and Larsen (1990) found an increased relationship between internal health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control and health when health value was assessed. Despite the importance Norman and Bennett attach to specific measures of <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control, there are general textbooks on personality which cite studies linking internal <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control with improved physical health, mental health {{and quality of life}} in people with diverse conditions: HIV, migraines, diabetes, kidney disease and epilepsy.|$|E

Careful distinctions should also be made between <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control (a concept linked with expectancies about the future) and attributional style (a concept linked with explanations for past outcomes), or between <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control and concepts such as self-efficacy.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of whether people from different cultures vary in <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control has long been of interest to social psychologists. Japanese {{people tend to be}} more external in locus-of-control orientation than people in the U.S.; however, differences in <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control between different countries within Europe (and between the U.S. and Europe) tend to be small. As Berry et al. pointed out in 1992, ethnic groups within the United States have been compared on <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control; African Americans in the U.S. are more external than whites when socioeconomic status is controlled. Berry et al. also pointed out in 1992 how research on other ethnic minorities in the U.S. (such as Hispanics) has been ambiguous. More on cross-cultural variations in <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control can be found in Shiraev and Levy (2004). Research in this area indicates that <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control has been a useful concept for researchers in cross-cultural psychology.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} section showed how self-efficacy {{can be related}} to a person's <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control, and stress also has a relationship in these areas. Self-efficacy can be something that people use to deal with the stress that they are faced with in their everyday lives. Some findings suggest that higher levels of external <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control combined with lower levels self-efficacy are related to higher illness-related psychological distress. In the {{previous section}}, the different types of <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control, internal and external, were mentioned. Based on the definition of people who have an external <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control, we can see that this can be associated with higher levels of stress. A study conducted by Bollini and others reveals that individuals who have a high external <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control tend to have higher levels of psychological and physical problems. These people are also more vulnerable to external influences and as a result they become more responsive to stress.|$|E
