Unlike human beings, a password manager program can also incorporate an automated login script that first compares the current site's URL to the stored site's URL.

40|$|Abstract. Secure login methods {{based on}} human {{cognitive}} {{skills can be}} classified into two categories based on information available to a passive attacker: (i) the attacker fully observes the entire input and output of a <b>login</b> <b>procedure,</b> (ii) the attacker only partially observes the input and output. Login methods secure in the fully observable model imply very long secrets and/or complex calculations. In this paper, we study three simple PIN-entry methods designed for the partially observable attacker model. A notable feature of the first method is that the user needs to perform a very simple mathematical operation, whereas, {{in the other two}} methods, the user performs a simple table lookup. Our usability study shows that all the methods have reasonably low login times and minimal error rates. These results, coupled with low-cost hardware requirements (only earphones), are a significant improvement over existing approaches for this model [9, 10]. We also show that side-channel timing attacks present a real threat to the security of login schemes based on human cognitive skills. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We propose active cookies as a {{tool for}} {{stronger}} user/client authentication on the Web. An ordinary cookie is automatically released to any server associated with a particular domain name. It is therefore vulnerable to capture by pharming, that is, spoofing of domain names. An active cookie, by contrast, resists such pharming attacks. Active cookies rely on a new protocol we propose that channels client communications to a specific, valid IP address. This protocol exploits a combination of cookie-based (or cached-object-based) authentication with a new type of IP-tracing protocol. This IP-tracing protocol helps defend against the presence of an attacker in the loop during an authentication session, but is unaffected by IP-address changes in clients between sessions. Active cookies are fully transparent to users. They require no explicit installation or behavioral changes from users, and thus avoid the security risks and deployment complications of plug-ins, new <b>login</b> <b>procedures,</b> and standalone applications. While active cookies have functional and security limitations, we believe that they are an attractive countermeasure to a range of phishing and pharming attacks and a useful complement to existing techniques for user authentication.

Registering and unregistering users both from within the organization and also from partner organizations, as well as managing their privileges and providing support all accumu-lates significant costs for the user management. FIdM is a solution that can centralize user management, allow partner organizations to feder-ate, ease users’ password management, provide SSO functionality and externalize the authentication logic from application development. An FIdM system with two organizations, AD FS and two applications have been deployed. The applications are constructed in. NET, with WIF, and in Java using a custom implementation of WS-Federation. In order to evaluate the system, a functional test and a security analysis have been performed. The result of the functional test shows that the system has been implemented successfully. With the use of AD FS, users from both organizations are able to authenticate within their own organization and are then able to access the applications in the organizations without any repeated authentication. The result of the security analysis shows that the overall security in the system is good. The use of AD FS does not allow anyone to bypass authentication. However, the standard integra-tion of WIF in the. NET application makes it more susceptible to a DoS attack.

40|$|Abstract. Single Sign-On (SSO) systems simplify <b>login</b> <b>procedures</b> {{by using}} an an Identity Provider (IdP) to issue {{authentication}} tokens which can be consumed by Service Providers (SPs). Traditionally, IdPs are modeled as trusted third parties. This is reasonable for SSO systems like Kerberos, MS Passport and SAML, where each SP explicitely specifies which IdP he trusts. However, in open systems like OpenID and OpenID Connect, each user may set up his own IdP, and a discovery phase {{is added to the}} protocol flow. Thus it is easy for an attacker to set up its own IdP. In this paper we use a novel approach for analyzing SSO authentication schemes by introducing a malicious IdP. With this approach we evaluate {{one of the most popular}} and widely deployed SSO protocols – OpenID. We found four novel attack classes on OpenID, which were not covered by previous research, and show their applicability to real-life implemen-tations. As a result, we were able to compromise 11 out of 16 existing OpenID implementations like Sourceforge, Drupal and ownCloud. We automated discovery of these attacks in a open source tool OpenID Attacker, which additionally allows fine-granular testing of all parameters in OpenID implementations. Our research helps to better understand the message flow in the OpenID protocol, trust assumptions in the different components of the system, and implementation issues in OpenID components. It is applicable to other SSO systems like OpenID Connect and SAML. All OpenID im-plementations have been informed about their vulnerabilities and we supported them in fixing the issues. ...|$|R

More and more people study academic subjects in parallel of having part-time or even full-time jobs. One {{of the most important}} challenges of e-learning solutions is to reproduce the features of a higher education institution’s campus as completely as possible to students who attend online courses. While there is a large market of e-learning tools, the majority of them come with a lecturer-oriented and material-based view only. When using single tools, a lot of aspects are not covered, for example the interaction between learners is often not paid enough attention to. In literature {{it has been shown that}} the social interaction of students on a classical university or college campus has a very positive effect on learning. To enable social interaction for online students, typically a conglomerate of software tools has to be provided: Classical e-learning tools to distribute content, tools for video conferencing and tools for social networking. While offering just a selection of tools in parallel might be able to cover the requirements formally, it often introduces unnecessary complexity. Several <b>login</b> <b>procedures,</b> different user interfaces and time-consuming ways of organizing data storage can render tools very unattractive.
