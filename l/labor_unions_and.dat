5|$|By 14November, {{the concept}} had been {{approved}} by the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. Following the announcement, Wam stated that NSB would continue to operate the service, and use the Timetoget concept. An internal document the newspaper Varden received access to showed that NSB needed to calm down the heated discussions with the <b>labor</b> <b>unions,</b> <b>and</b> that their negativity to Timetoget was a tactical move to satisfy the labor unions. Minister of Transport, Terje Moe Gustavsen from the Labour Party, stated in a meeting with two parliamentarians from Telemark, that he would allow a new private company, without NSB ownership, to operate the line.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Gompers of the AFL {{recognized}} that the strike was damaging the cause of labor {{in the public mind}} and advised the strikers to return to work. Commissioner Curtis refused to re-hire the striking policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. The strike proved a setback for <b>labor</b> <b>unions,</b> <b>and</b> the AFL discontinued its attempts to organize police officers for another two decades. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for vice-president of the U.S. in the 1920 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|The {{tone of the}} Seattle {{campaign}} against Initiative Thirteen was different from those in Miami and St. Paul; it focused consistently on privacy and civil rights. Instead of educating the public about different subcultures in the gay community, they printed effective posters showing an eye peeping through a keyhole and a family living in a fishbowl. High-profile liberal figures, <b>labor</b> <b>unions,</b> <b>and</b> other large organizations including the Church Council of Greater Seattle opposed Initiative Thirteen. David Estes {{did not have the}} enthusiasm and momentum modeled by Bryant and other communities though his campaign used many of their tactics. On election day, Initiative Thirteen was rejected by 63%.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Marshall {{declined}} his party's {{nomination to}} run for Congress. He did hint to state party leaders {{that he would be}} interested in running for Indiana governor in the 1908 election. He soon gained the support of several key <b>labor</b> <b>unions,</b> <b>and</b> was endorsed by Louis Ludlow, a reporter for the Indianapolis Star. Despite this support, Marshall was a dark horse candidate at the state convention. Initially, Thomas Taggart, Indiana Democratic Party boss, did not support him because of Marshall's support of prohibition. Taggart wanted the party to nominate anti-prohibitionist Samuel Ralston, but the prohibitionist and anti-Taggart factions united with Marshall's supporters. Taggart swung Ralston's delegates in support of Marshall to oppose L. Ert Slack, a temperance candidate, giving Marshall the votes he needed to win the nomination.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Bedell {{put forward}} an {{agricultural}} plan {{that he thought}} would increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by <b>labor</b> <b>unions</b> <b>and</b> certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then {{be used to determine}} what types of production controls to enact. The purpose of this plan was twofold: production controls would decrease the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit farmers, who {{were in the middle of}} an acute debt crisis.) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Majority Leader Gary Hooser's {{statement that he}} intended to bring the bill to a vote before the full Senate, the Hawaii Family Forum stated other issues demanded more attention than civil unions and the bill would create legal challenges for child care and education. The group held demonstrations on Maui and Kauai and stated their intention to hold demonstrations to ask the governor to veto the legislation should the bill advance. Hooser argued for the bill using President Barack Obama's support of civil unions and the support of <b>labor</b> <b>unions</b> <b>and</b> the majority of Hawaii House representatives. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators the bill could lead to a lawsuit to legalize same-sex marriage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii and Supreme Court of Hawaii judge Steven H. Levinson told the legislature that a lawsuit would have little chance of success.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{period that}} {{came to be known as}} the McCarthy era began well before Joseph McCarthy's own involvement in it. Many factors contributed to McCarthyism, some of them extending back to the years of the First Red Scare (1917–20), inspired by Communism's emergence as a recognized political force. Thanks in part to its success in organizing <b>labor</b> <b>unions</b> <b>and</b> its early opposition to fascism, the Communist Party of the United States increased its membership through the 1930s, reaching a peak of about 75,000 members in 1940–41. While the United States was engaged in World War II and allied with the Soviet Union, the issue of anti-communism was largely muted. With the end of World War II, the Cold War began almost immediately, as the Soviet Union installed Communist puppet régimes across Central and Eastern Europe, while the United States backed anti-communist forces in Greece and China.|$|E
5|$|Daniels {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run in Indiana's 2004 gubernatorial election after leaving the Bush administration. He won the Republican primary with 67% of the vote, and defeated Democratic incumbent Governor Joe Kernan in the general election. Daniels was reelected to a second term, defeating former U.S. Representative and US Department of Agriculture undersecretary Jill Long Thompson, on November 4, 2008. During his tenure as governor, Daniels cut the state government workforce by 18%, cut and capped state property taxes, and balanced the state budget through budget austerity measures and increasing spending by less than the inflation rate. In his second term, Daniels saw protest by <b>labor</b> <b>unions</b> <b>and</b> Democrats {{in the state legislature}} over his policies regarding Indiana's school voucher program and the Indiana House of Representatives attempt to pass right to work legislation, leading to the 2011 Indiana legislative walkouts. During the legislature's last session under Daniels, he signed the right-to-work law; with Indiana becoming the 23rd state in the nation to do so.|$|E

5|$|After {{both the}} British Industrial Syndicalist Education League (ISEL), a {{short-lived}} syndicalist organization {{heavily involved in}} the strike wave in Britain from 1910, and the Dutch syndicalist union National Labor Secretariat (NAS) published proposals for an international syndicalist congress in 1913, the FVdG {{was the first to}} express support. There were difficulties in organizing the congress, and the largest syndicalist union worldwide— the CGT— refused to participate because it was already affiliated with the social democratic International Federation of Trade Unions. Despite these challenges, the First International Syndicalist Congress took place at Holborn Town Hall in London from September 27 to October 2. British, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Belgian, French, Spanish, Italian, Cuban, Brazilian, and Argentine organizations—both <b>labor</b> <b>unions</b> <b>and</b> political groups— had delegates in London in addition to the FVdG, which was represented by Karl Roche, Carl Windhoff, and Fritz Kater. There were also links with Norwegian, Polish, and American groups. Kater was elected co-president of the congress alongside Jack Wills. After Wills was forced to resign, Kater served as co-president with Jack Tanner. The congress had difficulty agreeing on many issues, the main source of conflict being whether further schisms in the European labor movement (as had occurred in Germany and the Netherlands) should be risked. The FVdG generally agreed with their Dutch comrades in calling on other unions to decide between syndicalism and socialism, while their Italian, French, and Spanish counterparts, most notably Alceste De Ambris of the Italian USI, were more intent on preventing further division. Accordingly, the congress was divided {{on the question of whether}} its purpose was to simply pave the way for deeper relations between the syndicalist unions or whether a Syndicalist International was to be founded. The opponents of a new organization prevailed, but the congress agreed to establish an Information Bureau. The Information Bureau was based in Amsterdam and published the Bulletin international du mouvement syndicaliste. The congress was considered a success by most who attended, with the notable exception of De Ambris. A second congress was scheduled to take place in two years' time in Amsterdam. Due to the outbreak of World War I, the congress did not take place. The Bulletin only published for eighteen issues before the war caused it to cease publication.|$|E
