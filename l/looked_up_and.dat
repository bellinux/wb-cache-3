He {{followed}} it and as he followed it with his eyes he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> there was the stern of a purse seiner with a bunch of crewmen with binoculars looking at him.|$|E
25|$|Because the Israelites saw no shape when God {{spoke to}} {{them out of the}} fire at Horeb, Moses warned them not to make for {{themselves}} a sculptured image in any likeness whatever — the form of a man, woman, beast, bird, creeping thing, or fish. And when they <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> saw the sun, moon, stars, and heaven, they were not to be lured into bowing down to them or serving them, for God allotted those things to other peoples, but God took the Israelites and brought them out of Egypt to be God's very own people.|$|E
25|$|Not long afterward, {{during the}} heat of the day, Abraham had been sitting at the {{entrance}} of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre. He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> saw three men in the presence of God. Then he ran and bowed to the ground to welcome them. Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate.|$|E

25|$|During {{one of the}} National Air Tours, Schneider {{had taken}} off in his Cessna with the Warner Scarab engine, from Chicago bound for the balloon races in Cleveland. He saw the crowd scatter below, <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> saw the 40-foot left wing of a twenty {{passenger}} Burnelli transport plane directly over him. Passengers in the Burnelli scrambled {{to the other side}} of the cabin to tilt the wing back up. Schneider sent his plane diving just as the Burnelli's wing scraped his plane's wing. A crash was averted by his dip. The officials said his quick action in dipping his plane close to the ground and then pulling clear of the grandstand had probably averted the most serious accident in the races.|$|E
500|$|Hearing {{that his}} friend and former minor league {{teammate}} Greg Montalbano had died of testicular cancer {{at the age of}} 31 late on August 21, Youkilis dedicated his next game to his friend's memory. After inscribing [...] "GM" [...] in marker on his cap, he hit two home runs in the game against the Yankees, while driving in six runs. Both times as he crossed home plate, he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> pointed to the sky. [...] "That was for him", Youkilis said. [...] "There are some crazy things that have happened in my life. You ... feel like there's somebody out there somewhere pushing balls out for you, and doing great things." ...|$|E

Fox added, {{regarding}} {{the beginning of their}} relationship, [...] "It was a relationship that came out of nowhere, but the writers and the audience were so charmed by Nancy and Darren together that it's kept going". When asked if they were surprised at being initially paired up Dawson said, [...] "Yes, i was. The scene in which they got together was absolutely hilarious. Darren just <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> there she was!" [...] before Fox added [...] "I never {{thought they were going to}} last, but we just went for it full throttle". Fox later explained that the pairing [...] "was only ever intended to be quite a short-term thing".|$|E
50|$|Vervet monkeys are {{the typical}} example of both animal alarm calls and of {{semantic}} capacity in non-human animals. They have three distinct calls for leopards, snakes, and eagles, and {{research shows that}} each call elicits different responses. When vervets {{are on the ground}} they respond to the eagle alarm call by <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> running to cover, to leopard alarm calls primarily by <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> running into a tree, and to the snake alarm call primarily by looking down. When in trees vervets responded to the eagle alarm call by <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down and running out of trees, to the leopard alarm call by running higher in the tree <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> both <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, and to the snake alarm call by looking primarily down.|$|R

500|$|Chelsea {{survived the}} pressure, as Tevez failed {{to connect with}} a low cross from Rooney, and {{equalised}} {{in the final minute}} of the first half. The goal followed from a long-range shot by Michael Essien, which deflected first off Nemanja Vidić and then Ferdinand. The ball's change in direction caused Van der Sar to lose his footing, leaving Lampard, who had made a run from deep, with a simple finish. In celebration, Lampard <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> pointed to the sky with both hands in memory of his mother, Pat, who had died a month earlier. At {{the end of the first}} half, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson confronted match referee Ľuboš Micheľ, [...] "jabbing out an angry finger and spitting out a few choice words".|$|E
500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. [...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him as hard as I could. [...] Imagine my surprise when he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> said, 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon. [...] Every time I looked at the little fellow, I had to break out laughing".|$|E
500|$|In September 1833, after {{traveling}} to the French village of Besançon to find cheap paper for a publishing enterprise, Balzac crossed into Switzerland and registered at the Hôtel du Faucon under the name Marquis d'Entragues. He sent word to Hańska that he would visit the garden of the Maison Andrié, {{where she and her}} family were staying. He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> saw her face at the window, then– as he described it later– he [...] "lost all bodily sensation". They met later that day (September 25) at a spot overlooking Lake Neuchâtel; according to legend, he noticed a woman reading one of his books. He was overwhelmed with her beauty, and she wrote soon afterwards to her brother, describing Balzac as [...] "cheerful and lovable just like you".|$|E

500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] {{was used}} as an {{introduction}} to Lopez's performance at the American Music Awards on November 20, 2011. She wore a golden gown, with the words: [...] "Love... It's a journey and I still have questions" [...] appearing in a screen behind her. Lopez began to break down, appearing as though she was about to cry. She then paused, <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> shed most of her clothes for a performance of [...] "Papi". Critics noted the [...] "fake breakdown" [...] to be poking fun at her breakdown during her performance of the song at the Mohegan Sun casino a month earlier.

500|$|Tenar {{begins to}} {{question}} her beliefs {{when she hears}} Kossil defying the Nameless Ones, and sees {{that they do not}} punish her. She has a conversation with Penthe, her only friend, who expresses an [...] "unfaith" [...] in the divinity of the God-king. Though Tenar reacts to this with shock, the incident opens a new perspective to her. In her own thoughts, [...] "she felt as if she had <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> suddenly seen a whole new planet hanging huge and populous right outside the window, an entirely strange world, one in which the gods did not matter." [...] Ged acts as a catalyst for this stream of thought, because he is completely alien to her; he is male, brown-skinned, and has a picture of the world is so different from Tenar's own. After speaking to him, she begins to wonder whether the Nameless Ones, despite their power, deserve her worship, and begins to lose faith in them and in all the things she has been taught. She expects to find only evil in Ged, according to what she has been taught; but instead she finds light and love, further challenging her belief.|$|E
500|$|On 3 January 1927, {{following}} a venture out to Gunnamatta Bay, Gibbs was piloting a launch {{back into the}} Grays Point area of Port Hacking when a scream rang out. Gibbs <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> noticed 15-year-old Mervyn Allum struggling in the water about [...] from the shore. Subsequent reports indicate that the other bathers first thought that Allum, who {{was known to be}} a good swimmer, was drowning. Gibbs, however, quickly realised that the youth's leg had been grabbed by a shark. Gibbs immediately dived into the water and swam towards the scene to render Allum assistance, as the latter struggled to fend off the shark. By now the water was red with blood. As Gibbs grabbed for Allum, the teenager was pulled under water. Gibbs had to strike at the shark with his legs and fists and grasp its dorsal fin before the shark would release its grip. While Gibbs' friend, Donald Campbell, rowed a boat towards the pair, Gibbs maintained a hold on the now unconscious Allum, trod water, and splashed to discourage further attacks. The shark continued to circle below during this time, at one point brushing past Gibbs' feet. As Campbell drew near, he and Gibbs managed to lift Allum aboard before Gibbs pulled himself clear of the water. Gibbs later reported that the flesh had been stripped from the ankle to the thigh on one of Allum's legs, and there was evidence of teeth and bite marks to Allum's hands and stomach; Allum was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.|$|E

500|$|During 2007 spring practice, Scott {{was third}} on the depth chart, but {{suffered}} a left knee injury, which forced him to miss most of camp. During the 2007 season, he played in nine games as a reserve tailback behind Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore and as a kickoff returner. Despite the team's abundance of running backs, Friedgen wanted to utilize Scott in some capacity because of his speed, which had been recorded at 4.25seconds in the 40-yard dash. Maryland wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said, [...] "On paper it says I'm faster, but Da'Rel, he's just {{a different type of}} animal." [...] Against Wake Forest, he saw his first action when he returned four kickoffs for 101yards. Scott's special teams performance in that game sufficiently impressed head coach Friedgen that he said, [...] "I think I've got to try to get him involved within the offense. I think he's a guy that can make some plays for us." [...] The following week, unranked Maryland upset 10th-ranked Rutgers, and Scott made his first career appearance as a tailback. He had three carries for 29yards. After sitting out the Georgia Tech game because of an ankle injury, he returned four kicks for 68yards against Virginia, three for 56yards against Clemson, and two for 40yards against North Carolina. Against eighth-ranked Boston College, Scott caught a short screen pass from quarterback Chris Turner and ran 57yards for a touchdown. It was his first career reception and first career touchdown. It was one of just two offensive plays for Scott in that game, and incidentally, he was not intended to be in it. Friedgen said:"When he was in the game, I didn't even know he was in the game. I called a screen pass. I <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> it was Da'Rel in there. I figured we were just giving Lance a rest, but I asked [...] Zacharias about it Sunday and he started laughing. I said 'Did you put Da'Rel in for that screen pass?' He said, 'Lance's equipment was broken, so he had to go in the game.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{failed to}} throw a {{touchdown}} pass in any of their first five games, three of which were shutout losses. Offensive coordinator John Rauch walked out on the team during the week 5 game against Cincinnati, and gave 'personal differences' {{as the reason for}} his resignation. His duties were taken over by McKay, who pointed to the increased effectiveness of the team’s “simpler” offense, saying that they were no longer “trying to do all the things people said you have to do in this league”. On a strange NFL weekend in which O.J. Simpson was ejected from a game for fighting, the Chicago Bears lost a game due to a referee’s inadvertent whistle, and Minnesota Vikings receiver Sammy White fumbled away a touchdown due to starting his celebration before entering the end zone, McKay launched an obscenity-filled tirade against Denver Broncos coach John Ralston after a blowout loss. McKay admitted that his feelings dated back to their college rivalry, when McKay coached at USC and Ralston coached at Stanford University, but pointed to specific plays such as a reverse and a last-minute punt return as evidence that Ralston was trying to run up the score. Third-string running back Manfred Moore caught a lucky break when, waived after the week 13 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was picked up by the Oakland Raiders as an injury replacement for ex-Buccaneer Rick Jennings. He wound up going from an 0–13 team to the eventual Super Bowl champion. Players began to meet for postgame parties at Steve Spurrier’s house, in order to avoid having to show their faces in public. According to defensive end Pat Toomay, “By the time we got to the last game of the season, we had so many injuries that we didn’t feel we had much of a chance. Everybody was so sick of the season that they showed up packed and ready to get out of town. It looked like a bunch of Okies fleeing the dust bowl." [...] McKay said that the week 4 game against the Baltimore Colts summed up the season: “On one play I <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> one of our guys was getting kicked out of the game, and two more were getting carried off”.|$|E
