5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage {{and puts it on}} her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E

500|$|David Sims, also {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, {{called it a}} fitting end to the season, [...] "leaving {{absolutely}} everyone salivating for season two." [...] Writing for the Star-Ledger, Jenifer Braun praised the episode for its set dressing ("I have to say, it’s a pleasure just to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> shiny stuff the HBO set dressers came up with for Tywin Lannister's tent") and {{the authenticity of the}} baby dragons ("And wow, HBO, seamless special effects here. Baby Dragon looks every bit as real as the series’ dogs"). HitFix said it [...] "Wrapped up its terrific first season...it was damned entertaining along the way--with the finale as possibly the most entertaining so far--and we know that at least one more season is coming. And if the creative team can keep up this level of quality, it's hard to imagine HBO shutting things down anytime soon, even with a budget that only figures to get higher. Dragons aren't cheap, but they're also amazing." ...|$|E

In {{addition}} to Welch and Peyer, Lieutenant General Daniel Darnell, USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Air, Space and Information Operations, and Major General Raaberg testified and answered questions from the Senate committee's members. During the hearing, Welch stated that [...] "the military units responsible for handling the bombs are not properly inspected and, as a result, may not be ready to perform their missions." [...] He added, [...] "If you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> areas and all the ways that we have to store and handle these weapons in order to perform the mission, it just requires, we believe, more resources and more attention than they're getting." [...] Welch's report concluded that the combining of DoD nuclear forces with nonnuclear organizations has led to [...] "markedly reduced levels of leadership whose daily focus is the nuclear enterprise and a general devaluation of the nuclear mission and those who perform the mission." [...] Nevertheless, neither Welch's nor Peyer's reports found any failures with the security of United States nuclear weapons.|$|E
500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost a lot of weight. While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but I always had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved this because it meant she was allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly". The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.|$|E

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Adam Mazmanian from Library Journal recommended Spin Alternative Record Guide to [...] "both public and academic libraries" [...] {{and said that}} while The Rolling Stone Album Guide (1992) also offers complete discographies of artists ranging from Jonathan Richman to Throbbing Gristle, this book's reviews are superior in [...] "length and scope". Mazmanian argued that [...] "this guide fills {{a gap in the}} literature of modern music" [...] at a time when [...] "alternative" [...] has developed a ubiquitous presence in the marketing of popular music. In New York magazine, Kim France called it [...] "a well-edited, unpretentious, and comprehensive <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> crazy stuff the kids are listening to these days". In a less enthusiastic review, Booklist critic Gordon Flagg was impressed by the accuracy of the artist entries {{and the quality of the}} contributors' reviews, but found Weisbard's idea of alternative ill-defined and recommended The Trouser Press Record Guide (1991) as a more comprehensive alternative. Billboard magazine's Beth Renaud was more critical of the book, calling much of the writing biased and the organization unencyclopedic. She said Weisbard's [...] "obligatory" [...] essay is outdated and vague in defining alternative rock and that the contributors [...] "gush" [...] over artists usually covered by Spin, with many relevant artists omitted in place of more perplexing additions.|$|E
500|$|Following the cliffhanger of the first-season finale, Kindler {{worked to}} figure out how to {{conclude}} the story and managed to write the outlines of the first two episodes in two days. He also consulted with the writing team to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> problems on how to conclude the story. [...] "Eulogy" [...] was conceived as an important episode in the lives of the main characters following the aftermath of [...] "End of Nights", as well as dealing with the loss of Ashley. Kindler said of the episode [...] "it's one thing to end on a terrible tragic cliffhanger, it's another in a satisfactory manner lay all things to rest appropriately." [...] In writing the episode Cooper was knowledgeable on [...] "medical jargon," [...] as she once wrote for the medical drama series House. In writing his first script [...] "Hero", McCullough was initially concerned that it would be met by resistance from the producers because of the special effects that would be involved, but was [...] "floored" [...] to find out it was entirely possible because of Anthem Visual Effects. The producers were originally hesitant in including [...] "Hero" [...] as the fourth episode, as it was considered lighter in tone as Magnus was trying to get over Ashley's death from [...] "Eulogy". [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] came early in the development of the season, as Kindler wanted to show an episode about Magnus' work going [...] "horribly wrong," [...] and explore the opportunity to have the heroes warned that their work has consequences. Described as the [...] "darkest, scariest, creepiest episode ever" [...] by Tapping, it also featured scenes Kindler was never comfortable with, and did not want to show again, including the assault of naked women, and child killings.|$|E
500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E

The last one, which had been submitted by 11 people, was picked after Williams brought his 7-year-old daughter Karyn to visit in Orlando. On July 27, 1986, it was announced that the committee chose the Magic to be the new name of the Orlando franchise in the NBA. The name [...] "Magic" [...] alludes to the area's biggest tourist attraction and economic engine Walt Disney World, along with its Magic Kingdom.

2500|$|Moore-Bick {{is seen as}} aloof {{and lacking}} empathy; he {{concerned}} residents by suggesting only the technical causes of the fire would be investigated. Dent Coad said she still had less than “total confidence” in Moore-Bick, but “we {{have to work with}} the system we have, unfortunately.” Sources close to the inquiry suggest Moore-Bick is thinking of proposing an advisory panel. He is also inclined to recommend a two-stage inquiry: the first stage investigating the immediate causes of the fire, the second investigating broader issues over a longer period. Dent Coad said there must be a legal commitment to a second stage. [...] "We need to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> broader issues. One of the concerns about a two part inquiry – like with Hillsborough – is if it’s held off for too long and then it doesn’t happen at all, so that's a concern." [...] Dent Coad wants the first stage to, “look at accountability and recommendations straight away so that the things that have become most obvious throughout the inquiry are put into action straight away." ...|$|E

[...] MD 90 was extended west to US 113, which at the time followed today's MD 575, in 1975. [...] The state highway was completed when the highway opened between US 50 and US 113 in 1976. [...] MD 90's present interchange with US 113 was constructed in 1976. [...] However, the interchange remained unused until US 113 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway from Berlin north past MD 90 in 2000.

2500|$|Romney has not {{put forward}} a clear {{statement}} {{as to whether he}} supports and would have signed, or would have opposed, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require that employers prove that differences in pay are based on qualifications, not gender, and extends the statute of limitations for filing claims of wage discrimination. The legislation was opposed by all but two Republicans in the House of Representatives and five in the Senate; {{and it was the first}} piece of legislation signed into law by President Obama. Asked in an [...] April 2012 interview if he would have signed the bill had it come before him as president, Romney said, [...] "It’s certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing.

The following day, the campaign adviser retracted his statement, saying that he was wrong when he said that Romney had been opposed to the act.|$|E
