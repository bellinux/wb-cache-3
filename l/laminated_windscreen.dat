2500|$|From the {{beginning}} it was realised that some buyers would want a Land Rover's abilities without the spartan interiors. In 1949, Land Rover launched a second body option called the [...] "Station Wagon", fitted with a body built by Tickford, a coachbuilder known for their work with Rolls-Royce and Lagonda. The bodywork was wooden-framed and had seating for seven people. Tickford was well equipped {{in comparison with the}} standard Land Rover, having leather seats, a heater, a one-piece <b>laminated</b> <b>windscreen,</b> a tin-plate spare wheel cover, some interior trim and other options. The wooden construction made them expensive to build. [...] The Tickford was taxed as a private car, which attracted high levels of Purchase Tax unlike the original Land Rover. As a result, fewer than 700 Tickfords were sold, and all but 50 were exported.|$|E
2500|$|The {{handbrake}} is now electronic. Additionally, {{the seats}} {{differ from the}} old style, slightly resembling the new Range Rover Sport with cooling fans optional on the HSE/Vogue and standard on the Supercharged. Heated seats are standard across the board and the premium seats from the BMW era are no longer available. The HVAC system was also updated with more vents and quieter operation. That, along with the acoustic <b>laminated</b> <b>windscreen</b> lower noise. An increase in interior storage is mainly attributed to the new split-dual glovebox. [...] And then in a return to original Range Rover styling, more wood inserts {{have been added to}} the doors and centre console. Midway through production of the 2007 model (around production date of January 2007) the style of the key was changed from the BMW design to Land Rover's current [...] "switchblade" [...] type.|$|E

50|$|The Triplex Safety Glass Company Ltd {{was founded}} by Kent-born Reginald Delpech (30 March 1881 - 29 May 1935) in 1912. The company was {{established}} to build <b>laminated</b> <b>windscreens</b> in Britain, under French patents.|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of the {{legislation}} of periodical vehicle inspection, windscreens are examined to see if they fulfil the specifications. Damage to windscreens can cause a decrease of vision and/or crack. On parking places 840 cars were studied at random for such damage. The number of <b>laminated</b> glass <b>windscreens</b> has increased much over the last few years. In 1976 / 1977 only 13 % of <b>windscreens</b> were of <b>laminated</b> glass. In 1986 the percentage was already 71 %. Only 5 cars had a crack in the windscreen but in none of these cases was there a real visual hindrance. In the strict application of the current interpretation of the specifications of vehicle inspection more windscreens will be condemned than is really necessary. The presence of cracks in <b>laminated</b> <b>windscreens</b> will generally not lead to sudden visual hindrance. The specifications should therefore be modified...|$|R

5000|$|Mazda New Zealand {{initially}} assembled 626 [...] "short nose" [...] 1.8-liter four-door {{sedan and}} a [...] "long nose" [...] 2.0-liter five-door {{model with a}} higher trim level including a digital instrument panel. A small number of two-door coupés were imported built-up from Japan. <b>Laminated</b> <b>windscreens</b> were now standard. A midlife facelift for the 1985 model year brought a completely new dashboard with orange digital LCD electronic displays in top models (in place of the earlier luminescent green) and the sedan now had the long nose and 2.0-liter engine. Ford's Telstar received similar changes.|$|R
40|$|<b>Windscreens</b> from <b>laminated</b> {{safety glass}} (glass/PVB interlayer/glass) {{are widely used}} in {{automotive}} structures and have {{an important contribution to}} the stiffness of the vehicle. The stiffness of the laminated safety glass is dominantly given by the two layers of glass while the PVB interlayer serves to fix glass splinters to avoid serious injuries of the passengers in a collision. A finite element model for modelling the failure behaviour of <b>laminated</b> glass <b>windscreens</b> is presented. A special element structure with three layers (shell/volume/shell) has been used to model the <b>laminated</b> glass <b>windscreen.</b> A fracture criterion for brittle fracture based on the maximum principal stress (I  c) was applied to model the fracture behaviour of glass. The PVB interlayer was modelled with both a linear elastic and a hyperelastic material law without damage. The critical fracture stress of glass was determined by fitting the failure force measured from static bending tests on <b>laminated</b> glass <b>windscreens.</b> The transferability of the fracture criterion and the corresponding parameter was checked by simulating two different loading cases of the component tests...|$|R

40|$|Ocular {{injuries}} {{of sufficient}} severity to necessitate {{admission to the}} Eye and Ear Clinic, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, were sustained by 1707 male patients and 325 female patients. Blunt injury occurred in 1063 eyes (49. 2 %), perforating injury in 1037 (48 %), and intraocular or intraorbital foreign bodies in 181 eyes (8. 4 %). More than three-quarters of the patients (77. 4 %) were less than 36 {{years of age and}} 84 % of all injuries occurred in males. Normal visual acuity (6 / 6 or better) was regained by 41. 2 % of the patients in whom the final visual outcome was known. The benefit of wearing seat belts in road vehicles and protective goggles in industry and sport should receive more publicity on radio and television and via poster campaigns. Compulsory fitting of <b>laminated</b> <b>windscreens</b> in all road vehicles is recommended.

50|$|The N12 was {{assembled}} in New Zealand at Nissan NZ's plant in Wiri South Auckland from 1982, and facelifted in 1984 when the main change was a {{switch to the}} now compulsory <b>laminated</b> <b>windscreen.</b> This generation was offered in both three and five door hatchback form with both 1.3- and 1.5-liter Nissan E-series engines shared with the also locally assembled Sunny sedan (NZ did not import the equivalent Pulsar sedan). The Holden Astra badged variant was not sold in New Zealand. The EXA Coupé was a limited official Nissan import new but thousands more Japanese market specification models arrived in the later 1980s and early 1990s when the NZ market was opened up to used imports.|$|E
5000|$|This {{generation}} was also assembled in New Zealand in three versions - four-speed manual base, three-speed automatic mid range and five-speed manual [...] "Limited". Facelift models were {{much the same}} but some had velour upholstery and tinted glass. In 1982, Mazda NZ offered a locally assembled limited edition model called the Anniversary to mark 10 years of local build. Based on the Limited, this model had larger US-style bumpers, additional driving lights in the grille, a standard AM radio (this was a year before FM stereo radio was introduced in NZ) plus alloy wheels and unique velour upholstery. This {{was also the first}} NZ-built Mazda to have a <b>laminated</b> <b>windscreen</b> as standard.|$|E
50|$|In the Quasar, {{the rider}} sits feet forward or feet first, {{changing}} the usual {{position of the}} rider from on top and straddling the vehicle, to inside and sitting down. Unlike most motorcycles, the Quasar is a cabin motorcycle with a roof which goes over the rider. While normally not a problem, tall riders with larger, more modern helmets may have trouble fitting inside although {{it is also possible}} to carry a passenger with an intimate squeeze. In the front of the bike the <b>laminated</b> glass <b>windscreen</b> had car-style windscreen wipers and a heater. The use of a semi-enclosed 'cockpit' caused blind spots where the driver had to move his head around to make sure visibility was not obscured by the screen supports in corners. There is 60 L of storage space behind the rider and wrap-around panniers were available as a factory option. Ingeniously, they are no wider than the narrow mirrors.|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} how glass-filtered UV irradiances vary with glass thickness, lamination of the glass and the effect of solar zenith angle (SZA), and to measure the glass-filtered UV exposures to different receiving planes with a newly developed UVA dosimeter. Spectroradiometric and dosimetric techniques were employed in the experimental approach. The percentage of the glass-filtered solar UV compared to the unfiltered UV ranged from 59 % to 70 % and was influenced to a small extent by the glass thickness and the SZA. The laminated glass transmitted 11 - 12 % and the windscreen glass transmitted 2. 5 - 2. 6 %. The influence of the SZA was less for the thicker glass than it was for the thinner glass. The change in transmission was less than 14 % for the SZA between 48 ° and 71 °. There was a negligible influence due to the SZA on the glass-transmitted UV of the <b>laminated</b> and <b>windscreen</b> glass. The influence of the glass thickness in the range of 2 - 6 mm on the percentage transmission was less than 16 %.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{three different}} antenna systems for mobile vehicle applications. The antennas are either patches or derivatives in all cases. The {{first is a}} dual-band telephone antenna with a low profile and wide bandwidth. Operating at 900 MHz and 1800 MHz, with a VSWR of better than 1 · 7, it is a hybrid construction combining a monopole with a top-loading patch shorted to the ground-plane. Extra-shorted pins provide the upper frequency band coverage. It provides monopole radiation characteristics and can be hidden under a plastic panel or mounted on the vehicle roof. The second is a microstrip patch antenna integrated into a <b>laminated</b> glass <b>windscreen</b> for a vehicle. It is fed using a coplanar waveguide feed printed on the innermost layer of the glass, avoiding {{the need for a}} contacting feed within the laminate. The patch and ground plane are meshed for manufacturing in the glass to avoid distorting the heat profile when the glass is shaped and laminated. The patch is easily fed from inside the vehicle and is potentially a very low cost design. The final antenna discussed is a dual-band patch antenna specifically designed for the Globalstar satellite telephone system at 1 · 6 GHz and 2 · 45 GHz. It also covers the Iridium band at 1 · 6 GHz. A single circularly polarised patch is used. Dual-band operation results from truncating the corners of the square patch and judiciously placed slots to achieve a band spacing of 1 · 5...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to provide a method to simulate the mechanical behavior of <b>windscreen</b> <b>laminated</b> glass. The polyvinyl butyral (PVB) laminated glass is manufactured by pressing a layer of PVB film in between two pieces of glass plates under the high temperature condition. In this study, windscreen models are developed using different combination of glass and PVB with various connection types and two mesh sizes (5 mm & 10 mm). Then each windscreen model was impacted with standard adult headform under LS-DYNA environment and the results were compared with the experimental data reported in the literature. The results show that the behavior of windscreen developed with double layered shell elements of glass and PVB each with tied element connection simulates best the test results. Furthermore, the influence of fracture stress of glass on the above mentioned windscreen was investigated. It was observed that the area of crack and the peak value of headform acceleration are determined by the critical fracture stress and 50 MPa fracture stress of glass best predicts the headform acceleration level and the cracks of windscreen...|$|R
