HPC Challenge is a suite of tests that examine the performance of HPC architectures using kernels with memory access patterns more challenging {{than those of the}} High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark used in the Top 500 list. Thus, the suite is designed to augment the Top 500 list, providing benchmarks that bound the performance of many real applications as a function of memory access characteristics e. g., spatial and temporal locality, and providing a framework for including additional tests. In particular, the suite is composed of several well known computational kernels (STREAM, HPL, matrix multiply – DGEMM, parallel matrix <b>transpose</b> <b>–</b> PTRANS, FFT, RandomAccess, and bandwidth/latency tests – b eff) that attempt to span high and low spatial and temporal locality space.

40|$|By {{order of}} 29 November 1999 the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) {{referred}} to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC two questions regarding {{the interpretation of the}} "doorstep-selling directive", and the "consumer credit directive", which arose in the course of proceedings involving Mr and Mrs Heininger, who took out from the Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG bank a loan to purchase a flat, secured by a charge on the property (Grundschuld). Five years later they sought to cancel the credit agreement, maintaining that an estate agent had called uninvited at their home and induced them to purchase the flat in question and - at the same time acting on a self-employed basis as agent for the bank - to enter into the loan agreement, without informing them of their right of cancellation. Article 1 para. 1 of the doorstep-selling directive provides that it applies to contracts under which a trader supplies goods or services to a consumer and which are concluded during a visit by a trader to the consumer's home where the visit does not take place at the express request of the consumer'. Article 3 para. 2 a) of that directive provides that the directive shall not apply to contracts for the construction, sale and rental of immovable property or contracts concerning other rights relating to immovable property. Article 4 of the directive provides that traders shall be required to give consumers written notice of their right of cancellation. Article 5 provides that the consumer shall have the right to cancel the contract within seven days from receipt by the consumer of the notice. Article 2 of the consumer credit directive provides that it shall not apply to credit agreements intended primarily for the purpose of acquiring or retaining property rights in land or in an existing or projected building, and that Article 1 a) and Articles 4 to 12 of the directive shall not apply to credit agreements, secured by mortgage on immovable property. The German <b>legislation</b> <b>transposing</b> the doorstep-selling directive (the "HWiG") provides for a right of cancellation by the consumer within a period of one week, if a transaction is entered into away from the trader's business premises. The cooling-off period does not start to run until the customer receives a notice in writing containing information on this right and if that notice is not given, the right of cancellation will not lapse until one month after both parties have performed their obligations under the agreement in full. Section 5 para. 2 of the HwiG provides that where the transaction also falls within the scope of the <b>legislation</b> <b>transposing</b> the consumer credit directive (the "VerbrKrG"), only the provisions of the latter are to apply. Section 3 para. 2 of the VerbrKrG, in setting out the exceptions to the scope of that law, provides that inter alia Section 7 (right of cancellation) shall not apply to credit agreements in which credit is subject to the giving of security by way of a charge on immovable property, and is granted on usual terms for credits secured by a charge on immovable property and the intermediate financing of the same. Given this legal framework {{it is obvious that the}} Heiningers could not cancel the credit agreement according to the VerbrKrG. Although the agreement constitutes a consumer credit under section 1 VerbrKrG, the right of revocation is excluded by section 3 para. 2 VerbrKrG, the exclusion of which is backed by the consumer credit directive. Although the credit agreement was entered into away from the banks business premises, they as well could not cancel it under the HWiG since this law is not applicable to consumer credit agreements. Thus, the claim of the Heiningers was denied by German courts until the Federal Court of Justice raised the question, if the subsidiarity clause in section 5 para. 2 of the HWiG constitutes a contradiction to the provisions of the door step selling directive...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{evaluates the}} pattern {{of change in the}} field of employee representation in the UK as influenced by the transposition and implementation of the Directive 2002 / 14 /EC establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community and to relate this analysis to the impact of legislation in the field of labour law and industrial relations through the location of managerial and labour practice in implementing and handling the information and consultation arrangements. Theoretically, the thesis draws on the theory of reflexive law (Teubner, 1993; Barnard and Deakin, 2002) and on the capabilities approach (Sen, 1999), which has recently emerged in political economy. Empirically, it combines textual analysis, interviews with key actors, a questionnaire survey of companies and in-depth case studies in a few organizations in the business services and the financial sectors. The research aims to move beyond the traditional socio-legal concepts and methods to incorporate insights from the institutional and political economy frames of analysis commonly deployed in the field of industrial relations, and from its tradition of empirical enquiry rooted in field-based qualitative research methods. In diverging from existing UK social norms and conventions a new role for the two sides of industry, CBI and TUC, was created that assisted {{in the development of the}} national <b>legislation</b> <b>transposing</b> the directive and led to a re-conceptualization of the EU-level norms, as stipulated by the directive, concerning information and consultation of employees. Whilst the introduction of national legislation drove to some extent the spread of voluntary arrangements, albeit at the instigation of management, there was not much evidence that the 'standard provisions' of the UK Regulations promoted institutional experimentation or to a new framework for a process of learning, participation and capabilities for voice. This was down to the nature of the legal obligations, the efficacy of the enforcement mechanisms and the degree to which extra-legal resources, mainly trade union organization, were utilized.

The HPC Challenge benchmarks consist of a suite of tests that examine {{the performance of}} HPC architectures using kernels with memory access patterns more challenging than those of the High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark used in the TOP 500 list. The tests include four local (matrix-matrix multiply, STREAM, RandomAccess and FFT) and four global (High Performance Linpack – HPL, parallel matrix <b>transpose</b> <b>–</b> PTRANS, RandomAccess and FFT) kernel benchmarks. The purpose of our experiments is to evaluate the overheads of the different virtual environments and investigate how different aspects of the system are affected by virtualization. We ran the benchmarks on an 8 -core system with Core i 7 processors using Open MPI. We did runs on the bare hardware and in each of the virtual environments for a range of problem sizes. As expected, the HPL results had some overhead in all the virtual environments, with the overhead becoming less significant with larger problem sizes. The RandomAccess results show drastically different behavior and we attempt to explain it with pertinent experiments. We show the cause of variability of performance results as well as major causes of measurement error. ...|$|R

The software supports sequence lengths ranging from full length down to the short reads that are characteristic of next-generation sequencing technologies.

We subsequently used v-revcomp to analyse 1 171 646 16 S sequences deposited in the International Nucleotide Sequence Databases and found that about 1 % of these user-submitted sequences were reverse complementary. In addition, a nontrivial proportion of the entries were otherwise anomalous, including reverse complementary chimeras, sequences associated with wrong taxa, nonribosomal genes, sequences of poor quality or otherwise erroneous sequences without a reasonable match to any other entry in the database. Thus, v-revcomp is highly efficient in detecting and reorienting reverse complementary 16 S sequences of almost any length {{and can be used}} to detect various sequence anomalies...|$|R

For instance, in Spain, more than fifty percent of the emergencies are related to pleasure boats at sea. Recreational craft marketed in the EU must comply with harmonized technical safety and environmental requirements defined by Directive 94 / 25 /EC, as amended in 2003. On 28 December 2013, the new recreational craft directive 2013 / 53 /EU was published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

40|$|It can be {{concluded}} from the Tele 2 judgment of 2016 that i) {{the declaration of}} invalidity of the provisions contained in a directive inevitably affects the legal act of transposition into the legal order of the Member States, and ii) a Member State cannot resort to the Directive 2002 / 58 to impose a generalised and undifferentiated obligation to conserve traffic and location data following the declaration of invalidity of Directive 2006 / 24. It is, therefore, urgent to draw conclusions from this recent ruling by the CJEU, which {{is all the more}} relevant because, in Member States where the <b>transposed</b> <b>legislation</b> continued to apply following the declaration of invalidity of Directive 2006 / 24 – {{as was the case in}} Portugal – many criminal convictions were based on the access to potentially illegitimate data.

40|$|Objectives: The article elaborates on {{the intricacies}} brought on the Romanian Law by the adoption, on 7 July 2010, of Directive 2010 / 45 /EU of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council on {{standards}} of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation, raising for the Romanian legal system the question of rapidly adapting its regulations and procedures to the newly introduced European standards, {{as well as the}} question of harmonizing its essential <b>legislation</b> by <b>transposing</b> Directive 2010 / 45 /EU provisions into national law. Prior Work: Liability of Public Administration for damages caused by unsafe transplant procedures represents one of the major themes, in the recent specialized literature. The problematic of informed consent to organ donations, {{as well as that of}} organ traceability represents an interesting, though insufficiently explored and exploited issue, in contemporary Romanian Law. Approach: The author applies, as research method, the analysis of jurisprudence, doctrinal writing and legal provisions in force referring to the problematic of the human organs transplant and donations. The paper also discusses the text of Directive 2010 / 45 /EU on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation. Results: The “opting-in – opting out” dichotomy is discussed, as common standard for informed consent in the field of organ donations. The author also formulates de lege ferenda proposals. Implications: The paper interests legal practitioners confronted with the problematic of human organs donations, law students, as well as jurists specialized in Consumer Law and Administrative Law, since the problematic of organ transplantation also reverberates on the protection of the consumers of medical services. Value: The analysis insists on the degree of compliance of national law to the EU’s regulations when removing disparities on donor’s consent procedure or on standards of safety related to the transport of human organs. The paper is also enriched by a presentation of the new European standards on the National Register of living donors and on the National Data bases on serious adverse events...|$|R
