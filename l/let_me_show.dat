500|$|The game's repetitiveness was criticised by many reviewers. Sam Zucchi of Kill Screen {{said that}} the game got tedious and that the repetitiveness of {{clicking}} on objects was sometimes trivial. He {{said that it was}} as though the game was saying: [...] "No, you really don't understand. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>show</b> you". Alessandro Baravalle of Eurogamer said that although parts of the game were poorly managed or redundant, it did have some exciting moments. Eric Swain {{said that the}} story is great but the game as a whole is let down by the repetitiveness of some parts and, as a result, becomes exhausting to play.|$|E
500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>show</b> you what I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, {{preferred}} Sony's console to {{the competition}} from Sega, saying [...] "Our game designer likes the Sony machine." [...] Microsoft would later compete with Sony with its Xbox console. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, Famicom Tsūshin would score the PlayStation console a 19 out of 40. The staff of Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation {{a few weeks after}} its North American launch. They commented that while the CPU is [...] "fairly average", the supplementary custom hardware such as the GPU and sound processor is stunningly powerful. They particularly praised its focus on 3D, and also remarked positively on the comfort of the controller and the convenience of the memory cards. Giving the system 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, they concluded, [...] "To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war." [...] An advertisement slogan used in marketing the console was, [...] "Live in your world. Play in ours." [...] It is stylised as, [...] "LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS." [...] Another briefly used advertising campaign was titled [...] "You Are Not Ready" [...] or [...] "U R NOT [...]" [...] Sony's CCO Lee Clow explained that [...] "it's the ultimate challenge. Gamers love to respond to that tag line and say 'Bullshit. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>show</b> you how ready I am.'" ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{the third}} son said, 'Father, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> also <b>show</b> you something;' and, {{as it was}} {{beginning}} to rain, he drew his sword and swung it in cross cuts above his head, so that not a drop fell on him, and the rain fell heavier and heavier, till at last it was coming down like a waterspout, but he swung his sword faster and faster, and kept as dry as if he were under cover.|$|R

40|$|First and foremost, I {{would like}} to thank my thesis advisor Glen Van Brummelen who agreed to venture down this road with me; for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>show</b> up last minute and turn his {{schedule}} inside out; for his unlimited patience in helping me understand all the simple stuff; for allowing me to submit this thesis at the most ridiculous hour. I {{would also like to thank}} Ruben Puentedura, my advisor and thesis reader, who was always able to answer any question I had. Always walking down the hallway whenever I needed anything from him. Special thanks to Inam-ur-Rahman who pointed me to the N-Queens problem, which much of this thesis stems from. Nirjan and Sourya who would listen to me talk about queens, numbers and math jargon for hours on end, yet still seem interested. Zain for all the his help with Java. Sara Syed for allowing me to vent my frustrations by listening to me whine and groan throughout my senior year. The abstract algebra class which patiently sat through at least two of my presentations on the N-Queens game. The Media Center crew, those who are and those who have been, especially those who would wake me up at 5 a. m. so I could get back to work...|$|R

"Well," [...] said Tom, {{with cold}} scorn, [...] "if your {{feelings}} {{are so much}} better than mine, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see you <b>show</b> them in some other way than by conduct that's likely to disgrace us all,--than by ridiculous flights first into one extreme and then into another.

5000|$|In 1995, Bowie spoke more {{at length}} about how he felt his {{creativity}} and music had suffered after the success of Let's Dance: great public esteem at that time meant absolutely nothing to me. It didn't make me feel good. I felt dissatisfied with everything I was doing, and eventually it started showing in my work. Let's Dance was an excellent album in a certain genre, but the next two albums after that and Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Down <b>showed</b> that my {{lack of interest in}} my own work was really becoming transparent. My nadir was Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Down. It was such an awful album. I've gotten to a place now where I'm not very judgmental about myself. I put out what I do, whether it's in visual arts or in music, because I know that everything I do is really heartfelt. Even if it's a failure artistically, it doesn't bother me {{in the same way that}} Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Down bothers me. I really shouldn't have even bothered going into the studio to record it. laughs In fact, when I play it, I wonder if I did sometimes.|$|R

My body that is fat enough to withstand TWO YEARS of unremitting chemotherapy—that's right folks, if I had started out this journey as a skinny girl I'd likely be dead by now. My body that has brought me at least my fair share of pleasure and joy and is still allowing me to have the fantastic experience {{of life in a}} carnal body. Heather MacAllister ...|$|R
5000|$|Author Philip Lambert {{wrote that}} the song [...] "has all the earmarks of a classic feel-good Beach Boys song: powerful, catchy vocals, {{including}} back-and-forth leads between Brian and Mike Love, a clean, tight instrumental track, and a straightforward message about the rewards and benefits of monogamy." [...] Scott Interrante of PopMatters claimed that the song was [...] "a solidly written song reminiscent of the group's earlier singles: sophisticated but digestible and fun" [...] {{and went on to}} claim that [...] "when it’s juxtaposed against songs like 'When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)' and 'Please <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Wonder', it <b>shows</b> us just how impressive those other songs really are." ...|$|R

One day in dock at home, while loafing on the {{forecastle}} head, I noticed two respectable salts come along, one a middle-aged, competent, steady man, evidently, {{the other a}} smart, youngish chap. They read {{the name on the}} bows and stopped to look at her. Says the elder man: 'Apse Family. That's the sanguinary female dog' (I'm putting it in that way) 'of a ship, Jack, that kills a man every voyage. I wouldn't sign in her--not for Joe, I wouldn't.' And the other says: 'If she were mine, I'd have her towed on the mud and set on fire, blame if I wouldn't.' Then the first man chimes in: 'Much do they care! Men are cheap, God knows.' The younger one spat in the water alongside. 'They won't have me--not for double wages.' ...|$|R
