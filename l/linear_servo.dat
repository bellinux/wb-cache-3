It is very useful to demonstrate concepts in linear control such as the stabilization of unstable systems. Motion control system plays important roles in industrial equipment such as machine tools, semiconductor manufacturing systems and robot systems. One type of motion control systems is point-to-point (PTP) positioning system, which is used to move an object from one point to another point. <b>Linear</b> motion <b>servo</b> {{system is a}} machine that move cart from one point to another point. This system consists of a cart driven by a DC motor, via a rack and pinion mechanism to ensure consistent and continuous traction. Up to now many types of controllers have been proposed and evaluated for positioning systems. Two type of controller that discussed in this thesis are Proportional-Velocity (PV) and Nominal Characteristic Trajectory Following (NCTF). The experimental results showed that the PV was successfully implemented which controlled the settling time, rise time and steady-state error of the desired position. However, the overshoot performances show its disadvantages.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors which influence on the dynamical behavior of the <b>linear</b> motor <b>servo</b> drives for CNC machine tools is position loop gain or Kv factor. From the magnitude of the Kv-factor depends tracking or following error. In multi-axis contouring the following errors along the different axes may cause form deviations of the machined contours. Generally position loop gain Kv should be high for faster system response and higher accuracy, but the maximum gains allowable are limited due to undesirable oscillatory responses at high gains and low damping factor. Usually Kv factor is experimentally tuned on the already assembled machine tool. This paper presents a simple method for analytically calculation of the position loop gain Kv. A combined digital-analog model of the 4 -th order of the position loop is presented. In order to ease the calculation, the 4 -th order system is simplified with a second order model. With this approach it is very easy to calculate the Kv factor for necessary position loop damping. The difference of the replacement of the 4 -th order system with second order system is presented with the simulation program MATLAB. Analytically calculated Kv factor is function of the nominal angular frequency ω and damping D of the <b>linear</b> motor <b>servo</b> drive electrical parts (motor and regulator), as well as sampling period T. The influence of nonlinearities was taken with the correction factor.

Method—Quantitative measures of perioral stiffness were sampled during a nonparticipatory task using a computer-controlled <b>linear</b> motor <b>servo</b> programmed to impose a series of tensile displacements over a span of approximately 24 mm at the oral angle in 20 healthy young male adults. Perioral electromyograms were simultaneously sampled to confirm nonparticipation or passive muscle state.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, implementation, {{and control of}} {{a new class of}} fast tool servos (FTS). The primary thesis contributions include the design and experimental demonstration of: novel ultra-fast electromagnetic actuators, integration of these actuators in a new class of FTS, a novel real-time control computer with 1 million samples per second throughput, MIMO loop shaping techniques for parallel power amplifiers, and a novel configuration and controller tuning method for implementing adaptive feed-forward cancellation control. All of these elements have been successfully used for diamond turning of contoured surfaces. Fast tool servos (FTS) are high bandwidth positioning devices, which, in conjunction with an ultra-precision lathe and diamond tooling, can produce free form surfaces with nanometer-scale resolution, such as required in micro-optical devices and light-enhancing films. The increasing complexity of such surfaces requires more components in shorter spatial wavelengths, and thus drives simultaneously the need for high bandwidth, high acceleration and high accuracy of the FTS. Conventional FTS solutions are based on piezoelectric stacks, which are typically limited to a few micron stroke at 1 kHz operation if not operated in a resonant mode. (cont.) As a promising alternative, this thesis demonstrates electromagnetically driven solutions for fast tool servos. The key new technology in these alternative designs is a new class of ultra fast electromagnetic drivers with thousands of G's acceleration capability in continuous operation. By separating the flux-biasing surfaces from the normal-flux working surfaces, this new driver design has a number of advantages: (1) actuating force linear to both excitation current and displacement, (2) modularity and parallel operating ability, (3) full magnetic stress utilization of normal surfaces, and (4) low heat dissipation. We analyze the operation characteristics, and also provide soft magnetic material selection criteria and motor design guidelines. Based on this ultra fast driver, we designed a <b>linear</b> fast tool <b>servo</b> with the theoretical capability for 1200 G acceleration in continuous operation. To control such positioning devices at bandwidth of over 10 kHz, we developed a real-time computer architecture, utilizing three floating point digital signal processors (DSPs) in conjunction with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to significantly increase the processing rate. (cont.) The real-time computer prototype experimentally demonstrated 1 million samples per second real-time control execution with a total latency of 1. 9 microseconds when implementing a representative control algorithm of significant complexity. This processing system has capabilities far beyond what is commercially available for such real-time high-accuracy control tasks. The power amplifier driving the FTS must supply 1 kVA (primarily reactive power) with over 100 kHz bandwidth. We present a solution of using 4 power operational amplifiers in parallel, each capable of supplying one fourth of the total power. To address the coupling issues among channels, a decoupling theory is developed to convert the associated MIMO plant into several SISO sub-plants, and thus ease the analog decentralized controller design of the power amplifier current feedback loops. In order to enhance the FTS repetitive position trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection, adaptive feed-forward cancellation is embedded into a conventional motion control loop in our system. We provide a consistent loop shaping framework and intuitive parameter tuning and trade-off guidelines for this controller structure. (cont.) Experimental results with the first prototype FTS using powder iron cores demonstrate 23 kHz closed-loop bandwidth, as low as 1. 7 nm RMS error, 30 micron stroke, 500 G peak acceleration at 10 kHz open-loop operation, and 2. 1 nm (0. 04 %) error in tracking a 3 kHz sinusoid of 16 micron p-v. (The full 1200 G capability is expected to be experimentally demonstrated by the second prototype FTS using Ni-Fe tape cores). Using this FTS, we have diamond-turned two-dimensional sinusoidal surfaces in copper and aluminum with 0. 5 degree azimuthal spatial period, 160 micron radial spatial period, and 2 micron peak-to-valley amplitude, at 500 RPM spindle speed. by Xiaodong Lu.
