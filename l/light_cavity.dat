Two atomic systems are discussed, which allow transparency and ? -compensation, i. e. the dispersion {{of the medium}} compensates the frequency dependence of the vacuum wavelength.

40|$|Anomalously {{dispersive}} <b>cavities,</b> particularly white <b>light</b> <b>cavities,</b> {{may have}} larger bandwidth to finesse ratios than their normally dispersive counterparts. Partly for this reason, their use {{has been proposed}} for use in LIGO-like gravity wave detectors and in ring-laser gyroscopes. In this paper we analyze the quantum noise associated with anomalously dispersive cavity modes. The vacuum field energy associated with a particular cavity mode {{is proportional to the}} cavity-averaged group velocity of that mode. For anomalously dispersive cavities with group index values between 1 and 0, this means that the total vacuum field energy associated with a particular cavity mode must exceed ħω/ 2. For white <b>light</b> <b>cavities</b> in particular, the group index approaches zero and the vacuum field energy of a particular spatial mode may be significantly enhanced. We predict enhanced spontaneous emission rates into anomalously dispersive cavity modes and broadened laser linewidths when the linewidth of intracavity emitters is broader than the cavity linewidth.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{gravitational}} waves (GWs) {{has been observed}} indirectly, by monitoring {{the change in the}} orbital frequency of neutron stars in a binary system as they lose energy via gravitational radiation. However, GWs have not yet been observed directly. The initial LIGO apparatus has not yet observed GWs. The Advanced LIGO (AdLIGO) will use a combination of improved techniques in order to increase the sensitivity. Along with power recycling and a higher power laser source, the AdLIGO will employ signal recycling (SR). While SR would increase sensitivity, it would also reduce the bandwidth significantly. Previously, we and others have investigated, theoretically and experimentally, the feasibility of using a White <b>Light</b> <b>Cavity</b> (WLC) to circumvent this constraint. However, in the previous work, it was not clear how one would incorporate the white <b>light</b> <b>cavity</b> effect. Here, we first develop a general model for Michelson-Interferometer based GW detectors that can be easily adapted to include the effects of incorporating a WLC into the design. We then describe a concrete design of a WLC constructed as a compound mirror, to replace the signal recycling mirror. This design is simple, robust, completely non-invasive, and can be added to the AdLIGO system without changing any other optical elements. We show a choice of parameters for which the signal sensitivity as well as the bandwidth are enhanced significantly over what is planned for the AdLIGO, covering the entire spectrum of interest for gravitational waves.

40|$|The methods {{currently}} {{utilized in}} dentistry to detect caries lesions have their limitations and alternatives are being investigated. A promising option is tooth transillumination {{which is based}} on an increase of light scattering or light absorption in the affected tissue region. In this study transillumination applied to detect approximal caries lesions was investigated using premolar teeth containing simulated caries lesions. Cavities were drilled at the approximal surface and filled with light absorbing and light scattering fluids in different dye and particle concentrations to model successive stages of lesion progress. For <b>light</b> absorbing <b>cavities</b> the extinction as function of the decadic absorption coefficient measured at the occlusal surface could be approximated by the Lambert-Beer law (r = 0. 98 +/- 0. 01). For <b>light</b> scattering <b>cavities</b> the extinction {{as a function of the}} decadic reduced scatter coefficient wad fitted to a straight line (r = 0. 98 +/- 0. 03) for mu(s) ':(lambda = 633 nm) < 1. 25 mm(- 1).

40|$|We discuss in-medium {{propagation}} {{dynamics in}} a white <b>light</b> <b>cavity</b> that leads to an enhancement of the cavity's bandwidth without reducing its maximum intensity buildup. We analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of our system with a full simulation of the field propagation in a regime that leads to strong absorption of the control fields. We find that an additional coherent field is generated within the medium via four-wave mixing. This self-generated field leads to a backaction of the medium onto the probe field. Counter intuitively, this pronounced in-medium dynamics throughout the propagation leads to an additional enhancement of the cavity bandwidth. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that Bragg reflection from linearly chirped Bragg gratings (LCBGs) can compensate for a chromatic dispersion by reflecting different wavelengths at different location along {{the axis of}} the gratings for ultra-short pulses. In this paper, we studied the possibility of making use of such a dispersion-compensating property to construct a white <b>light</b> <b>cavity</b> (WLC). A pair of LCBGs is suggested as the reflectors of the cavity. The analytical and numerical analysis shows that the reflection by a LCBG does not solely occur at the position where Bragg condition is reached. The accumulated effect of multiple scatterings at different locations inside the LCBG produces a positive group delay, preventing the WLC to be realized with simple LCBG...|$|E

40|$|We {{observe the}} opto-mechanical multistability of a {{macroscopic}} torsion balance oscillator. The torsion oscillator forms the moving mirror of a hemi-spherical laser <b>light</b> <b>cavity.</b> When {{a laser beam}} is coupled into this cavity, the radiation pressure force of the intra-cavity beam adds to the torsion wire's restoring force, forming an opto-mechanical potential. In the absence of optical damping, up to 23 stable trapping regions were observed due to local light potential minima over a range of 4 micrometer oscillator displacement. Each of these trapping positions exhibits optical spring properties. Hysteresis behavior between neighboring trapping positions is also observed. We discuss the prospect of observing opto-mechanical stochastic resonance, aiming at enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in gravity experiments. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|A passive white <b>light</b> <b>cavity</b> (WLC) {{based on}} a fiber {{resonator}} {{can be used for}} high-bandwidth optical data buffering. Here, we report on experimental studies of such a WLC, employing stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) for producing the negative dispersion, using two different configurations. In one configuration, an absorption peak produced by a Brillouin pump is used. In the other configuration, two gain peaks produced by two separate Brillouin pumps are employed. In each case, we see evidence of the WLC effect. However, the range of parameters accessible experimentally limits the degree of the WLC effect significantly. We present a theoretical analysis for the optimal combinations of parameters, such as a high Brillouin gain coefficient and a low transmission loss, necessary for achieving the condition of a vanishing group index, as required for creating an ideal WLC.

For application to telecommunication systems, it would be convenient to realize such a device using fiber optic resonators. In this paper, we present the design of such a system, where the white <b>light</b> <b>cavity</b> effect is produced by using stimulated Brillouin scattering. The system consists of a pair of fiber optic white light cavities placed in series. As in the original proposal, the delay time can be controlled independently of the bandwidth of the data pulses. Furthermore, we show how the bandwidth of the system can be made as large as several times the Brillouin frequency shift. We also show that the net delay achievable in such a buffer can be significantly larger than what can be achieved using a conventional recirculating loop buffer. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{interferometric}} gravitational-wave detectors implement Fabry-Perot cavities {{to increase}} their peak sensitivity. However, this is at cost of reducing their detection bandwidth, which origins from the propagation phase delay of the light. The "white-light-cavity" idea, first proposed by Wicht et al. [Optics Communications 134, 431 (1997) ], is to circumvent this limitation by introducing anomalous dispersion, using double-pumped gain medium, to compensate for such phase delay. In this article, starting from the Hamiltonian of atom-light interaction, we apply the input-output formalism to evaluate the quantum noise of the system. We find that apart from the additional noise associated with the parametric amplification process noticed by others, the stability condition for the entire system poses an additional constraint. Through surveying the parameter regimes where the gain medium remains stable (not lasing) and stationary, we find {{that there is no}} net enhancement of the shot-noise limited sensitivity. Therefore, other gain mediums or different parameter regimes shall be explored for realizing the white <b>light</b> <b>cavity.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|Recently, a tunable {{bandwidth}} white <b>light</b> <b>cavity</b> (WLC) {{was demonstrated}} {{by using an}} anomalously dispersive intra-cavity medium to adjust a cavity linewidth without reducing the cavity buildup factor [G. S. Pati et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 133601 (2007) ]. In this paper, we show theoretically how such a WLC {{can be used to}} realize a distortion-free delay system for a data pulse. The system consists of two WLCs placed in series. Once the pulse has passed through them, the fast-light media in both WLCs are deactivated, so that each of these now acts as a very high reflectivity mirror. The data pulse bounces around between these mirrors, undergoing negligible attenuation per pass. The trapped pulse can be released by activating the fast-light medium in either WLC. Numerical simulations show that such a system can far exceed the delay-bandwidth constraint encountered in a typical data buffer employing slow light. We also show that the pulse remains virtually undistorted during the process. Comment: 10 pages 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} superluminal {{light propagation}} using two frequency multiplexed pump beams {{to produce a}} gain doublet in a photorefractive crystal of Ce:BaTiO 3. The two gain lines are obtained by two-wave mixing between a probe field and two individual pump fields. The angular frequencies of the pumps are symmetrically tuned from {{the frequency of the}} probe. The frequency difference between the pumps corresponds to the separation of the two gain lines; as it increases, the crystal gradually converts from normal dispersion without detuning to an anomalously dispersive medium. The time advance is measured as 0. 28 sec for a pulse propagating through a medium with a 2 Hz gain separation, compared to the same pulse propagating through empty space. We also demonstrate directly anomalous dispersion profile using a modfied experimental configuration. Finally, we discuss how anomalous dispersion produced this way in a faster photorefractive crystal (such as SPS: Sn 2 P 2 S 6) could be employed to enhance the sensitivity-bandwidth product of a LIGO type gravitational wave detector augmented by a White <b>Light</b> <b>Cavity.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

A distinct regime from the usual Raman-Nath, Bragg and Stern-Gerlach regimes is investigated, considering the situation where the <b>cavity</b> <b>light</b> field acts as a repulsive and an attractive two-dimensional potential. General expressions for the scattering lengths (the two-dimensional analogues to the three-dimensional scattering cross-sections) of finding the atoms deexcited or not after their interaction with the cavity are derived. The connection with the classical Rabi limit when the incident atomic kinetic energy is high compared with the atom-field interaction energy is made. In the cold atom regime characterized by much lower incident atomic kinetic energies, the scattering process exhibits very peculiar properties in connection with quasibound states of the atomic motion induced by the attractive potential of the <b>cavity</b> <b>light</b> field.

40|$|Coherent atomic states {{prepared}} by laser field can have quantum interference {{between the different}} transition amplitudes. Therefore, the medium susceptibility and optical response can be engineered, leading to many interesting phenomena, such as coherent population trapping (CPT), electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), and lasing without inversion (LWI). We studied the coherence effects in various prototype atomic systems, and found many interesting applications. We solved the slow light bandwidth problem by decomposing the pulse and matching each frequency to its EIT window using a magnetic field gradient.

40|$|Background: Because H 2 O 2 is {{generated}} by various oxidase-catalyzed reactions, a highly sensitive determination method of H 2 O 2 is applicable to measurements of low levels of various oxidases and their substrates such as glucose, lactate, glutamate, urate, xanthine, choline, cholesterol and NADPH. We propose herein a new, highly sensitive method for the measurement of H 2 O 2 and glucose using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Methodology/Principal Findings: FCS {{has the advantage of}} allowing us to determine the number of fluorescent molecules. FCS measures the fluctuations in fluorescence intensity caused by fluorescent probe movement in a small <b>light</b> <b>cavity</b> with a defined volume generated by confocal illumination. We thus developed a highly sensitive determination system of H 2 O 2 by FCS, where horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalyzes the formation of a covalent bond between fluorescent molecules and proteins in the presence of H 2 O 2. Our developed system gave a linear calibration curve for H 2 O 2 in the range of 28 to 300 nM with the detection limit of 8 nM. In addition, by coupling with glucose oxidase (GOD) -catalyzed reaction, the method allows to measure glucose in the range of 80 nM to 1. 5 mM with detection limit of 24 nM. The method was applicable to the assay of glucose in blood plasma. The mean concentration of glucose in normal human blood plasma was determined to be 4. 9 mM.
