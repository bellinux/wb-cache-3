500|$|The {{episode was}} {{critically}} acclaimed by television critics. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times opined, [...] "Those cues also hold out {{the promise that}} the coming season will once again pivot {{the story on the}} workplace. It’s where Mad Men started and where it was best. A fresh start at the rat race is just what the series needs." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. Goldman felt that it start of the season on a strong note, writing, [...] "It's a clever beat to start out with, leading into a strong premiere that quickly drops us into what can be described as Mad Men 2.0." [...] Praise was also directed to the musical selection of the episode, which Goldman described as excellent. In concurrence, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A' grade, praising the character development of Don Draper and Peggy Olson. Expressing that she had more confidence, Phipps said of Peggy: [...] " [...] the person who's changed most notably over the <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> <b>She</b> drinks at work like the boys and [...] goes into a Don-like trance as she searches for inspiration. She bosses Joey around and tells him when he’s gone too far. And she’s not afraid to get creative to sell ham and wants credit for her idea, even if it encounters a minor disaster along the way. Most significantly, she’s standing up to Don at every turn now. He bullies her in front of her fiancé but hears about it later. And she provides a devastating mixture of admiration and chiding when she reminds Don that everyone at SCDP is there because of him and out of a desire to make him happy." [...] Similarly, James Poniewozik of Time praised the performance of Elisabeth Moss, exclaiming that [...] "she has come a long way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bannerghatta is {{the first}} {{biological}} park in India to have a fenced forested elephant sanctuary where elephants can roam around freely without chains. A newly captured elephant was bought here. It was a herculean task to get such a huge animal to the national park. During offloading, it got stuck in the truck, cranes were called to ensure safety of this animal. Presence of elephant expert Carol Buckley made sure that chirag suffered no further troubles. His eating habits were also taken care of, which primarily includes grass. [...] It is designed by elephant expert Carol Buckley and covers an area of 122 acres. The fence is sponsored by animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India, which raised funds of Rs. 1 crore for its installation. “The elephants are absolutely free to roam without human interference, and will be free of tussles with other wild elephants,” Manilal Valliyate, PETA India's Director of Veterinary Affairs was quoted saying in an interview to The Hindu. According to a report published in Times of India, US elephant expert Margaret Whittaker {{came up with the}} innovative idea after visiting BBP <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> <b>She</b> gave the local mahouts training on 'protected contact' with the jumbos. This leads to safe interaction between human beings and elephants by keeping them separated {{while at the same time}} using positive techniques to manage the animals.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, Susan Lucci {{became known}} for gaining Daytime Emmy Award {{nominations}} for her portrayal of Erica, but never winning. Almost {{every year from}} 1978 to 1998, Lucci received nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama series and never won. Her negative reactions to the losses, including pounding her fist {{on the table and}} leaving one ceremony in tears, were mentioned in tabloids. Her losses also caused her fellow castmate Ruth Warrick to speak out to the press. In 1983, when Lucci lost to All My Children newcomer Dorothy Lyman (Opal), Warrick said, [...] "It seemed impossible that Susan wouldn't win this year. We are all very puzzled, amazed, and disgruntled." [...] She later added, [...] "It was {{a slap in the face}} to Susan that Dorothy should walk off with it after being on the show such a short time. And of course her role was so outrageous and so, well, it was a caricature. That's not in any way to put down what Dorothy did, but it really was a supporting role rather than a leading role." [...] The losing streak became a [...] "long-running gag" [...] in the entertainment community. Jay Leno on The Tonight Show used it as a joke as did Saturday Night Live. The author of The Emmy, Tom O'Neil, attributed the losses to the material she submitted for consideration. [...] "In the episodes she sent in <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> <b>she</b> was crying 75 percent of the time," [...] he said. [...] "She drowned her chances in a tsunami of tears. Lucci eventually won the Daytime Emmy Award in 1999, receiving a two-minute standing ovation at the win and again after the show in the press room. A reporter in the press room questioned whether she would miss the attention she got for losing, to which Lucci responded, [...] "Oh, not for a minute. Winning is definitely better." [...] The entries Lucci submitted for the 1999 Daytime Emmy Awards involved scenes from Erica's storyline where she helps Bianca deal with her anorexia.|$|E
