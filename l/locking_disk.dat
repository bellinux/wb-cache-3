40|$|Context. Very low-mass (VLM) {{stars and}} brown dwarfs (BDs) present a {{different}} rotational behaviour from their solar mass counter-parts. Aims. We investigate the rotational evolution of young VLM stars and BDs using Monte Carlo simulations under {{the hypothesis of}} <b>disk</b> <b>locking</b> and stellar angular momentum conservation. Methods. We built a set of objects with masses ranging from 0. 01 Mo to 0. 4 Mo and considered models with single- and double- peaked initial period distributions with and without <b>disk</b> <b>locking.</b> An object {{is considered to be}} diskless when its mass accretion rate is below a given threshold. Results. Models with initial single-peaked period distributions reproduce the observations well given that BDs rotate faster than VLM stars. We observe a correlation between rotational period and mass when we relax the <b>disk</b> <b>locking</b> hypothesis, but with a shallower slope compared to some observational results. The angular momentum evolution of diskless stars is flatter than it is for stars with a disk which occurs because the moment of inertia of objects less massive than 0. 2 Mo remains pratically constant for a time scale that increases with decreasing stellar mass. Conclusions. Comparing our results with the available observational data we see that <b>disk</b> <b>locking</b> is not as important in the low-mass regime and that the rotational behaviour of VLM stars and BDs is different from what is seen in their solar mass counterparts.

After correcting for projection effects, we find that infrared-selected Class I/flat spectrum objects rotate significantly more quickly (median equatorial rotation velocity ~ 38 km/sec) than Classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs; median equatorial rotation velocity ~ 18 km/sec) in the Rho Ophiuchi and Taurus-Aurigae regions. The detected difference in rotation speeds between Class I/flat spectrum sources and CTTSs proves difficult to explain without some mechanism which transfers angular momentum out of the protostar between the two phases. Assuming Class I/flat spectrum sources possess physical characteristics (M_*,R_*,B_*) typical of pre-main sequence stars, fully <b>disk</b> <b>locked</b> Class I objects should have co-rotation radii within their protostellar disks that match well (within 30 %) with the predicted magnetic coupling radii of Shu et al (1994).

This result is inconsistent with expectations that convective stars lacking disks should spin up as they contract, but paradoxically consistent with disk-locking models.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the rotational evolution of young stars through Monte Carlo simulations. We simulate 280, 000 stars, {{each of which}} is assigned a mass, a rotational period, and a mass accretion rate. The mass accretion rate depends on mass and time, following power-laws indices 1. 4 and - 1. 5, respectively. A mass-dependent accretion threshold is defined below which a star is considered as diskless, which results in a distribution of disk lifetimes that matches observations. Stars are evolved at constant angular spin rate while accreting and at constant angular momentum when they become diskless. We recover the bimodal period distribution seen in several young clusters. The short period peak consists mostly of diskless stars and the long period one is mainly populated by accreting stars. Both distributions present a long tail towards long periods and a population of slowly rotating diskless stars is observed at all ages. We reproduce the observed correlations between disk fraction and spin rate, as well as between IR excess and rotational period. The period-mass relation we derive from the simulations exhibits the same global trend as observed in young clusters only if we release the <b>disk</b> <b>locking</b> assumption for the lowest mass stars. We find that the time evolution of median specific angular momentum follows a power law index of - 0. 65 for accreting stars and of - 0. 53 for diskless stars, a shallower slope that results from a wide distribution of disk lifetimes. Using observationally-documented distributions of disk lifetimes, mass accretion rates, and initial rotation periods, and evolving an initial population from 1 to 12 Myr, we reproduce the main characteristics of pre-main sequence angular momentum evolution, which supports the <b>disk</b> <b>locking</b> hypothesis.

Our aim is {{to search for the}} relationship, if any, between spot temperatures and stellar rotation periods to better understand the relationship between accretion and angular momentum regulation in T Tauri stars. Current magnetic disk-locking models of young stars ascribe spot temperatures hotter than the photosphere to active accretion from a circumstellar disk. If accretion acts to brake stellar rotation, spot temperatures hotter than the photosphere should be more prevalent among slow rotators. From the variability amplitudes at four wavelengths (B, V, R, I), we determine spot temperatures and the areal coverage of the spot on the stellar surface. The results of our model show that we can unambiguously distinguish spots hotter than the photosphere from spots cooler than the photosphere for most stars. Comparisons between spot temperatures and previously determined rotation periods reveal no significant correlation between spot temperatures and stellar rotation. Comparisons between spot temperatures and measurements of nearIR excess, Δ(I-K), reveal possible problems with the accuracy of Δ(I-K) as an indicator of circumstellar disk presence. We confirm this problem by further comparing spot temperatures to Ca II equivalent widths and comparing Δ(I-K) measurements with Ca II equivalent widths corresponding to evidence for accretion from a circumstellar disk. We propose that future studies of the angular momentum evolution of T Tauri stars take considerable care in distinguishing stars with circumstellar disks and possible magnetic <b>disk</b> <b>locking</b> from stars without circumstellar disks or magnetic <b>disk</b> <b>locking.</b> Finally, we argue that our spot temperature and rotation period comparisons support new theories of angular momentum evolution in T Tauri stars that relate the angular momentum evolution of pre-main-sequence stars to the core-envelope decoupling that occurs during the convective-radiative transition...|$|R

The stability of the resonance <b>lock</b> when the <b>disk</b> dissipates is also tested. Methods: The orbital {{evolution of a}} large number of systems is numerically integrated within a three-body problem in which the disk potential is computed as a series of expansion. This is a good approximation, at least over a limited amount of time. Results: Two different resonances are studied: the 2 : 1 and the 3 : 2. In both cases the shift is inwards, even if by a different amount, when the planets are massive and carve a gap in the disk. For super [...] Earths, the shift is instead outwards. Different disk densities, Sigma, are considered and the resonance shift depends almost linearly on Sigma. The gas dissipation leads to destabilization of a significant number of resonant systems, in particular if it is fast. Conclusions: The presence of a massive circumstellar disk may significantly affect the resonant behavior of a pair of planets by shifting the resonant location and by decreasing the size of the stability region. The disk dissipation may explain some systems found close to a resonance but not locked in it. Comment: Accepted for publication on A&...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} field in young stellar object is undoubtedly {{the most important}} component when one dealing with the angular momentum evolution. It controls this latter one from the pre-main sequence, during the so-called <b>disk</b> <b>locking</b> phase where the stars magnetically interact with their surrounding disk, to the main-sequence through powerful stellar winds that remove angular momentum from the stellar surface. We present new models for the rotational evolution of solar-like stars between 1 Myr and 10 Gyr with the aim to reproduce the distributions of rotational periods observed for star forming regions and young open clusters within this age range. We based our simulation on a recent model dedicated {{to the study of}} the angular momentum evolution of solar-type stars. This model include a new wind braking law based on recent numerical simulations of magnetized stellar winds and a specific dynamo and mass-loss prescription are used to link the angular momentum loss-rate to angular velocity evolution. The model additionally allows for a core/envelope decoupling with an angular momentum transfer between these two regions. Since this former model didn’t include any physical star/disk interaction description, two star/disk interaction processes are eventually added to it in order to reproduce the apparent small angular velocities to which the stellar surface is subject during the disk accretion phase. We have developed rotational evolution models for slow, median and fast rotators including two star/disk interaction scenarios that are the magnetospheric ejection and the accretion powered stellar winds processes. The models appear to fail at reproducing the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars except when a more intense {{magnetic field}} is used during the disk accretion phase...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{simplified}} model {{to study the}} orbital evolution of a young hot Jupiter inside the magnetospheric cavity of a proto-planetary disk. The model {{takes into account the}} <b>disk</b> <b>locking</b> of stellar spin as well as the tidal and magnetic interactions between the star and the planet. We focus on the orbital evolution starting from the orbit in the 2 : 1 resonance with the inner edge of the disk, followed by the inward and then outward orbital migration driven by the tidal and magnetic torques as well as the Roche-lobe overflow of the tidally inflated planet. The goal in this paper is to study how the orbital evolution inside the magnetospheric cavity depends on the cavity size, planet mass, and orbital eccentricity. In the present work, we only target the mass range from 0. 7 to 2 Jupiter masses. In the case of the large cavity corresponding to the rotational period ~ 7 days, the planet of mass > 1 Jupiter mass with moderate initial eccentricities (>~ 0. 3) can move to the region < 0. 03 AU from its central star in 10 ^ 7 years, while the planet of mass < 1 Jupiter mass cannot. We estimate the critical eccentricity beyond which the planet of a given mass will overflow its Roche radius and finally lose all of its gas onto the star due to runaway mass loss. In the case of the small cavity corresponding to the rotational period ~ 3 days, all of the simulated planets lose all of their gas even in circular orbits. Our results for the orbital evolution of young hot Jupiters may have the potential to explain the absence of low-mass giant planets inside ~ 0. 03 AU from their dwarf stars revealed by transit surveys.

40|$|Using the Hectochelle multifiber spectrograph, we have {{obtained}} high-resolution (R~ 34, 000) spectra in the Halpha region {{for a large}} number of stars in the 4 Myr-old cluster Tr 37, containing 146 previously known members and 26 newly identified ones. We present the Halpha line profiles of all members, compare them to our IR observations of dusty disks (2 MASS/JHK + IRAC + MIPS 24 micron), use the radial velocities as a membership criterion, and calculate the rotational velocities. We find a good correlation between the accretion-broadened profiles and the presence of protoplanetary disks, noting that {{a small fraction of the}} accreting stars presents broad profiles with Halpha equivalent widths smaller than the canonical limit separating CTTS and WTTS. The number of strong accretors appears to be lower than in younger regions, and {{a large number of}} CTTS have very small accretion rates (dM/dt< 10 ^{- 9 } Msun/yr). Taking into account that the spectral energy distributions are consistent with dust evolution (grain growth/settling) in the innermost disk, this suggests a parallel evolution of the dusty and gaseous components. We also observe that about half of the "transition objects" (stars with no IR excesses at wavelengths shorter than ~ 6 micron) do not show any signs of active accretion, whereas the other half is accreting with accretion rates < 10 ^{- 9 } Msun/yr. These zero or very low accretion rates reveal important gas evolution and/or gas depletion in the innermost disk, which could be related to grain growth up to planetesimal or even planet sizes. Finally, we examine the rotational velocities of accreting and non accreting stars, finding no significant differences that could indicate <b>disk</b> <b>locking</b> at these ages.

40|$|A {{variability}} {{study of}} the young cluster IC 348 at Van Vleck Observatory has been extended {{to a total of}} seven years. Twelve new periodic stars have been found in the last two years, bringing the total discovered by this program to 40. In addition, we confirm 16 of the periods reported by others and resolve some discrepancies. The total number of known rotation periods in the cluster, from all studies has now reached 70. This is sufficient to demonstrate that the parent population of K 5 -M 2 stars is rotationally indistinguishable from that in the Orion Nebula Cluster even though their radii are 20 % smaller and they would be expected to spin about twice as fast if angular momentum were conserved. The median radius and, therefore, inferred age of the IC 348 stars actually closely matches that of NGC 2264, but the stars spin significantly more slowly. This suggests that another factor besides mass and age plays a role in establishing the rotation properties within a cluster and we suggest that it is environment. If <b>disk</b> <b>locking</b> were to persist for longer times in less harsh environments, because the disks themselves persist for longer times, it could explain the generally slower rotation rates observed for stars in this cluster, whose earliest type star is of class B 5. We have also obtained radial velocities, the first for PMS stars in IC 348, and v sin i measurements for 30 cluster stars to assist in the study of rotation and as an independent check on stellar radii. Several unusual variable stars are discussed; in some or all cases their behavior may be linked to occultations by circumstellar material. A strong correlation exists between the range of photometric variability and the slope of the spectral energy distribution in the infrared. Nineteen of the 21 stars with I ranges exceeding 0. 4 mag show infrared evidence for circumstellar disks. Comment: Accepted for publication in A...|$|R
