The two liquids are in a cylindrical container and set into motion by a rotating <b>lid</b> <b>positioned</b> above the interface. The upper liquid is more viscous than the lower and the difference in densities between the liquids is fairly small. As the rotational speed of the lid (Ω) is increased in small increments, {{the center of the}} interface rises and the height increases. Depending on Ω, the topology of the interface changes drastically. The shape of the interface depends strongly on Ω and also the volume fraction of the liquids. Some dynamical behavior of the interface accompanies the changes in topology: interfacial waves, the generation of droplets, and interfacial instability...|$|R
30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that basidiospore transfer from upside-down incubated mushrooms with open hymenia to the plastic lids depends on an active ballistospore discharge mechanism (Table  1). This suggested that producing spore prints from up-flying spores would be more selective to the basidiospores than the usual spore prints collected underneath wild mushrooms {{which tend to be}} mixed with fallen spores and cells of other microbes. This assumption was tested by plating spore solutions from classical prints and spore solutions collected from plastic <b>lids</b> <b>positioned</b> above upside-down incubated mushrooms (Table  4; Figs.  5, 6). In contrast to conventional spore prints, presence of yeasts or spores from other filamentous fungi which need animal vectors or air flow for their movements was rarely detected in plating tests of spore solutions which were collected from plastic <b>lids</b> <b>positioned</b> above reversed incubated mushrooms (at maximum 10 % of samples were contaminated). Bacteria were in somewhat higher frequency present (in up to 22 % of total samples of an individual test series), possibly because they may at times be flying directly with a basidiospore. However, there are possible measures against bacteria through addition of suitable antibiotics to the growth media (Fig.  5; Table  4). Further, accumulation of larger numbers of bacterial cells can be precluded by shorter incubation times applied for basidiospore collection (Fig.  6). Already 2 – 4  h of incubation are sufficient to collect 104 – 105  spores from mushrooms in the plastic lids (Fig.  2) with no or exceptionally a few bacteria being present in the spore solutions (Fig.  6). Spore ejection rates in our study (Fig.  2; see Table  1 for total ejection figures) correlate with ratios of ballistospore ejection/h from mushrooms reported by Buller (1909, 1922) and to ratios which can be calculated from the spore emission data/s × cm 2 compiled in Saar and Salm (2014).|$|R

50|$|When {{caused by}} Horner's syndrome, ptosis is usually {{accompanied}} by miosis and anhidrosis.

30|$|Classically, when spore {{prints are}} to be {{produced}} from mushrooms with open hymenia such as for species identification or when individual basidiospores {{are to be}} isolated for germination, mushroom caps are laid facing down onto a surface (see “Introduction” section), in compliance to their orientation in nature. Under saturating levels of humidity, matured basidiospores are propelled off from the sterigmata on their basidia by fast hygroscopic development and subsequent actions of Buller’s drop. The surface energy obtained from the Buller’s drop by its fusion with the also hygroscopic liquid adaxial spore film is calculated to be sufficient for the spores to just reach the middle in between two lamellae or ridges or of a pore in order to then fall {{down out of the}} mushroom by gravity (Ingold 1939, 1957, 1992; Webster et al. 1984 a, 1989; Turner and Webster 1991; Pringle et al. 2005; Noblin et al. 2009; Fischer et al. 2010 a, b).

40|$|PURPOSE: Lid architecture, lid tension, blink action, and blink rate may all {{influence}} rigid lens centration and stability. The aims of {{this study}} were to assess {{the nature of the relationship}} between lid geometry and lens position and to examine the influence of lens-lid interactions on the association between lens position and lens center of gravity and mass. METHODS: Eight subjects (four with high riding lenses and four with low riding lenses) participated in the study. Each subject was fit with 12 lenses-six designs in each of two materials. Lens center of gravity was calculated and lens mass was measured in every case. For each lens, the following four lens dynamics variables were assessed over a five blink cycle for both the vertical and horizontal meridians: 1) initial lens position; 2) settled lens position; 3) amount of lens movement; and 4) rate of lens movement. Lower <b>lid</b> <b>position</b> and palpebral aperture height were measured for each subject. RESULTS: Graphical analysis showed that a low upper <b>lid</b> <b>position</b> and small palpebral aperture promoted superior lens decentration, while a high upper <b>lid</b> <b>position</b> and wide palpebral aperature predisposed an individual to inferior lens decentration. Significant lid-lens overlap was a common finding with high riding lenses in both the initial and settled lens positions. The results also suggested that while a rigid lens tended to become more stable as the lens center of gravity shifted further behind the corneal apex, this gravitational effect was reduced for lenses that interacted with the upper lid. CONCLUSIONS: Lid geometry can influence rigid lens centration and stability by modifying the effects of lens design and lens mass. We recommend that consideration be given to the nature of potential lens-lid interactions prior to lens fitting...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} tear film spreading {{and central}} <b>lid</b> <b>position</b> in spontaneous blinks and {{to propose a}} model of the central <b>lid</b> <b>position</b> of the closed eye in such blinks. METHOD: In vivo: lid margin position and geometry of 15 subjects (9 female; median age= 45 years) were evaluated by high-speed video and slit-lamp microscope video in consecutive spontaneous blinks. Upper lid (UL) tear meniscus (TM) depth was observed in the open and almost closed eye. Eyelid geometry, position and UL TM depth were analysed by Image-J Software. Lid margin thicknesses were measured with a Scheimpflug camera. In vitro: tear film spreading and lipid layer formation were simulated on a lubricated glass plate and videoed by high-speed camera (JVC, GZ-GX 1 BE, Japan). RESULTS: In vivo: the median central lid margin thickness was not significantly (p= 0. 258) different between UL (1. 8 mm) and LL (1. 7 mm) in the opened eye. During blinking, UL remained perpendicular to the corneal surface, while LL tilted in and thinned. A scaled model diagram was created and revealed an over-blink of the UL over the LL (> 0. 7 mm) and a height offset of the posterior lid margin of > 0. 7 mm. In vitro: the LL TM fused with the UL TM even before full lid touch due to capillary bridge building. CONCLUSIONS: The central UL overlaps the central LL during spontaneous blinking. This provides the appearance of complete closure. The space that results from the lack of lid margin apposition influences the fusion of the upper and lower TM and ultimately tear film mixing...|$|E
30|$|Depending on {{individual}} spore charges and on relative distances (Fig.  3), electrostatic charged plastic lids of the Petri-dishes may thus differentially attract the also loaded spores. This can then explain why in our experiments mostly only {{parts of the}} total spores released from a fruiting body are directed toward the plastic <b>lids</b> <b>positioned</b> above mushrooms (Table  1) and why with higher distances between lids and mushrooms the number of spores attached to the lids decreased in logarithmic fashion (Fig.  3). Overall charges of spores correlate little with spore sizes and actual spore charges are also independent on spore emission rates from mushrooms (Saar and Salm 2014). This is also reflected in our results on different species as shown in Fig.  3. Spore sizes have in contrast been shown to influence sizes of Buller’s drops, the spore velocity upon ejection from the sterigmata, {{the length of the}} move vertically through a mushroom airspace before being braked (Stolze-Rybczynski et al. 2009; Fischer et al. 2010 a), and the distance of spore deposition from the source (Norros et al. 2014), parameters which appear all be not of primary relevance to the electrostatic attraction and attachment of the spores to plastic lids reported here.|$|R
30|$|We {{concluded}} {{before that}} spore collection in plastic <b>lids</b> <b>positioned</b> above mushrooms with open hymenium depended on their forcible ballistospore discharge mechanism mediated at high humidity by {{the fusion of}} Buller’s drops with liquid films at the adaxial sides of the spores. Gasteroid species have lost this active basidiospore discharge mechanism, produce their basidiospores within closed fruiting bodies and disperse them from openings or cracks passively with wind or through pushing the spore sacs by rain drops (Hibbett et al. 1997; Wilson et al. 2011; Kües and Navarro-Gonzaléz 2015). Accordingly, basidiospores did not accumulate during overnight windstill incubation in evaporating dishes (18 – 24  h) in the plastic lids above mature puffballs (Lycoperdon perlatum, Agaricaceae) which were either already cracked or of which the inner gleba with the basidiospores was opened by cutting the fruiting body into two equal halves. Similarly, there were no spores in lids after 18  h incubation when we positioned two different mature earth-stars (Geastrum rufescens and Geastrum striatum; Geastraceae, Geastrales) with an ostiole as a natural opening and unrolled segments of the exoperidium into windstill evaporating dishes covered by plastic lids. However, when we hit 2 × with caution the spore sacs from the side with a glass rod through the spouts of the evaporating dishes, clouds of spores escaped through the ostioles from the spore sacs {{into the air and}} attached to the plastic lids above (not further shown). We harvested and counted in the lids then 6.9  ×  106 basidiospores of G. rufescens (plating proofed them to be contamination free) and 4.4  ×  106 for G. striatum. We conclude that the spores are moved into the air is decisive for spore attraction to the plastic lids but not the particular initial mode of the spore release.|$|R

Material and methods: This study included 20 patients operated on in the authors&# 39; clinic. The median age of the patients was 24. 5 ± 18. 6 (4 – 73) years and the median follow-up was 9. 3 ± 11. 8 (3 – 43) months. Ten patients operated on with the standard method were labeled Group 1 and ten patients operated on with the new method were labeled Group 2. Without exceeding 4 mm, inferior rectus recession to the whole muscle was performed in Group 1 patients. Inferior rectus recession was also performed on patients in Group 2 following the new method. Using a spatula, approximately 10 % of the muscle surface fibers were detached intact as a thin layer, and the remaining 90 % of deeper fibers were recessed 4 – 8 mm as planned. Patients&# 39; preoperative deviations and lower <b>lid</b> <b>positions</b> were recorded. The same parameters were checked {{in the first and}} third month postoperatively. Both groups were evaluated retrospectively by screening their files, and the Mann–Whitney U test was used for statistical evaluation. Results: Lower lid retraction was seen in four patients of Group 1. There was no retraction in Group 2. While there was a need to perform additional vertical muscle procedures for vertical deviations and lower lid retractions in Group 1, it was observed that {{there was no need for}} additional procedures in Group 2 patients. There was a statistically meaningful difference between the two procedures (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: This novel technique was found to be an effective surgical method for permitting more recession without the risk of lower lid retraction.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} eyelid position on wavefront aberrations. Methods: In study 1, the right eyes of 43 non-cyclopleged subjects were evaluated using the Complete Ophthalmic Analysis System (COAS) aberrometer. In study 2, the right eyes of the 23 cyclopleged subjects were evaluated using the Optical Pathway Difference Scan aberrometer. Measurements were made with wide-open and deliberately narrowed palpebral apertures in these subjects. In study 3, the influence of eyelashes on the COAS output was investigated in 20 subjects by placing artificial eyelashes {{in front of the}} eye, in close proximity to the natural eyelashes. Results: For study 1, the total root mean square (RMS) of the third- and fourth-order aberrations with the wide-open lids was significantly different from the narrowed <b>lid</b> <b>position</b> after the correction for multiple comparisons. There was a difference in the Zernike coefficient of the defocus (C 4), 90 / 180 astigmatism (C 5), vertical coma (C 7) and spherical aberration terms (C 12) between the narrowed and wide-open positions. For study 2, changes were observed with the narrowed <b>lid</b> <b>position</b> in the overall RMS of the third and fourth orders, and total coma aberrations, as well as the specific Zernike coefficients of the C 5 and C 7 terms. However, none of these changes were significant after the multiple comparison correction. The corneal topography also showed remarkable changes in the superior corneal zone. Placing artificial eyelashes in front of the eye significantly affected some Zernike terms and the RMS of the second and fourth orders, and total coma aberrations, for particular pupil sizes. Conclusions: Deliberate narrowing of the palpebral aperture can influence the wavefront aberrations significantly. The corneal curvature distortion in response to eyelid pressure may account for some of the effect on aberration change. Eyelashes interfering with the light path within the pupil zone distort the output from the COAS, causing significant errors. School of Optometr...|$|E

Materials and Methods: Patients with impairment of the natural square-shaped eyelid margin morphology, anterior migration of mucocutaneous junction and mild lid inversion toward the ocular surface were diagnosed as having marginal entropion. Patients with shortened fornices, cicatricial changes or subconjunctival fibrosis were excluded. Demographic characteristics, ophthalmologic examination findings, surgical procedures and follow-up data were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Twelve eyes of 11 patients {{were included in the}} study. Median age was 73 years (range, 49 - 84 years). All cases presented with signs of meibomianitis and were treated preoperatively with oral doxycycline and topical corticosteroids.

METHODS: Prospective observational study including 24 healthy subjects of both genders (age range: 20 - 39 yrs) submitted to instillation of a single drop of 10 % phenylephrine in the upper fornix of one randomly chosen eye. A video camera recorded the images of both eyes before and after eye drop application at 3, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes. The images were digitally processed and edited to analyze lid measurements (upper lid height: distance between the highest upper margin lid point and a horizontal line traced from the medial to the lateral canthus; lower lid height: distance between the lowest margin lid point and the above-mentioned line).

40|$|Purpose - (i) Develop a computer–based {{procedure}} for accurate determination of two–dimensional {{characteristics of the}} anterior eye including the pupil, limbus, and lid aperture from digital images. - (ii) Illustrate the potential application of the {{procedure for}} high–speed filming, wavefront sensing, and {{in a study of}} the palpebral aperture in Caucasians and Asians. Methods - A specialized algorithm was developed. First, a procedure determines the areas of the image where the transition from the iris to the sclera is clearly visible. The limbus outline is then determined by iterative gradient techniques in polar coordinates. Similar techniques are used to establish the pupil outline and its relative position to the limbus. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, images from a standard digital camera, a high–speed camera, and the pupil viewer of a wavefront sensor were used. Many of the images were lacking contrast due to the low level of light during the acquisition. For the purpose of measuring the palpebral aperture, additional lines are drawn from the centers of pupil and limbus to assist the operator in determining the eyelid positions. Images of 25 young Caucasian and 24 Asian eyes were acquired with a digital camera in primary gaze. For each of the images the vertical palpebral aperture was estimated along with the pupil and limbus sizes. Results - (High–speed Filming) We used a high–speed camera with 250 Hz sampling rate. The proposed procedure performed well. However, when the eyelids obscure the pupil during blinking, the algorithm slightly overestimates or underestimates the true pupil size. (Wavefront Sensing) Since the measurement of the wavefront aberration is often performed in scotopic conditions, it is of interest to relate the wavefront measurement back to that of photopic pupil size. However, the pupil size and center changes with illumination so these two parameters are measured relative to the limbus outline. The image from the pupil viewer of the wavefront sensor can be used for this task. Despite the very low intensity of the image, the algorithm can successfully detect the limbus and pupil outlines. (Palpebral Aperture) The average limbus diameter was found to be 12. 16 ± 0. 36 for Caucasians and 11. 7 ± 0. 50 mm for Asians. In the primary gaze, the average vertical palpebral aperture was 10. 99 ± 1. 33 mm and 8. 91 ± 1. 72 mm, respectively.

As the sutures were tied, the distal tarsus advanced over the marginal section, and traction was exerted on the marginal strip of the orbicularis muscle. There were no bolsters or external knots. The pretarsal skin-muscle flap was closed with a 6. 0 plain gut suture. Results: We used this procedure at a tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia from 2013 to 2014. Sixty upper lids of 40 patients (23 women and 17 men) were operated on, with an age range of 44 - 99 years [mean ± standard deviation (SD) = 70. 9 ± 13. 01 years]. Bilateral surgery was performed on 21 patients. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 12 months (mean 3. 0 ± 2. 71 months). Forty percent of the patients (24 lids) had more than 3 months' follow-up. The postoperative <b>lid</b> margin <b>position</b> was good in all cases. Trichiasis (two lashes) was observed in only one patient with unilateral entropion on the medial aspect of the operated lid. Conclusions: The upper lid margin can be effectively rotated through a lid crease incision with internal sutures. The technique combines the main mechanisms of the Wies and Trabut approaches and avoids the use of bolsters or external sutures, which require a second consultation to be removed. Some other lid problems, such as ptosis, retraction, or dermatochalasis, can be concomitantly addressed during the procedure...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} a comprehensive description of upper eyelid movement in normal human subjects. Using the magnetic search coil technique to monitor <b>lid</b> <b>position</b> and modified skin electrodes to record orbicularis oculi electromyographic (EMG) activity, {{the authors found}} that the basic eyelid movements, blinks, and saccadic lid movements, can be uniquely and reliably characterized by their amplitude-maximum velocity relationships. The data show that similar increases in levator palpebrae activity produce the upward lid movements that accompany upward saccadic eye movements {{as well as the}} upward phase of a blink. The lid movements that accompany downward saccadic eye movements arise almost exclusively from the passive downward forces and relaxation of the levator palpebrae muscle. In contrast, active orbicularis oculi contraction and the passive downward forces act together to generate lid closure with a blink. These normative data and techniques provide the basis for the clinical analysis of lid motility by which abnormal lid movements can be compared with normal lid kinematics.

40|$|PURPOSE: Blepharoptosis repair by levator {{advancement}} {{is successful}} in most instances, but the postoperative eyelid level is not uniformly predictable. This study was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} possible effect of epinephrine (from local anesthetic) on eyelid position. METHODS: Seventeen adults with acquired unilateral ptosis {{as a result of}} levator aponeurosis dehiscence underwent levator aponeurosis advancement. The distance between the upper eyelid margin and the central corneal light reflex was measured preoperatively with the patient in both the upright and the supine position, 10 minutes after injection of 1. 0 mL of anesthetic solution (2 % lidocaine with 1 : 100, 000 epinephrine and 12 U hyaluronidase per mL) in the supine position, intraoperatively after skin closure in the supine position, and 1 week or more postoperatively in the upright position. The ptotic lid was positioned intraoperatively in relation to the contralateral unoperated lid according to the change (presumably) induced by epinephrine stimulation of Müller's muscle. RESULTS: Eleven (65 %) of the 17 patients had final postoperative lid positions within 1 mm between eyes. Two patients (12 %) had undercorrection. Four patients (24 %) had overcorrection by > 1 mm. The overcorrected lids were satisfactorily positioned, however, and none required further surgery; in 3 of these 4 patients, the unoperated lid had become ptotic, probably as a result of Hering's law. Differences between operated and unoperated lids and between the different times of measurement were analyzed. Significant changes in <b>lid</b> <b>position</b> occurred in the ptotic lids after injection (mean, + 1. 1 +/- 1. 5 mm; median, + 1. 0 mm; P =. 004) and in the final intraoperative difference between operated and unoperated lids (mean, + 0. 8 +/- 0. 9 mm; median, + 1. 0 mm; P =. 003). The change in the unoperated lid from preoperative upright to preoperative supine was significantly greater in the 6 failures (mean, - 0. 8 +/- 0. 6 mm; median, - 1. 0 mm) than in the 11 successful outcomes (mean, + 0. 1 +/- 0. 8 mm; median, 0. 0 mm; P =. 03). The change in unoperated <b>lid</b> <b>position</b> after injection of the ptotic lid was significantly greater in the failures (mean, + 0. 4 +/- 0. 5 mm; median, + 0. 3 mm) than in the successful cases (mean, - 0. 2 +/- 0. 4 mm; median, 0. 0 mm; P =. 02). CONCLUSION: Although it seems intuitively reasonable and clinically appropriate to account for the stimulatory effect of epinephrine during ptosis surgery, such intraoperative compensation alone did not yield a universally successful outcome in this study...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of dysport injection via a subconjunctival approach {{in the management of}} upper lid retraction at 3 months follow up. Methodology: It is a prospective, non comparative, interventional case series study. It enrolled 22 patients (34 lids) with upper scleral exposure mainly associated with thyroid eye disease who were referred to the ophthalmic department of Ahwaz Imam Khomeini Hospital. A single injection of botulinum toxin A (dysport) was injected into the subconjunctival space at the superior margin of the tarsal plate by conjunctival approach. Main outcome measurements included upper <b>lid</b> <b>position</b> in relation to the upper limbus, patient satisfaction and any complication in the period of the study. Results: All patients experienced some improvement in the amount of lid retraction after injection. The amount of lowering varied between patients and lasted at least 3 months. A lid repositioning acceptable to the patient was obtained in 19 patients (26 lids) one patient had ptosis lasting 3 weeks and one patient had transient diplopia lasting 4 weeks. Conclusion: Subconjuntval injection of dysport provides a safe and effective treatment for upper eyelid retraction associated with thyroid eye disease. It is easy to adminster and is well tolerated by patient with few minor and transient side effects, such as diplopia and ptosis...|$|E
40|$|UNILATERAL neglect {{involves}} a spatial bias {{to one side}} of space, usually to the right. Perceptual and motor systems interact in the manifestation of this disorder, and there is also evidence that motor manipulative responses may have access to unique streams of information not available for non-motoric judgements. It is therefore predicted that the manifestation of neglect may be alterable by changing the purpose of otherwise very similar responses to spatially extended objects. In Experiment 1, neglect-based deviation to the right of centre was significantly less when subjects reached towards metal rods as if to pick them up in the centre, compared to when they pointed to their centres. In Experiment 2, subjects pointed to the centre of a rectangular box with a swivelled lid. They were then asked to place a coin at the centre of this <b>lid,</b> in a <b>position</b> sufficiently central to prevent the lid tilting and the coin falling into the box; in fact, the lid was fixed and subjects never received feedback. Responses were significantly more central with the balancing response than with the pointing one. These results suggest that prehensive movements towards objects allow 'leakage' of information about their spatial extent, via an unaffected stream of information available for motor-manipulative responses...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} the impact of the local item dependence (LID) of testlet items on the performance of the multistage tests (MST) that make pass/fail decisions. In this study, LID is simulated in testlet items. Testlet items are those that physically share the same stimulus. In the MST design, the proportion of testlet items is a manipulated factor. Other studied factors include testlet item <b>position,</b> <b>LID</b> magnitude, and test length. The second {{purpose of this study}} is to use a testlet response model to account for LID in the context of MSTs. The possible gains of using a testlet model against a standard IRT model are evaluated. The results indicate that under the simulated conditions, the testlet item position has a very minimal effect on the precision of ability estimation and decision accuracy, while the item pool structure (the proportion of testlet items), the LID magnitude and test length have fairly substantial effects. Ignoring the LID effects and fitting a unidimensional 3 PL model result in the loss of ability estimation precision and decision accuracy. The ability estimation is adversely impacted by larger proportion of testlet items, the moderate and high LID levels and short test lengths. As the LID condition gets worse (large LID magnitude, or large proportion of testlet items), the decision accuracy rates decrease. Fitting a 3 PL testlet response model does not reach the same level of ability estimation precision under all simulations conditions. In fact, it proves that ignoring LID and fitting the 3 PL model provides inflated ability estimation precision and the accuracy of decision accuracies...|$|R
