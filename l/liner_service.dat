25|$|Patris, {{which had}} served without {{interruption}} on the Greece—Australia service from 1959, {{was assigned to}} a new service in 1972 due to declining passenger numbers, offering a much-shortedned <b>liner</b> <b>service</b> from Singapore to Australia, alongside occasional cruises from Australian ports. A similar fate befell Ellinis in 1973, when she {{was taken off the}} declining UK-Australia <b>liner</b> <b>service</b> and reassigned for cruising on European waters.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to being}} planned for <b>liner</b> <b>service,</b> Hamburg was {{designed}} with spacious cabins, {{most of which}} (306 out of 326) feature full bath-tubs, a feature not found on many ships built since.

25|$|Starting on September 1, 1979, the Skyliner began {{stopping}} at Keisei Narita Station {{once a day}} during the afternoon. This commuter-oriented service was expanded to become the Evening <b>Liner</b> <b>service</b> on December 1, 1984, and the Morning Liner was added on October 19, 1985.

Andes had generous promenade decks, a sun deck with a café, a sports deck, swimming pools, a gymnasium, a cocktail bar and its own orchestra.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 Matson Line offered {{another of}} their ships—the second 1932-built Lurline, {{originally}} named Matsonia {{and a sister}} ship to the Ellinis—for sale in 1970, Chandris Line were quick to purchase the ship. Given a large-scale refit in which particular attention was given to dual usage of the ship in both liner and cruise services, the former Lurline emerged in February 1971 as , joining Ellinis and Australis on the UK—Australia <b>liner</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1947 SCAJAP {{returned}} Hikawa Maru to NYK, which {{despite her}} passenger capacity ran her mostly as a cargo ship until 1953. Her work included general cargo between Japan and the East Coast of the United States, a <b>liner</b> <b>service</b> between Japan and Burma in 1949, and iron ore from Thailand. In the war NYK had lost 172 ships totalling 1.028 million gross tons, {{which may explain}} why the company used an ocean liner for any cargo.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 Bank Line, a {{subsidiary}} of Andrew Weir Shipping Ltd, purchased four SA-15 class ships, Okha, Bratsk, Tiksi and Nikel, for their westbound round-the-world <b>liner</b> <b>service</b> linking Europe to the South Pacific Islands and Papua New Guinea via the Panama and Suez Canals. The ships, no longer required to sail in the arctic conditions, were renamed Speybank, Arunbank, Foylebank and Teignbank and converted in the United Kingdom for the South Pacific service. In 2006 China Navigation Co Ltd, the deep-sea shipping arm of John Swire & Sons Ltd, bought the business from Andrew Weir Shipping. The ships, while still managed by Bank Line, were time chartered, renamed to Mahinabank, Tikeibank, Gazellebank and Boularibank, and sent to Singapore for drydocking and extensive refits. Later the company also chartered two more SA-15 class ships, Anatoliy Kolesnichenko and Vasiliy Burkhanov, but unlike the others they were not rebuilt and retained their Russian identity. However, due to the economic downturn of 2009 the round-the-world cargo <b>liner</b> <b>service</b> was discontinued, the charters were ended, and the four converted SA-15 class ships were returned to their original owner and sold for scrap in late 2009.|$|E
25|$|The new ship, {{eventually}} named Hamburg {{was originally}} planned to operate {{both as an}} ocean liner and as a cruise ship, similarly to RMS Queen Elizabeth 2, under construction at the time. However, by the time Hamburg was delivered in March 1969, German Atlantic Line (as the whole company was known by then) had abandoned <b>liner</b> <b>service</b> and Hamburg was used for full-time cruising. Additionally the first Hanseatic had burnt in September 1966, and instead of replacing her Hamburg now entered service alongside the second Hanseatic that had been purchased from Zim Lines in 1967.|$|E

25|$|The German Atlantic Line {{had been}} without a ship {{since the first}} TS Hanseatic had been {{destroyed}} by fire in New York in September 1966. On 9 November 1967, Shalom was sold to the German Atlantic Line and renamed Hanseatic, becoming the second ship to bear that name. On 16 December 1967, the new Hanseatic set on a crossing from Cuxhaven, Germany, to New York, with only special invited guests on board. After that she was used for cruising around North America and Europe. During 1968, she was also used on transatlantic service, but after that year, German Atlantic decided to abandon <b>liner</b> <b>service</b> and concentrate solely on cruising.|$|E
25|$|With {{the number}} of liner {{passengers}} between Europe and Australia dwindling, the Britanis was taken off <b>liner</b> <b>service</b> and rerouted to full-time cruising in 1975. During the same year the north Australian city of Darwin had been almost completely destroyed in a storm, and Patris found employment as a temporary accommodation ship for {{the residents of the}} destroyed city. This occupation lasted for only a year, after which a radically new use was found for the ship: she was converted into a ro-ro car/passenger ferry and used on services linking Ancona in Italy to Patras and Piraeus in Greece. In 1979 Patris was sold to Karageorgis Lines who retained her in the same service.|$|E
25|$|The Sylvania {{started on}} her maiden voyage from Greenock to Montreal on 5 June 1957. On 26 June 1957 she joined her sisters on their {{northern}} hemisphere summer service from Liverpool to Montreal via Greenock and Québec. By {{the time she}} entered service the growth of passenger numbers in transatlantic <b>liner</b> <b>service</b> had ceased, while the amount of passenger transported by the jet airplane was growing. In 1958 the Saxonia made one crossing from Liverpool to New York via Cobh and Halifax. In April 1961 she was moved permanently to the Liverpool—New York service, replacing the RMS Britannic. At some point during her career with Cunard, the Sylvania also served on the Rotterdam—Southampton—Le Havre—Québec—Montreal -route and winter crossings between Liverpool and Halifax via Greenock.|$|E

25|$|In Winter 1943 Gottlieb Duttweiler and the Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund, Zürich, {{withdrew from}} the {{shipping}} company Maritime Suisse S.A. originally planned to establish the Merchant Marine of Switzerland during World War II. Nevertheless, {{the creation of a}} shipping company with initially three Victory and three Liberty ships, sailing on a regular <b>liner</b> <b>service</b> between the USA and the Mediterranean Sea, never was realized. The shipping company Reederei Zürich AG was founded on 26 July 1951, and immediately two fast freighters were ordered from the shipyard H. C. Stülcken, Hamburg: Adele, named after Duttweiler's wife Adele Duttweiler, and Amelia, named after Göner's wife Amelia Göhner. Each unit was valued to 5,0 Mio. DM without the main engines which were ordered separately from Gebrüder Sulzer, Winterthur, for a total price of 3,75 Mio. CHF. The Swiss government financed 75% of the building costs under the terms, that during a crisis situation, the vessels would be immediately put at the government's disposal. Some of the Swiss parliamentarians, but also Swiss news papers were disturbed about the English prefix SUN {{in the name of a}} Swiss ship, and other were indignant with the charterers. In February 1966 the time charter of SUNADELE with Saguenay was terminated and later sold; SUNAMELIA remained in the Saguenay charter until 31 December 1968 until she was sold in February 1970.|$|E
