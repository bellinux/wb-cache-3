60|$|Although I did {{not think}} that I was dead, I still {{perceived}} quite clearly that I was soon to die. This brought me back to the consideration of Haddon's proceedings. I looked into his mind, and saw that he was afraid of cutting a branch of the portal vein. My attention was distracted from details by the curious changes going on in his mind. His consciousness was like the quivering little spot of light which is thrown by the mirror of a galvanometer. His thoughts ran under it like a stream, some through the focus bright and distinct, some shadowy in the half-light of the edge. Just now the little glow was steady; but the least movement on Mowbray's part, the slightest sound from outside, even a faint difference in the slow movement of the living flesh he was cutting, set the <b>light-spot</b> shivering and spinning. A new sense-impression came rushing up through the flow of thoughts; and lo! the <b>light-spot</b> jerked away towards it, swifter than a frightened fish. It was wonderful to think that upon that unstable, fitful thing depended all the complex motions of the man; that for the next five minutes, therefore, my life hung upon its movements. And he was growing more and more nervous in his work. It was as if a little picture of a cut vein grew brighter, and struggled to oust from his brain another picture of a cut falling short of the mark. He was afraid: his dread of cutting too little was battling with his dread of cutting too far.|$|E

50|$|Dalla octomaculata, the eight-spotted skipper or <b>light-spotted</b> skipper, is {{a species}} of {{butterfly}} in the family Hesperiidae, in the subfamily Heteropterinae, which are sometimes called skipperlings. It is found in Costa Rica and Panama.|$|R
50|$|This conic {{section is}} the {{intersection}} of the cone of light rays with the flat surface. This cone and its conic section change with the seasons, as the Sun's declination changes; hence, sundials that follow the motion of such <b>light-spots</b> or shadow-tips often have different hour-lines for different times of the year. This is seen in shepherd's dials, sundial rings, and vertical gnomons such as obelisks. Alternatively, sundials may change the angle or position (or both) of the gnomon relative to the hour lines, as in the analemmatic dial or the Lambert dial.|$|R
6000|$|Neither, in so capricious inexpressible a Work as this of the Professor's, can our course {{now more}} than {{formerly}} be straightforward, step by step, but at best leap by leap. Significant Indications stand out here and there; which for the critical eye, that looks both widely and narrowly, shape themselves into some ground-scheme of a Whole: to select these with judgment, so that a leap {{from one to the}} other be possible, and (in our old figure) by chaining them together, a passable Bridge be effected: this, as heretofore, continues our only method. Among such <b>light-spots,</b> the following, floating in much wild matter about Perfectibility, has seemed worth clutching at:-- ...|$|R
50|$|In other cases, the hour-lines are not spaced evenly, {{even though}} the shadow rotates uniformly. If the gnomon is not aligned with the {{celestial}} poles, even its shadow will not rotate uniformly, and the hour lines must be corrected accordingly. The rays of light that graze {{the tip of a}} gnomon, or which pass through a small hole, or reflect from a small mirror, trace out a cone aligned with the celestial poles. The corresponding <b>light-spot</b> or shadow-tip, if it falls onto a flat surface, will trace out a conic section, such as a hyperbola, ellipse or (at the North or South Poles) a circle.|$|E
5000|$|Isaac Newton {{developed}} a convenient and inexpensive sundial, {{in which a}} small mirror {{is placed on the}} sill of a south-facing window. [...] The mirror acts like a nodus, casting a single spot of light on the ceiling. Depending on the geographical latitude and time of year, the <b>light-spot</b> follows a conic section, such as the hyperbolae of the pelikonon. If the mirror is parallel to the Earth's equator, and the ceiling is horizontal, then the resulting angles are those of a conventional horizontal sundial. Using the ceiling as a sundial surface exploits unused space, and the dial may be large enough to be very accurate.|$|E
5000|$|According to Matthias Schramm, Alhazen [...] "was {{the first}} to make a {{systematic}} use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that {{the intensity of the}} <b>light-spot</b> formed by the projection of the moonlight through two small apertures onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up." [...] G. J. Toomer expressed some skepticism regarding Schramm's view, arguing that caution is needed to avoid reading anachronistically particular passages in Alhazen's very large body of work, because at the time (1964), his Book of Optics had not yet been fully translated from Arabic. While acknowledging Alhazen's importance in developing experimental techniques, Toomer argued that Alhazen should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers. Toomer does concede that [...] "Schramm sums up Alhazen's achievement in the development of scientific method." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhile saccadic eye {{movements}} produce rapid {{shift of}} images of objects on the retina, the visual world is perceived as stationary (visual stability), but the precise mechanisms involved in such perception remain unclear. We investigated if visual stimuli existing before and/or after a saccade serve to preserve visual stability. Participants observed a vertical array of <b>light-spots</b> flashing consecutively {{at the time of}} horizontal saccades. When total duration of the flashing array was short (38 ms), large distortions of the array were observed. However, as duration increased up to 300 ms, distortion decreased or was completely eliminated. This demonstrated that visual images of a flashing array momentarily perceived before and/or after saccades suppressed illusory distortion of arrays observed when a 38 -ms array was used, implying that the same mechanism may be used to achieve transsaccadic visual stability in daily life...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 11th century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) wrote the Maqala fi daw al-qamar (On the Light of the Moon) {{some time before}} 1021. This was the first attempt {{successful}} at combining mathematical astronomy with physics and the earliest attempt at applying the experimental method to astronomy and astrophysics. He disproved the universally held opinion that the moon reflects sunlight like a mirror and correctly concluded that it [...] "emits light from those portions of its surface which the sun's light strikes." [...] In order to prove that [...] "light is emitted from every point of the moon's illuminated surface," [...] he built an [...] "ingenious experimental device." [...] Ibn al-Haytham had [...] "formulated a clear conception {{of the relationship between}} an ideal mathematical model and the complex of observable phenomena; in particular, {{he was the first to}} make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the <b>light-spot</b> formed by the projection of the moonlight through two small apertures onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up." ...|$|E
50|$|Another type of sundial {{follows the}} motion of a single point of light or shadow, which may be called the nodus. For example, the sundial may follow the sharp tip of a gnomon's shadow, e.g., the shadow-tip of a {{vertical}} obelisk (e.g., the Solarium Augusti) or {{the tip of the}} horizontal marker in a shepherd's dial. Alternatively, sunlight may be allowed to pass through a small hole or reflected from a small (e.g., coin-sized) circular mirror, forming a small spot of light whose position may be followed. In such cases, the rays of light trace out a cone {{over the course of a}} day; when the rays fall on a surface, the path followed is the intersection of the cone with that surface. Most commonly, the receiving surface is a geometrical plane, so that the path of the shadow-tip or <b>light-spot</b> (called declination line) traces out a conic section such as a hyperbola or an ellipse. The collection of hyperbolae was called a pelekonon (axe) by the Greeks, because it resembles a double-bladed ax, narrow in the center (near the noonline) and flaring out at the ends (early morning and late evening hours).There is a simple verification of hyperbolic declination lines on a sundial: the distance from the origin to the equinox line should be equal to harmonic mean of distances from the origin to summer and winter solstice lines.|$|E
40|$|A {{theory of}} the carrier transport, optical emission, and {{photoconductivity}} from optoelectronic devices based on ambipolar long-channel carbon-nanotube (CNT) field-effect transistors (FETs) is presented in this dissertation. In optical emitters based on ambipolar long-channel CNT FETs, an analytic diffusive-transport model for various recombination mechanisms is provided {{for the first time}}. The relationship and the scaling of emitted <b>light-spot</b> size and emitted optical power are clearly depicted {{for the first time as}} well. We also implement a numerical diffusive-transport approach for the light emission, in which the focus is on the effects of radiative and nonradiative recombination in the channel, with the movement of the spatial recombination profile in response to the gate and drain voltages. For the first time, we find that the emitted <b>light-spot</b> size and the emitted optical power depend sensitively on the operative nonradiative recombination mechanisms. We implement a numerical diffusive-transport approach including exciton photogeneration as well for photoconductors based on ambipolar long-channel CNT FETs with uniform and near-field photoexcitation. We show that the photocurrents are typically much smaller than the dark currents, and explain some possible reasons. Moreover, the exciton densities in CNTs are calculated and the effect of exciton diffusion is presented. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Citrin, David S.; Committee Co-Chair: Ruden, P.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new microscopy design that can achieve wide field-of-view (FOV) imaging and yet possesses resolution that is comparable to a conventional microscope. In our design, the sample is illuminated by a holographically projected <b>light-spot</b> grid. We acquire images by translating the sample across the grid and detecting the transmissions. We have built a prototype system with an FOV of 6 mm× 5 mm and acquisition time of 2. 5 s. The resolution is fundamentally limited by the spot size—our demonstrated average FWHM spot diameter was 0. 74 μm. We demonstrate the prototype by imaging a U. S. Air Force target and a lily anther. This technology is scalable and represents a cost-effective way to implement wide FOV microscopy system...|$|E

We also report on nominal-gain and low-gain operations, full- and subwindow read rates, and non-photon-counting modes of operation, all expected {{to be used in}} flight. We derive corrections to the event centroids from the CMOS readout arrays, for different centroid algorithms.

40|$|Advancements in micro-/nano-technology {{have led}} to the {{development}} of micro-manipulators. However, some challenges remain; for instance, the efficiency, precision and flexibility of micro-manipulators restrain their applications. This paper proposes a bio-tweezer system to flexibly manipulate micro-objects with bio-actuation via local light-induced high-concentration microorganisms in two different manipulation modes: <b>light-spot</b> induced mode and geometric shape-induced mode. Depending on the shape of micro-objects, either 2 -dimensional translation or 1 -dimensional rotation can be achieved. Based on the Langevin equation, a mathematical model considering both hydrodynamics and mimicked Brownian motion is proposed to analyze the bio-manipulation performance of the microorganisms; the model was validated by experiments to translate micro-particles in a two-dimensional plane and to rotate a micro-gear structure around its axis. This paper will aid in the development of micro-manipulators and the quantitative understanding of micro-/nano-manipulation actuated by microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} to perform multicolor, wide field-of-view (FOV) fluorescence microscopy imaging {{is important in}} screening and pathology applications. We developed a microscopic slide-imaging system that can achieve multicolor, wide FOV, fluorescence imaging based on the Talbot effect. In this system, a <b>light-spot</b> grid generated by the Talbot effect illuminates the sample. By tilting the excitation beam, the Talbot-focused spot scans across the sample. The images are reconstructed by collecting the fluorescence emissions that correspond to each focused spot with a relay optics arrangement. The prototype system achieved an FOV of 12 × 10 mm^ 2 at an acquisition time as fast as 23 s for one fluorescence channel. The resolution is fundamentally limited by spot size, with a demonstrated full-width at half-maximum spot diameter of 1. 2 μm. The prototype was used to nimage green fluorescent beads, double-stained human breast cancer SK-BR- 3 cells, Giardia lamblia cysts, and the Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts.

40|$|The {{lighting}} {{performances and}} phosphor degradation in field emission lamps (FELs) with two {{different kinds of}} cathode materials—multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and carbon nanocoils (CNCs) —were compared. The MWCNTs and CNCs were selectively synthesized on 304 stainless steel wire substrates dip-coated with nanosized Pd catalysts by controlling the growth temperature in thermal chemical vapor deposition, and the film uniformity can be optimized by adjusting the growth time. FELs were successfully fabricated by assembling these cathode filaments with a glass bulb-type anode. The FEL with the CNC cathode showed much higher lighting uniformity and <b>light-spot</b> density and a lower current at the same voltage than that with the MWCNT cathode filament, and its best luminous efficiency was as high as 75 [*]lm/W at 8 [*]kV. We also found that, for P 22, the phosphor degradation can be effectively suppressed by replacing MWCNTs with CNCs in the cathode, due to the much larger total bright spot area and hence much lower current density loading on the anode...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{simulation}} of a CMOS 8 × 8 single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array is presented. The chip has been fabricated in a 0. 18 ¿m standard CMOS technology and implements a double functionality: measuring the Time-of-Flight {{with the help}} of a pulsed light source; or computing focal-plane statistics in biomedical imaging applications based on a concentrated <b>light-spot.</b> The incorporation of on-chip processing simplifies the interfacing of the array with the host system. The pixel pitch is 32 ¿m, while the diameter of the quasi-circular active area of the SPADs is 12 ¿m. The 113 ¿m 2 active area is surrounded by a T-well guard ring.

40|$|The {{basis for}} this paper was {{initiated}} by observations that were made {{by a group of}} undergraduate students (the co-authors listed above) as part of a coursework exercise in an elective unit (CMPS 2 S 22 "The Information Revolution and its origins") which is taught at the University of East Anglia, Norwich. It concerns a technical problem that must have beset the early operators of cables who used a sensitive galvanometer with a <b>light-spot,</b> so that deflections one way were identified as dots and the other way as dashes. If Morse code had been designed for use on long distance cables, then it would have been balanced, so that the number of dots in an average message would equal the number of dashes. This would generally leave the light spot {{in the middle of the}} screen. But Morse code was not designed this way and the sum of dots generally exceeds the sum of dashes. In the case of the imbalance in Morse code messages, there are linguistic effects, but we may be certain that operators would, with experience, have developed coping strategies, so that the spot did not go off the scale. However, the authors are not aware of any record of such operational procedure...|$|E

DOI can help {{to improve the quality of}} the positron emission tomography images affected by the parallax error. This paper contemplates the computation of DOI based on the standard deviation of the light distribution. The simulations have been carried out by GAMOS. The design of the proposed digital silicon photomultiplier (d-SiPM) with focal plane detection of the center of mass position and dispersion of the scintillation light is presented. The d-SiPM shares the same off-chip time-to-digital converter such that each pixel can be individually connected to it. A miniature d-SiPM 8 × 8 single-photon avalanche-diode (SPAD) array has been fabricated as a proof of concept. The SPADs along each row and column are connected through an OR combination technique. It has 256 × 256 μm 2 without peripherals circuits and pads. The fill factor is about 11 %. The average dark count rate of the mini d-SiPM is of 240 kHz. The average photon detection efficiency is 5 % at 480 nm wavelength, room temperature, and 0. 9 V excess voltage. The dynamic range is of 96 dB. The sensor array features a time resolution of 212 ps.

40|$|AbstractAccurately perceiving the {{activities}} of other people is a crucially important social skill of obvious survival value. Human vision is equipped with highly sensitive mechanisms for recognizing activities performed by others [Johansson, G. (1973). Visual perception of biological motion and a model for its analysis. Perception and Psychophysics, 14, 201; Johansson, G. (1976). Spatio-temporal differentiation and integration in visual motion perception: An experimental and theoretical analysis of calculus-like functions in visual data processing. Psychological Research, 38, 379]. One putative functional role of biological motion perception is to register the presence of biological events anywhere within the visual field, not just within central vision. To assess the salience of biological motion throughout the visual field, we compared the detectability performances of biological motion animations imaged in central vision and in peripheral vision. To compensate for the poorer spatial resolution within the periphery, we spatially magnified the motion tokens defining biological motion. Normal and scrambled biological motion sequences were embedded in motion noise and presented in two successively viewed intervals on each trial (2 AFC). Subjects indicated {{which of the two}} intervals contained normal biological motion. A staircase procedure varied the number of noise dots to produce a criterion level of discrimination performance. For both foveal and peripheral viewing, performance increased but saturated with stimulus size. Foveal and peripheral performance could not be equated by any magnitude of size scaling. Moreover, the inversion effect––superiority of upright over inverted biological motion [Sumi, S. (1984). Upside-down presentation of the Johansson moving <b>light-spot</b> pattern. Perception, 13, 283]––was found only when animations were viewed within the central visual field. Evidently the neural resource responsible for biological motion perception are embodied within neural mechanisms focused on central vision...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Forest associations, {{secondary}} succession, {{and relationships}} of plant communities to Roosevelt elk were investigated. Stratification of vegetation into ecological units {{and an understanding}} of secondary succession by habitat-type were a necessary first step in investigations into browsing of conifers by elk. The study was jointly conducted by the Oregon State Game Commission and the Weyerhaeuser Company. Vegetation, soils, and physiography were studied together. Vegetation cover data, recorded in thirty-two, 275 to 500 -year-old forest stands, formed the basis of a synecological classification. Lightspots are a natural component of these forests. The dense forest and a lightspot were separately sampled in each stand. <b>Light-spot</b> cover data were analyzed separately in an association table. Lightspot data were compared with dense forest data to check validity of the phytosociological classification. This approach increased phytosociological understanding of these forests. The climax dominant tree and shrub and herb layer species with highest cover are used in naming the following associations (in order of increasing xerism) : Thuja/Adiantum-Athyrium Tsuga/Polystichum/Oxalis Tsuga/Acer/Berberis Tsuga-Pseudotsuga/Rhododendron/Berberis Pseudotsuga/Holodiscus/Gaultheria. The exceptions are Adiantum pedatum and Athyrium filix-femina, high constancy, low cover, indicator species, used in naming the Thuja/Adiantum-Athyrium association. Polystichum munitum and Oxalis oregana dominate the herb layer of this association. Associations will be referred to in the abstract by a two-part name. The Adiantum-Athyrium association has the following additional indicator species: Blechnum spicant and Marah oreganus. Stands usually occur near the bottoms of lower elevation canyons. The moist, stony, Slickrock soil series underlies most stands. The Polystichum/Oxalis association is the most widespread and variable community studied. Tiarella trifoliata has high indicator value for this association. The presence of any one of Stellaria crispa, Montia sibirica, Dicentra formosa or Athyrium filix-femina in lightspots effectively differentiates stands of this association from related ones of the Acer/Berberis association. Stands frequently occur on lower and middle slopes and are usually underlain by the Matson or Apt soil series. In the Acer/Berberis association, Acer circinatum has high cover only in lightspots. Most stands are found on the Millicoma or Matson soil series. Stands occur on lower and middle slopes. Stands of the Rhododendron/Berberis association usually occur on south-facing, upper slopes and ridgetops where high winds frequently cause blowdown. The resultant large openings allow regeneration of Pseudotsuga menziesii. Rhododendron macrophyllum has low cover in the dense forest but high cover in lightspots. Allotropa virgata, a low constancy (saprophyte), has high fidelity to the association. The Millicoma, Matson or Ivers soil series underlie most stands. The Holodiscus/Gaultheria association has the following high fidelity species: Philadelphus lewisii, Symphoricarpos mollis, Madia gracilis, Hierochloe occidentalis, Ligusticum apiifolium, and Lonicera hispidula. This is the only association studied in which the lightspot phenomenon was not important. With the exception of Pseudotsuga menziesii regeneration, understory vegetation did not increase in cover when the tree canopy was removed. Stands usually occur on south-facing, upper slopes and ridgetops. The Digger or Agony soil series are associated with most stands. The successional influence of soil-surface disturbance caused by logging was studied in 1 to 15 -year-old stands of the Polystichum/Oxalis and Rhododendron/Berberis habitat-types. In the Polystichum/Oxalis habitat-type, the vegetative dominants by years since logging are: Senecio sylvaticus [...] first year; Deschampsia elongata [...] years 2 to 4; Aira caryophyllea, Rubus ursinus, Hypochaeris radicata and Crepis capillaris share dominance [...] years 5 to 9; Hypochaeris radicata and Pteridium aquilinum share dominance [...] years 10 to 15. Pseudotsuga menziesii increased to 16 percent cover in the 10 to 15 -year period. Disturbed areas of the Rhododendron/Berberis habitat-type have more than 65 percent bare ground for two years after logging. The vegetation dominants by years are: Deschampsia elongata [...] years 3 to 4; Hypochaeris radicata and Rubus ursinus [...] years 5 to 7; and Pseudotsuga menziesii [...] years 8 to 15. Other high cover species in the 8 to 15 -year period are Thermopsis montana, Rubus ursinus, and Pteridium aquilinum. Selected stages in secondary succession were studied from one year after logging to climax in the two most important habitat-types. In the Polystichum/Oxalis habitat-type, Pseudotsuga menziesii is the seral tree dominant but is replaced by Tsuga heterophylla in climax. The tall shrub Acer circinatum has high cover in those serai stages with a comparatively open tree canopy. The herb layer is dominated throughout secondary succession by Polystichum munitum and Oxalis oregana. The tree layer of serai stands of the Rhododendron/Berberis habitat-type is dominated by Pseudotsuga menziesii. Either Tsuga heterophylla or Pseudotsuga menziesii dominate near-climax stands. The shrub layer dominant is Rhododendron macrophyllum throughout secondary succession. It has low cover in the dense forest but high cover in lightspots of near-climax stands. Berberis nervosa has nearly constant coverage throughout secondary succession in the Rhododendron/Berberis habitat-type and is the herb layer dominant in near-climax stands. Herb layer dominants in early serai stages are: Senecio sylvaticus [...] year 1; Erechtites prenanthoides [...] year 2; Rubus ursinus and Gaultheria shallon [...] years 4 - 15. Classification and recognition of habitat-types are possible throughout secondary succession from logging to climax {{on the basis of the}} same indicator species. The dominance level of some species changes with seral stage, but the change is predictable. Preferred elk food is about twice as abundant in the Polystichum/Oxalis as the Rhododendron/Berberis habitat-type. Nutritious, preferred elk food is most available in the 4 to 9 -year period of secondary succession. Present logging methods which leave a mosaic of intermingled disturbed and undisturbed areas create a habitat beneficial to elk. The animals forage on disturbed areas for preferred invader species and on adjacent undisturbed areas for forest remnant species...|$|E
