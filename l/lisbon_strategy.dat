After briefly setting out the framework for economic policy coordination established since Maastricht, it sheds light on the <b>Lisbon</b> <b>strategy’s</b> problem-laden legacy for the Europe 2020 strategy (2011 - 2020) : the issues of non-binding member state commitment to an EU-wide reform agenda, and of member state failure to create sufficient ownership of reform. The article then examines the workings of the Europe 2020 strategy – the EU’s economic and institutional modernisation strategy for the current decade – with regard to structural reform especially in the Eurozone. It addresses the question of the effectiveness of the European semester process in light of the sovereign debt crisis.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>Lisbon</b> <b>Strategy's</b> {{guidelines}} transformed {{education and}} training into unavoidable economic and social priorities. These guidelines also revealed that some European countries were far from achieving the minimum baseline for their inclusion in new knowledge economies and guaranteeing the sustainability of the lifelong learning processes implemented. In this context, a broad priority education program started developing in Portugal (TEIP Program), aimed at recovery from a significant educational lag and fulfilling the European guidelines that maintain that all citizens must develop skills and competencies towards their employability and foster further learning, active citizenship and intercultural dialogue. Throughout the communication we will present our analysis and reflections about the program's dynamics and results, mainly through methodologies of a quantitative nature (education statistics, national examinations results). Reflections will be complemented by information gathered from interviews with key actors in the TEIP program (educational administration offices’ program coordinators; program consultants; school directors) {{where some of the}} core strategies and change processes harnessed are identified. Data points to a reduction in school failure and school dropout rates in TEIP schools. However, significant differences still persist when comparing TEIP results and national results, proving that an important path must yet be taken in Portugal in order to ensure a quality inclusive education...|$|R

500|$|Orban {{told the}} Committee that the {{multilingual}} {{dimension of the}} EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes {{and should not be}} seen as a separate, isolated policy. He stated that, [...] "Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the internal market: culture, education and competitiveness." [...] In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, [...] "At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [...] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism." [...] According to Orban, multilingualism promotes labour mobility, tolerance and a sense of European citizenship and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy. Within the <b>Lisbon</b> <b>strategy,</b> the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient. To address this, Orban aims to improve language teaching and to make the media and new communication technologies more language-friendly. He underlined that, [...] "our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Turkish and Russian." [...] He added that, [...] "The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a general objective of the new programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union {{as well as to the}} languages of the EU's main trading partners." [...] Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against discrimination on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, [...] "Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted," [...] which presumably includes all languages, national, regional, minority and migrant. However, Orban agreed that the protection of language rights was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, [...] "When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States." ...|$|E

Instead, he urged the EU to reform the Pact to encourage growth, and to seek the reorientation of the €100 billionn annual EU budget towards research and innovation. By 2005, he had successfully pushed for an agreement on sweeping plans to rewrite the Pact, which now allowed EU members with deficits above the original 3 per cent of GDP limit to cite the costs of [...] "the reunification of Europe" [...] as a mitigating factor.|$|E

Innovative researchers are therefore essential to the achievement of this. Growth, in this policy discourse, refers not to purely economic measures, such as GDP, but to the more recently developed benchmarks associated with happiness and well-being. This illustrates {{the extent to which the}} knowledge of the psy- disciplines has become central to our self-understanding. The professional development guidance and devices made available to the researcher provide strategies derived from psychology for identifying and overcoming weaknesses and address her in a variety of aspirational ways, e. g. as balanced, leading, creative. This does not ignore less attractive, more mundane aspects of the life of the researcher – tiredness, stress, not feeling at home in the university today – but rather treats them as weaknesses to be overcome by resort to psychological strategies. This paper takes each of these in turn to consider them not as conditions to be overcome by means of psychological strategies but as responses to conditions that open up a space for thinking otherwise about how we live with and respond to our conditions (as researchers). It is suggested that to deny them and treat as aspects of ourselves that we can master effects a desubjectivation, while addressing the individual as researcher produces a new mode of subjectivation...|$|R

40|$|The {{investment}} on key-competences in last years was one crucial European strategy {{to face the}} new challenges of the knowledge society and of the digital convergence and to guarantee the active citizenship and social inclusion. The first answer has been given in Lisbon 2000 ’s, when eight main objectives have been presented; they were focused on the improvement of basic and "soft" skills in educational paths of the main agencies (i. e. school and family). Hence, the digital competence, included in <b>Lisbon</b> <b>strategies,</b> can be interpreted in a double meaning: as basic skill (focused on the digital literacy) as soft skill (focused on the digital learning). Starting from here, this proposal will construct a theoretical description of the digital competence and its impact to cognitive processes of the children, considering the influence and the strategies applied by agencies of the social capital, especially the family. This issue will be analysed through the re-reading the capabilities approach by Sen and Nussbaum (2011), according two perspectives: 1. the first is psyco-cognitive connected {{to the development of}} digital competences during the learning process of children; 2. the second is focused on the relational and communicative styles of their socializing agencies. In the digital skills, the generation gap is more evident: the youngsters acquire the digital literacy through their experiences; however their digital knowledge is often technical and linguistic, while it isn’t a lot oriented to the metacognition of the digital media, such as the critical thinking or the creativity; on the other side, the educators don’t have the same familiarity with media and for this reason they not always understand needs, values and references of youngsters. The consumption styles of parents, their prejudices and their competences influence the relationship of children with media starting from their first digital experience, with social and cognitive consequences...|$|R

A summary of relevant early school leaving statistics and research studies which describe the situation in Austria is presented.

The conclusion critically sums up the following relevant results: although many of the policies recommended by the EU have been implemented in Austria, many preventive measures are also still outstanding. These include, for example, the continued lack of (tertiary level) training for kindergarten teachers and the failure to introduce comprehensive schools. The call for the latter was not met by Austrias' introduction of so-called new middle schools, a workaround which has not led to a reduction in social inequalities in educational pathways.
