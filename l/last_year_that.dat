While studying Politics, Philosophy, and Economics at Oxford, he commuted to Italy to play professional basketball for Olimpia Milano during the 1965–66 season, where the team won a European Champions Cup (predecessor to the modern EuroLeague).|$|E
5|$|Federal {{examiners}} had {{the authority}} to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E
