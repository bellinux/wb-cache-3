40|$|Fifteen pigeons {{were exposed}} to either response-independent or response-dependent {{schedules}} of water reinforcement, whereby water was injected directly into the unrestrained pigeons' mandibles. Key-contact responses were released by a <b>lighted</b> <b>key</b> correlated with water, but not by a <b>lighted</b> <b>key</b> uncorrelated with water. A negative response-reinforcer contingency suppressed autoshaped key-contact responses, resulting in responding directed away from the <b>lighted</b> <b>key.</b> In all pigeons, water injected directly into the mandibles elicited a consummatory fixed-action pattern of “mumbling” and swallowing. The <b>lighted</b> <b>key</b> correlated with water released a broader set of both appetitive and consummatory responses: approach to the <b>lighted</b> <b>key,</b> “bowing”, “rooting”, “mumbling”, and swallowing. Key-contact responses were “rooting” and “mumbling” motions of the beak {{on the surface of}} the key. Views of autoshaping based on stimulus substitution or stimulus surrogation do not fully explain the origin of autoshaped responses not previously elicited by the reinforcer. The present findings are consonant with views of conditioning that emphasize the large degree of biological pre-organization in conditioned response patterns, and the importance of associative factors in the control of such patterns...|$|R

5000|$|Breath of Fire {{takes place}} in an unnamed medieval world. In {{addition}} to ordinary humans, it is populated by various [...] "clans" [...] of anthropomorphic animals. The Dragon Clan—a race of humans {{who are able to}} transform into dragons—differ from the others in that their members appear (for the most part) to be human. The back-story of the game is summarized during its prologue: Thousands of years ago, a goddess named Myria (also known as [...] "Tyr" [...] and [...] "Maria" [...] in some English translations and [...] "Miria" [...] in Breath of Fire II) sowed discord amongst the Dragon Clan by offering to grant any wish. Feuding over the goddess' favor eventually split the Clan into two feuding sides, the Light Dragons and the Dark Dragons, who engaged in a war. Myria encouraged the fighting and watched the war escalate. Just as the world was on the brink of destruction, the [...] "Goddess War" [...] ended when a heroic Light Dragon imprisoned Myria and sealed her away using six keys. Each key has a unique magical property which affects the surrounding landscape; the <b>Light</b> <b>Key</b> is hidden in the port town of Auria, providing boundless prosperity for its residents. Alternatively, the Dark Key resides near the slums of Bleak, accounting for that town's perpetual darkness.|$|E

At Auria, the trio are mistaken for thieves and arrested, but Karn, a thief they meet inside their cell, frees them. They meet Karn again inside a tomb in the desert, and when they recover a tome {{containing}} thieving secrets, he joins the team. Back at Auria, the party discovers that the Dark Dragons have blackmailed the town's richest resident into surrendering the <b>Light</b> <b>Key.</b> They manage to foil this plot, however, by claiming the Dark Key and the Mirror from a tower near the thieves' town of Bleak and using the Mirror to allow the rich man's wife to communicate with him from beyond the grave. Unfortunately, the Dark Dragons then resort to more aggressive tactics and sink the ship the party planned to board. The captain {{of the ship and}} the gold digging merchant Gobi approach the group with a plan to obtain a new ship. Their new ship is sunk as well, though, stranding them on a desert island. In order for the party to continue their quest, they must rely on Gobi.

The feed to the crude distillation column {{was assumed to be}} crude oil containing naphtha gas, kerosene, petrol and diesel as the light-light key, <b>light</b> <b>key,</b> heavy key and heavy-heavy key respectively. The models determined maximum concentrations of heavy key in the distillate and <b>light</b> <b>key</b> in the bottom for limited feed stock and market condition. Both were impurities in their respective positions of the column. The limiting constraints were sales specification concentration of <b>light</b> <b>key</b> in the distillate [ ], heavy key in the bottom [ ] and an operating loading constraint of flooding above the feed tray. For unlimited feed stock and market condition, the optimization models determined the optimum separation [ and ] and feed flow rate that would give maximum profit with minimum purity sales specification constraints of <b>light</b> <b>key</b> in the distillate and heavy key in the bottom as stated above. The feed loading was limited by the reboiler capacity.
