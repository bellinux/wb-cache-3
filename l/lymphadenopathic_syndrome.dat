40|$|Using {{monoclonal}} antibodies against CD 2, CD 4, CD 8 and CD 19 antigens and {{an automated}} biotin-avidin immunoperoxidase technique on whole blood samples, we evaluated the technical performance and clinical usefulness of lymphocyte subset counting by the routine hematology analyzer Technicon H* 1. Statistical evaluation demonstrated excellent precision and very good correlation with the immunofluorimetric flow cytometer Ortho Spectrum III. Correlation between manual immunofluorescence at the microscope and the H* 1 method was much poorer, {{owing to the}} high intrinsic imprecision of the manual method. Reference ranges obtained with the H* 1 immunoperoxidase method in 44 healthy subjects closely matched those obtained with the Spectrum III. In 46 subjects with or at risk for HIV infection, we found with the H* 1 method {{a significant decrease in}} CD 4 + cells and in the CD 4 +/CD 8 + cell ratio, which was progressively more marked in HIV- negative patients with <b>lymphadenopathic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> AIDS-related complex, and in patients with full-blown AIDS...|$|E
