5|$|Subsistence crops {{grown in}} the country include matoke (green bananas), which occupy {{more than a third}} of the country's farmland, potatoes, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, wheat and maize. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and {{volcanic}} soils providing favourable conditions. Reports, have established that more than 400,000 Rwandans, make their living from coffee plantation. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts in their prices. Animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation in the numbers of each. Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive dairy farms around Kigali. Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output. Fishing takes place on the country's lakes, but stocks are very depleted, and <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} {{shock of the}} common torpedo can be severe, but is not life-threatening. In classical antiquity, the electrogenic properties of this species led it (and other strongly electric fishes) {{to be used in}} medicine for the treatment of pain and diseases such as gout. For example, the Roman physician Scribonius Largus, in his Compositiones medicae (c. 50 AD), recommended that chronic headaches be treated by the application of a live torpedo to the affected area. The common torpedo is edible, but is little-valued by commercial or artisanal fisheries and is mostly discarded when caught. Because of its shallow-water habits, it may survive being captured and discarded relatively well. It is susceptible to several types of demersal fishing gear, including bottom trawls and trammel nets; fishing activity is heavy within its range but no specific data regarding this species are available. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient. The common torpedo has been kept in aquariums, but requires <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> for food.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the parasite load in populations of Heterobranchus longifilis obtained from a cultured environment (pond) and wild habitats. One hundred and twenty fishes were used for the study; 60 each from the cultured environment and wild which were further divided into 30 dead and 30 <b>live</b> <b>fishes</b> for each of the habitat sources. The results showed that 80 % of dead H. longifilis from the pond were infested, as against 73. 3 % of the dead fishes from the wild by different protozoan parasites. Also, 83. 3 % of live H. longifilis from the pond were infested, as against 90 % of the <b>live</b> <b>fishes</b> from the wild. Of the various protozoan parasites observed, I. mutifilis was the most abundant in both the pond (37. 41 %) and wild (36. 40 %). Among the body parts of the sampled fishes from the pond, the gills had the highest parasite load (46 %). Also, the gills had the highest parasite load (44 %) among the body parts of the fishes sampled from the wild. <b>Live</b> <b>fishes</b> from both sources had more protozoan parasites than the dead fishes. Bigger fishes of total length between 25 - 48 cm were more infected than smaller fishes of total length between 19 - 24 cm from both sources.

They have been observed to wash objects, raccoon-style. <b>Live</b> <b>fish</b> are readily taken, with full submergence of the head, and the fish were usually carried at least two meters away, suggesting a feeding strategy to avoid letting aquatic prey escape back into water. Captive specimens show much greater interest in potential prey in the water than on dry land, suggesting a strong preference for riverine hunting in their natural habitat. Their morphological specialization suggest that their diet is mostly composed of fish, but they are reported to hunt for frogs, and are thought to catch crustaceans.

25|$|Many {{countries}} have banned {{the use of}} <b>live</b> <b>fish</b> for bait, but pike can be caught with dead fish, which they locate by smell.

Baitfish can be used as groundbait, but also below a float carried by the wind. This method is often used in wintertime and best done in lakes near schools of preyfish or at the deeper parts of shallow water bodies, where pike and preyfish tend to gather in great numbers.|$|E

Due to their dietary habits, bald eagles are frequently viewed in a negative light by humans. Thanks to their superior foraging ability and experience, adults are generally more likely to hunt live prey than immature eagles, which often obtain their food from scavenging. They are not very selective about the condition or origin, whether provided by humans, other animals, auto accidents or natural causes, of a carcass's presence, but will avoid eating carrion where disturbances from humans are a regular occurrence. They will scavenge carcasses up {{to the size of}} whales, though carcasses of ungulates and large fish are seemingly preferred. Bald eagles also may sometimes feed on material scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps (dump usage is habitual mainly in Alaska).|$|E
