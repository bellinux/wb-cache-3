30|$|Complete {{evaluation}} of HFZ standards distribution within {{urban and rural}} girls and girls <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flat or a house is presented in Fig.  2. We found that 69.1  % of girls <b>living</b> <b>in</b> urban areas, 63.3  % of girls <b>living</b> <b>in</b> rural areas, 67.8  % of girls <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flat and 65.3  % of girls <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> house met HFZ standards.|$|R
30|$|Results {{point to}} minor {{differences}} {{in the level of}} abdominal strength and endurance between urban and rural students and students <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flat or a house. Urban students performed better than those <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rural area (1.5  %) as well as students <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flat than students <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> house (2.5  %). Statistical analysis showed that there is no relationship between the distribution of HFZ standards and residence area or housing type in both males and females.|$|R
30|$|Results {{suggest that}} about 23 % of the {{population}} belonging to multidimensional poor households and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment had experienced short-term morbidities <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reference period of 30  days compared to 20 % {{of the population}} belonging to multidimensional non-poor households and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment, 19 % of the population belonging to multidimensional poor households and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment and 15 % of the population belonging to multidimensional non-poor households and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment. Controlling for socioeconomic covariates, the odds of short-term morbidity was 1.47 [CI 1.40 – 1.53] among the multidimensional poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment, 1.28 [CI 1.21 – 1.37] among the multidimensional non-poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment and 1.21 [CI 1.64 – 1.28] among the multidimensional poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment compared to the multidimensional non-poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment. Results are robust across states and hold good {{for each of the}} three morbidities: fever, cough and diarrhoea. This establishes that along with poverty, household environmental conditions have a significant bearing on short-term morbidities in India. Public investment in sanitation, drinking water and cooking fuel can reduce the morbidity and improve the health of the population.|$|R
5|$|During the Norman reign, several {{different}} religious communities coexisted in the Kingdom of Sicily. They were: Latin Christians (Roman Catholics), Greek-speaking Christians (Eastern Orthodox), Muslims and Jews. Although local religious practices were not interrupted, {{the fact that}} Latin Christians were in power tended to favor Latin Christianity (Roman Catholicism). Bishops of the Eastern Orthodox rite were obliged to recognize {{the claims of the}} Latin Church in Sicily, while Muslim communities were no longer ruled by local emirs. Greek-speaking Christians, Latin Christians, and Muslims interacted on a regular basis, and were involved in each other's lives, economically, linguistically, and culturally. Some intermarried. Christians <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> Arabic-speaking area might adopt Arabic or even Muslim names. In many cities, each religious community had its own administrative and judicial order. In Palermo, Muslims were allowed to publicly call for prayer in mosques, and their legal issues were settled by qadis, judges who ruled in accordance with Islamic law.|$|E
5|$|Parenting style {{seems to}} have no major effect, {{although}} people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents. Childhood trauma, death of a parent, and being bullied or abused increase the risk of psychosis. <b>Living</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two, even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of social group. Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity, racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and poor housing conditions.|$|E
5|$|While living indoors {{decreases}} {{the risk of}} contracting certain diseases, living in close quarters with other rats, being unable to always seek proper protection from environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity), being fed an unhealthy diet, and the stresses inherently associated with <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unnatural habitat can all adversely affect a rat's health {{to make them more}} prone to specific conditions. Specifically, Tyzzer's disease, protozoic infections (e.g. Giardia muris), and pseudotuberculosis are usually seen in stressed or young rats. Additionally, pet rats are exposed to Streptococcus pneumoniae, a zoonotic disease caught from humans, not the same bacteria associated with strep throat. A human-associated fungus, Pneumocystis carinii (also found in almost all domesticated animals) is usually asymptomatic in the rat, unless the rat's immune system is compromised by illness. If this occurs the infection can develop into pneumonia.|$|E

30|$|The {{prevalence}} of diarrhoea (Table  2) {{in the month}} preceding the survey was higher in Madhya Pradesh (5.6 %) followed by Uttar Pradesh (4.8 %) and Chhattisgarh (3.6 %). On the other hand, the {{prevalence of}} diarrhoea was lowest {{in the state of}} Kerala (1.3 %). In Uttar Pradesh, among the multidimensional poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment, the prevalence of diarrhoea was 6.7 % compared to 3.8 % among the multidimensional non-poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment and 3.5 % each among the multidimensional poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment and the multidimensional non-poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment. Also, in eight states (Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka), it was higher among the multidimensional non-poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment. In five states, the prevalence of diarrhoea was higher among the multidimensional poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment, and in majority of the states (13 major states), the prevalence of diarrhoea was lowest among the multidimensional non-poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment.|$|R

5|$|In the Pokémon anime, the Saffron City Gym Leader, Sabrina owns an Abra, {{which she}} sends {{out in a}} battle against the series protagonist, Ash. After battling, Sabrina's Abra evolves into Kadabra, causing Ash to forfeit the match due to Kadabra's new and more {{powerful}} psychic abilities. Ash later returns for a rematch, and Ash's Haunter makes Sabrina laugh, which causes Kadabra to also laugh due to the psychic bond it has with Sabrina. Because of Kadabra and Sabrina's laughter, {{they are unable to}} fight, and hand over the gym badge. Abra later appears in the series under the ownership of Mira, who offers to teleport everyone to Hearthome city using her Abra, but instead teleports them to a flooded city to find a Poké Ball containing a Sandshrew that was lost in the newly flooded lake. One of Abra and Kadabra's other appearances is <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> abandoned mining colony with several other Psychic-type Pokémon. Alakazam's first appearance was as a giant Alakazam awakened near the site of the Pokémopolis ruins. Alakazam has also been owned by many notable trainers, such as Luana, the Gym Leader of Kumquat Island, Eusine, Anabel, and Kenny.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after first}} developing, one oil company {{evacuated}} its oil rigs off of Texas and Louisiana by helicopter, {{with several other}} companies beginning to evacuate unneeded workers. Ultimately, 7,000 oil workers were removed from offshore oil platforms. The threat of the developing disturbance prompted officials to close a state park in southern Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along the northern Gulf Coast to remain at port. Initially, Anita was predicted to continue tracking west-northwestward and make landfall near the Texas/Louisiana border. As a result, schools in Cameron Parish, Louisiana were closed, and on August 30 a hurricane watch was issued for the southwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas coastlines. After the track shifted further to the south, the watch was replaced with a hurricane warning between Brownsville and just south of Corpus Christi, Texas. An emergency shelter was opened in Brownwood, Texas, and Army trucks were prepared to assist in evacuations. An official from the National Weather Service recommended evacuation for all residents east of Galveston, Texas <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area below 5 feet (1.5 m) above sea level; about 20,000 left Cameron, Louisiana. In all, about 58,000 people evacuated coastal locations in Louisiana and Texas.|$|E
5|$|The boomtown of Chadderton {{reached its}} {{industrial}} zenith in the 1910s, with over 50cotton mills within the town limits. A social {{consequence of this}} industrial growth was a densely populated metropolitan landscape, home to an extensive and enlarged working class community <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> urban sprawl of low quality terraced houses. However, Chadderton developed an abundance of civic institutions including public street lighting, Carnegie library, public swimming baths and council with its own town hall. The development of the town meant that the district council made initial steps to petition the Crown for honorific borough status for Chadderton in the 1930s. However, the Great Depression, and the First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns and textile goods increased during the mid-20th century, Chadderton's textile sector declined to a halt; cotton spinning reduced dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s and by 1997 only two mills were operational. In spite of efforts {{to increase the efficiency}} and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton was spun in the town in 1998. Many of the redundant mills have now been demolished. Non-textile based industries continued on throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, particularly in the form of aircraft and chemical manufacture at plants in south Chadderton and Foxdenton respectively.|$|E

Poverty is measured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> multidimensional framework that includes the dimensions of education, health and income, while household environmental deprivation is defined as lack of access to improved sanitation, drinking water and cooking fuel. A composite index combining multidimensional poverty and household environmental deprivation has been computed, and households are classified as follows: multidimensional poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment, multidimensional non-poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor household environment, multidimensional poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment and multidimensional non-poor and <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good household environment.|$|R
