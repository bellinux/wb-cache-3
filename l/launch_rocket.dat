5|$|As {{part of the}} Army's {{modernization}} {{effort in}} the 1980s corps units introduced new organizations and equipment including the M1 Abrams tank, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, AH-64 Apache helicopter, Multiple <b>Launch</b> <b>Rocket</b> System, and Mobile Subscriber Equipment. In 1987, III Corps also conducted the largest deployment of forces to Germany since the Second World War, Exercise Reforger '87. During this time, the corps began assisting in the training and support of active and reserve component units. This support involves training guidance, resources, {{and the maintenance of}} relationships that extend to wartime affiliations.|$|E
5|$|The {{success and}} economy of {{multiple}} rocket launchers (MRL) have {{led them to}} continue to be developed. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union fielded several models of Katyusha-like MRL, notably the BM-21 launchers somewhat inspired by the earlier weapon, and the larger BM-27. Advances in artillery munitions have been applied to some Katyusha-type multiple <b>launch</b> <b>rocket</b> systems, including bomblet submunitions, remotely deployed land mines, and chemical warheads.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear Strike is a helicopter-based shooter {{game with}} a blend of both {{strategy}} and action, which the player views from outside the helicopter from an overhead perspective. It is similar to previous games in the series, but has 15 playable vehicles, a larger number than any of its predecessors. The main helicopter is a fictional Super Apache, with additional helicopters including the Cobra and other Hueys. Playable jets include the Harrier Jump Jet and a fictional V/STOL version of the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The player can use surface vehicles including the M1 Abrams tank, Bradley armoured vehicle, the Multiple <b>Launch</b> <b>Rocket</b> System and a PACV hovercraft.|$|E

5|$|The final {{attack on}} 28 February also {{began with a}} mortar attack, but the {{communist}} assault wave was broken up by mortar fire, {{and was forced to}} withdraw to the east. Three Americans were wounded. A clearing patrol later revealed that the Viet Cong had inserted a mortar team {{to the edge of the}} rubber trees by night in a Lambretta and a cart and had then manhandled the tubes into position. 3 RAR's defence of FSB Andersen was the first occasion in the history of their operations in Vietnam that an Australian fire support base had been subjected to a ground assault while during all three attacks the cavalry and artillery in support had played a key role in the defence. Throughout the later part of the operation the patrolling rifle companies had systematically searched the AO and although contact was infrequent the patrols had been effective in denying the subsequent use of the area to <b>launch</b> <b>rocket</b> attacks against the bases in Long Binh and Bien Hoa.|$|E

25|$|Although the Soviet Union's {{position}} in the crisis was as helpless as was the United States' regarding Hungary's uprising, Premier Nikolai Bulganin threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side, and to <b>launch</b> <b>rocket</b> attacks on Britain, France and Israel.

Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin was planning to go to Israel next week to forge {{an agreement with the}} prospective suppliers. “If you have an agreement this would hasten the procurement process, say in three to six months you would already have the weapons.

Air defence is provided using a mix of Swiss Oerlikon twin 35mm and Swedish Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft artillery and missile systems such as the Jernas and Starburst from the UK, Anza from Pakistan, FN-6 from China and Igla from Russia. Malaysia committed to purchase Starstreak V-Shorads missiles from the UK in 2015.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{ground forces}} {{included}} a battalion from the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. The unit was deployed in March 1999 to Albania {{in support of}} the bombing campaign where the battalion secured the Tirana airfield, Apache helicopter refueling sites, established a forward-operating base to prepare for Multiple <b>Launch</b> <b>Rocket</b> System (MLRS) strikes and offensive ground operations, and deployed a small team with an AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar system to the Albania/Kosovo border where it acquired targets for allied/NATO air strikes. Immediately after the bombing campaign, the battalion was refitted back at Tirana airfield and issued orders to move into Kosovo as the initial entry force in support of Operation Joint Guardian.|$|E

25|$|With the {{reduction}} {{of the size of the}} ROC armed forces in recent years, the Army has endured the largest number of cutbacks as ROC military doctrine has begun to emphasize the importance of offshore engagement with the Navy and Air Force. Subsequent to this shift in emphasis, the ROC Navy and Air Force have taken precedence over the ROC Army in defense doctrine and weapons procurement. Recent short-term goals in the Army include acquisition and development of joint command and control systems, advanced attack helicopters and armored vehicles, Multiple <b>Launch</b> <b>Rocket</b> System and field air defense systems. The Army is also in the process of transitioning to an all volunteer force.|$|E
500|$|The {{army has}} three main {{artillery}} systems: the Multi <b>Launch</b> <b>Rocket</b> System (MLRS), the AS-90 and the L118 light gun. The MLRS, first used in Operation Granby, has a [...] range. The AS-90 is a 155mm self-propelled armoured gun with a [...] range. The L118 light gun is a 105mm towed gun used {{in support of}} 16 Air Assault Brigade, 3 Commando Brigade of the Royal Marines and the Adaptive Force. To identify artillery targets, the army operates weapon locators such as the MAMBA Radar and utilises artillery sound ranging. For air defence it uses the Short-Range Air Defence (SHORAD) Rapier FSC missile system, widely deployed since the Falklands War, and the Very Short-Range Air Defence (VSHORAD) Starstreak HVM (high-velocity missile) launched by a single soldier or from a vehicle-mounted launcher.|$|E
