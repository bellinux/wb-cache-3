40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. As <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cryocoolers are miniaturized, {{boundary}} layer {{effects in the}} <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> may become more important than they are for larger refrigerators. Nearly uniform flow in the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> is necessary for efficient cooling, and this condition is compromised as the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> diameter becomes smaller relative to the thermal and viscous {{boundary layer}} thicknesses. As a result, miniature <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cryocoolers are likely to experience enhanced acoustic streaming losses compared to larger PTC’s. This acoustic streaming results from thermal and viscous interactions between the working fluid and the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> walls. The thermal and viscous penetration depths and their magnitudes relative to the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> diameter and wall thickness are therefore important parameters for this phenomenon. A parametric study {{of the effects of}} the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> diameter, scaled to a non-dimensional value by the relevant boundary layer thicknesses, on acoustic streaming in the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> was performed using CFD modeling. The effect of the operating frequency was also considered through the frequency dependence of the viscous and thermal penetration depths. Temperature dependant material properties were included in the CFD models because they play an important role in acoustic streaming. Results indicated that close attention must be paid to the sizes of the boundary layers relative to the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> physical dimensions when designing miniature <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cryocoolers...|$|R

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Multistage <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cryocoolers require {{separate}} {{phase shifters}} for each stage. For sufficiently high frequency and acoustic power, the inertance tube {{is commonly used}} for such phase shifting. For Stirling-type, multistage <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cryocoolers, the warm end of the coldest <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> is often heat sunk to the cold end of a warmer stage rather than at room temperature to improve the figure of merit for the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> and/or to achieve a larger phase shift with a cold inertance tube. The use of a secondary <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> or regenerator between the main <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> and a phase shifter allows the phase shifter to operate at room temperature where space is more readily available. It also allows {{for the use of}} commercially available pressure oscillators as expanders. The secondary regenerator amplifies the acoustic power, so a room temperature inertance tube may perform as well as a cold one. A secondary <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> transfers acoustic power to room temperature without amplification, so a rather small warm expander or displacer can provide the optimum phase shift even in a low-power cryocooler. In this paper, we model the behavior of these secondary <b>pulse</b> <b>tubes</b> and regenerators using REGEN 3. 3 and present results to assist in selecting the optimum geometry and the optimum characteristics for the expander.

In a PTR, the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> is only filled with working gas and there exists secondary flow {{due to a}} large temperature difference between cold-end and warm-end.

It is desirable to minimize axial thermal conductance in the pulse-tube wall to minimize leakage of heat between the warm and cold ends of the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube.</b> At the same time, it is desirable to maximize radial thermal conductance at the cold end of the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> to ensure adequate thermal contact between (1) a heat exchanger {{in the form of a}} stack of copper screens inside the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> at the cold end and (2) the remainder of the cold tip, which is the object to which the heat load is applied and from which heat must be removed. The modified design yields a low-heat-leak <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> that can be easily integrated with a cold tip. A typical <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> of prior design is either a thin-walled metal tube or a metal tube with a nonmetallic lining. It is desirable that the outer surface of a <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> be cylindrical (in contradistinction to tapered) to simplify the design of a regenerator that is also part of the cryocooler. Under some conditions, it is desirable to taper the inner surface of the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> to reduce acoustic streaming. The combination of a cylindrical outer surface and a tapered inner surface can lead to unacceptably large axial conduction if the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> is made entirely of metal. Making the pulse-tube wall of a nonmetallic, lowthermal- conductivity material would not solve the problem because the wall would not afford the needed thermal contact for the stack of screens in the cold end.

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. In a coaxial <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cryocooler, the radial thermal {{conduction}} between the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> and the regenerator {{has a large}} influence on cryocooler performance. Caused by the temperature mismatch between the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> and regenerator, this phenomenon needs to be carefully considered during the cryocooler design process. In this work, models with and without radial {{thermal conduction}} between the regenerator and its coaxial <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> have been constructed to analyze the mechanism and predict its effect on cryocooler performance. Experiments {{have been carried out}} to characterize the coaxial <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> axial temperature distribution under a variety of working conditions. A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) has been used to analyze the pressure-flow phase angle in the test system. The results were then compared with the simulated results and were used to provide direction for further optimization. The simulation results show that a steady radial thermal conduction exists between the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> and the regenerator, and this heat transfer can affect the fluid dynamics and thermodynamics in the system. Experiments show that the shape of the wall temperature distribution curve is a useful indicator of the cooler performance and the appropriateness of the arrangement of the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> and the regenerator for achieving optimal working conditions. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data, which verifies the numerical simulation modeling.

The refrigerator is considered as a thermoacoustic converter based on the modified Stirling cycle with helium working fluid. A sound pressure generator runs as a compressor. Plant model comprises an inner heat exchanger, a regenerative heat exchanger, a <b>pulse</b> <b>tube,</b> hot and cold heat exchangers at its ends, an inertial tube with the throttle, and a reservoir.

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{advances}} in <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cryocoolers and their application for cooling infrared sensors. There are many advantages of <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cryocoolers over Stirling cryocoolers associated with the absence of moving parts in the cold head. Efficiencies have been improved considerably {{in the last few}} years to where they equal or even exceed the efficiencies of Stirling cryocoolers. The use of inertance effects and double inlets to improve the efficiencies will be discussed. <b>Pulse</b> <b>tube</b> cryocoolers are now being used or considered for use in cooling infrared detectors for many space applications. One disadvantage of <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> coolers is the difficulty in scaling them down to sizes as small as 0. 15 W at 80 K while maintaining high efficiency. A second disadvantage is the larger diameter cold finger required for the same refrigeration power because of the presence of the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube.</b> These two disadvantages have limited their use so far in cooling infrared sensors for many military tactical applications. Progress in overcoming these disadvantages is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Thermal energy {{conversion}} processes are usually accompanied by considerable amounts of waste heat, {{which are often}} released into the environment unutilized. An internal combustion engine, for instance, only converts about {{one third of the}} supplied combustion heat into usable mechanical or electrical energy. About two third of the fuel's chemical energy are released as waste heat. Recovering energy from the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine is one way to reduce fuel consumption and to contribute to a reasonable use of energy resources. This PhD dissertation aims to analyze and develop a new and to date rarely investigated technology - the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> engine - with respect to its applicability for low grade waste heat recovery. To do so, this work consists of a theoretical and an experimental part. An analytical and a numerical simulation model of the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> engine are developed and used to clarify its thermodynamic working principle and to predict its power output and efficiency under variation of design features and operating conditions. The results of the theoretical investigations are used to build an experimental <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> engine at a laboratory scale. It uses pressurized helium as working gas and is equipped with a high number of sensors for the measurement of temperature, pressure and power, which enables a comparison of the measured engine performance with the theoretical predictions. In this work, it is shown {{for the first time that}} the combination of a <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> and a regenerator results in a thermodynamic asymmetry, which forms the underlying working principle of the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> engine, and the regenerator is - in contrast to the Stirling engine - essential for its functioning. It is proven analytically that the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> engine's operation is intrinsically irreversible. A relation for the minimal necessary temperature ratio of heat source to heat sink, which enables the engine to operate, is derived analytically and confirmed experimentally using the built laboratory-scale <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> engine. From the theoretical and experimental performance results, the properties of the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> engine are derived and limitations for its efficiency are outlined. The <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> engine built to laboratory scale has a maximum net power output of 6 W at a net efficiency of 8 %. In order to increase power output and efficiency, suggestions for an advanced design are concluded and used for the development of a powerful <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> engine. Furthermore, the potential of the <b>pulse</b> <b>tube</b> engine for its application in energy recovery from the internal combustion engine's exhaust gas is discussed and compared to that of the thermoelectric energy converter...|$|R
