5|$|Born in Buckfield, Maine, <b>Long</b> <b>was</b> educated as {{a lawyer}} at Harvard University, later {{settling}} in Hingham, Massachusetts. He became active in Republican Party politics in the 1870s, winning election for the state legislature in 1874.

5|$|Due to a ban of {{nunchaku}} {{weapons in}} the United Kingdom, his weapon was changed to a three-section staff for European releases of Soul Blade, with a section of staff replacing the chain in terms of appearance. Li <b>Long</b> <b>was</b> initially considered for inclusion for Soulcalibur, however the developers instead decided to focus on creating a new character using the same weapon for the title, resulting in Maxi.

In an interview, Soulcalibur IV director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated many fans had requested for the character to reappear in the series, though added no plans had been made to release the character as downloadable content for the title.|$|E
5|$|<b>Long</b> <b>was</b> {{elected to}} the United States Congress in the 1882 election, and served until 1889, declining to run for reelection in the 1888 election. In 1886, he was {{encouraged}} to stand for the Senate by Henry Cabot Lodge, although Lodge's support was apparently part of a ruse to test {{the strength of the}} state party leadership. Lodge withdrew his support at the last minute, throwing it instead to the incumbent Henry L. Dawes, and the legislature reelected Dawes to the seat. The incident cooled relations between Lodge and Long. In the wheeling and dealing that preceded the Senate election, <b>Long</b> <b>was</b> offered Democratic support by Butler, but refused, believing that such votes would be seen as tainted by an unsavory political deal.|$|E

5|$|<b>Long</b> <b>was</b> {{promoted}} {{as a potential}} vice presidential candidate by the Massachusetts delegation to the 1900 Republican National Convention, and was a personal favorite of McKinley's for the position. However, party leaders objected to him on geographic grounds, and Lodge (with whom Long continued to feud) disingenuously wore a Long banner, even though he supported Roosevelt, who easily won the nomination. The McKinley–Roosevelt ticket won the election, and Long decided to stay on for McKinley's second term.|$|E
