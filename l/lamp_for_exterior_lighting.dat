The carrier substrate supports an electrode (202), covered by an organic layer system (204) which carries a second electrode (206). The lamp assembly is covered by an outer layer (208). USE - The <b>lamp</b> is <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> <b>lighting</b> on a motor vehicle e. g. tail lights, stop lights, direction blinkers and the like, or panels with warning signs or advertising. ADVANTAGE - The lamps {{are attached to the}} outer surface of the bodywork, without drillings or recesses for their mountings, and lie flat without causing wind resistance. They require only small drillings for electrical supply connections...|$|R

40|$|As {{presently}} practiced and applied, photometry {{does not}} reflect the response of the human visual system at many light levels commonly used for nighttime lighting. Vision and photometry have never been synonymous, but this discon-nect could obscure prudent light source specification for outdoor illumination. The unified system of photometry, which links photopic and scotopic luminous efficiency at nighttime light levels, provides a framework for communicating information about <b>light</b> sources considered <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> <b>lighting.</b> Despite meth-odological differences, work from a recent research consortium closely matches the system of unified photometry and exactly matches its framework. This correspondence should encourage decision-making bodies as they move toward a consensus basis for specifying and communicating luminous quantities. 1.

500|$|That same year, Ralph Pulitzer, who {{had succeeded}} his father Joseph as {{publisher}} of the World, began a drive to raise [...] <b>for</b> an <b>exterior</b> <b>lighting</b> system to illuminate the statue at night. He claimed over 80,000 contributors, but failed to reach the goal. The difference was quietly made up by a gift from a wealthy donor—a fact that was not revealed until 1936. An underwater power cable brought electricity from the mainland and floodlights were placed along the walls of Fort Wood. Gutzon Borglum, who later sculpted Mount Rushmore, redesigned the torch, replacing much of the original copper with stained glass. On December 2, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson pressed the telegraph key that turned on the lights, successfully illuminating the statue.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a study made on choosing LED street lighting installations, {{such that the}} quality requirements <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> ar-tificial <b>lighting</b> are fulfilled. We analyze two types of LED street lighting installations from a technical point of view, together with lighting level and brightness values obtained during the measurements. Following on the field measurements, the lighting quality parameters are calculated, and, for the lighting installation with the best performance, optimal mounting suggestions are made. The optimal quality parameters are calculated by simulations using the Dialux software. The same software and the same light sources we also compute an optimal street lighting by determining {{the size of the}} installation that provides the best lighting parameter values...|$|R

50|$|The Audi Q8 will be {{the first}} SUV model {{designed}} by Audi's new head of design, Marc Lichte, and will usher in a new design language for Audi's SUVs, and for the brand as a whole. The grill is larger, with both vertical and horizontal slats, and the character lines of the Q8 are inspired by the Audi Quattro rally car from the 1980s. The Audi Q8 features full-laser headlamps and taillamps, the first-ever in a crossover or SUV. The interior too is totally redesigned and it very different from any previous Audi interior, and certain feature such as the knob-less MMI system, the three touch screens and enlarged virtual cockpit, and well as the ability <b>for</b> the <b>exterior</b> <b>lights</b> to project messages, lines and more onto the road, another first, will make it to production.|$|R
40|$|Report and {{presentation}} completed by {{students enrolled in}} BBE 5733 : Renewable Energy Technologies, taught by Dr. Min Addy in Fall 2015. This project was completed {{as part of a}} year-long partnership between Carver County and the University of Minnesota’s Resilient Communities Project ([URL] Carver County has been exploring opportunities for renewable energy and energy efficiency in county government buildings. The Carver County Government Center in Chaska was a potential candidate for a renewable energy installation, specifically <b>exterior</b> solar <b>lights.</b> The goal of this project was to determine the feasibility and potential payback time <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> solar <b>lighting</b> and other energy-efficient lighting systems at the Carver County Government Center. In collaboration with the county project lead, Nick Koktavy, a team of students in BBE 5733 : Renewable Energy Technologies, examined three scenarios [...] conversion of <b>exterior</b> <b>lights</b> to LED, installation of solar-powered lights, and a combination of both LEDs and solar power [...] and concluded that installing LEDs alone was the most cost-effective solution. A final report and PowerPoint slides from the project are available. This project was supported by the Resilient Communities Project (RCP), a program at the University of Minnesota whose mission is to connect communities in Minnesota with U of MN faculty and students to advance local sustainability and resilience through collaborative, course-based projects. RCP is a program of the Center for Urban and Regional Affairs (CURA). More information at [URL]...|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} {{light is}} {{a device that}} produces visible light by the flow of electric current. It {{is the most common}} form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society, providing interior <b>lighting</b> <b>for</b> buildings and <b>exterior</b> <b>light</b> <b>for</b> evening and nighttime activities. In technical usage, a replaceable component that produces light from electricity is called a lamp. Compact lamps are commonly called light bulbs; for example, the incandescent light bulb. Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture. The electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal pins, two metal caps or a bayonet cap.|$|R
