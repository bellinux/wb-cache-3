5|$|Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs) recovers {{from his}} {{operation}} to remove fragments of a bullet, {{which he had}} received earlier when encountering a deer. He asks his father Rick (Andrew Lincoln) if his friend Sophia Peletier (Madison Lintz) is alright. Since Sophia is still missing, Rick reluctantly lies to Carl and tells him that she is fine. Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn), Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), Andrea (Laurie Holden) and Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) move the vehicles and set up camp at the Greene home and are introduced to the Greene family. There, they lead a funeral procession for their ranch hand, Otis (Pruitt Taylor Vince). Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) is asked to share Otis' final moments; Shane sticks to his <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> Otis had sacrificed his life to save Carl, while in reality Shane (unwillingly) sacrificed Otis.|$|E
5|$|Dixon is {{accepted}} into the lacrosse team after trying out, but gets into a fight with team member George Evans (Kellan Lutz). Annie tells Dixon of her invitation to Naomi's party, and how she saw Ethan cheating on Naomi. The next day at school, Annie finds out that Silver made a video blog about her, depicting her as a bitchy farmer. Annie confronts Silver, who felt insulted by Annie's decision {{to hang out with}} Naomi. When Silver is reprimanded by her half-sister, Kelly, she realizes that she shouldn't reprimand Annie for what happened between her and Naomi in the past. Elsewhere, Ethan is forced by his team members to <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> Dixon started the fight during, and he is subsequently kicked off the team. Annie argues with Ethan because of his lying, and asks what happened to the Ethan that she met two years ago. In class, Naomi reads an exact copy of Annie's paper. Afterward, when Annie confronts Naomi, she apologizes by giving Annie an $800 dress. Annie decides to watch the school play rehearsals, and Silver apologizes for the video by asking the drama teacher to let Annie sing with the chorus for the play. Much to Adrianna's dismay, Annie is allowed to be in the play. Naomi again gets into trouble when Harry discovers that she cheated, and forces her to write the paper in his office. Ethan has a fight with George and tells the truth, resulting in Dixon being allowed to play on the team. Dixon tells Annie that he feels horrible, as he sent a text message to Naomi telling her that Ethan is cheating on her.|$|E

25|$|Barron says he {{does not}} salute the flag or believe in the Pledge of Allegiance, stating that the pledge's {{assertion}} that there is equality and justice for all is a <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> is not true for African-Americans. In 2004, he strongly objected to a move by the City Council that would begin each meeting with a voluntary Pledge.|$|E
25|$|Chris is {{something}} of a weakling who often finds himself getting in difficult situations, usually over women. When he goes to the past, he finds himself lying to a pretty girl to impress her, a <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> causes him to end up having to joust with her potential husband. As time passes, however, Chris proves himself to be much braver than he appears. In fact, Chris single-handedly kills de Kere, the one man crazy enough to kill them all.|$|E
25|$|Téchiné's {{demonstrated}} his {{flair for}} richly textured, atmospheric storytelling with his next film, the aptly titled thriller Barocco (1976), a crime drama, rooted in expressionist surrealism. A boxer who has accepted {{and then turned}} down a huge bribe from a politician to tell a <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> will influence an election is killed by a hired assassin. The boxer's girlfriend eventually {{falls in love with}} the killer while trying to remake him into the image of her slain lover. The film elicited critical plaudits for its elegant look.|$|E

25|$|Soon, the empress is {{pregnant}} with twins! When her time comes, she {{gives birth to}} two healthy boys. Octavian is delighted. His mother, however, tells him that the children are not his, a malicious <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> she tries to corroborate by bribing a male kitchen servant to enter the empress's bed while she is asleep. Octavian is taken to the room, sees the boy, kills him at once and holds his severed head in stark accusation before his terrified wife as she wakes from sleep.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the You're Fired audience {{and two of the}} panellists agreed with Sir Alan's decision. Torode, who disagreed, thought that Kevin should have been fired instead of Ian. On Why I Fired Them, despite having serious concerns with the three candidates in the final boardroom, Sir Alan noted that Ian's fate was sealed by the complete arrogance he displayed. This was due to him making the bizarre <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> Kevin had not held a motivational talk with the rest of Renaissance outside the pub {{towards the end of the}} day, which was contradicted by both Kevin and Simon, along with the fact that it had been recorded by the film crew following them.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} eight months since Cyclops' death, Emma started to train and {{improving}} her time to turn into her diamond form. She {{also seems to be}} traumatized from the death of Scott and began to actually believe her own <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> Black Bolt was the one who actually killed him. Emma wasted no time and began to prepare for a war with the Inhumans by making alliances with various teams of X-Men, with the last being Storm's X-Haven. She declares war on the Inhumans when Beast reports that the Terrigen cloud will soon saturate and render earth as completely uninhabitable for mutants, believing that they have no time to attempt negotiation. When Medusa learns the truth about why the X-Men went to war against the Inhumans, she willingly destroys the cloud and ends the possibility of future Inhuman manifestations so that the mutants can survive.|$|E

25|$|Part of {{the reason}} SCDPW widened Middle Road was in {{anticipation}} of the formerly proposed North Fork extension of the Long Island Expressway (LIE). Once the expressway had been extended to the west end of CR48 and Sound Avenue in Mattituck, CR48 was to be upgraded into another segment of the <b>LIE</b> <b>that</b> would lead to a bridge either between East Marion and Old Saybrook, Connecticut, or from Orient Point to Watch Hill, Rhode Island. There was also a proposal to extend CR48 west along Sound Avenue in anticipation of a formerly proposed nuclear power plant in South Jamesport that was to be built by the Long Island Lighting Company. SCDPW's official description of CR48 still lists part of Sound Avenue east of CR105 as being part of CR48, despite the fact that signage along the route indicates that Sound Avenue is the western terminus.|$|E
25|$|Deianira feared {{she would}} lose Heracles {{to the younger}} and more {{beautiful}} Iole. Years earlier, the centaur Nessus had ferried her across the river Evenus and attempted to rape her when {{they were on the}} other side. Heracles saved her from Nessus by shooting him with poisoned arrows. She had kept some of Nessus' blood for the centaur told her in his dying breath that if she were to give Heracles a cloak (chiton) soaked in his blood, it would be a love charm. Deianira, being concerned by Heracles' infidelity, believed Nessus’ <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> Heracles would no longer desire any other woman after he was under the spell of the love philter. This seemed like the perfect solution to her problem to reclaim her husband's love from him Iole, the foreign concubine. The cloak was delivered to Heracles and when he put it on the poison went into his body. Deianira had unwittingly poisoned her husband with this purported love potion because of her sadness over her husband's unfaithfulness. Upon realizing the mistake she had made, Deianira then killed herself. Because of his love for his concubine Iole, Heracles asked his eldest son, Hyllus to marry her so that she would be well taken care of. Iole and Hyllus had a son called Cleodaeus, and also three daughters, Evaechme, Aristaechme, and Hyllis.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, it is {{revealed}} that Den had remarried whilst in Spain in 1999, and {{his estranged wife}} Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman) arrives in Walford to collect some money from him. They then continue their romantic relationship. Den however still cannot remain monogamous, and when Chrissie discovers {{that he has been}} sleeping with Kate Mitchell (Jill Halfpenny), she threatens to kill him if he ever cheats again. To rebuild his family, Den attempts to regain the Vic from the Mitchells just before Christmas 2004; he blackmails their lawyer Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett) into convincing Sam that Phil, who is still on-the-run, needs immediate money. Sam sells the Vic to Den at a vastly reduced price and he reinstates his family at the pub in time for Christmas. Things go awry when Den discovers that Sharon and Dennis have resumed their affair, and in order to split them up, Den persuades Zoe to <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> she is pregnant with Dennis's baby. Unwilling to allow Dennis to leave his unborn child, Sharon leaves Walford with Vicki leaving Dennis and Zoe unhappily together. In apparent retribution towards Dennis for inadvertently being the cause of Sharon's departure, Den manipulates Zoe into having sex with him so she can get pregnant and pretend the baby is Dennis's; when Dennis catches them having sex, Den appears pleased.|$|E

50|$|Ste {{returns to}} Hollyoaks {{following}} {{a stint in}} a young offenders' institute. Mike is angry, but Amy <b>lies</b> <b>that</b> he is Leah's father and they eventually move into their own flat. Ste begins to steal to help fund the family, but begins <b>lying</b> <b>that</b> Leah has leukaemia for money. An angry Amy decides to leave Ste, but agrees to continue lying until they {{have enough money to}} support them. After the secret is revealed, Ste ultimately assaults Amy and she is rejected by her family. Ste's violent outbursts continue, with him cutting off her long ponytail on an occasion. After Amy is threatened by Ste again, she <b>lies</b> <b>that</b> she is pregnant. After admitting her lie, he apologises, seeing what he has caused. Soon after, Amy unearths her actual pregnancy and dumps Ste once again after he attacks her.|$|R

Gerry Adams remarked that Sands' victory [...] "exposed the <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> the hunger strikers—and by extension the IRA and the whole republican movement—had no popular support". The election victories of Doherty and Agnew also had political impact in the Republic of Ireland, as they denied power to Charles Haughey's outgoing Fianna Fáil government.|$|E
500|$|George {{had never}} liked his wife's habit of signing {{official}} documents and letters as [...] "Victoria Mary" [...] and insisted she drop {{one of those}} names.

Later that year, a radical propagandist, Edward Mylius, published a <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> George had secretly married in Malta as a young man, and that consequently his marriage to Queen Mary was bigamous. The lie had first surfaced in print in 1893 but George had shrugged it off as a joke. In an effort to kill off rumours, Mylius was arrested, tried and found guilty of criminal libel, {{and was sentenced to}} a year in prison.|$|E

500|$|Christian Scientists avoid {{almost all}} medical treatment, relying instead on Christian Science prayer. This {{consists}} of silently arguing with oneself; {{there are no}} appeals to a personal god, and no set words. Caroline Fraser wrote in 1999 that the practitioner might repeat: [...] "the allness of God using Eddy's seven synonyms—Life, Truth, Love, Spirit, Soul, Principle and Mind," [...] then that [...] "Spirit, Substance, is the only Mind, and man is its image and likeness; that Mind is intelligence; that Spirit is substance; that Love is wholeness; that Life, Truth, and Love are the only reality." [...] She might deny other religions, the existence of evil, mesmerism, astrology, numerology and the symptoms of whatever the illness is. She concludes, Fraser writes, by asserting that disease is a <b>lie,</b> <b>that</b> this is the word of God {{and that it has}} the power to heal.|$|E
500|$|Coghill has {{explained}} that Tony began grooming Whitney {{as soon as}} he met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's [...] "hero figure" [...] and [...] "saviour". Coghill elucidated: [...] "The <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life. But Tony's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children. Whitney is beginning to pass her sell-by date with him. [...] He feels like he's losing his little girl but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out." [...] As Tony began to lose interest in Whitney, he started grooming her 14-year-old school-friend Lauren Branning. A show-insider commented that Tony had been getting away with abusing Whitney for years, but was escalating as one young girl was no longer enough to satisfy him.|$|E

[...] Any lingering doubts Rookwood had were removed by Catesby's <b>lie</b> <b>that</b> the Jesuits had given the scheme their approval. [...] Rookwood had stayed with the Wintours at Huddington Court, and that month with the Catholic Lacons at Kinlet Hall, but at Cateby's behest he rented Clopton House near Stratford, and moved there after Michaelmas. [...] He took with him several Catholic religious symbols, such as chalices, crucifixes, vestments, Latin books and praying beads.
