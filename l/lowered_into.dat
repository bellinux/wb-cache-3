With sponsor Suisse Power & Gas SA having subsequently secured the naming rights, the completed SuisseGas Bridge was officially opened and turned over to Manchester City Council for general public access on 26 November 2014. Twelve days later, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, presided over the official opening of the CFA.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham died {{suddenly}} from acute meningitis at Auckland in September 1927, and his funeral {{was attended by}} a number of dignitaries, including representatives of the New Zealand, Auckland, New South Wales and Thames Rugby Unions. His pallbearers were all former All Blacks, and included fellow Original All Blacks George Tyler, George Nicholson and George Gillett. After his casket had been <b>lowered</b> <b>into</b> its grave at Hillsborough Cemetery, an Auckland representative jersey was thrown on top.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Sheaffe and {{his staff}} decided to entrust the funeral {{arrangements}} to Captain John Glegg, who had served with Brock for many years. On 16 October, a funeral procession for Brock and Colonel Macdonell went from Government House to Fort George, with soldiers from the British Army, the colonial militia, and First Nations warriors {{on either side of}} the route. The caskets were <b>lowered</b> <b>into</b> a freshly dug grave at the northeast corner of Fort George. The British fired a twenty-one gun salute in three salvos, in a gesture of respect. Later that day, the American garrison at Fort Niagara respectfully fired a similar salute. Over five thousand people attended the funeral, a remarkable number given the limited population of Upper Canada at that time.|$|E
5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, <b>lowered</b> <b>into</b> place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E

Police Commissioner Garfield notes that classified documentation regarding criminal organisations, including the Erdman Gang, has been destroyed in the fire. Prescott's claims about the hitch-hiker are validated when the charred remnants of the bracelet are discovered.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's body {{reportedly}} sustained two falls. As {{the coffin}} was lifted into {{place for the}} lying in state at the Column Hall of the House of the Unions, Brezhnev's body fell through the bottom. After that, a new, metal-plated coffin was made, and as it was <b>lowered</b> <b>into</b> the grave, the funeral servants could not handle its weight and the coffin fell with a loud crash into the grave hole. This account, however, was contested by Georgy Kovalenko, one of the funeral servants—according to him, twenty minutes before the deposition of the coffin he {{was asked by the}} Kremlin custodian Semyon Shornikov to lower the coffin simultaneously with the chime of bells.|$|E
5|$|The What If? book {{contains}} {{a selection of}} questions and answers from the original blog, as well as nineteen new ones. Furthermore, Munroe selected a few unanswered questions from his inbox and collected those in separate sections in the book. Alt text, which was commonly used for illustrations on the original blog, was omitted from the book in many cases, though is sometimes included as small captions underneath the images. Instead, Munroe has added footnotes to the essays in the book to inform or entertain the reader. The cover of the book depicts a Tyrannosaurus rex being <b>lowered</b> <b>into</b> a Sarlacc from Star Wars, a topic not covered in the book.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} Aguilera gearing up and riding a {{motorcycle}} into a nightclub. Wearing a bikini and buttocks-bearing chaps, she is lowered from a cage into a boxing ring and dances, accompanied by several back-up dancers. A masked woman is <b>lowered</b> <b>into</b> the ring, {{and the two}} engage in foxy boxing. The scene is intercut with sequences of Aguilera dancing in a crop top, which she later removes to reveal a bra, and a microskirt. Redman then proceeds down a hallway, passing people such as mud wrestlers, a contortionist, and furries. The video proceeds to a scene of Aguilera and back-up dancers splashing and dancing while being sprayed with water in a room containing several urinals, as a possible reference to urolagnia. It features several sexual fetishes, from mud wrestling to muscle worshipping.|$|E
5|$|Disorder {{followed}} William's death; {{everyone who}} had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired {{to be buried in}} his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was <b>lowered</b> <b>into</b> the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.|$|E
5|$|The hobo's third tale {{tells the}} story of Tom Sawyer, whom Bart portrays, and Huckleberry Finn, whom Nelson portrays. Tom is a rebellious trouble maker while Huck is a bully. Huck is caught holding hands with Becky (Lisa) and is forced to marry her by her father (Homer). Huck dodges the {{marriage}} and goes on the run with Tom, leaving Missouri for Missoura. However, they are chased by townspeople led by Becky's father and their families. Huck and Tom flee to a river boat, but are thrown into the Mississippi River and are caught by the townspeople. At their funeral, Tom and Huck are first revealed to not be in their caskets, seemingly watching the proceedings from the rafters which they have big smiles on their faces, until Reverend Lovejoy orders their bodies <b>lowered</b> <b>into</b> the caskets, revealing that Tom and Huck are in fact dead.|$|E

50|$|At {{the main}} drive sites, four main {{activities}} {{need to take}} place: shaft construction (where a concrete cylinder 25 - 30 m in diameter and about 40 - 60 m deep {{would need to be}} constructed), tunnelling preparations (preparing the site for arrival of the TBM), TBM assembly and <b>lowering</b> <b>into</b> the shaft, and driving the TBM to excavate the main tunnel.|$|R
5|$|Where it was {{necessary}} for the pipeline to curve to fit the route, the steel pipes were bent, using either a cold-bending approach, in which tractors would pull and push the pipelines into position, or a hot-bending method, with the pipe heated up by blow-torches and pulled into place using a jig. A new, specialized piece of equipment for bending pipes, the Cummings bending jig, was invented during the Big Inch build, and used on the construction of the Little Big Inch pipeline. To protect the pipeline from corrosion, its outside was then cleaned by machine, and painted in first a layer of coal tar enamel, and then hot coal tar coating, before being wrapped in asbestos felt. Finally the pipeline was <b>lowered</b> <b>into</b> position, taking care not to damage the ends of the pipes; the larger pipes were so heavy that they required a D-8 caterpillar tractor equipped with counter-weights to lift them. The trench was then back-filled, completing the process.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Environment Agency {{constructed}} a tidal barrier {{at the mouth}} of the river. The structure spans the river, and a huge steel gate, weighing 202 tonnes, can be <b>lowered</b> <b>into</b> the waterway, effectively sealing the river from the Humber, and preventing tidal surges from moving up the river and flooding parts of the city and the low-lying areas beyond. The gate is lowered between eight and twelve times a year, and protects around 17,000 properties. In 2009, a £10million upgrade of the structure was started, to ensure it would stay operational for a further 30 years. The upgrade included a new drive mechanism, which raises and lowers the gate, and pivots it when it is at the top of the structure, so that it lies horizontally rather than vertically. It also included a new control system. In July 2017 the barrier was granted Grade II listed status. Plans have been considered to build a barrage {{at the mouth of}} the Hull where it joins the Humber Estuary to maintain a constant water level as it passes through the city. The idea was first raised by the Abercrombie report, which considered how to redevelop Hull after significant destruction during the Second World War. The estimated cost of such a project was around £195million in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Moscow militsiya {{sealed off}} {{downtown}} Moscow during the funeral on 15 November. Large avenues were tightly guarded {{by the police}} and the Moscow military garrison. The soldiers, who {{stood in front of the}} House of the Unions, wore black-edged red armbands. The House of the Unions was decorated by numerous red flags and other communist symbols. Brezhnev's body lay in state for three days at the House of the Unions. On the third day the coffin was placed on an artillery carriage towed by an olive-green BRDM-2 armored vehicle of the Red Army—led by dozens of wreaths as well as Brezhnev's decorations carried by Soviet military personnel and other mourners—to the Lenin Mausoleum on the Red Square, where it was greeted by speeches by Andropov; Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov; Anatoly Alexandrov, the President of the Academy of Sciences; and a factory worker. After the speeches, pallbearers, led by Andropov and Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, carried the coffin to another location close to the mausoleum. It was here that Brezhnev's family made their farewell. Before the body was laid to rest Viktoria kissed Brezhnev on the face in accordance with Russian traditions. As Brezhnev's body was <b>lowered</b> <b>into</b> the grave a military squad saluted while an orchestra played the Soviet national anthem. According to Time magazine Brezhnev's death was mourned by the majority of Soviets.|$|E

When the footway of the churchyard was restored to its normal condition Dare pursued his way to Markton.|$|R
