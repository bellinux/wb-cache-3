Quantitative mapping of structural brain differences in those at genetic risk of AD is crucial for evaluating treatment and prevention strategies.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that individuals with lower levels of FA may engage in more biologically costly behaviours such as recreational drug use and risky body modifications such as piercings and tattoos. These ideas have been proposed in the context of Zahavi's handicap principle, which argues that highly costly behaviours or traits serve as signals of an organism's genetic quality. The relationship between FA and behaviours with high health risks has received mixed support.

A motion capture study of videos of Jamaican dancers, altered to make the dancers unrecognizable used FA ratings to categorize the dancers. Male and female subjects assessed dancing ability and identified the dancer's sex. Symmetrical dancers were rated as significantly better than others, but female symmetry accounted for less than it did in males. Female evaluators more strongly preferred symmetrical male dancers than male evaluators, while there was no gender difference in ratings of female dancers. <b>Lower</b> <b>FA</b> male evaluators were less likely to prefer dances performed by symmetrical females.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has shown}} that the female {{partners}} of men with lower levels of FA experience a higher number of copulatory orgasms, compared to the female partners of males with higher levels of FA. Other studies have also found that the voices of men and women with low fluctuating asymmetry are rated as more attractive, suggesting that voice may be indicative of developmental stability. Research has shown attractiveness ratings of men's scent are negatively correlated with FA, but FA is unrelated to attractiveness ratings for women's scent, and women's preferences for the scent of more symmetric men appears to limited to the most fertile phases of the menstrual cycle However, other research has failed to find changes in women's preferences for low FA across the menstrual cycle. Facial symmetry has been positively correlated with higher occurrences of mating. Also, one study used 3-D scans of male and female bodies, and showed videos of these scans to a group of individuals who rated the bodies on attractiveness. It was found that, for both males and females, lower levels of FA were associated with higher attractiveness ratings. It was also found that sex-typical joint configurations were rated as more attractive and linked to <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> in men, but not women. Men with higher FA have been shown to have higher levels of oxidative stress and lower levels of attractiveness. Research has also provided evidence that FA is linked to extra-pair copulation, as women have been shown to prefer men with lower levels of FA as extra-pair partners. However, the literature is mixed regarding the relationship between attractiveness and FA. For example, in one study, altering images of faces to in a way that reduced asymmetry led to observers rating such faces as less, rather than more, attractive. Research by Van Dongen also found FA to be unrelated to attractiveness, physical strength and level of masculinity in both men and women.|$|E
40|$|Background Very preterm birth (VPT, < 32 weeks' gestation) is {{associated}} with altered white matter fractional anisotropy (FA), the biological basis of which is uncertain but may relate to changes in axon density and/or dispersion, which can be measured using Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI). This study aimed to compare whole brain white matter FA, axon dispersion, and axon density between VPT children and controls (born ≥ 37 weeks' gestation), and to investigate associations with perinatal factors and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Methods FA, neurite dispersion, and neurite density were estimated from multishell diffusion magnetic resonance images for 145 VPT and 33 control 7 -year-olds. Diffusion values were compared between groups and correlated with perinatal factors (gestational age, birthweight, and neonatal brain abnormalities) and neurodevelopmental outcomes (IQ, motor, academic, and behavioral outcomes) using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. Results Compared with controls, VPT children had <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> and higher axon dispersion within many major white matter fiber tracts. Neonatal brain abnormalities predicted <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> and higher axon dispersion in many major tracts in VPT children. <b>Lower</b> <b>FA,</b> higher axon dispersion, and lower axon density in various tracts correlated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes in VPT children.

40|$|Skin {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignancy}} in humans. Although highly treatable, non-melanoma skin cancer is commonly followed by other non-cutaneous malignancies. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) acts as both tumor initiator and promoter, and also results in the suppression of specific immune responses. The systemic suppression of immune responses is initiated by DNA damage, which promotes IL- 10 production, an important cytokine as anti-IL- 10 can abrogate the suppression, and upregulates the pro-apoptotic proteins Fas and Fas ligand (FasL). FasL is a critical factor for UV-induced immune suppression, and the suppressor cell induced by UV expresses FasL. ^ We hypothesized that the microenvironment affects Fas/FasL interactions, and that these interactions are important to the phenomenon of UV induced immune suppression. To determine the effects of the interaction of FasL and IL- 10, splenocytes isolated from C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were cultured in {{the presence or absence of}} IL- 10 post-mitogenic activation. We determined that IL- 10 protects from Fas-mediated apoptosis by <b>lowering</b> <b>Fas</b> sensitivity and <b>lowering</b> the levels of either Fas or FasL. This protection is stronger when IL- 10 is given immediately after mitogenic activation, and does not increase any of the inhibitors of apoptosis studied. In vivo, splenocytes from UV-irradiated mice are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis and present very high levels of IL- 10, <b>lowered</b> <b>Fas</b> sensitivity and <b>lowered</b> caspase cleavage despite higher expression of Fas and FasL than non-irradiated mice. ^ UV-induced immune suppression affects female mice preferentially, which led us to look at prolactin as a possible component of this suppression since this hormone has also been associated with increased skin carcinogenesis. The interaction of FasL and prolactin results in suppression of the delayed type hypersensitivity response to Candida albicans. This lack of response depends on FasL as is not seen in gld mice. Similar to UV-induced immune suppression, the suppression is caused by a Th 2 deviation, and correlates with a significant increase in Fas expression. In the presence of UV, the effects of prolactin seemed to be protective, and UV actually restores the DTH response. ^ Taken together, these observations suggest that the microenvironment dictates the outcome of the interaction of FasL with Fas going from promoting apoptosis to preventing apoptosis or mediating a Th 2 deviation and suppression of a Th 1 response. ...|$|R

40|$|Individuals with {{a family}} history of {{substance}} use disorders (FH+) are at a greater risk of developing substance use disorders than their peers with no such family histories (FH-) and this vulnerability is proportional to the number of affected relatives (FH density). The risk for developing substance use disorders peaks during adolescence to early adulthood in the general population, and that is thought to be related to delayed maturation of frontocortical and frontostriatal functional circuits. We hypothesized that FH+ youth and young adults have impaired myelination of frontocortical and frontostriatal white matter tracts. We examined fractional anisotropy (FA) data in 80 FH+ and 34 FH- youths (12. 9 +/- 1. 0 years) and in 25 FH+ and 30 FH- young adults (24. 3 +/- 3. 4 years). FH+ youths had <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> values in both frontocortical and frontostriatal tracts as well as parietocortical tracts including the anterior, superior and posterior corona radiata and the superior frontal-occipital fasciculus. Moreover, FA values in these tracts were negatively correlated with FH density.

In both groups, <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> values corresponded to higher radial diffusivity suggesting reduced axonal myelination. We interpreted our findings as evidence for impaired myelination of frontal white matter that was proportional to FH density.

METHODS: This study applied a single measurement session of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine white matter structure in male cocaine polysubstance users (n= 37) versus male healthy controls (n= 38), along with correlations between DTI measures and patterns of polysubstance use and duration of abstinence. Specifically, we conducted voxel-wise analyses of fractional anisotropy (FA) in the corpus callosum, frontolimbic, striatal and cingulate tracts relevant to drug sequelae. RESULTS: Cocaine polysubstance users, compared to controls, showed <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> {{in the body of the}} corpus callosum, anterior cingulate, uncinate fasciculus and retrolenticular part of the internal capsule. Duration of cocaine use had a marginal negative association with FA in the corpus callosum, and duration of alcohol use was negatively associated with FA in the internal capsule and the uncinate fasciculus. Duration of cocaine abstinence was positively correlated with FA in the uncinate fasciculus, posterior cingulate and fornix-striatum. In the context of cocaine polysubstance use, chronicity of cocaine use is therefore likely to be associated with <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> in the corpus callosum, and chronicity of alcohol use with <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> in the frontal-striatal and frontal-limbic tracts. Longer abstinence was correlated to greater FA in frontal-striatal and frontal-limbic tracts, though the direction of causality remains unclear.

While cognitive dysfunction is reported in 40 – 60 % of MS patients, the neuroanatomical correlates of cognitive impairment remain incompletely understood. Methods. The cingulum, pillars of the fornix, and corticospinal tract were segmented by fiber tracking via diffusion tensor imaging. Average tract-specific fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) were compared in MS cases and healthy volunteers.

Alternatively, these <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> values may be due to partial volume effects. In the case of ABI, it is difficult to separate between these two effects (of degeneration and partial volume), as degeneration of the tract would be expected to cause a loss of white matter volume and a reduction in the “number of tracts” in the region previously occupied by the tract prior to the injury. However, the higher predictive accuracy for outcome observed with the FA values from the atlas-based approach suggests that the atlas-based FA values are clinically relevant, even if the atlas region includes parts of the tract that have undergone degeneration, or where the FA falls below the tracking threshold.|$|E

Materials and Methods By systematically searching online databases, tract-based spatial statistics studies were identified that compared fractional anisotropy (FA; a marker for WM integrity) in MS patients to healthy control subjects, correlated FA in MS patients with physical disability, or correlated FA in MS patients with cognitive performance. Voxelwise meta-analysis {{was performed by}} using the Signed Differential Mapping method for each comparison. Moderating effects of mean age, mean physical disability score, imager magnet strength, lesion load, and number of diffusion directions were assessed by means of meta-regression. Results Meta-analysis was performed on data from 495 patients and 253 control subjects across 12 studies. MS diagnosis {{was significantly associated with}} widespread lower tract FA (nine studies; largest cluster, 4379 voxels; z = 7. 1; P <. 001). Greater physical disability was significantly associated with <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> in the right posterior cingulum, left callosal splenium, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and left fornix crus (six studies; 323 voxels; z = 1. 7; P =. 001).

40|$|This {{prospective}} study of {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) patients investigates fractional anisotropy (FA) from chronic diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in areas corresponding to persistent and transient traumatic axonal injury (TAI) lesions detected in clinical MRI from the early phase. Thirty-eight patients (mean 24. 7 [range 13 – 63] years of age) with moderate-to-severe TBI and 42 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Patients underwent 1. 5 -T clinical MRI in the early phase (median 7 days), including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T 2 * gradient echo (T 2 *GRE) sequences. TAI lesions from the early phase were characterized as nonhemorrhagic or microhemorrhagic. In the chronic phase (median 3 years), patients and controls were imaged at 3 T with FLAIR, T 2 *GRE, T 1, and DTI sequences. TAI lesions were classified as transient or persistent. The FLAIR/T 2 *GRE images from the early phase were linearly registered to the FA images from the chronic phase and lesions manually segmented on the FA-registered FLAIR/T 2 *GRE images. For regions of interest (ROIs) from both nonhemorrhagic and microhemorrhagic lesion, we found a significant linear trend of lower mean FA from ROIs in healthy controls to ROIs in patients without either nonhemorrhagic or microhemorrhagic lesions and further to transient and finally persistent lesion ROIs (P < 0. 001). Histogram analyses showed <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> in persistent compared with transient nonhemorrhagic lesion ROIs (P < 0. 001), {{but this was not}} found in microhemorrhagic lesion ROIs (P = 0. 08 – 0. 55).

Several lines of evidence suggest that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) {{play a role in}} myelination, and there is substantial evidence documenting decreased PUFA concentrations in schizophrenia. We therefore hypothesized that lower membrane PUFA concentrations may be related to reduced WM integrity in schizophrenia and related disorders. In 30 male patients with a recent-onset psychotic disorder, erythrocyte membrane PUFA concentrations were assessed and diffusion tensor imaging was performed with voxelwise analysis. Lower total PUFA concentration was associated with lower fractional anisotropy (FA) throughout the corpus callosum and bilateral parietal, occipital, temporal and frontal WM (P <. 05, corrected). Of the individual PUFAs, lower arachidonic acid concentration, and to a lesser extent, lower nervonic acid, linoleic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid concentration were significantly associated with <b>lower</b> <b>FA.</b> PUFA concentrations were inversely associated with radial diffusivity but showed little association with axial diffusivity.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether apoptosis occurs during aortic valve surgery and whether modifying temperature during CPB has any influence on cardiomyocyte apoptotic death rate. Methods 20 patients undergoing elective aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis were randomly assigned to either moderate hypothermic (ModHT group, n = 10, 28 °C) or mild hypothermic (MiHT group, n = 10, 34 °C) CPB. Myocardial samples were obtained from the right atrium before and after weaning from CPB. Specimens were examined for apoptosis by flow cytometry analysis of annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) and Fas death receptor staining. Results In the ModHT group, non apoptotic non necrotic cells (annexin negative, PI negative) decreased after CPB, while early apoptotic (annexin positive, PI negative) and late apoptotic or necrotic (PI positive) cells increased. In contrast, no change in the different cell populations was observed over time in the MiHT group. Fas expression rose after reperfusion in the ModHT group but not in MiHT patients, in which there was even a trend for a <b>lower</b> <b>Fas</b> staining after CPB (p = 0. 08). In ModHT patients, a prolonged ischemic time tended to induce a higher increase of Fas (p = 0. 061).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Economic {{evaluations}} {{provide an}} important {{basis for allocation}} of resources and health services planning. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate and compare the costs of correcting anterior crossbite with functional shift, using fixed or removable appliances (FA or RA) and to relate the costs to the effects, using cost-minimization analysis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two patients with anterior crossbite and functional shift were randomized in blocks of 10. Thirty-one patients were randomized to be treated with brackets and arch wire (FA) and 31 with an acrylic plate (RA). Duration of treatment and number and estimated length of appointments and cancellations were registered. Direct costs (premises, staff salaries, material, and laboratory costs) and indirect costs (the accompanying parents' loss of income while absent from work) were calculated and evaluated with reference to successful outcome alone, to successful and unsuccessful outcomes and to re-treatment when required. Societal costs were defined as the sum of direct and indirect costs. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with FA or RA. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between FA and RA with respect to direct costs for treatment time, but both indirect costs and direct costs for material were significantly <b>lower</b> for <b>FA.</b> The total societal costs were <b>lower</b> for <b>FA</b> than for RA. LIMITATIONS: Costs depend on local factors and should not be directly extrapolated to other locations. CONCLUSION: The analysis disclosed significant economic benefits for FA over RA. Even when only successful outcomes were assessed, treatment with RA was more expensive. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was not registered. PROTOCOL: The protocol was not published before trial commencement...|$|R

40|$|Background Persistent {{depressive}} symptoms {{in children and}} adolescents are considered a risk factor for the development of major depressive disorder (MDD) later in life. Previous research has shown alterations in white matter microstructure in pediatric MDD but discrepancies exist as to the specific tracts affected. The current study aimed to improve upon previous methodology and address the question whether previous findings of lower fractional anisotropy (FA) replicate in a sample of children with persistent depressive disorder characterized by mild but more chronic symptoms of depression. Methods White matter microstructure was examined in 25 boys with persistent depressive disorder and 25 typically developing children. Tract specific analysis implemented with the Diffusion Tensor Imaging - ToolKit (DTI-TK) was used to probe fractional anisotropy (FA) in eleven major white matter tracts. Results Clusters within the left uncinate, inferior fronto-occipital and cerebrospinal tracts showed <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> in the clinical group. FA in the left uncinate showed a negative association with self-reported symptoms of depression. Conclusions The results demonstrate <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> in several white matter tracts in children with persistent depressive disorder. These findings support the contention that early onset depression is associated with altered white matter microstructure, which may contribute to the maintenance and recurrence of symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Smoking is a {{significant}} cause of preventable mortality worldwide. Understanding the neural mechanisms of nicotine addiction and smoking cessation may provide effective targets for developing treatment strategies. In the present study, we explored whether smokers have white matter alterations and whether these alterations are related to cessation outcomes and smoking behaviors. Sixty-six smokers and thirty-seven healthy non-smokers were enrolled. The participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans and smoking-related behavioral assessments. After a 12 -week treatment with varenicline, 28 smokers succeeded in quitting smoking and 38 failed. Diffusion parameter maps were compared among the non-smokers, future quitters, and relapsers to identify white matter differences. We found that the future relapsers had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the orbitofrontal area than non-smokers, and higher FA in the cerebellum than non-smokers and future quitters. The future quitters had significantly <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> in the postcentral gyrus compared to non-smokers and future relapsers. Compared to non-smokers, pooled smokers had <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> in bilateral orbitofrontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus. In addition, regression analysis showed that the left orbitofrontal FA was correlated with smoking-relevant behaviors. These results suggest that white matter alterations in smokers {{may contribute to the}} formation of aberrant brain circuits underlying smoking behaviors and are associated with future smoking cessation outcomes...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} abnormal changes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by histogram and region-of-interest–based methods by using diffusion tenor imaging. However, there are few studies on specific white matter fiber tracts of RRMS. Our study sought to use diffusion tensor tractography–based group mapping to investigate the presence of abnormal diffusion in the normal-appearing pyramidal tract (PYT) of RRMS and its possible mechanism. METHODS: A PYT probability map was first constructed from data on 20 healthy patients based on the deterministic-based tractography method. The PYT probability map was then applied to 29 RRMS patients to calculate diffusion indices of the PYT. In this study, 4 quantitative indices—fractional anisotropy (FA), directionally averaged diffusion coefficient (Dav), axial diffusion coefficient (1), and radial diffusion coefficient (23) —were used to characterize the abnormal diffusion. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, RRMS patients had a significantly higher Dav and 23 but a <b>lower</b> <b>FA</b> and a trend toward a lower 1 in the normal-appearing PYT. In RRMS patients, PYT lesions had a significantly higher 23 and a <b>lower</b> <b>FA,</b> {{but there were no}} differences for Dav and 1 when compared with the normal-appearing PYT. Moreover, the diffusion indices derived from the normal-appearing PYT were significantly correlated with PYT lesion volumes by using the Spearman correla...|$|E
40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was conducted}} to assess alterations in measures of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the patients of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), exploring the potential role of DTI as a diagnosis biomarker. A systematic search of all related studies written in English was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane comparing CSM patients with healthy controls. Key details for each study regarding participants, imaging techniques, and results were extracted. DTI measurements, such as fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and mean diffusivity (MD) were pooled to calculate the effect size (ES) by fixed or random effects meta-analysis. 14 studies involving 479 CSM patients and 278 controls were identified. Meta-analysis of the most compressed levels (MCL) of CSM patients demonstrated that FA was significantly reduced (ES - 1. 52, 95 % CI - 1. 87 to - 1. 16, P < 0. 001) and ADC was significantly increased (ES 1. 09, 95 % CI 0. 89 to 1. 28, P < 0. 001). In addition, a notable ES was found for <b>lowered</b> <b>FA</b> at C 2 -C 3 for CSM vs. controls (ES - 0. 83, 95 % CI - 1. 09 to - 0. 570, P < 0. 001). Meta-regression analysis revealed that male ratio of CSM patients {{had a significant effect}} on reduction of FA at MCL (P = 0. 03). The meta-analysis of DTI studies of CSM patients clearly demonstrated a significant FA reduction and ADC increase compared with healthy subjects. This result supports the use of DTI parameters in differentiating CSM patients from health subjects. Future researches are required to investigate the diagnosis performance of DTI in cervical spondylotic myelopathy...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Rolandic {{epilepsy}} (RE) is {{a childhood}} epilepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, {{that is increasingly}} associated with language impairment. In this study, we tested for a white matter (connectivity) correlate, employing diffusion weighted MRI and language testing. Methods Twenty-three children with RE and 23 matched controls (age: 8 – 14 years) underwent structural (T 1 -weighted) and diffusion-weighted MRI (b = 1200 s/mm 2, 66 gradient directions) at 3 T, as well as neuropsychological language testing. Combining tractography and a cortical segmentation derived from the T 1 -scan, the rolandic tract were reconstructed (pre- and postcentral gyri), and tract fractional anisotropy (FA) values were compared between patients and controls. Aberrant tracts were tested for correlations with language performance. Results Several reductions of tract FA were found in patients compared to controls, mostly in the left hemisphere; the most significant effects involved the left inferior frontal (p = 0. 005) and supramarginal (p = 0. 004) gyrus. In the patient group, <b>lower</b> tract <b>FA</b> values were correlated with lower language performance, among others for {{the connection between the}} left postcentral and inferior frontal gyrus (p = 0. 043, R = 0. 43). Conclusion In RE, structural connectivity is reduced for several connections involving the rolandic regions, from which the epileptiform activity originates. Most of these aberrant tracts involve the left (typically language mediating) hemisphere, notably the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area) and the supramarginal gyrus (Wernicke’s area). For the former, reduced language performance for <b>lower</b> tract <b>FA</b> was found in the patients. These findings provide a first microstructural white matter correlate for language impairment in RE...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:  Among {{screening}} {{tools for}} cognitive impairment in large cohorts, the Montreal Cognitive assessment (MoCA) {{appears to be}} more sensitive to early cognitive impairment than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), particularly after transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke. We reasoned that if MoCA-detected early cognitive impairment is pathologically significant, then it should be specifically associated with the presence of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) on MRI. METHODS: Consecutive eligible patients with TIA or minor stroke (Oxford Vascular Study) underwent MRI and cognitive assessment. We correlated MoCA and MMSE scores with WMH and FA, then specifically studied patients with low MoCA and normal MMSE. RESULTS: Among 400 patients, MoCA and MMSE scores were significantly correlated (all p< 0. 001) with WMH volumes (rMoCA=- 0. 336, rMMSE=- 0. 297) and FA (rMoCA= 0. 409, rMMSE= 0. 369), and -on voxel-wise analyses- with WMH in frontal white matter and reduced FA in almost all white matter tracts. However, only the MoCA was independently correlated with WMH volumes (r=- 0. 183, p< 0. 001), average FA values (r= 0. 218, p< 0. 001), and voxel-wise reduced FA in anterior tracts after controlling for the MMSE. In addition, patients with low MoCA but normal MMSE (N= 57) had higher WMH volumes (t= 3. 1,p= 0. 002), <b>lower</b> average <b>FA</b> (t=- 4. 0,p< 0. 001), and <b>lower</b> voxel-wise <b>FA</b> in almost all white matter tracts than those with normal MoCA and MMSE (N= 238). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with TIA or minor stroke, early cognitive impairment detected with the MoCA but not with the MMSE was independently associated with white matter damage on MRI, particularly reduced FA...|$|R
