40|$|Apparatus is {{described}} for automatically mating {{a pair of}} connectors and protecting them prior to mating, which minimizes weight and uses relatively simple and reliable mechanisms. Lower and upper connectors (24, 26) are held in lower and upper parts (14, 16) of a housing, with the upper connector mounted on a carrier (32) that is motor driven to move down and mate the connectors. A pair of movable members (36, 38) serve as shields, as coarse alignment aids, and as force transmitters. The movable members are pivotally mounted {{at the bottom of}} the upper housing, and as the carrier moves down it pivots the members out of the way. The movable members have socket elements (116) that closely receive pin elements (120) on the lower housing part, to coarsely align the connectors and to react mating and unmating forces between the housings. The carrier has a pair of plate portions (60, 62) with slots (64), and the movable members have cam followers engaged with the slot walls, to move the members with precision. The carrier plate-like portions engage follower members (82) that pivot open <b>lower</b> <b>shield</b> parts (44, 46) covering the lower connector, which is mounted on four stacks of Belleville washers (142) ...|$|E

50|$|Data {{suddenly}} asks Picard to <b>lower</b> <b>shields</b> and Worf does so. The next {{shock wave}} is harmless and the Enterprise is safe. Data realized that giving {{energy to the}} shields caused even heavier shock waves (the more power the ship generated, the heavier the shock), and these were ultimately responsible {{for the destruction of}} Timothy's ship.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} to the HFBR environment on the carbon steel in the HFBR <b>lower</b> thermal <b>shield</b> were evaluated. Corrosion was found to be a non-significant degradation process. Radiation embrittlement has occurred; portions of the plate closest to the reactor are currently operating in the lower-shelf region of the Charpy impact curve (i. e., below the fracture toughness transition temperature). In this region, the effects of radiation on the mechanical properties of carbon steel are believed to have been saturated, so that no further deterioration is anticipated. A fracture toughness analysis shows that a large factor of safety (> 1. 5) exists against propagation of credible hypothetical flaws. Therefore, the existing <b>lower</b> thermal <b>shield</b> structure is suitable for continued operation of the HFBR...|$|R

40|$|Minimizing astronaut's {{short and}} {{long-term}} medical risks arising from exposure to ionizing radiation during space missions {{is a major concern}} for NASA's manned spaceflight program, particularly exploration missions. For ethical and legal reasons, NASA follows the "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA) principal in managing astronaut's radiation exposures. One implementation of ALARA is the response to space weather events. Of particular concern are energetic solar particle events, and in low Earth orbit (LEO), electron belt enhancements. To properly respond to these events, NASA's Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG), in partnership with the NOAA Space Environment Center (SEC), provides continuous flight support during U. S. manned missions. In this partnership, SEC compiles space weather data from numerous ground and space based assets and makes it available in near real-time to SRAG (along with alerts and forecasts), who in turn uses these data as input to models to calculate estimates of the resulting exposure to astronauts. These calculations and vehicle instrument data form the basis for real-time recommendations to flight management. It is also important to implement ALARA during the design phase. In order to appropriately weigh the risks associated with various shielding and vehicle configuration concepts, the expected environment must be adequately characterized for nominal and worst case scenarios for that portion of the solar cycle and point in space. Even with the best shielding concepts and materials in place (unlikely), there will be numerous occasions where the crew is at greater risk due to being in a <b>lower</b> <b>shielded</b> environment (short term transit or <b>lower</b> <b>shielded</b> vehicles, EVAs), so that accurate space weather forecasts and nowcasts, of particles at the relevant energies, will be crucial to protecting crew health and safety...|$|R
50|$|Shortly afterward, also at Elsdorf, another T26E3 {{knocked out}} a Tiger I and two Panzer IVs. The Tiger {{was knocked out}} at 900 yd with the 90-mm HVAP T30E16 ammunition.

40|$|Multiwalled carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWNTs) {{with two}} different diameters were dispersed within poly(is an element of-caprolactone) (PCL) by melt-blending and coprecipitation, respectively, {{with the purpose}} to impart good electromagnetic interference shielding properties to the polyester. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the MWNTs were uniformly dispersed as single nanotubes within the matrix. Because the nanotubes were broken down during melt-blending, the percolation threshold was observed at a lower filler content {{in the case of}} coprecipitation. Substitution of poly(ethylene-co-octene), poly(vinyl chloride), polypropylene, and polystyrene for PCL resulted in a much <b>lower</b> <b>shielding</b> efficiency. Finally, polycarbonate and poly(methyl methacrylate) appeared as promising substitutes for PCL, suggesting that pi-pi interactions between the nanotubes and constitutive carbonyl units of the polymers would be beneficial to the dispersion and ultimately to the electrical properties of the nanocomposites...|$|R

50|$|Since some {{interpretations of}} the Codex Belli {{go as far as}} banning hits against {{the entire length of the}} lower arms and <b>lower</b> legs, <b>shields</b> have become the {{standard}} choice for a secondary weapon in these combats because they can cover the entire legal hit area (torso, upper arms and upper legs).|$|R
50|$|Ringling {{was named}} for John Ringling of the Ringling Brothers circus family, which once owned {{considerable}} ranch land in the area. Ringling was also president of the White Sulphur Springs and Yellowstone Park Railway. After acquiring the Barnum & Bailey Circus, the combined circus had winter quarters in Bridgeport, CT (the birthplace of P.T. Barnum) and later {{near the town of}} Ringling, which was often snow-free unlike most locales at this latitude in the United States. The <b>lower</b> <b>Shields</b> Valley (which contains Ringling and environs) and nearby Big Timber, Montana has one of the warmest average January temperatures in the state of Montana, due to chinook winds (adiabatic warming). This same consistent warming was responsible for the ice-free corridor in the area, which enabled the land bridge traversing ancestors of most Native Americans to enter the mainland of North America during the Pleistocene.|$|R

40|$|This study {{considered}} {{the effect of}} shielding gas parameters (composition, supply method and flow rate) on the post weld thermal properties (thermal expansion, specific heat capacity, thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity) of the weld metal in gas metal arc welding. This is of importance as the thermal properties influences the temperature distribution and therefore the residual stresses and distortion present within the final structure. Due {{to the lack of}} accurate thermal data, computational modelling techniques (such as FEA, CFD, etc.) used for modelling the welding process generally make assumptions regarding the material thermal properties, and it is often the case that the parent material thermal properties are extended to the weld metal, introducing errors to the simulation. It was determined that the weld metal posses considerably different thermal properties to the DH 36 grade steel parent material, and that the shielding gas parameters significantly alter key thermal properties of the solidified weld metal. A <b>lower</b> <b>shielding</b> gas flow rate exhibited beneficial properties including a lower thermal expansion, and higher specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity than a higher shielding gas flow rate...|$|R
