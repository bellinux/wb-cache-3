5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophy}} {{had developed}} Western Europeans’ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised Ancient Greece, the <b>linchpin</b> <b>of</b> Antiquity, {{as it was}} perceived and taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works {{such as those of}} Abbé Barthélemy, Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis (1788), served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|Flagg first {{appeared}} in The Stand as a demonic figure who wreaks havoc after a plague kills most of the population. He makes his second appearance in The Eyes of the Dragon as an evil wizard trying to plunge the fictional medieval city of Delain into chaos. Flagg was a primary antagonist in King's epic series, The Dark Tower, who tries to keep protagonist Roland Deschain from reaching the Tower—the <b>linchpin</b> <b>of</b> existence—so he can claim it for himself and become a god. The Dark Tower expanded on Flagg's background and motivation, linking his previous appearances. Aside from King's novels, Flagg was featured in a television miniseries adaptation of The Stand {{in which he was}} portrayed by Jamey Sheridan and The Dark Tower film adaptation in which he was portrayed by Matthew McConaughey. He has also appeared in Marvel Comics' adaptations of The Dark Tower and The Stand.|$|E
5|$|Ethiopian historiography {{embodies the}} ancient, medieval, early modern and modern {{disciplines}} of recording {{the history of}} Ethiopia, including both native and foreign sources. The roots of Ethiopian historical writing {{can be traced back}} to the ancient Kingdom of Aksum (c. 100 – c. 940 AD). These early texts were written in either the Ethiopian Ge'ez script or the Greek alphabet, and included a variety of mediums such as manuscripts and epigraphic inscriptions on monumental stelae and obelisks documenting contemporary events. The writing of history became an established genre in Ethiopian literature during the early Solomonic dynasty (1270–1974). In this period, written histories were usually in the form of royal biographies and dynastic chronicles, supplemented by hagiographic literature and universal histories in the form of annals. Christian mythology became a <b>linchpin</b> <b>of</b> medieval Ethiopian historiography due to works such as the Orthodox Kebra Nagast. This reinforced the genealogical traditions of Ethiopia's Solomonic dynasty rulers, which asserted that they were descendants of Solomon, the legendary King of Israel.|$|E

5|$|Chauvel {{arrived on}} 12 May 1915 {{and took over}} the {{critical}} sector, which included Pope's Hill and Quinn's, Courtney's and Steele's Posts, from Colonel John Monash. Open to Turkish observation on two sides, these four advanced posts {{at the top of}} Monash Valley were the <b>linchpin</b> <b>of</b> the defence. Chauvel reorganised the defence, appointing permanent commanders for the posts. He also formed special sniper groups who eventually managed to suppress the Turkish snipers, making it safe even for mule trains to move up Monash Valley. Chauvel's brigade soon found itself under heavy pressure from the Turks. On 29 May 1915, the Turks fired a mine under Quinn's Post and broke into it. The permanent commander of the post, Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Cannan was absent on leave and the acting commander, Lieutenant Colonel G. J. Burnage was wounded in the fighting. Chauvel responded by bringing up reserves and appointing a temporary post commander, Lieutenant Colonel H. Pope, with orders to drive the Turks out at all costs. Major S. C. E. Herring was miraculously able to charge across the open practically unscathed, his attack having coincided with a Turkish one on another part of the post so that the Turkish machine gunners could not shoot without hitting their own men. There were in fact only about seventeen Turks in the post, who eventually surrendered. Chauvel's decision may have been the wrong one, but it was decisive; he was also lucky. For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.|$|E

25|$|Another <b>linchpin</b> <b>of</b> {{official}} {{corruption in}} Argentina {{is the lack}} of public access to government information.

Iran was the second Muslim-majority country to recognize Israel as a sovereign nation after Turkey.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 99 - 105. Retrenchments {{have become}} {{increasingly}} prevalent in South Africa affecting those that are retrenched and the survivors of such a process. Despite survivors being the <b>linchpins</b> <b>of</b> future profitability, research on their experiences is limited in this country. This research followed a case study approach and examined survivor experiences in a South African alcoholic beverage organisation. Qualitative data was obtained through fourteen semi-structured interviews with employees who are retrenchment survivors.

[...] Movements of alchemy, life-prolonging techniques, and the quest for [...] "immortality" [...] flourished, yet most mystical allusions remained firmly ground in the Zhuangzi. From the Zhuangzian perspective, the religious experience (etymologically, that which binds together) becomes a personal rapture that elevates one from the microcosmic to an altogether macrocosmic perspective - a perspective that affirms continuity as the fabric of unity - that somehow binds one to the totality of existence in a personal integration and affirmation of all.

25|$|The paseo de Bolívar, in {{the heart}} of Barranquilla, is the most {{important}} avenue {{of the city and the}} place from which it expanded. Until the late nineteenth century it was called Calle Ancha (Broad Street), but in 1886 Mayor Antonio Abello renamed it Abello. In the early twentieth century it was located at the north end of Columbus statue, so it was called Paseo de Colón. In 1937, a plaza was built at its northern end with an equestrian statue of the Liberator Simon Bolívar, a gift from Andrés Obregón to the city in 1919, and it was renamed Paseo de Bolívar. It is the <b>linchpin</b> <b>of</b> the historic center, housing many buildings from the Republican period which are in the process of being restored.|$|E
25|$|Maddux was {{the jewel}} in the much-vaunted Braves trio of Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz, who pitched {{together}} {{for over a}} decade as the core of one of the best pitching staffs {{in the history of the}} game. The three were the <b>linchpin</b> <b>of</b> a team that won its division (the National League West in 1993 and the East from then on) every year that Maddux was on the team (1994 had no division champions). The three pitchers were frequently augmented by other strong starters such as Steve Avery, Kevin Millwood, Denny Neagle, and Russ Ortiz. In 1995, they pitched the Braves to a World Series title. In 29 postseason games with Atlanta, Maddux had a 2.81 ERA and a 1.19 WHIP, but just an 1113 record.|$|E
25|$|The son of {{a member}} of the Royal Air Force, Keenan was brought up in Swatragh, County Londonderry, before his family moved to Belfast.

During this time he {{came to the attention of}} the police when he damaged a cigarette machine, which led to police having his fingerprints on file. Keenan returned to Northern Ireland when the Troubles began, and started working at the Grundig factory in the Finaghy area of Belfast where he acquired a reputation as a radical due to his involvement in factory trade union activities.
