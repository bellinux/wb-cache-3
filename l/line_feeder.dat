40|$|The {{research}} of efficiency and flexibility has forced assembly systems {{to change to}} mixed model assembly lines. Moreover the necessity to reduce inventory has led to pass from single to multi line systems, where some components are assembled in secondary <b>lines,</b> called <b>feeder</b> <b>lines,</b> connected to the main one with a “pull philosophy”. A possible approach to configure such an assembly system is to balance the main line first and use the retrieved cycle time to balance each <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> separately. It is questionable, especially if operators can perform tasks on both the feeder and the main line. In addition, {{the use of a}} single representative “virtual average model” creates overload/idle time at the stations, with negative effects on productivity and buffer space constrains. This paper introduces an innovative balancing procedure in presence of multiple unpaced <b>feeder</b> <b>lines.</b> The proposed approach is compared with the classical one and validated through simulation and industrial applications...|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of modern transmitting equipment {{is designed to}} operate with a resistive load fed via coaxial cable of a particular characteristic impedance, often 50 ohms. To connect the power stage of the transmitter to this coaxial cable transmission line a matching network is required. For solid state transmitters this is typically a broadband transformer which steps up the low impedance of the output devices to 50 ohms. A tube transmitter will contain a tuned output network, most commonly a PI network, that steps the load impedance which the tube requires down to 50 ohms. In each case the power producing devices will not transfer power efficiently if the network is detuned or badly designed or if the antenna presents other than 50 ohms at the transmitter output. Commonly an SWR meter and/or directional wattmeter are used to check {{the extent of the}} match between the aerial system and the transmitter via the transmission <b>line</b> (<b>feeder).</b> A directional wattmeter indicates forward power, reflected power, and often SWR as well. Each transmitter will specify a maximum allowable mismatch based on efficiency, distortion, and possible damage to the transmitter. Many transmitters have automatic circuits to reduce power or shut down if this value is exceeded.|$|E

40|$|Integration of rooftop PVs and {{increasing}} peak {{demand in the}} residential distribution networks has resulted in unacceptable voltage profile. Curtailing PV generation to alleviate overvoltage problem and making regular network investment to cater peak demand is not always feasible.

Furthermore, the need of appropriate feeder distances and R/X ratio for acceptable voltage profile, which can be useful for suburban design and distribution planning, is explored...|$|E
