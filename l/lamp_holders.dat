500|$|The Marie Antoinette Suite is {{accessed}} {{from the}} main restaurant. According to Marcus Binney [...] "the gilded detail of the room has the lustre and crispness of gilt bronze, even the egg-and-dart in the boldly modelled cornice". Floral motifs are a common feature of the room, given the namesake, Marie Antoinette, and represents the flowers at one of her feasts. Over the overmantel is a basket of flowers, with [...] "flowers spilling out over the frames of the oval lunettes". [...] In the small entrance lobby of the suite are two terracotta statues of Spring and Summer, with [...] "drum-shaped pedestals ornamented with gilt-bronze flowers and ribbons". The ventilation grilles, of considerable size, are decorated in bronzed lattice. On the walls are a series <b>lamp</b> <b>holders</b> held by miniature Apollo lyres, with each bulb holder containing around 25 leaves opened out. The lights, according to Binney, are hung on [...] "cords from ribbons tied in bows, entwined at intervals with flowers, descending to a cluster of tassels". [...] The panels of the walls are treated like picture frames, with inner and outer mouldings, {{in contrast to the}} window frames and the wall mirrors which are surrounded by [...] "clusters of reeds, with an inset behind which a curtain could hang without obscuring the moulding", according to Binney.|$|E

[...] Instant start fluorescent tubes simply use a high enough voltage {{to break down the}} gas and mercury column and thereby start arc conduction. These tubes can be identified by a single pin {{at each end of the}} tube. The <b>lamp</b> <b>holders</b> have a [...] "disconnect" [...] socket at the low-voltage end which disconnects the ballast when the tube is removed, to prevent electric shock. In North America, low-cost lighting fixtures with an integrated electronic ballast use instant start on lamps originally designed for preheating, although it shortens lamp life. This ballast technology isn't common outside North America.|$|E

A <b>lamp</b> base is too short to contact the bottom terminal of a fuse holder. However it's possible (but not useful) to screw a DII fuse holder without a fuse in an E27 <b>lamp</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{adapters}} {{for wall}} outlets use an Edison screw, allowing a light socket {{to become an}} ungrounded electrical outlet (such as to install Christmas lights temporarily via a porch light), or to make a pull-chain switch with two outlets, or to split it for two lamps. Another adapter can make a wall outlet into a <b>lamp</b> <b>holder</b> (<b>lamp</b> socket).|$|R

50|$|Around 1980 (in the UK, at least), {{some new}} {{fluorescent}} fittings {{were designed to}} take only the newer, retrofit tubes (the <b>lamp</b> <b>holders</b> are designed not to take T12 tubes, except for 8 ft length). The earlier T12 halophosphate tubes still remained available as spares until 2012. They fit in older fittings and some modern fittings that employ twist lock <b>lamp</b> <b>holders,</b> even though the modern fittings were not electrically designed for them.|$|E

50|$|Edison screw (ES) is a {{standard}} socket for light bulbs in the United States. It was developed by Thomas Edison and was licensed in 1909 under the Mazda trademark. Normally, the bulbs have right-hand threaded metal bases (caps) which screw into matching threaded sockets (<b>lamp</b> <b>holders).</b> For bulbs powered by AC current, the thread is connected to neutral and the contact on the bottom tip of the base is connected to hot.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{an early}} form of {{insulated}} cable, introduced in 1896, {{consisted of two}} impregnated-paper-insulated conductors in an overall lead sheath. Joints were soldered, and special fittings were used for <b>lamp</b> <b>holders</b> and switches. These cables were similar to underground telegraph and telephone cables of the time. Paper-insulated cables proved unsuitable for interior wiring installations because very careful workmanship was required on the lead sheaths to ensure moisture {{did not affect the}} insulation.|$|E

The ceramic infrared heaters (emitters) are manufactured with three basic emitter faces: trough (concave), flat, and bulb or Edison screw element for normal installation via an E27 ceramic <b>lamp</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lamppost {{dates from}} about 1860 and {{is made of}} cast iron by the Sun Foundry of George Smith and Company in Glasgow. It stands on a square-section plinth with waterleaf {{decoration}} on the top edges. The base of the shaft of circular section is encircled with four intertwined heraldric dolphins. The shaft carries four <b>lamp</b> <b>holders</b> by means of scrolled wrought-iron stays. Presumably it was originally lit by gas and subsequently converted to electricity. It is said be the oldest electrical lamppost in Cambridge.|$|E
50|$|Qasr al-‘Ishshah {{exhibits}} some of {{the finest}} examples of lime plaster decoration (malas) in Tarim. The decorative program of the exterior south façade finds its antecedents in Mughal royal architecture, as well as the colonial forms of the Near East, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Interior stucco decoration differs from room to room, including Art Nouveau, Rococo, Neo-Classical and combinations of the three. The ornamentation often incorporates pilasters along the walls framing openings, built-in cabinetry with skilled wood carvings, elaborate column capitals, decorated ceilings, niches and kerosene <b>lamp</b> <b>holders,</b> as well as complex color schemes.|$|E
50|$|At {{some point}} in the 19th century the design was altered, {{probably}} by John Pinch. The pediment was moved to be above the attic storey, so that the attics of the central houses were not deprived of light. Palmer's plan had a carved tympanum in the pediment, but this was never made, probably {{due to a lack of}} funds. Pinch also added balconies with wrought iron railings on the piano nobile (first floor) of all the houses. The iron <b>lamp</b> <b>holders</b> over the entrances to Nos. 7 and 14 are also likely to be Pinch's work.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} parts to a {{recessed}} lighting fixture: housing, trim and bulb. The trim is the visible {{portion of the}} light. It is the insert that is seen when looking up into the fixture, and also includes the thin lining {{around the edge of}} the light. The housing is the fixture itself that is installed inside the ceiling and contains the <b>lamp</b> <b>holder.</b> There are many different types of bulbs that can be inserted into recessed lighting fixtures, with the amount of heat generated by the bulb being a unique consideration.|$|R

5000|$|Soon he {{discovered}} {{that he had to}} design machinery to make its parts. One of the first was a tapping machine, also his patent. Around 1896 with his business in machinery progressing, Hubbell's next patent was a major breakthrough in the fastener industry: the process and machinery for cold rolled screw threads which reduced the rate of material lost in production by more than 50%. He designed and built progressive blanking and forming dies, patented machinery to slot screw heads, a machine to assemble screws and small parts, devised tools to indicate speed, and patented a changeable speed screwdriver. Hubbell's idea was to provide convenience, safety, and control to an electric light with his new [...] "pull socket" [...] which was patented in August 1896. The same familiar device with its on/off pull chain is still in use today. He built three prototypes by hand using metal and insulated wood parts to design a product with individual wires permanently attached in the proper sequence and correct polarity, and one which could be connected or disconnected, easily and safely, to a power supply in the wall. cartridge fuses and fuse block, <b>lamp</b> <b>holders,</b> key sockets - soon followed the same path Later, Hubbell's [...] "separable plug" [...] design took shape on the drawing board back in Bridgeport, and then submitted to the patent office in Washington, D.C. Additional designs based on that basic concept - separable plugs in different configurations, a single flush mounted receptacle - as well as new products for electrical circuits. One of the most successful and the one most familiar today, was the duplex receptacle which is still found everywhere that electrical power is used. In 1901 Hubbell published a 12-page catalogue that listed 63 electrical products of his company's manufacture, and four years later he incorporated his enterprise as Harvey Hubbell, Incorporated , In the same year, the Company registered its trademark of [...] "...a sphere with meridian lines and the name 'Hubbell' centered within." [...] Hubbell's pace of new ideas and product design did not falter. In 1909 the company began constructing a four-floor factory and office building that woul d become the first building in New England made of reinforced concrete.|$|E

40|$|LED {{retrofit}} kits and linear replacement lamps are {{now available}} to convert recessed fluorescent light fixtures (or ‘troffers’) in commercial buildings such as offices and retail. These retrofits re-use the top portion of the existing troffer, so the space above the dropped ceiling is not disturbed. Compared to complete troffer replacement, LED retrofits can usually be installed more quickly, with less dust and disturbance of the occupants. Two types of retrofits are available. LED linear replacement lamps are shaped like fluorescent lamps. They reuse the existing lens, and often the existing <b>lamp</b> <b>holders.</b> Integrated-style LED retrofit kits are not shaped like fluorescent lamps. Some reuse the existing lens, while others provide a new customized lens, to enhance appearance and light distribution. Note that besides LED kits, energy efficient kits with new customized lenses are also available with new fluorescent HPT 8 ’s. A recently published report [1] found that, among 21 LED troffer products purchased in summer 2012, most dedicated LED troffers performed better than most LED retrofits.
