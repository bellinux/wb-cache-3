The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate whether host-plant volatiles from foliar extracts of hop, Humulus lupulus L.

Eighty-nine volatile compounds were detected in a non-concentrated methanol extract of hop by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 11 of which elicited an EAG response. Concentration of the crude extract significantly reduced <b>landing</b> <b>rates</b> on artificial leaves treated with the sample due to loss of volatile compounds, but after landing the oviposition response of gravid females was not affected. A mixture of eight commercially available EAG-active volatiles increased the <b>landing</b> <b>rate</b> of gravid females to their source but did not act as oviposition stimulants. Dividing the volatile compounds into two groups - consisting of (1) hexanal, (E) - 2 -hexenal, octanal, nonanal, and decanal, and (2) sulcatone, humulene, and benzyl alcohol - obliterated effectiveness, revealing synergism between compounds.

40|$|The article {{contains}} a proposal of the methodology {{for the creation of}} resources, monetary funds into agriculture by way of tax savings. Those are created by way of the utilization of items deductible from the tax base. The average official price of agricultural land for the cadastral area and a proposed “land rate” (3. 3 %) were used for the calculation of deductible items. The <b>land</b> <b>rate</b> was calculated as the inverse value of the return time for investments in agricultural land. The calculated tax savings according to the relevant tax rate and the amount of the deductible item constitutes the amount of CZK 306 - 388 /ha of agricultural land {{depending on the type of}} business entity. The arisen savings correspond, for example, to the compensation for the cancelled TOP-UP (2010) payments for agricultural land. Other reserves within the current economic system (untaxed agricultural subsidies) could also lead, for example, to the protection of the agricultural land fund in terms of quantity and quality.

40|$|Developers and {{contractors}} nowadays {{need to be}} aware of the extent of soil erosion at construction sites by estimating annual soil loss precisely so Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (ESCP) can be implemented with reasonable cost. Soil erosion at construction site that mainly caused by massive earthworks activities could endanger environment by clogging drains with excessive sediments and conducing flash flood in a long term run. Hence, one of the objectives of this research is to determine a suitable method either by Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) or Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) by comparing the soil loss rates and also differentiate the methods. Simultaneously, a RUSLE software program is developed.

Yet, the contribution of marsh oiling to landscape-scale degradation and subsequent land loss {{has been difficult to}} quantify. Here, we applied advanced remote sensing techniques to map changes in marsh land cover and open water before and after oiling. We segmented the marsh shorelines into non-oiled and oiled reaches and calculated the <b>land</b> loss <b>rates</b> for each 10 % increase in oil cover (e. g. 0 % to > 70 %), to determine if <b>land</b> loss <b>rates</b> for each reach oiling category were significantly different before and after oiling. Finally, we calculated background land-loss rates to separate natural and oil-related erosion and land loss. Oiling caused significant increases in land losses, particularly along reaches of heavy oiling (> 20 % oil cover). For reaches with ≥ 20 % oiling, <b>land</b> loss <b>rates</b> increased abruptly during the 2010 - 2013 period, and the loss rates during this period are significantly different from both the pre-oiling (p < 0. 0001) and 2013 - 2016 post-oiling periods (p < 0. 0001). The pre-oiling and 2013 - 2016 post-oiling periods exhibit no significant differences in <b>land</b> loss <b>rates</b> across oiled and non-oiled reaches (p = 0. 557).
