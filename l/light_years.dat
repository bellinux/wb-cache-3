5|$|GJ 3634 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.95. Thus, despite its proximity at 19.8 parsecs (64.6 <b>light</b> <b>years)</b> {{away from the}} Earth, it cannot be seen with the unaided eye. The star is of a similar distance from Earth as planet-bearing 51 Pegasi, which lies {{at a distance of}} 14.7 parsecs (47.95 <b>light</b> <b>years).</b>|$|E
5|$|Lying a {{few degrees}} west of Beta is Delta Pavonis, a nearby Sun-like but more evolved star; this is a yellow subgiant of {{spectral}} type G8IV and apparent magnitude 3.56 that is only 19.9 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> distant from Earth. East of Beta and at the constellation's eastern border with Indus is Gamma Pavonis, a fainter, solar-type star 30 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> from Earth with a magnitude of 4.22 and stellar class F9V. Other nearby stars in Pavo are much fainter: SCR 1845-6357 (the nearest star in Pavo) is a binary system with an apparent magnitude of 17.4 consisting of a red dwarf and brown dwarf companion lying around 12.6 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> distant, while Gliese 693 is a red dwarf of magnitude 10.78 lying 19 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> away.|$|E

It was first discovered in 2010, and the central galaxy is producing an estimated 740 new stars a year. Larger still is El Gordo, or officially ACT-CL J0102-4915, whose discovery was announced in 2012. Located around 7.2 billion <b>light</b> <b>years</b> away, it is composed of two subclusters in the process of colliding, resulting in the spewing out of hot gas, seen in X-rays and infrared images.|$|E
5|$|Alpha Apodis is {{an orange}} giant of {{spectral}} type K3III located 447 ± 8 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> away from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 3.8. It {{spent much of}} its life as a blue-white (B-type) main sequence star before expanding, cooling and brightening as it used up its core hydrogen. It has swollen to 48 times the Sun's diameter, and shines with a luminosity approximately 928 {{times that of the}} Sun, with a surface temperature of 4312 K. Beta Apodis is an orange giant 157 ± 2 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> away, with a magnitude of 4.2. It is around 1.84 times as massive as the Sun, with a surface temperature of 4677 K. Gamma Apodis is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III located 156 ± 1 light-years away, with a magnitude of 3.87. It is approximately 63 times as luminous the Sun, with a surface temperature of 5279 K. Delta Apodis is a double star, the two components of which are 103 arcseconds apart and visible through binoculars. Delta1 is a red giant star of spectral type M4III located 760 ± 30 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> away. It is a semiregular variable that varies from magnitude +4.66 to +4.87, with pulsations of multiple periods of 68.0, 94.9 and 101.7 days. Delta2 is an orange giant star of spectral type K3III, located 610 ± 30 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> away, with a magnitude of 5.3. The separate components can be resolved with the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{are very}} bright as {{observed}} from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a bolometric flux comparable to a bright star {{of our galaxy}} despite a distance of billions of <b>light</b> <b>years</b> (compared to a few tens of <b>light</b> <b>years</b> for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. GRB 080319B, for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude of 5.8, {{comparable to that of}} the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion <b>light</b> <b>years.</b> This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the rest-mass energy of the Sun (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).|$|E

5|$|IK Pegasi (or HR 8210) is {{a binary}} star {{system in the}} {{constellation}} Pegasus. It is just luminous enough {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye, at a distance of about 150 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> from the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|In {{the north}} of the {{constellation}} is the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, a dark molecular cloud with many embedded reflection nebulae, including NGC 6729, NGC 6726–7, and IC 4812. A star-forming region of around , it contains Herbig–Haro objects (protostars) and some very young stars. About 430 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> (130 parsecs) away, {{it is one of the}} closest star-forming regions to the Solar System. The related NGC 6726 and 6727, along with unrelated NGC 6729, were first recorded by Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt in 1865.

5|$|Located in {{the west}} of the {{constellation}} and depicting the peacock's tail are Eta and Xi Pavonis. At apparent magnitude 3.6, Eta is a luminous orange giant of spectral type K2II some 350 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> distant from Earth. Xi Pavonis is a multiple star system visible in small telescopes as a brighter orange star and fainter white companion. Located around 470 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> from Earth, the system has a magnitude of 4.38. AR Pavonis is a faint but well-studied eclipsing binary composed of a red giant and smaller hotter star some 18000 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> from Earth. It has some features of a cataclysmic variable, the smaller component most likely having an accretion disc. The visual magnitude ranges from 7.4 to 13.6 over 605 days.|$|E
5|$|The cluster {{core radius}} is about 8 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> and tidal radius is about 43 <b>light</b> <b>years.</b> The cluster {{contains}} over 1,000 statistically confirmed members, although this figure excludes unresolved binary stars. Its light {{is dominated by}} young, hot blue stars, up to 14 {{of which can be}} seen with the naked eye depending on local observing conditions. The arrangement of the brightest stars is somewhat similar to Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. The total mass contained in the cluster is estimated to be about 800 solar masses and is dominated by fainter and redder stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to Beta Pictoris {{and many other}} stars {{was measured by the}} Hipparcos satellite. This was done by measuring its trigonometric parallax: the slight displacement in its position observed as the Earth moves around the Sun. Beta Pictoris was found to exhibit a parallax of 51.87 milliarcseconds, a value which was later revised to 51.44 milliarcseconds when the data was reanalyzed taking systematic errors more carefully into account. The {{distance to}} Beta Pictoris is therefore 63.4 <b>light</b> <b>years,</b> with an uncertainty of 0.1 <b>light</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{distance}} to the IK Pegasi system can be measured directly by observing the tiny parallax shifts of this system (against the more distant stellar background) as the Earth orbits around the Sun. This shift was measured to high precision by the Hipparcos spacecraft, yielding a distance estimate of 150 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> (with an accuracy of ±5 <b>light</b> <b>years).</b> The same spacecraft also measured the proper motion of this system. This is the small angular motion of IK Pegasi across the sky because of its motion through space.|$|E

5|$|Zeta Coronae Australis is {{a rapidly}} {{rotating}} main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 4.8, 221.7 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> from Earth. The star has blurred lines in its hydrogen spectrum {{due to its}} rotation. Its spectral type is B9V. Theta Coronae Australis lies further to the west, a yellow giant of spectral type G8III and apparent magnitude 4.62. Corona Australis harbours RX J1856.5-3754, an isolated neutron star that is thought to lie 140 (±40) parsecs, or 460 (±130) <b>light</b> <b>years,</b> away, with a diameter of 14km.

5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{made by the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, Mu Arae {{exhibits a}} parallax of 64.47 milliarcseconds as the Earth moves around the Sun.
