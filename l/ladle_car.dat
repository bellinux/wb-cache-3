5000|$|... #Caption: [...] An {{arc furnace}} pouring out steel {{into a small}} <b>ladle</b> <b>car.</b> The {{transformer}} vault {{can be seen at}} {{the right side of the}} picture. For scale, note the operator standing on the platform at upper left. This is a 1941-era photograph and so does not have the extensive dust collection system that a modern installation would have, nor is the operator wearing a hard hat or dust mask.|$|E
5000|$|Until recently, {{pig iron}} was {{typically}} poured {{directly out of}} {{the bottom of the}} blast furnace through a [...] into a <b>ladle</b> <b>car</b> for transfer to the steel mill in mostly liquid form; in this state, the pig iron was referred to as hot metal. The hot metal was then poured into a steelmaking vessel to produce steel, typically an electric arc furnace, induction furnace or basic oxygen furnace, where the excess carbon is burned off and the alloy composition controlled. Earlier processes for this included the finery forge, the puddling furnace, the Bessemer process, and the open hearth furnace.|$|E
40|$|Abstract To {{inspect the}} {{refractory}} of torpedo <b>ladle</b> <b>car</b> at high temperature {{is effective in}} expanding its service life and reducing its maintenance cost, preventing metal break out. As to metal impact area, the refractory thickness could not be inspected by thermal analysis of outer steel shell. The refractory thickness meter was installed at torpedo repair shop for evaluating its measurement stability and refractory thickness measurement accuracy. It has two surface profile maters using laser rangefinder equipped with two tilt stages, facing each other. It measures the inner refractory profile and the outer steel shell profile at one time to calculate the accurate refractory thickness without influence {{of the outer shell}} deformation. After 90 minutes from discharging molten iron, it could achieve stable measurement without the influence of fume and heat haze, and could measure the refractory thickness with a good accuracy of 7. 3 mm (1 sigma) ...|$|E
50|$|For the {{transportation}} of very {{large volumes of}} molten metal, such as in steel mills, the ladle can run on wheels, a purpose-built <b>ladle</b> transfer <b>car</b> or be slung from an overhead crane and will be tilted using a second overhead lifting device.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>ladle</b> {{transfer}} <b>car</b> is {{a material}} handling tool {{which is used}} in foundries. The car carries a metal ladle, typically torpedo-shaped (with two pointed ends), from one location to another for processing molten liquid metal. It can also be called a molten steel transporter or a Tundish transfer car.|$|R

Using the {{mechanical}} {{design of the}} software Solid works to established the 280 t LF the <b>ladle</b> furnace transportation <b>car</b> frame three dimensional model, and by using the finite element analysis of software Cosmos/works to static analysis for the frames, revealing that the frame of structure stress and strain distribution map of the frame, and also reveals that dangerous points and dangerous sections. Using resistance strain gauge to measure 280 t <b>ladle</b> transportation <b>car</b> frame, it is concluded that the frame of stress and strain distributions. Through the electrical measurement test the results were compared with finite element analysis results, further proof that the finite element analysis of {{the accuracy of the}} results provides theory basis for the optimization design of the frames...|$|R
40|$|In 1994, the fume {{collection}} {{system for the}} Desulphurization Station at Dofasco Inc., Hamilton, Ontario was studied for energy and maintenance optimization. The existing system consisted of two 600 hp fans on a wet scrubber system for two collection hoods and one 600 hp fan on a baghouse collection system for two more collection hoods. The fans for the wet system had been an ongoing maintenance problem with frequent outages due to build-up problems. The scrubber fans were approximately 20 years old while the dust collector was 14 years old. The two scrubber fans were rated at 50, 000 cfm at 55 in. wg (inches water gauge). The baghouse fan was rated at 105, 000 cfm at 17. 5 in. wg. All fans were controlled by inlet dampers which adjusted to a - 4 in. wg inlet pressure set-point depending on whether zero, {{one or both of}} the hoods for a particular system pair were open. The engineering feasibility study completed by FLOWCARE Engineering Inc. was able to prove the following. ?	Through timing changes to the incoming <b>ladle</b> <b>cars,</b> three hoods would be sufficient without affecting production. ?	By adding tip extensions to the fan wheel, the baghouse was able to handle 3 hoods simultaneously. ?	 Wet scrubber could be shut down. The entire project was implemented with 100 % success within two months after studying. The final result was that $ 244, 115 are now saved annually due to scrubber shutdown. Total implementation costs were $ 22, 000. As an added bonus, hood capture volumes were proved to have been increased slightly. This eliminated a small fugitive emission problem that had existed on the hoods of the scrubber system...|$|R
5000|$|The Hot Metal Bridge is a {{truss bridge}} in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that crosses the Monongahela River. The bridge {{consists}} of two parallel spans on a single set of piers: the former Monongahela Connecting Railroad Bridge, built in 1887, on the upstream side and the former Hot Metal Bridge, built in 1900, on the downstream side. The Monongahela Connecting Railroad Bridge carried conventional railroad traffic, while the Hot Metal Bridge connected parts of the J&L Steel mill, carrying crucibles of molten iron from the blast furnaces in <b>ladle</b> transfer <b>cars</b> to the open hearth furnaces on the opposite bank to be converted to steel. During World War II 15% of America's steel making capacity crossed over the Hot Metal Bridge, up to 180 tons per hour. The upstream span was converted to road use after a $14.6 million restoration, and opened by Mayor Murphy with a ceremony honoring former steel workers on June 23, 2000. [...] The bridge connects 2nd Avenue at the Pittsburgh Technology Center in South Oakland with Hot Metal Street (South 29th Street) in the South Side. The downstream span reopened for pedestrian and bicycle use in late 2007 {{after two years of}} work. The Great Allegheny Passage hiker/biker trail passes over this bridge as it approaches Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle area.|$|R
