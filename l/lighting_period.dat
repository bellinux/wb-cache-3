40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2012. Major: Bioproducts/Biosystems Science Engineering and Management. Advisor:Dr. Roger Ruan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 181 pages. There has been {{renewed interest in}} bio-fuel production {{over the past decade}} due to the sharp rise in fossil fuel prices and increasing concerns about the global climate change. This dissertation was inspired by the idea of coupling algae based biofuel generation and municipal wastewaster treatment. The objectives of this study are to employ potential algae strains for efficient simultaneous biodiesel production and wastewater nutrients removal, and to develop an operational strategy optimal for biomass and biodiesel production as well as nutrient removal from a highly concentrated municipal wastewater stream, centrate, which is generated during the sludge thickening process. In the first stage, the feasibility of growing Chlorella sp. in the centrate for simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy production was tested. The characteristics of algal growth, biodiesel production, wastewater nutrient removal and the viability of scale-up and the stability of continuous operation were examined. Two culture media, namely autoclaved centrate (AC) and raw centrate (RC) were used for comparison. The results showed {{that by the end of}} a 14 -day batch culture, algae could remove ammonia, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) by 93. 9 %, 89. 1 %, 80. 9 %, and 90. 8 %, respectively from raw centrate, and the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content was 11. 04 % of dry biomass providing a biodiesel yield of 0. 12 g-biodiesel/L-algae culture solution. The system could be successfully scaled up, and continuously operated at 50 % daily harvesting rate, providing a net biomass productivity of 0. 92 g-algae/(L·day). The second stage was targeted at screening one or several algae species/strains that can survive and grow well in centrate with high biomass and lipid productivity as well as superior nutrient removal efficiency, and investigating the significance of environmental factors including ligh intensity, light/dark cyle, and exogenous CO 2 on biomass accumulation and biodiesel production using Plackett-Burman experiment design. In this stage the study was carried out in two sections, namely using aglae strains collected from local lake areas and those purchased from algae commercial bank, respectivity. In the first section, sixty algae-like microorganisms collected from different sampling sites in Minnesota were examined using multi-step screening and acclimation procedures to select high-lipid producing facultative heterotrophic microalgae strains capable of growing on centrate for simultaneous energy crop production and wastewater treatment. Twenty-seven facultative heterotrophic microalgae strains were found, among which seventeen strains were proved to be tolerant to centrate. These seventeen top-performing strains were identified through morphological observation and DNA sequencing as Chlorella sp., Heynigia sp., Hindakia sp., Micractinium sp., and Scenedesmus sp [...] Five strains were chosen for other studies because of their ability to adapt to centrate, high growth rates (0. 455 - 0. 498 d- 1) and higher lipid productivities (74. 5 – 77. 8 mg L- 1 d- 1). These strains are considered highly promising compared with other strains reported in the literature. In the second section, 143 different algae strains from the family of Chlamydomonas, Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Ankistrodesmus, Euglena, Chloroccum, and Botryococcus, etc. purchased from a number of U. S. institutions were screened use the same multi-step screening and acclimation procedures. The results showed that 14 algae strains from the genus of Chlorella, Haematococcus, Scenedesmus, Chlamydomonas, and Chloroccum were capable of growing on centrate. Since the highest net biomass accumulation (2. 0143 g/L) was observed with Chlorella kessleri (UTEX 398) followed by Chlorella protothecoides (UTEX 25, 1. 3089 g/L), the two strains were used in further studies. It is found that both algae strains, UTEX 398 and UTEX 25 were capable of mixotrophic growth when cultivated on centrate. Environmental factors had significant effect on algal biomass accumulation, wastewater nutrients removal and biodiesel production for both strains. Higher light intensity and exogenous CO 2 concentration with longer <b>lighting</b> <b>period</b> promote biomass accumulation, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) formation, removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN), while, lower exogenous CO 2 concentration promotes phosphorus removal due to higher pH increase. In the third stage, the single effect of light intensity on biomass accumulation, wastewater nutrient removal through algae cultivation, and biodiesel productivity was investigated with algae species Chlorella kessleri and Chlorella protothecoide. The light intensities studied were 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 200 μmolm- 2 s- 1. The results showed that light intensity had profound impact on tested responses for both strains, and the dependence of these responses on light intensity varied with different algae strains. For Chlorella kessleri, the optimum light intensity was 120 μmol·m- 2 ·S- 1 for all responses except for COD removal. For Chlorella protothecoide, the optimum light intensity was 30 μmol·m- 2 ·S- 1. The major components of the biodiesel produced from algae biomass were 16 -C and 18 -C FAME, and the highest biodiesel contents were 24. 19 % and 19. 48 % of dried biomass for Chlorella kessleri and Chlorella protothecoide, respectively. Both species were capable of wastewater nutrients removal under all lighting conditions with high removal efficiencies. Since Chlorella kessleri showed superior capability of biomass accumulation and biodiesel production, it was used in the following sections. The fourth stage was aimed at investigating the single effect of light/dark cycle at low light frequency on algae based biodiesel production using centrate wastewater stream with mixotrophic strain Chlorella kessleri. The data suggested that the length of <b>lighting</b> <b>period</b> during a day greatly affects the algal biomass accumulation, biodiesel production and wastewater nutrients removal. The biomass concentration, biodiesel content and the removal of ammonia, total nitrogen and total phosphorus all increased with increasing <b>lighting</b> <b>period.</b> However, the removal of COD showed different trend, with higher removal rate observed under shorter <b>lighting</b> <b>period.</b> The results showed that for maximum biomass accumulation, biodiesel production and wastewater nutrients removal in batch culture system, the optimum <b>lighting</b> <b>period</b> is 16 hours and the cultivation time should be controlled at three days. In the fifth stage, the effect of supplying different concentrations of exogenous CO 2 uder various light intensities at simulated light/dark cycle on biomass accumulation and wastewater nutrients removal was tested with aglae strain Chlorella kessleri. The results confirmed that there was an optimum CO 2 level for algae growth, which is 2. 5 % for this investigation. When the light intensity reached a certain lower limit, the effect of CO 2 supplementation became minimum because the photoautotrophic efficiency was significantly reduced. It is also found that a future study to investigate the effects of environmental factors on biomass and biodiesel production under continuous or fed-batch cultivation mode, where wastewater is continuously replenished and algae was harvested, would be valuable due to the fact that the nutrients was depleted and the algae biomass concentration decreased on Day 8. The objective of the last stage was to optimize the operational parameters, including light intensity, light-dark cycle, exogenous carbon dioxide concentration, and hydraulic retention time (HRT), for high algae biomass accumulation, biodiesel production and wastewater nutrients removal in designed fed-batch culture system. The results showed that response surface methodology with central composite design is effective in system optimization for algal-based biodiesel production using centrate wastewater in fed-batch culture. The regression analysis illustrates that, at p-value< 0. 05, harvesting rate, light intensity and <b>lighting</b> <b>period</b> had significant effect on biomass concentration, biomass and biodiesel yield, as well as ammonia removal rate. Hydraulic retention time and exogenous CO 2 concentration played important role in FAME content, while the removal rates of toal nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) could not be explained by quadratic models. The optimum conditions for biodiesel production are hydraulic retention time of 2. 86 days, which means harvesting 35 % of the total volume daily, light intensity of 190 µmolm- 2 s- 1 and <b>lighting</b> <b>period</b> of 10 h...|$|E

40|$|THE {{production}} of turkey hatching eggs {{on a commercial}} scale has brought out the problems of increasing the egg {{production of}} the breeding females, and of producing earlier eggs to supply the de-mand for early poults. From the results of previous experimental work {{it would seem that}} the use of artificial lights might be the most promising method of obtaining these results. While work has been reported indi-cating that turkeys can be brought into production earlier by the use of artificial lights, the length of the <b>lighting</b> <b>period</b> prior to production has not been determined definitely and the effect of lights upon early fertility seemed debatable, although Al-bright and Thompson (1933, 1934) had obtained some evidence that the use of artificial lights injured neither the birds nor the hatchability. These workers also re-ported that egg production could be in-creased by the use of artificial lights, hav-ing obtained an average annual record of 124. 8 eggs for 14 bronze pullets. It was found in this work that the first egg was produced on December 26 when morning lights were begun on December 1. Since this work was done in Oklahoma, there was some question as to whether the same relative time would be required for the onset of production in more northern latitudes. Moore and Berridge (1934) found that when morning lights were turned on a...|$|E
40|$|Photosynthesis {{characteristics}} of tomato plants grown under LED modules that produced blue, green, red, and white light were determined. Photosynthesis rates at low light intensity of plants grown and measured {{under the same}} colour {{related to each other}} as: white › red › green › blue. However, rates measured under red/blue light also related to each other as: blue › white › red = green. Photosynthesis rates at high light intensity measured under red/blue light related to each other as: blue › white › red › green. The INTKAM crop growth model was used to quantify the potential effects of light colours and levels on crop photosynthesis and seasonal growth and production. INTKAM was extended with 1) spectral composition of light, 2) light extinction profiles for different wavelengths, 3) colour effects on initial light use efficiency, and 4) on maximum carboxylation capacity. Various scenarios were examined, in which light colours provided with LEDs were or were not combined with solar radiation, and varied over the day. Daily PAR and initial light use efficiency were important causes of simulated differences in total dry matter production. The effects of differences in maximum carboxylation capacity proved small during the winter season with low light levels. A longer duration of <b>lighting</b> <b>period</b> also proved effective, even if the total light input was kept the same, due to the non-linearity of the photosynthesis-light response curve at lower light intensities...|$|E

40|$|Photosynthetic {{performance}} was examined in Skeletonema costatum (Greville) Cleve. under 12 : 12 -h light: dark (LD) cycle at ambient CO 2 (350 muL L- 1) and elevated CO 2 (1000 muL L- 1). At ambient CO 2, the cellular chlorophyll a content, the light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P-m), the initial {{slope of the}} light saturation curves (a), the photochemical efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m), the apparent carboxylating efficiency (ACE) and the photosynthetic affinity for CO 2 [1 /K-m (CO 2) ] all showed rhythmical changes with different amplitudes during the <b>light</b> <b>period.</b> The P-m had similar changing pattern in the <b>light</b> <b>period</b> with the ACE and 1 /K-m (CO 2) rather than with the alpha and F-v/F-m, indicating that rhythmical changes of photosynthetic capacity may be mainly controlled by the activity of C- reduction associated with CO 2 uptake during the <b>light</b> <b>period.</b> The CO 2 enrichment reduced the ACE and the affinity to CO 2, and increased the a, cellular chlorophyll a content and P m based on cell number. By contrast, the changing patterns of all photosynthetic parameters examined here during the <b>light</b> <b>period</b> had almost the same for cells grown at ambient CO 2 and elevated CO 2, suggesting that the photosynthetic rhythms of S. costatum are not affected by CO 2 enrichment...|$|R
40|$|Five week-old Pannon White rabbits were {{housed in}} a closed climatized rabbitry and {{randomly}} assigned to pens (56 rabbits) having a basic area of 1 m 2 with a stocking density of 16 and 12 rabbits/m 2 or to 18 individual cages (0. 24 m 2; 1 rabbit/cage; stocking density of 4 rabbits/m 2). The pens and the cages were divided into 2 parts and animals could move freely among the 2 parts through swing doors. The vertical sides of {{one part of the}} pens and cages were completely covered with mirrors while the other part was covered with white plastic panels. A 24 hour video recording was performed twice a week using infrared cameras and the number of rabbits in each pen and cage was counted with a frequency of 15 minutes (96 times a day). The duration of the trial was 6 weeks. The <b>lighting</b> <b>period</b> was 16 L/ 8 D. Rabbits were fed ad libitum a standard diet and water was available ad libitum from nipple drinkers. Throughout the entire rearing period 67 % of the individually caged rabbits showed a preference for the part of the cage enriched with mirrors (P< 0. 001). This preference slightly decreased with increasing age. The strong preference toward the part of the cage provided with mirror walls was independent of the time of day.

40|$|In two {{experiments}} {{the free}} choice of growing rabbits among cages with different length of feeders {{and the effect}} of the length of the feeder on the rabbits ’ growth were examined. Experiments were carried out on the rabbit farm of the University of Kaposvár using Pannon White rabbits. The temperature of the rabbit house was 16 - 18 oC on average and a 16 L: 8 D <b>lighting</b> <b>period</b> was applied. Rabbits were fed ad libitum a commercial diet in pellet and water was available ad libitum from nipple drinkers. In the first experiment 24 growing rabbits were reared in cage blocks (1. 5 m 2 floor-area, 16 rabbits/m 2) from 5 to 10 weeks of age (n= 144). The blocks consisted of 4 cages of the same size and the rabbits could move freely among the cages through swing doors. The cages only differed {{in the size of the}} feeder. In the various cages the lengths of the feeders were 10, 20, 30 or 40 cm, respectively. Using infrared cameras 24 hour video recordings were performed once a week and the number of rabbits in the cages was counted for 30 minutes. Feed consumption was measured weekly using the different sized feeders. The experiment was carried out in 6 repetitions. Although the choice of the cages with different sized feeders was significantly different in all weeks, only a small difference in the choice across the whole experimental period was observed: 22, 25, 26 and 27 % o...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the immunohistochemical expression of proliferative, apoptotic and steroidogenic enzyme markers in the ovaries of rats with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods: twenty rats {{were divided into two}} groups: GCtrl - estrous phase, and PCOS - with polycystic ovaries. The GCtrl animals were subjected to a <b>lighting</b> <b>period</b> from 7 am to 7 pm, while the animals with PCOS group remained with continuous lighting for 60 days. Subsequently, the animals were anesthetized, the ovaries were removed and fixed in 10 % formaldehyde, prior to paraffin embedding. Sections were stained using H. E. or subjected to immunohistochemical methods for the detection of Ki- 67, cleaved caspase- 3, CYP 11 A 1, CYP 17 A 1 and CYP 19 A 1. The results were analyzed using Student's t-test (p < 0, 05). Results: morphological results showed evidence of interstitial cells originating from the inner theca cells of degenerating ovarian cysts in PCOS. Immunoexpression of Ki- 67 was higher in the granulosa cells in GCtrl, and the theca interna cells in PCOS, while cleaved caspase- 3 was higher in granulosa cells of ovarian cysts from PCOS and in the theca interna cells of GCtrl. Immunoreactivity of CYP 11 A 1 in the theca interna, granulosa and interstitial cells was similar between the two groups, while CYP 17 A 1 and CYP 19 A 1 were higher in the granulosa and interstitial cells in the PCOS group. Conclusion: the results indicate that the interstitial cells are derived from the theca interna and that enzymatic changes occur in the theca interna and interstitial cells in ovaries of rats with PCOS, responsible for the high levels of androgens and estradiol...|$|E
40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} {{activity of the}} green alga Scenedesmus quadricauda was investigated during synchronous growth in light/dark cycles. The rate of O 2 evolution increased 2 -fold during the first 3 to 4 h of the <b>light</b> <b>period,</b> remained high for the next 3 to 4 h, and then declined during {{the last half of}} the <b>light</b> <b>period.</b> During cell division, which occurred at the beginning of the dark period, the ability of the cells to evolve O 2 was at a minimum. To determine if photosystem II (PSII) controls the photosynthetic capacity of the cells during the cell cycle we measured PSII activity and heterogeneity. Measurements of electron-transport activity revealed two populations of PSII, active centers that contribute to carbon reduction and inactive centers that do not. Measurements of PSII antenna sizes also revealed two populations, PSIIα and PSIIβ, which differ from one another by their antenna size. During the early <b>light</b> <b>period</b> the photosynthetic capacity of the cells doubled, the O 2 -evolving capacity of PSII was nearly constant, the proportion of PSIIβ centers decreased to nearly zero, and the proportion of inactive PSII centers remained constant. During the period of minimum {{photosynthetic activity}} 30 % of the PSII centers were insensitive to the inhibitor 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea, which may be related to reorganization of the thylakoid membrane. We conclude from these results that PSII does not limit the photosynthetic activity of the cells during the first half of the <b>light</b> <b>period.</b> However, the decline in photosynthetic activity observed during {{the last half of the}} <b>light</b> <b>period</b> can be accounted for by limited PSII activity...|$|R
