40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} the PARIS {{approach}} for improving complex problem solving by learning from previous cases. In this approach, abstract planning cases are learned from given concrete cases. For this purpose, {{we have developed}} a new abstraction methodology that allows to completely change the representation <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planning <b>case,</b> when the concrete and abstract languages are given by the user. Furthermore, we present a learning algorithm which is correct and complete {{with respect to the}} introduced model. An empirical study in the domain of process planning in mechanical engineering shows significant improvements in planning efficiency through learning abstract <b>cases</b> while <b>an</b> explanation-based learning method only causes a very slight improvement...|$|R

This paper introduces social judgment theory to linguists, economists, and strategic planners, as a potentially useful theoretical and methodological tool for the assessment of the value <b>of</b> <b>language.</b> <b>A</b> <b>case</b> study is provided as <b>an</b> illustration <b>of</b> how the judgment paradigm can be used for both research and decision making purposes...|$|R
40|$|Most {{software}} {{systems are}} complex and composed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large number <b>of</b> artifacts. To realize each different artifact specific techniques are used resorting to different abstractions, languages and tools. Successful composition of different elements requires coherence among them. Unfortunately constraints between artifacts written in different languages are usually not formally expressed nor checked by supporting tools; as a consequence they can be <b>a</b> source <b>of</b> problems. In this paper we explore {{the role of the}} relations between artifacts written in different <b>languages</b> by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study on the Hadoop open source project. We present the problem introducing its terminology, we quantify the phenomenon and investigate its relation with defect proneness...|$|R
5000|$|Its {{earliest}} cited {{use by the}} United States Supreme Court was in {{an opinion}} by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph McKenna in Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co., 242 U.S. 539 (1917), <b>a</b> <b>case</b> that addressed the constitutionality of state securities laws. Oddly, McKenna is frequently (and erroneously) given credit for inventing the term, even though J. N. Dolley used the term when pushing for passage of the Kansas statute in 1910, and McKenna's own opinion in Hall itself attributes the term to an unnamed, earlier source: [...] The name that {{is given to the}} law indicates the evil at which it is aimed, that is, to use the <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cited <b>case,</b> [...] "speculative schemes which have no more basis than so many feet of 'blue sky'"; or, as stated by counsel in another case, [...] "to stop the sale of stock in fly-by-night concerns, visionary oil wells, distant gold mines and other like fraudulent exploitations." [...] Even if the descriptions be regarded as rhetorical, the existence of evil is indicated, and <b>a</b> belief <b>of</b> its detriment; and we shall not pause to do more than state that the prevention of deception is within the competency of government and that the appreciation of the consequences of it is not open for our review.|$|R

The World Health Organization 2 ̆ 7 s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a shared {{language and}} conceptual framework that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. This paper will familiarize readers with the ICF and describe the biopsychosocial perspective that is adopted in its conceptual framework and <b>language.</b> The presentation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study will illustrate how the ICF can enhance interprofessional learning by promoting <b>a</b> multidimensional perspective <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individual 2 ̆ 7 s health concerns. The case study will also highlight the value <b>of</b> the shared <b>language</b> and conceptual framework of the ICF for interprofessional collaboration. It is argued that a strong foundation in the principles exemplified by the ICF may serve to enhance interprofessional communication, and in so doing, encourage involvement in interprofessional collaboration and healthcare...|$|R
40|$|In {{the realm}} <b>of</b> <b>language</b> <b>a</b> special <b>case</b> <b>of</b> mimetic {{illusion}} is the calembour, where the sound <b>of</b> <b>a</b> phrase signifies something else {{than what is}} written. At {{the end of the}} XVI century the artistic expression of this phenomenon gave birth to the paintings of Arcimboldo, who separated the contour <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object form the linear organization of the surface, in order to feature another object, through <b>a</b> kind <b>of</b> “polyphonic” dissociation between meaning and form. Strangely enough, nothing has been written, in modern musicology, about the musical analogue of this phenomenon, but one can prove that it was not confined to paintings. The art of dissociating signs and meanings, was very well known by musicians not only through poetics, but also through musical mathematics, and above all by the study of the ancient Greek theory of metabolai, about the qualitative change <b>of</b> <b>an</b> harmonic form through the ambiguity created with others forms. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to look into the knowledge-intensive work that entangles the use of various visual {{representations}} such as drawings, CAD images, and scale models. Rather than assuming that knowledge is exclusively residing in the human cognitive capacities, most knowledge-intensive work integrates <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> perceptual skills and the use <b>of</b> <b>language.</b> Design/methodology/approach: <b>A</b> <b>case</b> study <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Scandinavian architect bureau, including semi-structured interviews with architects, design engineers and managers, was conducted. Findings: The study shows that architects mobilize and use <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> visual representations in their day-to-day work. Such visual representations serve <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> roles and purposes but actually more generally enhance communication between colleagues and external stakeholders. The paper concludes that visuality and visual representations deserve a more adequate analysis in the knowledge management literature. Originality/value: The paper contributes to <b>an</b> understanding <b>of</b> how visual representations are constitutive of knowledge and central to architect work. Rather than residing in language or being embodied, knowledge is developed through the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> tools and aids...|$|R
40|$|Can a {{knowledge}} level layer be individuated in the Semantic Grid infrastructure? Is {{it possible to}} design {{a knowledge}} level ACL which enable agents to cooperate in a geographically distributed Semantic Grid despite failures or malfunctions of nodes? This paper tries to address the above Semantic Grid challenges presenting an Agent-based Open Service Architecture which integrates geographically distributed agents in a Semantic Grid. The architecture is well integrated with standard Internet components and technologies and supports communication among knowledge level agents. The role of agents is to retrieve, execute and compose available services providing more sophisticated instances of them. Inter-agent communication is realized exploiting an advanced agent communication language which supports a fault-tolerant anonymous interaction protocol and satisfies <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> well defined knowledge-level programming requirements. We present {{the design of the}} architecture and its implementation, and we highlight the features of the agent communication <b>language</b> by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study, comparing it with current Grid programming technologies. The main advantage of our approach is to demonstrate that different issues, such as high-level inter-agent communication and fault tolerance, can be successfully integrated in Grid infrastructures which provide Web Services maintaining <b>a</b> clean design <b>of</b> the architecture and a knowledge level characterization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract__ This thesis {{investigates the}} {{long-term}} effects of awake glioma surgery in eloquent areas on cognition. The general assumption is that neurological recovery takes place within 3 months; no detailed cognitive follow-up studies have been conducted yet. Glioma patients (N= 45) were tested pre- and postoperatively (3 months and 1 year) with a neuropsychological test-protocol assessing language, memory, attention and executive functions. Spontaneous speech was examined pre- and 3 months postoperatively as well as the relation of cognition and emotional factors on global quality of life (QoL). The influence of tumor- and treatment related factors on cognition was also investigated. Impairments were present in all cognitive domains on all test-moments. Permanent improvement postoperatively was found on a memory test. Language was the most sensitive domain for recovery. One language test deteriorated at short-term, and remained impaired at 1 year postoperatively. Two language tests improved between 3 months and 1 year. In addition to language tests, a spontaneous speech analysis was necessary to determine the quality <b>of</b> <b>language</b> production. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> study also underlined the importance of spontaneous speech monitoring intraoperatively to detect disturbances. Global QoL remained relatively stable, with depression as the only predictor for QoL change. Tumor- and treatment related factors were no clear risk-factors for cognitive change. Our results show that cognitive recovery takes longer than 3 months and that language, including spontaneous speech, is <b>a</b> crucial element <b>of</b> cognition to assess. Glioma surgery is possible without inducing major cognitive damage. Patients can be informed about the long-term cognitive prognosis...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} formulaic phenomena in Homer are best described {{by using the}} linguistic concept of construction (borrowed from Construction Grammar). Through <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies, the dissertation explores new possibilities opened by the adoption of this framework, in particular regarding the synchronic and diachronic study of the technique {{and the study of}} Homeric word order (i. e., syntax and discourse). While chapters 1 - 3 lay the methodological bases for the enterprise, chapters 4 - 7 explore theoretical and practical issues in the workings of Homeric constructions. Chapter 1, Describing Homer's Technique, frames the goals of the work against the backdrop of earlier research. Chapters 2 (Homeric Formulas and their Definitions) and 3 (Formulas in Linguistics) discuss the topic of formularity within Homeric studies and linguistics, respectively, leading up to the concept of construction in usage-based linguistics and its application to the study of Homer. Chapter 4, Homeric Constructions at Work, explains conventions for the formal notation of Homeric constructions and discusses how constructions have semantic, syntactic, and discourse functions. Chapter 5, The Synchronic Workings of Constructions, discusses how poets acquire constructions during their training, and asks whether constructional habits can be used as diagnostics for individual style; <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study on the epithets of Here illustrates how constructions pass through a life cycle, and how we can use type and token frequency to distinguish innovative constructions from fossilized ones. <b>A</b> study <b>of</b> the famous formula &# 7936;&# 957;&# 948;&# 961;&# 959;&# 964;&# 8134;&# 964;&# 945; &# 954;&# 945;&# 8054; &# 7973;&# 946;&# 951;&# 957; `manliness and youth' shows that this formula was created using a regular and productive construction in the technique, and is thus unlikely to preserve phonological or metrical archaisms (as often argued). Chapter 6, The Diachrony of Constructions, integrates the study of how constructions change over time with previous work on the diachronic evolution <b>of</b> the <b>language</b> <b>of</b> Greek epic; <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study illustrates how different speech introduction constructions evolved at different speeds between the Iliad and the Odyssey, depending on their type and token frequencies. Chapter 7, Constructions and the Study of Homeric Discourse, introduces the study of Homeric discourse and covers the principles of referent management, information structure, and word order in Homer...|$|R
