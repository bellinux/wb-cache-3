Both of his parents were avid readers and were tremendously influential in his life, said Crews; “They had both been raised in considerable poverty, and books had been extremely important to them personally, in shaping them. My mother was very literary; my father was very scientific. I feel that I got a <b>little</b> <b>something</b> of both sides.” In high school, Crews was co-captain of the tennis team, and for decades he remained an avid skier, hiker, swimmer, and runner. Crews lives in Berkeley with his wife of 57 years, Elizabeth Crews, a photographer who {{was born and raised}} in Berkeley, California. They have two daughters and four grandchildren.|$|E

It's a pop-culture clash that is sometimes quite annoying (especially in Rice's left-field rhymes) but still works like a charm". Spins Annie Zaleski noted that the soundtrack demonstrated Madonna's [...] "astronomical growth as a vocalist...Evita marked the start of Madonna's Serious Phase, one where she balanced youthful coquettish-ness with a more mature, introspective outlook".|$|E

500|$|In late 2009, McAdams {{starred in}} the mystery/action-adventure film Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law. She played Irene Adler, an {{antagonist}} and love interest of Downey's title character Sherlock Holmes, and welcomed {{the opportunity to play}} a character who is [...] "her own boss and a real free spirit". Todd McCarthy of Variety felt her character was [...] "not very well integrated into the rest of the story, a shortcoming the normally resourceful McAdams is unable to do much about". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated, [...] "Ms.McAdams is a perfectly charming actress and performs gamely as the third wheel of this action-bromance tricycle. But Irene feels in this movie more like a somewhat cynical commercial contrivance. She offers a <b>little</b> <b>something</b> for the ladies and also something for the lads, who, much as they may dig fights and explosions and guns and chases, also like girls." [...] The film was a major commercial success, earning over $524 million at the worldwide box office.|$|E
500|$|A Times Editor review from The St. Petersburg Times also {{described}} it as sounding similar to other hits: [...] "She hankers for a boy who either doesn't love her back or wants to ditch this small town." [...] Josh Love of The Village Voice thought [...] "preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness" [...] shined through the lyrics and theme of [...] "You Belong with Me"; Love also mentioned {{that it was one}} of Fearless [...] "great songs". The same magazine later ranked the song at number 10 on its annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said Swift's vocals fit the song's melody and instrumentation, which, according to her, is [...] "slick" [...] and [...] "radio-friendly". Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine recommended for readers to download [...] "You Belong with Me", and Jeniffer Webb, also from About.com, predicted that the song would reach different age groups. Webb said, [...] "It continues the artist's tradition of having a <b>little</b> <b>something</b> for everyone, so it's no wonder she has such a large fanbase." ...|$|E

A spirit of good will prevails." [...] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post was critical, calling the series [...] "just as dull as it sounds," [...] and arguing that [...] "weariness" [...] could be detected in Foxworthy's hosting. Rebecca Cusey of Patheos recommended the series for Christians in particular, saying, [...] "Those that take the Bible as the word of God will enjoy this show." [...] Additionally, Bounce TV expressed excitement when announcing their acquisition of the series in 2013; network chief operating officer Jonathan Katz commented, [...] "We are very confident that the broadcast premieres of The American Bible Challenge and Catch 21 will add fuel to Bounce TV’s skyrocketing growth." ...|$|E

500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she felt much more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, you do a <b>little</b> <b>something</b> over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' I raise my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E
500|$|Character {{designer}} Shigenori Soejima made Yu {{with the}} idea that his entire personality be decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions. As a result, he wanted Yu to look more ambiguous than the protagonist of Persona 3. Soejima compared Yu to the Blue Ranger from the Power Rangers franchise as such character tends to stand silent to follow the orders from his leader. His character design stayed relatively similar to its initial conception, with his tone and facial expressions changing the most. The feature Soejima focused on most was his eyes: he thought that having his eyes under the fringe of his hair would make him [...] "look cool." [...] The collar of his school uniform was made to stand a bit taller than other characters'. While designing the character, Soejima noted [...] "the main character needs to be well-rounded enough to be likeable, but also needs that extra <b>little</b> <b>something</b> to make him stand out {{from the rest of the}} cast." [...] He made a [...] "baby face" [...] sketch of the character so that he and the staff could discover Yu's [...] "special something" [...] and discuss what would make him stand out as the protagonist.|$|E
500|$|The WiiWare {{version has}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews, {{with the central}} criticism being the 1200 Wii Point price tag (US$12, £10), after years of free play. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com commended the graphical update, which [...] "sacrifices none of [...] classic-influenced charm". He also remarked that the Classic Controller and Wii Remote are superior to the keyboard input of the PC original. On the issue of price, he explained that [...] "the prospect of Amaya finally earning a <b>little</b> <b>something</b> for the hard work he invested in this masterpiece strikes me as satisfyingly poetic" [...] and [...] "absolutely worth your money". John Teti of Eurogamer had similar sentiments, but also noted the technical issues with the remixed music, recommending the original soundtrack. Edge compared the remake to , satisfying both modern tastes with its graphical overhaul and old school fans with the option to switch to the original graphics. Daemon Hatfield of IGN felt that Cave Story [...] "belongs on a Nintendo system" [...] and noted gameplay similarities to Blaster Master, in which damage reduces the power of weapons as well. Cave Story was nominated for Game of the Year at the 2010 Nintendo Power Awards, as well as WiiWare Game of the Year.|$|E

On February 26, 2015, he publicly apologized to Beck on Twitter. On August 30, 2015, West was presented with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. In his acceptance speech, he stated, [...] "Y'all might be thinking right now, 'I wonder did he smoke something before he came out here?' And the answer is: 'Yes, I rolled up a <b>little</b> <b>something.</b> I knocked the edge off.'" [...] At the end of his speech, he announced, [...] "I have decided in 2020 to run for president." [...] At the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards West was given four minutes to do [...] "whatever he wanted". He chose to debut his new music video for Fade, but first, delivered a speech in which he discussed recent shootings in Chicago, why he included Ray J and Donald Trump in his Famous video, the Taylor Swift situation, his love of Beyoncé and Steve Jobs amongst others.|$|E
500|$|Wodehouse {{expected}} to follow Armine to the University of Oxford, but the family's finances took {{a turn for the}} worse at the crucial moment. Ernest Wodehouse had retired in 1895, and his pension was paid in rupees; fluctuation against the pound reduced its value in Britain. Wodehouse recalled, [...] "The wolf was not actually whining at the door and there was always a <b>little</b> <b>something</b> in the kitty for the butcher and the grocer, but the finances would not run to anything in the nature of a splash". Instead of a university career, in September 1900 Wodehouse was engaged in a junior position in the London office of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. He was unsuited to it and found the work baffling and uncongenial. He later wrote a humorous account of his experiences at the bank, but at the time he longed for the end of each working day, when he could return to his rented lodgings in Chelsea and write. At first he concentrated, with some success, on serious articles about school sports for Public School Magazine. In November 1900 his first comic piece, [...] "Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings," [...] was accepted by Tit-Bits. A new magazine for boys, The Captain, provided further well-paid opportunities, and during his two years at the bank, Wodehouse had eighty pieces published in a total of nine magazines.|$|E
500|$|The Fame {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, based on 13 reviews. Matthew Chisling from Allmusic called the album [...] "a well-crafted sampling of feisty anti-pop in high quality", and wrote that it [...] "fails {{to come up}} short on funky sounds to amuse fans of this dance genre." [...] Nicole Powers of URB complimented its [...] "irony-laden lyrics, delivered in a style that owes a <b>little</b> <b>something</b> to Gwen Stefani," [...] {{as well as the}} album's [...] "deluxe ditties". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "remarkably (and exhaustingly) pure in its vision of a world in which nothing trumps being beautiful, dirty, and rich. In this economy, though, her high-times escapism has its charms". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian found it [...] "packing an immensely addictive melody or an inescapable hook, virtually everything sounds like another hit single", and predicted that it [...] "certainly sounds like it could be big." [...] Daniel Brockman from The Phoenix wrote that [...] "Gaga ups the ante in terms of catchy songwriting and sheer high-in-the-club-banging-to-the-beat abandon." [...] Ben Hogwood of musicOMH praised Gaga's [...] "blend of sassy attitude, metallic beats and sharp, incisive songwriting", elements which he felt are integral to [...] "creating pop music".|$|E

500|$|... "At Long Last Leave" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, [...] particularly for its couch gag in the Simpsons opening sequence. This couch gag features a frame-by-frame montage of previous couch gags that pulls {{back into a}} photomosaic of the number [...] "500". The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs wrote that the [...] "best thing about the 500th Simpsons episode is the opening couch montage, which hits the nostalgia bullseye almost perfectly." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall praised the couch gag as being [...] "marvelous", noting that it [...] "actually made me choke up a bit." [...] Sepinwall commended [...] "At Long Last Leave", commenting that [...] "like many latter-day Simpsons outings, [...] features a story we've seen variations on several times before (including in The Simpsons Movie), but also features many funny jokes that affirm my belief that I'm happier {{to live in a}} world that keeps giving us new Simpsons episodes [...] than I will be in the one where that inevitably stops." [...] Similarly to Sepinwall, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "I got a few laughs and that's all I ever look for in The Simpsons these days. I just like knowing it's still there. [...] It doesn't have the spring in the legs quite like it used to. It's not going to dazzle at the same spectacular rate. But even after 500 episodes, it still has a <b>little</b> <b>something</b> left." [...] Goodman described the couch gag as [...] "lovely".|$|E
500|$|Come What(ever) May was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive critical reviews. Several reviewers noted how it helped to further establish Stone Sour. Chad Bower of About.com stated that the band had [...] "progressed a lot since their debut", noting that the album was [...] "very diverse and [...] the band to show many different sides of their musical personality". Megan Frye of Allmusic opened her review of the album by distinguishing what sets Stone Sour apart musically, writing [...] " [...] ability to create smooth, radio-friendly alternative metal songs while simultaneously not boring {{the people who have}} heard way too much from post-grunge groups." [...] On a similar note, Michael Melchor of 411mania said, [...] "The band is much better at the craft of songwriting than many of their peers." [...] In contrast, reviewer William Fry of IGN criticized the album, writing, [...] "Stone Sour doesn't do anything inspired, original, or fresh here," [...] even calling the album [...] "completely misdirected, and stonewalled". A particular point of interest for reviewers was how Come What(ever) May is more melodic than the band's previous album Stone Sour. Melchor of 411mania said the album is [...] "much more liberal with the balladry and acoustic sounds than its predecessor"; of the track [...] "Sillyworld" [...] he said, [...] "It sounds like what Nickelback could be if Chad Kroeger could write a good melody." [...] In his review, Chad Bower labeled Come What(ever) May as a [...] "very melodic and accessible album" [...] writing that [...] "it has a <b>little</b> <b>something</b> for everyone". Similarly, Megan Frye praised the album as an [...] "unyielding effort from a promising talent".|$|E

5000|$|About Parenting {{recommends}} {{the game for}} [...] "doctor's offices, restaurants and other places where you sometimes have to wait with kids", but discourages its use in moving cars. The way players choose {{who will be the}} Spy/It can range from the noncompetitive alternating of turns to a game of skill/chance such as rock, paper, scissors. The Spy silently selects an object that is visible to all the players and does not reveal their choice. They then say, [...] "I spy with my <b>little</b> eye <b>something</b> beginning with ...", naming the letter the chosen object starts with (e.g. [...] "I spy with my <b>little</b> eye <b>something</b> beginning with C" [...] if the chosen object is a car). An alternative version is substituting the initial letter for an adjective such as the colour of the object (e.g. [...] "I spy with my <b>little</b> eye <b>something</b> blue"), while another is to say [...] "I Spy with my <b>little</b> eye <b>something</b> that sounds like". Some sites such as About Parenting describe the letter version has the variant to the colour-based game. This site has the form [...] "I spy something, and it's blue" [...] as the traditional version, deeming [...] "I spy with my little eye..." [...] as an alternative. Having clues based on an object's shape is another alternative, while quick thinkers can deliberately choose objects that can only be seen for a limited amount of time. Howcast notes that looking at an object when announcing its colour is a [...] "dead giveaway" [...] so this should be avoided. Another variation that encourages language development involves the Spy giving various descriptive clues, such as describing a watch as [...] "something that made of metal and glass that makes a quiet noise".|$|R
