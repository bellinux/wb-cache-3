A popular 18th century nursery rhyme is There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe. This story tells about an old woman living in a shoe with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> In 1948, Mahlon Haines, a shoe salesman in Hallam, Pennsylvania, built an actual house shaped like a work boot as a form of advertisement. The Haines Shoe House was rented to newlyweds and the elderly until his death in 1962. Since then, it has served as an ice cream parlor, a bed and breakfast, and a museum. It still stands today and is a popular roadside attraction.|$|E

Although initially skeptical about the show, he took the role when Lost creator J. J. Abrams explained more about it. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> were seen {{for the role of}} Walt. They were narrowed down to the top three, with Malcolm David Kelley winning it, after {{the producers}} were impressed with his role in Antwone Fisher. [...] Abrams had worked with Terry O'Quinn previously on Alias, and was keen to work with him again. He explained to O'Quinn that although the role in the first episodes would be fairly small, the character will develop afterwards. O'Quinn took the role as he trusted Abrams. He was also the only character who did not have to officially audition for a part of a main character. The producers were looking for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. [...] A lot of women were auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be an antipathetic character in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. Unlike many other characters of the first season, who were rewritten based on their actors, Boone was largely the same through production. He was originally going to be named Boone Anthony Markham V, going by the nickname, [...] "Five". Ian Somerhalder was cast in the role, but {{he did not want to}} shoot a pilot; however, he jumped at the opportunity once he found out he would be working with Abrams.|$|E

The Vatican's newly-released 2008 yearbook of statistics revealed that for the first time, Islam has outnumbered the Roman Catholics globally. It stated that, [...] "Islam has overtaken Roman Catholicism as the biggest single religious denomination in the world", and stated that, [...] "It is true that while Muslim families, as is well known, continue to make a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>children,</b> Christian ones on the contrary tend to have fewer and fewer". According to the Foreign Policy, High birth rates were cited as the reason for the Muslim population growth. With 3.1 children per woman, Muslims have higher fertility levels than the world’s overall population between 2010 and 2015. High fertility is a major driver of projected Muslim population growth around the world and in particular regions. Between 2010-2015, with exception of the Middle East and North Africa, Muslim fertility of any other region in the world was higher than the rate for the region as a whole. While Muslim birth rates are expected to experience a decline, it will remain above replacement level and higher fertility than the world’s overall by 2050.

In her first {{televised}} appearance, she began her number ballet dancing to [...] "I Could Have Danced All Night" [...] from the musical My Fair Lady, then, as judge Simon Cowell started {{to reach for the}} red rejection buzzer, she began singing the song with an unexpectedly powerful voice.

Commentators and mainstream media outlets speculated that she might defeat Susan Boyle, who had made an impression worldwide in the first show of the series.

6000|$|With the {{exception}} of Dr. Johnson, there is scarcely any great man of letters whom we are enabled to know so intimately as the Sieur de Montaigne. He has told us all about himself; all about his age, {{as far as it}} came under his eager and observant eyes; all about the whole world, as far as it made part of his experience. Rousseau is not more frank, and not half so worthy of credit, for Rousseau, like Topsy in the novel, had a taste for [...] "'fessing" [...] offences that he had never committed rather than not [...] "'fess" [...] at all. Montaigne strikes no such attitudes; he does not pose, he does not so much confess as blab. His life stands before the reader [...] "as in a picture." [...] We learn that his childhood was a happier one than usually fell to the <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> in that age when there was but little honey smeared on the cup of learning. We know that his father taught him Greek in a kind of sport or game, that the same parent's relations with the fair sex were remarkable, and that he had extraordinary strength in his thumb. For his own part, Montaigne was so fresh and full of life that Simon Thomas, a great physician, said it would make a decrepit old man healthy again to live in his company. One thinks of him as a youth like the irrepressible Swiss who amused the ennui of Gray.|$|E
