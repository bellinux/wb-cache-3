25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center <b>drill</b> <b>bits,</b> it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist <b>drill</b> <b>bit)</b> is a spotting <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> (or a spot <b>drill</b> <b>bit,</b> as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> so that the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Optimization {{drilling}} parameters {{in order}} to temperature decrease during creation of hole in the bone is an interested issue. The {{aim of this study}} was to achieve optimum values of drilling parameters based on the creation of minimum temperature during jawbone drilling. Materials and Methods: In this study two models of mandible and maxilla was created and teeth 2, 5 and 8 from maxilla and teeth 25, 28 and 31 from mandible were removed. The drilling operation was performed under different conditions on jawbone models using finite element analysis and the maximum temperatures were measured in adjacent of holes. Results: <b>Drill</b> <b>bit</b> head angle of 70 degrees was created the lowest maximum temperature during drilling operation. The lowest maximum temperatures were observed in the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> rotational speed, <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> feed rate and the force exerted on the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> equal to 200 rpm, 120 mm/min and 60 N, respectively. The use of irrigation can decrease the maximum bone temperature about 7 ºC. The maximum temperature differences in various regions of mandible and maxilla were approximately about 1 ºC. Conclusion: Sharpness of <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> head angle, reduction of <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> rotational speed, increasing <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> feed rate and exerted force on <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> and also the use of irrigation played effective roles in temperature decrease during jawbone drilling.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} hole quality and energy consumption {{in the process of}} drilling a thermoplastic polymeric material, polyether-ether-ketone, reinforced with 30 % glass fibers (PEEK-GF 30). PEEK-GF 30 ’s capacity to be machined has focused on turning operations. Studies of drilling involving thermoplastic polymeric materials have considered materials with other types of matrices, or reinforcement. In this study, quantities such as maximum and mean surface roughness, delamination, maximum thrust force, maximum momentum, and energy required during the process were determined for three types of <b>drill</b> <b>bits,</b> and the most influential factors for each variable were identified using an ANOVA multifactor analysis. The highest quality and lowest energy consumption were achieved for a <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> rotation speed of 7000 rpm and a feed rate of 400 mm/min with a tungsten carbide (WC) <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> coated with titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN). Although a WC <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> with a diamond point reduces delamination, the roughness increases, thus, the choice of the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> type depends on the roughness allowed.
