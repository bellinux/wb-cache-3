25|$|Pyridine {{might also}} have minor neurotoxic, genotoxic, and clastogenic effects. Exposure to {{pyridine}} would normally lead to its inhalation and absorption in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, where it either remains unchanged or is metabolized. The major products of pyridine metabolism are N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide, which are formed by N-methyltransferases (e.g., pyridine N-methyltransferase), as well as pyridine N-oxide, and 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxypyridine, which are generated {{by the action of}} monooxygenase. In humans, pyridine is metabolized only into N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide. Pyridine is readily degraded by bacteria to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The unsubstituted pyridine ring degrades more rapidly than picoline, <b>lutidine,</b> chloropyridine, or aminopyridines, and a number of pyridine degraders have been shown to overproduce riboflavin in the presence of pyridine. Ionizable N-heterocyclic compounds, including pyridine, interact with environmental surfaces (such as soils and sediments) via multiple pH-dependent mechanisms, including partitioning to soil organic matter, cation exchange, and surface complexation. Such adsorption to surfaces reduces bioavailability of pyridines for microbial degraders and other organisms, thus slowing degradation rates and reducing ecotoxicity.|$|E

40|$|The main focuses of {{this project}} have been {{investigations}} {{of a variety of}} hydrogen bonding systems for unusual behaviour such as disordered or migrating hydrogens/protons with both single crystal X-ray and neutron diffraction, crystallisation {{of a large number of}} molecular complexes of the chloranilic acid molecule, and examining the bifurcated hydrogen bond motif found in many of the chloranilic acid co-crystals discovered. The neutron single crystal diffraction instruments SXD and VIVALDI have been used to provide conclusive results in cases of suspected unusual hydrogen bond behaviour in molecular materials. 2, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid and its isomer 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid have been examined using X-ray and neutron diffraction to investigate possible disordered cooperative hydrogen bond systems. The energy difference of the three possible tautomers of 2, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid in different environments have been calculated in theoretical computations which concur with the neutron results. Single crystal neutron diffraction experiments were also carried out on isonicotinamidium formate, 2 -iodoaniliium picrate, chloranilic acid 2, 4 -lutidine and malonic acid, where unusual behaviour in the hydrogen systems was also suspected. The molecular complexes of chloranilic acid with various pyridine-based molecules have been the main focus of the X-ray diffraction work of this thesis. Multiple crystallisations over a range of different conditions were set up for chloranilic acid with various series of molecules including <b>lutidines</b> (dimethylpyridines) and picolines (methylpyridines). This resulted in a large number of new crystal structures, determined by X-ray diffraction and all found to contain a bifurcated hydrogen bond motif producing two robust hydrogen-bonded supramolecular synthons.

40|$|The main focuses of this {{research}} were to examine the capabilities of solution techniques to attempt to monitor the nucleation process in crystallisation, and to investigate structural outcomes of crystallisation processes, with reference to polymorphism and intermolecular interactions. To achieve this, work on the investigation of nucleation and early-stage crystallisation was carried out at the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Strathclyde and also at the central synchrotron facility of Station 2. 1 at the SRS Daresbury. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was carried out on solutions of methyl- 4 -hydroxybenzoate (pMHB) and 2 -bromobenzoic acid. These {{studies were carried out}} after developing solution methods to enable us to determine the point at which crystals emerged from solution. This was achieved using Focussed Beam Reflectance Measurements. Structural studies were also carried out on pMHB to examine its polymorphic behaviour and crystal structures were solved at various temperatures from 100 K to 300 K. The crystal structure of methyl- 2, 5 - dibromobenzoate was also solved at 100 K after discovering it sublimes at room temperature. This structure could only be solved from a twinned crystal and indicated the appearance of interesting halogen interactions occurring. Structural studies have also been carried out using the bromanilic acid molecule as a focus to generate a number of co-crystal complexes to examine their halogen bonding capability and to determine any structural significances in their formation. Co-crystal complexes of bromanilic acid and a variety of molecules were made in 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 ratios to see if any additional halogen interactions could be observed or induced, in addition to the expected hydrogen-binding interactions. The co-crystals included a range of picolines and <b>lutidines</b> as well as bromo-substituted pyridines to attempt to induce halogen interactions. This generated a number of new compounds whose structures were determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction and the interactions were monitored to observed whether any defined patterns with regards to the tendency of bromanilic acid co-crystallisations to produce predictable patterns of intermolecular interactions could be determined.

The effect of the structure directing organic molecule on the inorganic structure was investigated in this thesis, with a variety of novel materials synthesised. A family of one-dimensional chains have been prepared. The first, composed of fused four-membered rings, was found in [NH 4][InSe 2] (using 3, 5 -lutidine) and in a number of phases prepared with bicyclic superbases.

The design of inherently safe processes is currently' viewed as a necessary target of the engineering discipline (Gupta and Ed~ards, 2002) [...] Alkylpyridines and their N-oxides are being used widely as intermediates and final products in the Phannaceutical Industry. Under typical industrial conditions the N-oxidation reaction is performed catalytically, in the liquid phaSe in a semi-batch mode. Hydrogen peroxide is used as the oxidising agent. It is dosed over the alkylpyridine-catalyst mixture over a period of time. The desired N-oxidation is accompanied by one only additional reaction, the lpldesired decomposition ofhydrogen peroxide. The catalytic N-oxidation of selected picolines, <b>lutidines</b> and collidines were performed in an HEL SIMULARÃ‚Â® lL calorimeter at conditions very close to the industrial'ones, following a certain procedure. The catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide alone, under the same conditions was also studied. A sensitive mass flow-meter MKS 1179 A Mass-FloÃ‚Â® was used for the continuous measurement of the oxygen produced by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, thus. allowing the split {{of the power of the}} two reactions. The heat of reaction has been evaluated for all the selected N-oxidation and hydrogen peroxide decomposition reactions. The concentration of the a 1 kylpyridines and their N-oxides was measured using HPLC. These measurements confirmed that the hydrogen peroxide decompositio~ was the only parallel reaction. Integration of the thermal power evolution curves also provided a continuous measure of concentration [...] These curves were found to be in good agreement with the HPLC measurements. The reactions were studied using heat-flow and power compensation calorimetry at subcooled conditions. Their study shows that their N-oxidation follows Langmuir type kinetics. The paraIlel decomposition ofhydrogen peroxide also follows the same type ofkinetics. Their kinetic study was based on the kinetic model of Sempere et al, 1998, whi~h was improved and refined. The model of Sempere et al., 1998 on a-picoline assumes paths of reaction, in which, the employedÃ‚Â· catalyst, phosphotungstic acid, does not participate. However, as reported in our previous work (papadaki et al., 2002 a), no reaction takes place in the absence of phosphotungstic acid. The kinetic model proposed by Sempere et al. 1998 has thus been modified to account for those paths. The modified model is, as before, based on the assumption of very fast always in equilibrium reactions or interactions for the formation of intermediates which subsequently react in a number of ways to give the final products. All paths of the modified model are catalytic. The new kinetic model has been tested and found to be,:in good agreement with experimental data. A number of runaway scenarios of the excess of hydrogen peroxide used during the N-oxidation of alkylpyridines, under closed and open conditions, were examined. It was found that, in most cases, if the volume of the liquid hydrogen peroxide solution occupies more than 10 % ofthe total volume ofa closed system (e. g. reactor and vent line between reactor and blockage), the production of gases raises the pressure so quickly that evaporation is completely suppressed. Higher that 70 % filling levels result in complete expansion of the liquid~The MTSR(t) (the inaximum temperature attained by the synthesis reaction) of the system falls rapidly if th~ normal process temperature is high, but if a runaway. occurs exactly at the end of dosing, MTST (the maximum temperature reached during the synthesis reaction) will be very high and secondary decompositions will rapidly develop. The results of this study are currently being used to critically assess the current approaches and to further the study ofinherently safer designs.

In this article the IMS spectra of background gases, <b>lutidine,</b> and mixtures of amines with three extraction solvents are measured and analyzed. Selective detection of amines achieved by doping NH 3, ethanol, acetone, and ether into a dilute concentration of amines in air is also discussed. Finally, the results of field tests in a chemical plant are presented. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Co-crystallisation of {{pentachlorophenol}} (PCP) {{with the}} series of dimethylpyridines (lutidines) results {{in the formation of}} molecular complexes that show strong hydrogen bonding in the solid state, as anticipated. Competition for the hydrogen atom in these strong hydrogen bonds (HBs) by the p K a -matched molecules leads to a variable degree of hydrogen transfer from PCP towards the <b>lutidine,</b> dependent on the &# 916;p K a value in a particular complex. The influence of weak C-H&# 175;&# 175;&# 175;O HBs {{in the vicinity of the}} strong O&# 175;&# 175;&# 175;H&# 175;&# 175;&# 175;N HB on this hydrogen transfer is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Since {{there is}} an {{asymmetric}} centre at platinum in complexes PtMe 3 (AA) L (H(AA) = amino acid; L = MeOH, 3, 5 -lutidine) and PtMe 3 (AA) - 2, mixtures of diastereoisomers are formed when the amino acid also contains an asymmetric C-atom. Rapid interconvesion of isomers has been studied by variable-temperature NMR. The effects of various substituents on the amino acid on the relative proportions of isomers, and on the chemical behaviour of the compounds have been examined. In <b>lutidine</b> complexes marked upfield shifts are observed for a substituent on the amino acid which is near the aromatic ring...|$|E
40|$|The {{selective}} inclusion {{properties of}} the host compound 1, 1 -bis-(4 - hydroxyphenyl) cyclohexane were investigated. This host readily forms inclusion compounds with the isomers of phenylenediamine, benzenediol, picoline and <b>lutidine,</b> as well as selected solvents including methanol, ethanol, i-propanol, n-butanol, ethyl acetate and dioxane. The crystal structures of the complexes formed were elucidated, and comparisons were made between the packing of the complexes, and the intermolecular interactions between the host and guest components of the complexes. The complexes were characterised using thermal analysis and X-ray powder diffraction. The lattice energies of the complexes were calculated to determine their relative stability. The kinetics of desolvation of the picoline and <b>lutidine</b> inclusion compounds were studied, using isothermal and non-isothermal thermogravimetry. These experiments yielded the kinetic models {{as well as the}} activation energies of the desolvation reactions. Competition experiments were performed to determine which isomers of the compounds mentioned above were enclathrated preferentially by the host, and the observed selectivity was related to differences in complementary between the host and guest components in each complex. Inclusion compounds were formed between the host and the solid guests (benzenediol and phenylenediamine) by means of solid-solid reactions. The complexes were formed by grinding the two powdered starting components together in a ball mill. The resulting products were analysed by X-ray powder diffractometry. Competition experiments were also performed in the solid state to determine whether the selectivity of the host differed from that observed in solution...|$|E
40|$|Applications of the bifunctional ferrocenediyl Lewis acid 1, 1 ′-fc{B(C 6 F 5) 2 } 2 in {{frustrated}} Lewis pair (FLP) chemistry are described. The coordination (or otherwise) of a {{range of}} sterically encumbered C-, N- and P-centred Lewis bases has been investigated, with <b>lutidine,</b> tetramethylpiperidine, PPh 3, P t Bu 3 and the expanded ring carbene 6 Dipp being found to be sterically incapable of coordinate bond formation. The chemistry {{of a range}} of these FLPs in the presence of H 2 O, NH 3, CO 2 and cyclohexylisocyanate (CyNCO) has been investigated, with the patterns of reactivity identified including simple coordination chemistry, E–H bond cleavage and C–B insertion. </p...|$|E
