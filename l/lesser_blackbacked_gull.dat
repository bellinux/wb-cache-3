40|$|In 1998, {{the first}} roof-nesting Herring Gulls Larus argentatus for Belgium were {{recorded}} at Oostende (along the coast) following indications of breeding in earlier years. Since then, breeding numbers increased from 33 pairs in 1998 to 205 in 2001. This is about 12 % {{of the total}} Belgian breeding population. In 1999, also <b>Lesser</b> <b>Blackbacked</b> <b>Gull</b> Larus fuscus started breeding on rooftops (4 pairs), followed by a moderate increase in the next years (up to 8 pairs in 2001). Roof-nesting Herring Gulls showed a different breeding behaviour than groundnesting birds, e. g. a much longer bound between parents and young and a longer breeding season. The coming years, a further increase of roof-nesting gulls along the Belgian coast is expected...|$|E
40|$|After a gap {{of almost}} ten years, several total and partial counts of gulls along the Belgian coast {{have been carried}} out during the period 1998 - 2001. The study area, always counted at low tide, {{consists}} of all tidal areas along the coastline: beach, harbours of Nieuwpoort, Oostende, Blankenberge and Zeebrugge (rear port), the Yzer estuary and the Zwin reserve. The Herring Gull Larus argentatus is the most common species and represents 60 tot 70 % {{of the total number of}} gulls. The less abundant species is Great Black-backed Gull Larus marinus (5 % of total numbers). The counts also give a clear picture of seasonal differences in number between species, as for <b>Lesser</b> <b>Blackbacked</b> <b>Gull</b> Larus fuscus (summer visitor) and Common Gull Larus canus (winter visitor). Species that are mainly foraging at sea and only come to land to rest, are more found in harbour areas than other species as Herring Gull. During the winter season, 60 to 70 % of the Herring Gulls are adult birds. This proportion is even higher in other species: about 80 % in Great Black-backed Gull and more than 90 % in Lesser Black-backed Gull, Common Gull and Black-headed Gull Larus ridibundus. More counts in the near future will be needed to find out if the seasonal pattern of gull numbers along the Belgian coast is rather constant or is fluctuating strongly between years...|$|E
40|$|At 8 : 45 a. m. CST on 17 December, 1992, we {{observed}} a <b>Lesser</b> <b>Blackbacked</b> <b>Gull</b> at Sutherland Reservoir in Lincoln County. The bird was first seen {{resting on the}} water in the company of Herring and Ringbilled Gulls. Compared to these species, this bird had a very distinct dark charcoal-gray mantle and upperwings, which were at least a shade darker than the mantle color of a Herring Gull, though definitely not black. When, during a brief period, the bird was compared directly to an adult California Gull, it had a noticeably darker mantle, was slightly larger, and had more obvious dark-brown streaking on the head and nape. In flight, the primary tips were darker {{than the rest of the}} flight feathers, and small, white mirrors were visible near the tips of the outer primaries, but were not visible on the underwing, which was pale, with some dark gray on the undersides of the primaries. The underparts, including the breast, belly, and undertail, were white and unmarked. The uppertail was mostly white except for small brown marks on the tips of a couple of the rectrices. The legs were very pale pink rather than yellow. The bill was fairly thin, with a slight gonys, which was not as obvious as those seen on most of the Herring Gulls that were present at the time. The distal half of the bill was yellow, with some dark smudging on the proximal half. The head was mostly white, with some fairly prominent dark-brown streaking, particularly on the crown, nape, and sides of the neck. The iris appeared yellow. There was some confusion as to the age of the bird. Grant (1986) notes that, for Lesser Black-backed Gulls, 2 Ì† 2 [...] . a few (as high as 3...|$|E
40|$|In 1999, a colour ring-project on Herring Larus argentatus and Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus was {{launched}} at the Belgian coast. In total 509 and 486 Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gulls respectively, were equiped with colour rings. Both chicks and breeding {{adults in the}} colony of the outer harbour of Zeebrugge (West-Flanders) were ringed. Also some Herring Gull chicks from roof-nesting birds in Ostend (West-Flanders) and wintering birds from different places at the Belgian coast were equiped with a colour ring. In this article {{an overview of the}} distribution and migration patterns is given for both species. Most of the recoveries are from Belgium, France and the Netherlands. <b>Lesser</b> <b>Blackbacked</b> <b>Gulls</b> are reported from the coastal areas in Southwestern Europe and Northern Africa. Some colour ringed individuals from both species are seen in Germany and the United Kingdom. Outside the breeding period, Herring Gull from this study stayed close to the colony with the Dutch Delta-area, the coastline of Northern France and the Belgian coast itself being the most important. Besides a clear southward migration, some Belgian Herring Gulls also migrate to the north. Other populations from the northwest European continent show a similar northward migration, although this is less pronounced in the nearby breeding population of Schouwen in Zeeland (the Netherlands). In spring immature birds return later to the breeding grounds than adults. The Belgian Herring Gulls tend to visit rubbish dumps less frequently {{in the course of their}} lifetime, suggesting a change in food choise. Lesser Black-backed Gulls from Zeebrugge show a tendency to winter closer to the natal colony when getting older...|$|R
40|$|During the 20 th century, gull {{populations in}} North America {{experienced}} considerable changes in abundance and geographic ranges. The {{objective of this}} study was to describe population trends of Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) and Great Black-backed Gulls (L. marinus) in the New York Bight, USA, over a 40 -year period (1974 - 2013). A variety of data sources using different survey methods provided estimates of the number of breeding pairs for both species. In the Long Island portion of the New York Bight, overall Herring and Great Black-backed gull nesting populations appear to have fluctuated considerably in size during this time period, and the largest numbers of breeding individuals of these two species occurred in the 1980 s. In coastal New Jersey, the Herring Gull nesting population has remained relatively constant, whereas the Great Black-backed Gull nesting population has increased. Individual nesting colonies are dynamic and can vary in size considerably during even short time periods. Several factors, including sea-level changes and the availability of anthropogenic food sources (i. e., at landfills and fisheries by-catch), likely have strongly influenced individual colonies and the overall Herring and Great <b>Blackbacked</b> <b>gull</b> breeding populations in the New York Bight...|$|R
