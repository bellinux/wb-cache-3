50|$|Green fireballs are {{a type of}} {{unidentified}} {{flying object}} which have been sighted in the sky since the late 1940s. Early sightings primarily occurred in the southwestern United States, particularly in New Mexico.

40|$|Models used in {{performance}} assessment and site characterization {{activities related to}} nuclear waste disposal rely on simplified representations of solute/rock interactions, hydrologic flow field and the material properties of the rock layers surrounding the repository.

An intermediate-scale experiment is being carried out at the Experimental Engineered Test Facility at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory by the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> and Sandia <b>National</b> Laboratories to develop a strategy to validate key geochemical and hydrological assumptions {{in performance}} assessment models used by the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project...|$|R
5|$|Emil Julius Klaus Fuchs (29 December 1911– 28 January 1988) was a German {{theoretical}} {{physicist and}} atomic spy who, in 1950, {{was convicted of}} supplying information from the American, British, and Canadian Manhattan Project to the Soviet Union during and shortly after the Second World War. While at the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory, Fuchs was responsible for many significant theoretical calculations relating to the first nuclear weapons, and later, early models of the hydrogen bomb.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear {{weapons were}} {{developed}} during World War II by the Manhattan Project, which created {{a network of}} production facilities, and the weapons research and design laboratory at the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory.

50|$|A {{particular}} {{concern was the}} possibility of flooding in areas downstream from the burned zone. The town of <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos,</b> the <b>national</b> laboratory, and the lower parts of the burned area are all situated on the Pajarito Plateau, an area of extensive canyons and mesas in which surface runoff tends to concentrate in the canyon bottoms. This tendency was exacerbated in Cerro Grande's aftermath {{by the fact that}} the soil in the burned areas had become hydrophobic, raising the specter of drastically increased water flow in the streams in the canyons that the existing streambeds might not have been able to handle. This concern, coupled with the prospect of monsoon rains that typically begin in about July in the area, made it urgent to deal with the possibility of flooding.|$|R
50|$|The {{present study}} was carried out using {{mathematical}} simulations because of the difficulties involved in fabricating these materials with semiconductor lithographic techniques. While more work {{needs to be done}} to determine if chiral materials can induce a repulsive Casimir force strong enough to overcome friction in nanoscale devices, practical applications of the Casimir effect are already under close study at other DOE facilities, including <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> and Sandia <b>National</b> Laboratories. Both have expressed considerable interest in using the chiral metamaterials designed at Ames Laboratory to fabricate new structures and reduce the attractive Casimir force, and possibly to obtain a repulsive Casimir force.|$|R
5000|$|Although it {{was known}} to have poor cost-performance, the HEP {{received}} attention due to what were, at the time, several revolutionary features. The HEP had {{the performance of a}} CDC 7600-class computer in the Cray-1 era. HEP systems were acquired by the Ballistic Research Laboratory (four PEM system), <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos,</b> the Argonne <b>National</b> Laboratory (single PEM), the National Security Agency, and Germany's Messerschmitt (three PEMS system. Denelcor also delivered a two PEM system to the University of Georgia in exchange for them providing software assistance (the system had also been offered to the University of Maryland). Messerschmitt was the only client to put the HEP into use for [...] "real" [...] applications; the other clients used it for experimenting with parallel algorithms. The BRL system was used to prepare a movie using the BRL-CAD software as its only real application. The HEP attracted widespread attention despite its terrible cost performance because of its many interesting hardware features that attempted to facilitate performance.|$|R

5|$|Kennedy {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{recruits}} to Manhattan Project's <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory, arriving in March 1943. He became acting head of the Chemistry and Metallurgy (CM) Division. There was concern amongst the project leadership about Kennedy, as he was only 26 years old at the time. An approach was therefore made to Charles Thomas from Monsanto. Thomas agreed to co-ordinate the Chemistry efforts of the different Manhattan Project laboratories, but he did not wish to move to New Mexico. Despite his youth, Kennedy officially became CM Division leader in April 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan Project was {{replaced}} by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on 1 January 1947. Fermi served on the AEC General Advisory Committee, an influential scientific committee chaired by Robert Oppenheimer. He also liked to spend a few weeks of each year at the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> <b>National</b> Laboratory, where he collaborated with Nicholas Metropolis, and with John von Neumann on Rayleigh–Taylor instability, the science of what occurs at the border between two fluids of different densities.|$|E

40|$|The Jefferson Laboratory {{electron}} accelerator {{is controlled by}} the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS), which was initially developed by the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> and Argonne <b>National</b> Laboratories, and which has since become an extensive collaboration among scientific institutions worldwide. In keeping with the spirit of cooperation and exchange fostered by the EPICS community, the Controls Software group at Jefferson Laboratory aims to produce portable software tools useful not only locally, but also at any EPICS site, and even at non-EPICS sites where feasible. To achieve this goal, the group practices several software engineering principles which have demonstrated success in producing sharable software. This paper first discusses those principles along with the practicalities involved in pursuing them, and then illustrates how they prevail within three different frameworks: the architecture and operating system portability provided by the EPICS environment, which assists in porting to other EPICS sites; the control system portability inherent in the Common Device (CDEV) abstraction layer, which facilitates porting to any supported control system; and the general system portability which follows from careful code design...|$|R
