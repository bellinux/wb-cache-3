5|$|In {{parallel}} of {{the video}} game approach, in the media art field, Maurice Benayoun’s Virtual Reality artwork The Tunnel under the Atlantic (1995), often compared to video games, introduced a virtual film director, fully autonomous intelligent agent, to shoot and edit in real time a full video from the digging performance in the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Museum of Contemporary art in Montreal. The full movie, Inside the Tunnel under the Atlantic, 21h long, was followed in 1997 by Inside the Paris New-Delhi Tunnel (13h long). Only short excerpts where presented to the public. The complex behavior of the Tunnel’s virtual director makes it a significant precursor of <b>later</b> <b>application</b> to video games based machinimas.|$|E

25|$|A barcode is an optical, machine-readable, {{representation}} of data; the data usually describes {{something about the}} object that carries the barcode. Originally barcodes systematically represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines, and may {{be referred to as}} linear or one-dimensional (1D). Later two-dimensional (2D) codes were developed, using rectangles, dots, hexagons and other geometric patterns in two dimensions, usually called barcodes although they do not use bars as such. Barcodes were initially scanned by special optical scanners called barcode readers. <b>Later</b> <b>application</b> software became available for devices that could read images, such as smartphones with cameras.|$|E
25|$|The Security Extensions, {{marketed as}} TrustZone Technology, is in ARMv6KZ and <b>later</b> <b>application</b> profile architectures. It {{provides}} a low-cost alternative to adding another dedicated security core to an SoC, by providing two virtual processors backed by hardware based access control. This lets the application core switch between two states, {{referred to as}} worlds (to reduce confusion with other names for capability domains), {{in order to prevent}} information from leaking from the more trusted world to the less trusted world. This world switch is generally orthogonal to all other capabilities of the processor, thus each world can operate independently of the other while using the same core. Memory and peripherals are then made aware of the operating world of the core and may use this to provide access control to secrets and code on the device.|$|E
2500|$|As part {{of their}} <b>later</b> <b>application</b> on rezoning, the Council {{submitted}} {{a report on the}} prevailing winds, which suggested the land would be unsuitable as open space. While the commissioners acknowledged this, they felt that landscaping could improve the situation somewhat. They then noted the number of people using the newly opened reserve was [...] "relatively modest," [...] especially when contrasted with the significant number who wanted to reinstate the library there.|$|E

50|$|This species {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the 1871 name Ephedra antisyphilitica S.Wats., native to farther west in the Southwestern US and in Baja California.

50|$|The {{intensive}} {{use of the}} Laplace transform in engineering led to the heuristic use of symbolic methods, called operational calculus.
