40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} shown that in some countries, liquid assets {{increased}} leverage while in other countries liquid firms were more frequently financed by their own capital and therefore were less leveraged. Objectives: The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the impact of liquidity on the capital structure of Croatian firms. Methods/Approach: Pearson correlation coefficient is applied to the test on the relationship between <b>liquidity</b> <b>ratios</b> and debt ratios, the share of retained earnings to capital and <b>liquidity</b> <b>ratios</b> and the relationship between the structure of current assets and leverage. Results: A survey has been conducted on a sample of 1058 Croatian firms. There are statistically significant correlations between <b>liquidity</b> <b>ratios</b> and leverage ratios. Also, there are statistically significant correlations between leverage ratios and the structure of current assets. The relationship between <b>liquidity</b> <b>ratios</b> and the short-term leverage is stronger than between <b>liquidity</b> <b>ratios</b> and the long-term leverage. Conclusions: The more liquid assets firms have, the less they are leveraged. Long- term leveraged firms are more liquid. Increasing inventory levels leads to an increase in leverage. Furthermore, increasing the cash in current assets leads to a reduction in the short-term and the long- term leverage...|$|R
