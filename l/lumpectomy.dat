5|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} {{standard}} of care for women who have undergone <b>lumpectomy</b> or mastectomy surgery, and is an integral component of breast-conserving therapy.|$|E
5|$|Intraoperative {{radiation}} therapy (IORT) delivers radiation {{at the same}} time as the surgery to remove the tumour (<b>lumpectomy).</b> An applicator is placed in the cavity left after tumour removal and a mobile electronic device generates radiation (either x-rays or electrons) and delivers it via the applicator. Radiation is delivered all at once and the applicator removed before closing the incision.|$|E
50|$|After {{undergoing}} treatment, {{including two}} <b>lumpectomies,</b> chemotherapy and radiation, Mesley {{returned to the}} CBC full-time in March 2006, but was {{under the care of}} an oncologist and had been taking the intravenous, anti-cancer drug Herceptin.|$|R
40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of operative experience in obtaining tumor-free margins in breast-conserving therapy. In the case of palpable breast cancers, <b>lumpectomies</b> can safely be performed by any surgical resident. For nonpalpable breast cancers, <b>lumpectomies</b> should be treated only by senior residents or attending surgeons, even if supervision during the operation is given by an attending surgeon for junior residents. Radicality of breast carcinoma excision, defined by the tumor-free margin of the removed specimen has been determined to be the major prognostic factor for local recurrence. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the influence of operative experience in obtaining tumor-free margins in breast-conserving therapy (BCT). Can lumpectom...|$|R
50|$|For {{patients}} with {{invasive ductal carcinoma}} who have <b>lumpectomies,</b> lymph node biopsy and radiation therapy are usually recommended. Adjuvant chemotherapy is often recommended, {{but it may not}} be recommended if the tumor is small and there are no lymph node metastases. For larger tumors, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended.|$|R
5|$|In 2009, the Romneys {{sold their}} primary {{residence}} in Belmont and their ski chalet in Utah, leaving them an estate along Lake Winnipesaukee in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and an oceanfront {{home in the}} La Jolla district of San Diego, California, which they had purchased the year before. The La Jolla home proved beneficial in location and climate for Ann Romney's multiple sclerosis therapies and for recovering from her late 2008 diagnosis of mammary ductal carcinoma in situ and subsequent <b>lumpectomy.</b> Both it and the New Hampshire location were near some of their grandchildren. Romney maintained his voting registration in Massachusetts, however, and bought a smaller condominium in Belmont during 2010.|$|E
5|$|Romney was {{diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis in 1998 and has credited a mixture of mainstream and alternative treatments with giving her a lifestyle mostly without limitations. In one activity, equestrianism, she has consequently received recognition in dressage as an adult amateur {{at the national level}} and competed professionally in Grand Prix as well. In 2008, she was also diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, a non-invasive type of breast cancer. She underwent a <b>lumpectomy</b> in December of the same year and has since been cancer-free.|$|E
5|$|Peggy starts dating {{businessman}} George Palmer (Paul Moriarty), {{unaware that}} he is a criminal involved in illegal money laundering. She instigates a hate campaign against local resident Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) when she discovers he is HIV positive and begins a feud with his mother Pauline (Wendy Richard). Peggy later realises she was wrong when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. She initially refuses surgery and ends things with George, fearing that he {{will not be able to}} handle her illness. However, supported by George and her family, she eventually has a <b>lumpectomy.</b> Peggy and George get engaged but their relationship ends when Phil reveals his criminal nature. Peggy goes on to date local car lot owner, Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), and they become engaged. Peggy has doubts about the wedding when her cancer returns and she has to have a mastectomy, but eventually decides to go through with it. Tension develops between Peggy and Phil when Grant leaves for Rio de Janeiro after a violent fight with his brother. To spite Peggy, Phil sells Grant's share in the pub to local businessman Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for £5. Peggy loathes Dan, and the two frequently row over the running of the pub. Eventually, she and Phil call a truce and force Dan out of Walford. Peggy discovers Frank is planning to leave her for his ex-wife, Pat (Pam St. Clement), so she shames them by reading Frank's Dear Jane letter to the entire pub and then slaps them both. She throws Frank out and he leaves Walford. Afterwards, Peggy becomes depressed and begins to rely heavily on tranquillisers. When Frank's daughter, Janine (Charlie Brooks), taunts her on Christmas Day about her father moving on, Peggy begins drinking heavily and smashes up the pub with a baseball bat. The next year, Peggy is forced to sell the pub as Frank left her in debt, and is furious to discover the new owner is Sharon.|$|E
30|$|Data were {{obtained}} for 5421 women. The percentage of women of Asian descent was small (n =  120), therefore, we excluded these women from analysis. We also excluded 1147 women who received partial or segmental mastectomies, which are often <b>lumpectomies</b> that rarely receive breast reconstruction. The 1147 women excluded accounted for 1  % of the reconstruction in the original sample. The final sample consisted of 4154 African American and Caucasian women who received mastectomy for definitive breast cancer treatment.|$|R
50|$|But {{the news}} about the falsified data {{blackened}} Fisher's image, {{at least for a}} time. Many breast-cancer sufferers who had followed Fisher's advice and opted for <b>lumpectomies</b> instead of radical mastectomies were especially outraged. Sharon Batt accused Fisher in her book, Patient No More: The Politics of Breast Cancer, of a “shocking breach of trust.” Amid the charges of scientific malfeasance, the NCI and the University of Pittsburgh removed him as head of the NSABP. At the time of his removal, he was engaged in a clinical trial studying whether tamoxifen could prevent breast cancer.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{report a}} novel {{observation}} about breast cancer. We imaged 6 fresh pathological specimens {{of breast cancer}} (1 mastectomy and 5 <b>lumpectomies)</b> with a sensitive infrared camera. We found that, following exposure to hot air for 1 min, the cancers warmed up {{much less than the}} surrounding normal breast with a difference ranging from 12 to 20 °C. We believe that this physical property of cancer should be explored and may give us better insight into the nature of cancer, its diagnosis (including intraoperative diagnosis) and targeted treatment...|$|R
25|$|<b>Lumpectomy</b> {{techniques}} are increasingly utilized for breast-conservation cancer surgery. Studies indicate that {{for patients with}} a single tumor smaller than 4cm, a <b>lumpectomy</b> with negative surgical margins may {{be as effective as}} a mastectomy. Prior to a <b>lumpectomy,</b> a needle-localization of the lesion with placement of a guidewire may be performed, sometimes by an interventional radiologist if the area being removed was detected by mammography or ultrasound, and sometimes by the surgeon if the lesion can be directly palpated.|$|E
25|$|Stage 2 and 3 cancers with a {{progressively}} poorer prognosis {{and greater}} risk of recurrence are generally treated with surgery (<b>lumpectomy</b> or mastectomy with or without lymph node removal), chemotherapy (plus trastuzumab for HER2+ cancers) and sometimes radiation (particularly following large cancers, multiple positive nodes or <b>lumpectomy).</b>|$|E
25|$|General {{surgeons}} {{perform a}} majority of all non-cosmetic breast surgery from <b>lumpectomy</b> to mastectomy, especially pertaining to the evaluation and diagnosis, of breast cancer.|$|E
40|$|Hamartoma of {{the breast}} is an {{uncommon}} lesion. Although it can possess characteristic radiological features, the pathological appearance is not distinctive. Hamartoma is generally considered benign, but four cases have been reported with ductal and lobular carcinoma arising in hamartomas. This report describes further cases of hamartoma from which ductal carcinoma in situ arose, with one showing early invasion. In both cases, the tumours were within the hamartomas and were adequately excised during <b>lumpectomies</b> of the hamartomas, and the patients were well afterwards. This report emphasises the importance of adequate sampling of mammary hamartoma...|$|R
50|$|In December 2009, Heinz {{revealed}} she {{was being}} treated for breast cancer. She revealed she has had several <b>lumpectomies</b> and will be following up with a targeted type of radiation therapy treatment called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). She has not revealed what type of APBI she will be receiving. APBI {{is a way of}} delivering radiation to the breast for five days or less, rather than six to eight weeks. Radiation oncologists are still studying this new method to see if it is as effective as the longer regimen.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: So called “extreme oncoplastic surgery” is {{emerging}} as a new promising concept in breast cancer surgery allowing successful breast conservation in selected patients with multicentric tumors. Presentation of case: We report {{the case of a}} 48 -year-old woman presenting with a multicentric breast cancer and successfully treated with an oncoplastic technique consisting in three radical <b>lumpectomies</b> followed by breast reshaping and simultaneous contralateral symmetrization. Discussion: According to our experience, oncoplastic conserving breast surgery could represent a better option than the combination of mastectomy, reconstruction and radiation therapy, in terms of quality of life for selected patients affected by multicentric breast cancer. Conclusion: The surgical treatment for multicentric breast cancers remains controversial even though emerging evidences show good oncological and aesthetic outcomes following oncoplastic conserving breast surgery...|$|R

25|$|A {{study is}} {{currently}} underway by the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) {{to determine whether}} limiting radiation therapy to only the tumor site following <b>lumpectomy</b> is as effective as radiating the whole breast.|$|E
40|$|The surgery {{of breast}} cancer has changed lately in favour of breast conserving treatment, {{the main purpose of}} which is to provide good {{cosmetic}} results together with radical resection of the tumour. In this paper we describe the cosmetic results obtained in 242 patients treated by conservative surgery (226 quadrantectomies, 93 %, and 16 <b>lumpectomies,</b> 7 %) for low risk breast cancer. Several of these resections were combined with plastic surgical techniques for residual breast reshaping. The technique chosen depended on the site of tumour, width of resection, and breast volume. The cosmetic assessment was made by the patient and the physician. Our data suggest that better cosmetic results may be obtained when plastic surgical procedures are combined with conservative surgery for breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|Although breast {{conservation}} therapy now {{provides an}} option equal {{in terms of}} overall survival to mas-tectomy, 1 some women with breast cancer and some physicians still choose mastectomy, for many reasons. A major factor in this decision is often the length of treat-ment. The six- to seven-week course of daily radiation treatment 2, 3 has been an obstacle to many women who would otherwise {{be able to have}} successful breast conserv-ing treatment. 4 Up to 43 percent of cancer patients who are eligible to receive breast conservation therapy instead elect to have a mastectomy. 2 Even more worrisome, 15 to 30 percent of women who have <b>lumpectomies</b> do not receive prescribed radiation therapy. 2, 3 This leaves them at significant risk for local recurrence, as was evidenced i...|$|R
25|$|The {{breast cancer}} {{movement}} {{has resulted in}} widespread acceptance of second opinions, the development of less invasive surgical procedures, the spread of support groups, and other advances in patient care. The movement successfully separated diagnostic biopsy from mastectomy surgery; before about 1980, it was common to perform the biopsy and, if a quick review of tissues indicated a probable need, a mastectomy in the same surgery. The one-step surgery prevented women from seeking different opinions about their treatment, and sent them into the surgery without knowing whether their breasts would be removed that day. In response to women's concerns over lymphedema after routine removal of lymph nodes during mastectomy, the more limited approach of sentinel node biopsy was developed. Advocacy efforts also led to the formal recommendation against the routine use of the Halsted radical mastectomy in favor of simple mastectomies and <b>lumpectomies.</b>|$|R
25|$|After surgery, {{radiation}} {{and other treatments}} have been completed, many patients notice the affected breast seems smaller or seems to have shrunk. This is basically due to the removal of tissue during the <b>lumpectomy</b> operation.|$|E
25|$|Stage 1 cancers (and DCIS, LCIS) have an {{excellent}} prognosis and are generally treated with <b>lumpectomy</b> and sometimes radiation. HER2+ cancers should be treated with the trastuzumab (Herceptin) regime. Chemotherapy is uncommon for other types of stage 1 cancers.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is {{the primary}} {{management}} for breast cancer. Depending on staging and biologic characteristics of the tumor, surgery can be a <b>lumpectomy</b> (removal of the lump only), a mastectomy, or a modified radical mastectomy. Lymph nodes are often included in the scope of breast tumor removal. Surgery can be performed before or after receiving systemic therapy.|$|E
5000|$|The Breast Cancer Research Stamp was {{the idea}} of Ernie Bodai, MD, a breast surgeon. In 1997 he {{approached}} the United States Postal Service about pricing a stamp a few pennies over the regular price with the extra pennies to be used for breast cancer research. He was turned away. [...] Dr. Bodai is a Kaiser Permanente surgeon who performs <b>lumpectomies</b> and mastectomies on women with breast cancer. Betsy Mullen is a breast cancer survivor and advocate, the Founder of WIN Against Breast Cancer and the Breast Buddy Breast Care Program. Dr. Bodai, Betsy Mullen and David Goodman spent their money and time lobbying for Congress' approval of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. Dr. Bodai later began a nonprofit organization, Cure Breast Cancer Inc., to raise money to bring attention to the BCR Stamp and the breast cancer cause.|$|R
40|$|Decellularized {{adipose tissue}} (DAT) has shown great {{potential}} {{for use as a}} regenerative scaffold in breast reconstruction following mastectomies or <b>lumpectomies.</b> Mechanical properties of such scaffolds are of great importance in order to mimic natural adipose tissue. This study focuses on the characterization of mechanical properties and assessment of DAT scaffolds for implantation into a human breast. DAT samples sourced from multiple adipose tissue depots within the body were tested and their elastic and hyperelastic parameters were obtained. Subsequently simulations were conducted where the calculated hyperelastic parameters were tested as a real human breast model under two different gravity loading situations (prone-to-supine, and prone-to-upright positions). DAT samples were also modelled for post-mastectomy, and post-lumpectomy reconstruction purposes. Results show that DAT shows similar deformability to that of native tissue, and varying DAT depots exhibited little intrinsic nonlinearity. Finally, contour defects were not observed for the samples under either loading conditions...|$|R
30|$|Clinicopathologic {{information}} of TNBC patients were retrospectively {{collected from the}} Department of Pathology, Cancer Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. The study comprised women diagnosed with TNBC from January 1999 to December 2008. Basal-like breast cancer is defined as triple-negative tumors (lack of ER, PR and HER 2 expression) with expression of cytokeratin 56 (CK 56) and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as previously reported. The inclusion criteria were also determined as follows: primary operable breast cancer, no family history for breast or ovary cancer, no prior treatments before surgery, mastectomies, or <b>lumpectomies</b> specimens with sufficient tissue. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were built as previously reported (Zhu et al. 2015). In brief, two tumor cores and one normal core of 1.0  mm diameter were taken from each case based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Then, TMAs were performed with immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ mRNA hybridization and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). The study was approved by the Institute Review Board of the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. Each participant signed an Institutional Review Board approved informed consent in accordance with current guidelines.|$|R
25|$|As of 2014 cryoablation {{is being}} studied {{to see if}} it could be a {{substitute}} for a <b>lumpectomy</b> in small cancers. There is tentative evidence in those with tumors less than 2 centimeters. It may also be used in those in who surgery is not possible. Another review states that cryoablation looks promising for early breast cancer of small size.|$|E
25|$|Jane Emily Goward {{was born}} in Wakefield in Yorkshire in 1964, the sixth of ten {{children}} of a dentist. When she was aged 11, the family emigrated to Australia but returned after three years. In 1990, Tomlinson applied to study Mathematics at the University of Leeds. However, when she found a lump in her breast and had a <b>lumpectomy,</b> she enrolled instead at Leeds General Infirmary and trained as a radiographer. By this time, she had married Mike Tomlinson and had two daughters, Suzanne and Rebecca. They later had a son, Steven. Qualifying in 1993, Tomlinson later studied to postgraduate level and became a paediatric radiographer. Three years after having a <b>lumpectomy</b> the cancer returned {{and she had a}} second mastectomy, and two rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In 2000, Jane Tomlinson was told that the cancer had spread to her bones and lungs, and was given about 12 months to live.|$|E
25|$|The breast implant has no {{clinical}} bearing upon <b>lumpectomy</b> breast-conservation {{surgery for}} women who developed breast cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the breast implant interfere with external beam radiation treatments (XRT); moreover, the post-treatment incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular contracture. The study Breast Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies, reported a significant delay in the diagnoses of women who developed breast cancer after undergoing breast augmentation, when compared to breast cancer patients who had not undergone breast augmentation. The metadata study Breast Implants following Mastectomy in Women with Early-stage Breast Cancer: Prevalence and Impact on Survival (2005) reported that breast augmentation patients were statistically likelier to die from breast cancer. Although the use of implants for breast reconstruction after breast cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of cancer-related death, women who underwent a mastectomy procedure tend to die earlier than women who underwent a <b>lumpectomy</b> procedure, with like diagnoses.|$|E
40|$|As {{the number}} of soft tissue correctional {{procedures}} increases yearly and the current methods being inadequate, alternative methods of rectifying defects has become a focus for tissue engineers. Our long-term goal is to engineer adipose tissue to correct soft tissue defects resulting from aging, trauma, congenital abnormalities, and tumor resection (including <b>lumpectomies</b> and mastectomies). The immediate objective is to develop and characterize a photopolymerizable synthetic hydrogel system {{to act as a}} bioactive scaffold that promotes preadipocyte (precursor cell to adipocyte) adhesion and proliferation for adipose tissue engineering. We have shown that poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate derivatized with enzyme-sensitive degradation sites and cell-adhesion ligands promote preadipocyte adhesion, viability, proliferation and differentiation, and demonstrates mechanical properties able to withstand physiological strains and frequencies. The following specific aims address the scope of this thesis: (1) Determine the required polymer chemistry and fabricate a series of hydrogels with and without degradation peptides and cellular binding sites. (2) Quantitatively compare the physical properties (e. g., viscosity, elastic modulus, viscous modulus, complex modulus, and % recovery) of human adipose tissue with hydrogels fabricated. (3) Demonstrate that hydrogels containing adhesion ligands and degradation sites optimally promote preadipocyte adhesion, viability, and proliferation compared to other hydrogel configurations. (4) Demonstrate that preadipocyte-loaded hydrogels promote adipogenesis within a low-shear bioreactor system...|$|R
40|$|Columnar cell lesions (CCLs) of {{the breast}} range from the {{innocuous}} CAPSS (columnar alteration with prominent apical snouts and secretions) to DCIS. Their precancerous potential poses diagnostic and therapeutic riddles, especially in those which show mammographic microcalcifications. Aims: 1. To document the prevalence of CCLs in the breast. 2. To study their morphologic spectrum. 3. To study the significance of their association with benign and malignant breast lesions. Material and Methods: One hundred consecutive breast specimens were studied. These specimens included biopsies, <b>lumpectomies</b> and mastectomies. CCLs were classified as per Schnitt criteria. Associated lesions in the adjacent tissue were studied. Results: Of the 100 samples (43 malignant and 57 benign), 37 cases showed CCL: CAPSS – 23, columnar cell hyperplasia – 11 and columnar cell hyperplasia with atypia – three. The commonest associated lesion was fibrocystic change (n = 54). Their incidence in benign and malignant lesions was 42 % and 30 %, respectively, with no statistical significance in the difference. Lesions with atypia were seen only in malignant cases. Conclusions: CCLs are common and often overlooked. These lesions are seen in association with both benign and malignant breast lesions. It is only the presence of atypia in CCL that warrants a special mention and necessitates follow-up, and resection if indicated. Key words: Columnar cell lesions, breast, CAPS...|$|R
40|$|Female {{breast cancer}} {{patients}} are often confused, frustrated, and devastated by changes occurring in their bodies and the treatment process. Many women express frustration and concern with the inability {{to know what the}} next phases of their life will bring. Previous research also states that many women struggle to communicate with others about treatment as well as side effects. This research examined how woman are use metaphors to describe their experience with breast cancer, specifically throughout the treatment period related to body image struggles. I qualitatively conducted interviews with women who were either currently in treatment or just finishing. My interview questions related to their uncertainties, as well as the changes occurring to their bodies. After conducting the interviews I transcribed the conversations and coded for specific metaphors. The results were consistent with previous research, in that that the interviewees used at least four major metaphors to describe what they are going through. The four most prominent metaphors were (1) journey, (2) game, (3) struggle/fight, (4) grasping. The findings could benefit patients, nurses, physicians as well as family and friends to reduce stress and help with coping. The findings may also help female patients struggling with identity issues due to <b>lumpectomies</b> or mastectomies. Understanding how patients comprehend the disease can ultimately help others to understand and hopefully reduce some of the concerns of all those involved in such situations...|$|R
