6000|$|I excused {{myself from}} {{appearing}} at the luncheon-table; and I drew down the blinds in my sitting-room, {{so that my}} face might not betray me when Lady Claudia's maternal duty brought her upstairs to make inquiries. The same excuse served in both cases--my ride had failed to relieve me of my headache. My aunt's brief visit led to one result which is worth mentioning. The indescribable horror of her that I felt forced the conviction on my mind that we two could live no longer under the same roof. While I {{was still trying to}} face this alternative with the needful composure, my uncle presented himself, in some anxiety about my continued illness. I should certainly have burst out crying, when the kind and dear old man condoled with me, if he had not brought news with him which turned back all my thoughts on myself and my aunt. Michael had shown the General his <b>letter</b> and had <b>given</b> <b>notice</b> to leave. Lady Claudia was present at the time. To her husband's amazement, she abruptly interfered with a personal request to Michael to think better of it, and to remain in his place! ...|$|R
5000|$|James B Fraser & Co Ltd were timber merchants. An {{agreement}} with Denny, Mott & Dickson Ltd in 1929 {{said they would}} buy wood from Denny, and lease a timber yard with the option to buy it or take a long lease on certain terms. The contract's first four clauses concerned the timber. Clause 5 provided for the contract's termination on notice by either party. Clause 6 provided for the letting of the timber yard [...] "to enable the foresaid trading agreement to be carried out." [...] Clause 8 gave the Denny, [...] "in the event of the foregoing trading agreement being terminated by either party as aforesaid, ... the right as at {{the date of the}} termination of the said agreement" [...] to purchase the timber yard at a certain price or to take a lease of it at a certain rent. Because of the Control of Timber (No 4) Order 1939, further transactions between the parties became impossible from the end of September, 1939. Denny continued to occupy the timber yard. In July 1941 James sent a <b>letter</b> purporting to <b>give</b> <b>notice</b> to terminate the agreement and also of their intention to exercise the option of purchase the yard.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis was to use serious games {{as a tool to}} teach about {{obligation}} to <b>give</b> <b>notice.</b> Obligation to <b>give</b> <b>notice</b> means that certain professionals need to report to social services if a child is being harmed. This thesis studied if case-based storytelling could bring a relevant teaching experience, if storytelling could help participants learn about obligation to <b>give</b> <b>notice</b> and how instant and delayed feedback affect the learning. Participants played a story-based game with either instant or delayed feedback and answered three questionnaires about obligation to <b>give</b> <b>notice.</b> The study found that participants did find that the storytelling was useful for learning and gaining more knowledge about about obligation to <b>give</b> <b>notice.</b> For the feedback it was found that both types of feedback made the participants learn significantly more but {{there was no significant difference}} when comparing the feedbacks to each other...|$|R
