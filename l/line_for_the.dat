5|$|Robinson again {{assumed the}} {{position}} as Speaker of the Senate on August 16, 1862 {{as part of}} a political deal to effect the resignation of Governor Beriah Magoffin. Magoffin's lieutenant governor, Linn Boyd, had died in office in 1859, and Magoffin was unwilling to allow John Fisk, then Senate Speaker and next in <b>line</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> governorship, to succeed him. Magoffin agreed to resign if the Senate would elect Robinson as Speaker, putting him next in <b>line</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> governorship. This was done, and at 10:00am on August 18, 1862, Robinson succeeded Magoffin upon the latter's resignation. Because he never resigned from the Senate, Robinson technically held both his legislative seat and the governorship concurrently.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{existing}} double track {{all the way}} from Oslo to Moss, a further upgrade southwards {{will not be able to}} increase capacity past the current single train per hour to Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg and Halden.

The Rail Administration and Ministry of Transport is working on proposals for a high-speed railway between Oslo and Gothenburg in Sweden.
