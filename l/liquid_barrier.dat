50|$|Composite liners are {{required}} {{to be used in}} municipal solid waste systems for landfills and use a double liner system which is composed of a leachate system which is a liquid that collects solids from the substance this is passed through it. The leachate system is surrounded in a by a type of solid drainage layer such as gravel which is enclosed by a geomembrane and compressed clay, also known as a geosynthetic clay liner. This geosynthetic clay liner is usually made of sodium bentonite which is compacted in between two thick pieces of geotextile. The next material surrounding the composite liner would be a leak detection system composed of another material like gravel with an additional geomembrane or complex liner. The geomembranes within the composite liner consist of a high-density polyethylene which provide an effective minimization for flow and deliver and helpful barrier which is used on inorganic contaminants. It {{can be used as a}} substitute for sand or gravel and also has a very high transmissivity and low storage. The lower surface helps provide an effective leak test once correctly installed. It is also a low permeable vapor and <b>liquid</b> <b>barrier.</b> The geosynthetic clay liners are manufactured by factories and the purpose for it being made of sodium bentonite is that they regulate the movement of liquids in gases within the waste. The geocomposites which are a combination of the geomembranes and geosynthetic liner material also include a layer of bentonite between the middle of the layers of geotextile; however, airspace is allowed to be implemented. It is then topped off with a final cover.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{coefficient}} of friction (CoF) of skin against fabric when the skin {{is covered with a}} <b>liquid</b> <b>barrier</b> film versus a silicone dressing, relative to a bare skin baseline. Approach: A laboratory instrument allowing the measurement of friction be-tween two surfaces was used to compare the CoF between a fabric re-presenting bed linen (100 % cotton) and the skin of two laboratory operators, either bare (dry or hydrated) or covered with a <b>liquid</b> <b>barrier</b> film or a silicone dressing. Results: The CoF of hydrated skin was over twice the value found for dry skin. The <b>liquid</b> <b>barrier</b> film product reduced the CoF of hydrated skin {{to a greater extent than}} the silicone dressing. Innovation and Conclusion: Silicone dressings have recently been promoted to help prevent pressure ulcers. Published data have shown that their CoF is lower than other dressings, but the data were not compared to bare skin. We found that a <b>liquid</b> <b>barrier</b> film provided a greater reduction in the CoF of skin against linen than a silicone dressing. In the context of preventative use (e. g., application on intact skin) to reduce the risk of pressure ulcers, applying a <b>liquid</b> <b>barrier</b> film may reduce friction better than a silicone dressing...|$|E

40|$|Contaminants in the {{subsurface}} can {{be contained}} by injection of viscous <b>liquid</b> <b>barriers</b> [1, 2]. These barriers, formed by injection {{of a low}} viscosity liquid which gels after placement in the subsurface, reduce the permeability of the porous media surrounding the contaminants and thereby inhibiting the flow of potentially toxic agents to groundwater. There are several chemical formulations {{that are used in}} <b>liquid</b> <b>barriers</b> technology. Recent work [3] has suggested the use of injectable colloidal silica barriers that contain magnetite. The addition of magnetite would facilitate the precise placement of the grouting liquid during the gelling process. The stabilized colloidal silica-magnetite fluid, called a ferrofluid, can be held in position during the gellation process using permanent or electromagnets, thus providing a means of precise placement of the barrier. To evaluate the long term stability of this type of barrier, an understanding of the interaction of the entrapped contaminants with the barrier material is needed. The interaction of the contaminant species with the barrier can result in either surface adsorption, chemical transformation, or diffusion through the barrier. Any of these phenomena can effect the mobility of the contaminant in the subsurface...|$|R

30|$|In superhydrophilic–underwater superoleophobic filter membranes, {{water is}} {{attached}} to the membrane surface to form an oleophobic <b>liquid</b> <b>barrier,</b> which prevents oil droplets from seeping through, thereby realising oil–water separation [36]. As a result of the underwater oleophobicity and low adhesion to oil, the superhydrophilic material has an excellent underwater antifouling property so that the problem of filter pores being blocked by oil is avoided [47]. However, because of the adhesion of organic pollutants with low surface energy, the superhydrophilicity of this kind of membrane will gradually decrease, which consequently affects the oil–water separation ability.|$|E

In this study, nonwoven fabrics spunbond polypropylene, polyester basis weight of 25  g/m 2 and microporous PTFE film were used to develop tri-laminate antiviral surgical gown. The outer layer of spunbond polypropylene was treated with plasma enhanced fluorocarbon. The plasma treated polypropylene was also treated with titanium nano dispersion finish in a single bath pad-dry-cure method. The pore sizes of nonwoven fabrics were characterized using tri-nocular microscope. The titanium nano finished polypropylene was characterized by scanning electron microscope.
