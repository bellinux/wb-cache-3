Prominent species include the endangered hawksbill sea turtle, the threatened green sea turtle and the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, the Laysan and Nihoa finches, the Nihoa millerbird, <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck,</b> seabirds such as the Laysan albatross, numerous species of plants including Pritchardia palms, and many species of arthropods. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, populations of lobster have not recovered from extensive harvesting in the 1980s and 1990s, which is now banned; the remaining fisheries are overfished.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> is an insular {{relative}} of the mallard, with a very small and fluctuating population. Mallards sometimes arrive on its island home during migration, and {{can be expected to}} occasionally have remained and hybridised with Laysan ducks as long as these species have existed. However, these hybrids are less well adapted to the peculiar ecological conditions of Laysan Island than the local ducks, and thus have lower fitness. These ducks were found throughout the Hawaiian archipelago before 400AD, after which they suffered a rapid decline during the Polynesian colonisation. Now, their range includes only Laysan Island. It is one of the successfully translocated birds, after having become nearly extinct in the early 20thcentury.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, the Tanager Expedition arrived, and {{the rabbits}} were exterminated at long last. The bird {{population}} {{had been reduced}} to about a tenth of its former size. Three endemic taxa had become extinct, as had numerous other plant species. Two other endemic species, the <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> and the Laysan finch, survive to this day, but are endangered.|$|E
50|$|The current {{lake was}} created during the 1980s. Originally {{constructed}} as a stormwater measure, {{it is now}} home to several species of water birds, including mallards, moorhens, ruddy and <b>laysan</b> <b>ducks,</b> Chinese geese, and kingfishers.|$|R
5000|$|Including the Mexican duck in the mallard is a relic {{from the}} usual {{practice}} {{of much of the}} mid-late 20th century, when all North American [...] "mallardines" [...] as well as the Hawaiian and <b>Laysan</b> <b>ducks</b> were included in the mallard proper as subspecies. This was {{based on the assumption that}} hybridization, producing fertile offsprings, is an indicator of lack of speciation.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2004 and 2005, 42 <b>Laysan</b> <b>ducks</b> were {{translocated}} to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge as {{a collaborative}} effort between the United States Geological Survey and Fish and Wildlife Service to restore a second population of ducks in the wild.

2500|$|The {{decline of}} the <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> began between AD 400 and 1000, with the {{colonization}} of the Hawaiian Islands by Polynesians and associated non-native mammalian predators. [...] By 1860, the ducks disappeared from all but Laysan Island (the duck’s namesake), most likely due to predation by introduced rats. [...] Like many isolated island species, the <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> evolved in an environment lacking mammalian predators, and is ill-suited to defend itself against non-native ground hunters, such as humans, rats, pigs, and small Asian mongooses. [...] For example, Laysan ducks {{are more likely to}} freeze their movement rather than flush or fly when startled— a strategy well suited for cryptic defense against Hawaii’s native flying predators, but ineffective against ground predators. [...] Although the non-migratory <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> can fly, it does not disperse between islands.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> is teal-sized {{and dark}} brown, with a {{prominent}} white eye-ring. [...] The bill {{is short and}} spatulate, dark green with variable black blotching in males, and dull orange with variable black blotching in females. The <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> usually has a ring of fat around its neck. Some males show faint iridescence on the head or neck and have slightly upturned central tail feathers. [...] The wing has an iridescent purplish-green patch (speculum feathers) in both sexes. [...] Leucistism, or extensive white feathering, is common {{on the head and}} neck of older birds. [...] The legs and feet are orange, usually brighter in the male. [...] The annual pre-basic molt is complete, and the ducks lose all their flight feathers and become incapable of flight until new feathers grow in. [...] Wild ducks have been known to live to the age of twelve years, and captive birds have lived to the age of eighteen.|$|E
2500|$|Named by Lionel Walter Rothschild in 1892, the <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> {{is named}} after Laysan island, one of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

2500|$|The <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> found refuge {{through most}} of the nineteenth century on rat-free Laysan Island, {{surviving}} within the smallest geographic range of any duck species worldwide (...)

2500|$|A {{recovery}} {{plan for the}} <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> has been developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. [...] The goal of the recovery program is to conserve and recover the species {{to the extent that}} it may be down-listed from endangered to threatened in the near future, and ultimately, that the population be healthy enough to no longer require federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. [...] The emphasis of the {{recovery plan}} is the distribution of additional viable populations in the Laysan duck’s historical and prehistorical range. [...] The creation of multiple populations will decrease the risk that catastrophic events will result in species extinction. [...] The increase of population size will diminish the threats from demographic and environmental uncertainties. [...] To achieve this goal, biologists plan to establish at least five populations on a combination of predator-free Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and predator-controlled sites on Main Hawaiian Islands. [...] This plan includes wild translocation and the establishment of a successful captive or semi-captive breeding program using wild source eggs for reintroductions to the Main Hawaiian Islands. Additionally, the plan calls for achieving gene flow between the wild source populations through long-term inter-island translocations, and island-specific management for each population to reduce threats and improve quality of habitat. [...] If basic criteria of the recovery plan are met, the <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> could be down-listed from endangered to threatened by 2019.|$|E
2500|$|The {{persistence}} of the <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> into the future is optimistic, though threats to the population remain. [...] Threats include the introduction of non-native species, which may change vital rates, displace native species and adversely affect nesting and foraging opportunities. [...] Devastation to vegetation could increase sedimentation of the lakes and seeps that serve as important foraging habitat. [...] Human disturbance may impact nesting and brooding, and landing permits to the Laysan Island refuge are granted only for official or scientific purposes. [...] Debris and contaminants washed ashore by ocean currents could pose {{a serious threat to}} the duck. [...] Pesticide containers and oil spills have contaminated Laysan in the past. [...] The island homes of the duck are especially vulnerable to a rise in sea level and extreme weather associated with global warming. [...] Even a slight rise in sea level would destroy {{a large portion of the}} duck’s current habitat. [...] The spread of parasites such as the nematode Echinuria uncinata could be extremely pathogenic, as well as the introduction of disease by migratory waterfowl along the Pacific Flyway (such as avian influenza, avian malaria, cholera, botulism and duck plague). [...] Environmental catastrophes such as drought, severe storms, and tsunamis may decimate populations. [...] Sea level rise and [...] increased frequency and severity of storms are an anticipated effect of global warming and could effect the population of the <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Midway Atoll is a {{critical}} habitat in the central Pacific Ocean which includes breeding habitat for 17 seabird species. A number of native species rely on the island, which is now home to 67–70% of the world's Laysan albatross population, and 34–39% of the global population of black-footed albatross. A {{very small number of}} the very rare short-tailed albatross also have been observed. Fewer than 2,200 individuals of this species are believed to exist due to excessive feather hunting in the late nineteenth century. [...] In 2007-8, the US Fish and Wildlife Service translocated 42 endangered <b>Laysan</b> <b>ducks</b> to the atoll as part of their efforts to conserve the species.|$|R
2500|$|The {{removal of}} {{invasive}} weeds is, in most cases, {{more difficult than}} removing animal species. One such eradication was that of sandbur, Cencrus echinatus, an introduced grass on Laysan. The grass, introduced to Laysan around 1961, had taken over 30% of the island by 1991, displaced the native bunchgrass, and reduced the breeding habitat of two endemic threatened species, the <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> and Laysan finch, {{as well as those}} of several seabirds. [...] The removal took ten years, with controlled spraying for the first year, then individual removal of plants, then, when few plants were being found, sifting of the sands around plants to remove seeds. The cost of the eradication program was $150,000/year.|$|E
2500|$|Laysan is {{generally}} regarded as the [...] "gem" [...] of the NWHI, with the most biodiversity. It {{is home to the}} <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck,</b> the rarest duck in the world. The other native land bird of Laysan is the Laysan finch, an opportunistic hunter. Eighteen other bird species nest here and use Lake Laysan, the only lake in the NWHI, as a rest stop or breeding ground. Laysan also has its share of native plants, many of which, such as Eragrostis variabilis, were extirpated from Laysan during its extinction period and then reintroduced by scientists afterwards, from other leeward islands. Like most other of the NWHI, Laysan is home to Hawaiian monk seals and green sea turtles.|$|E
2500|$|After many {{domestic}} rabbits starved {{and the remaining}} ones were eradicated by biologists in 1923, the ducks began to recover, increasing to {{a population of about}} 500 individuals by the 1950s. Congress passed the Endangered Species Preservation Act in 1966, and in 1967 the <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> was declared an endangered species with federal protection. [...] However, population bottlenecks occurred, such as the severe 1993 El Niño drought and food shortage, which reduced the number of ducks to about 100. [...] Today, breeding and survival of the birds are closely tracked. [...] Since 1998, a sample of birds have been fitted with unique leg bands or radio transmitters for monitoring reproductive success and survival, revealing that typically only 30% of ducklings on Laysan Island survive to fledge. In 2004, the population grew to an estimated 576 ducks.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> {{walks and}} runs well, with a pelvic girdle adapted to {{terrestrial}} foraging. [...] Energetic foraging behavior includes a fly-snapping sprint through Neoscatella sexnotata brine fly swarms. [...] With necks outstretched, and bills {{close to the}} ground, the ducks run along a mudflat and as clouds of flies rise up in front, snap them up by rapidly opening and closing their bills. [...] The ducks also will dabble and filter feed along lake shallows, shore, and in upland vegetation for macroinvertebrates, algae, leaves, and seeds. [...] During the day, {{and especially in the}} breeding season, they prefer to hide among the grass and shrub vegetation, helping them to avoid avian predators such as frigatebirds. They prefer to venture out in the open and feed on the lake from dusk til dawn, although there seems to be marked variation from year to year according to the availability of food items.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Laysan</b> <b>duck</b> (Anas laysanensis), {{also known}} as the Laysan teal, is a dabbling duck endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. [...] Fossil {{evidence}} reveals that Laysan ducks once lived across the entire archipelago, but today survive only on Laysan Island. The duck has evolved several behavioral traits linked to the absence of ground-based predators in its habitat; these include freezing or running to escape danger rather than flying, which made the duck vulnerable to hunting by humans, and the pigs, rats and mongooses they brought with them to Hawaii. By 1860, the ducks had disappeared from everywhere except Laysan Island. The introduction of rabbits brought the bird to the brink of extinction in 1912 with twelve surviving individuals. Rabbits were eradicated from the island in 1923 and numbers of Laysan ducks began to rise, reaching 500 by the 1950s. In an effort to ensure the long-term future of this duck, 42 birds were translocated to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in 2002. These thrived in their new surroundings, and another group were later relocated to Kure Atoll.|$|E
