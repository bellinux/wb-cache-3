50|$|In {{an effort}} to get the engine and gearbox to fit, some chassis {{triangulation}} was removed compared to that of the Grantura Mk 3, and various parts of the chassis were simply hammered until the drivetrain fitted.

50|$|The 'SPR' limited-edition racing {{homologation}} {{model has}} special factory parts including wide-mouthed TRM40 carbs, close-ratio gearbox, magnesium engine covers, alloy water pump, six-piston brake calipers, {{and a new}} braced swingarm. A wider rear wheel holding a wider 180 rear <b>section</b> <b>tyre</b> was also fitted. The 'SPR' was 10 kilos lighter than the WP.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the early}} {{motorcycle}} industry progressed, larger tyre sizes accompanied larger engine displacements, {{so that by}} 1909-1914, 2+1/4 in section, 26 in diameter tyres were used on [...] motorcycles, and 2+3/8 to 2+1/2 in <b>section</b> <b>tyres</b> appeared on motorcycles with displacements over 350 cc. Indian tyres reached 3.0 × 28 in, giving even greater rider comfort but with a taller seat height.|$|R
50|$|This Twelve shared {{much with}} Morris's 1292cc Ten Four and 1378cc Ten Six using the Ten Four gearbox and ratios but with wider wheels and larger <b>section</b> <b>tyres</b> {{than either of}} the smaller-engined cars and it used, with modifications, the {{wheelbase}} of the Ten Six which was six inches more than the Ten Four. The wheelbase was almost an inch longer than the Ten Six. It also had a fuel tank which held a gallon more than either of the other cars.|$|R
50|$|Fully {{chromium-plated}} bumpers {{were provided}} {{instead of the}} previous black and chromium edged type and the standardization of Magna type wheels with large <b>section</b> <b>tyres</b> helped {{the appearance of the}} car. The instrument board and other interior woodwork were redesigned. The windscreen was centrally controlled and was given dual wipers working from the bottom. The rear quarter windows were hinged to open. The upholstery was redesigned and could be had in all leather or in a combination of cloth and leather. The spare wheel was covered and there was a wide range of new colour schemes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} part of a single {{assembly}} including its clutch and gearbox. This assembly was held at three points in [...] "live rubber" [...] with a steadying bearing forward of the flywheel. Suspension was by long semi-elliptic springs at each corner of the car controlled by Luvax shock absorbers combined with a front (anti-roll) torsion bar. The chassis was mounted on large <b>section</b> <b>tyres.</b> Spare wheel and tyre were stowed in a separate compartment below the luggage locker. Permanent hydraulic jacks were built into the chassis. Both springs and frame pass beneath the back axle.|$|R

40|$|High value {{crops such as}} peas for {{the frozen}} {{vegetable}} market have to be harvested at the optimum point for quality, regardless of field conditions. Six wheeled pea harvesters with a gross weight of 27 t, giving a wheel load of 4. 5 t are required to move from field to field with optimum timeliness. In order to achieve road speeds of 25 km/h an inflation pressure of 2. 2 bar {{is required for the}} specific tyre load speed rating. Typically, in field conditions, this inflation pressure is not reduced and therefore the likelihood of soil damage is increased. This study was undertaken {{to examine the effects of}} <b>tyre</b> <b>section</b> width and inflation pressure on rolling resistance, rut depth and sub-surface soil deformation. Under controlled laboratory conditions three tyres, at three inflation pressures, with a load of 4. 5 t were passed over a soil at three different initial bulk densities. Measurements of dry bulk density, rut depth, rolling resistance, cone penetrometer resistance and soil deformation through the profile were taken before and after the passage of the tyres. The results show that by increasing the tyre size and reducing the inflation pressure the depth at which compaction occurs and rut depth decrease by 44 %. The 800 mm <b>section</b> <b>tyre</b> causes less compaction than any of the other tyres tested especially when inflated to 1. 6 bar. Rolling resistance is reduced when the tyre is inflated to the optimum for each tyre. The change in bulk density when plotted against either initial bulk density or penetration resistance results in a set of curves which can be used by the manufacturer, farmer or operator to select the correct <b>tyre</b> <b>section</b> width and inflation pressure for field conditions. As a result of this study the harvester manufacturers are investigating the engineering requirements of increasing <b>tyre</b> <b>section</b> width to 800 mm and are now equipping pea harvesters with central tyre inflation systems. The benefits of which would be to significantly reduce the amount of soil compaction, reduce rolling resistance and save the operator £ 455 000 per annum in fuel costs...|$|R
