Many countries, including Canada and the United States, have issued special labels for envelopes that have travelled through the dead letter office.

40|$|PC {{franking}} systems allow {{customers to}} download <b>postage</b> <b>value</b> into their PCs and to print <b>postage</b> <b>value</b> onto envelopes or mailing labels by using regular desktop printers connected to their PCs. In emerging standards, {{such as the}} IBIP program of the US postal services, the resulting imprints are called indicia, and they are printed as 2 D bar codes that are easy and reliable to scan while passing through the mail delivery system. In contrast to the IBIP program, which requires a tamper responsive postal security device for each customer, we propose a pure software solution for PC franking systems that is more secure for the postal services, gives more privacy to the customers and {{has the potential of}} being much cheaper than any IBIP compliant franking system. In contrast to existing PCfranking products that require no hardware postal security device, our solution works o#- line. Customers are not required to be online while printing indicia. Our solution operates anexisting o#ine e- ash scheme over certain elliptic curves rather than over finite fields. 1 Ke ywords: Open franking systems, o#ine electronic cash, blind signature, elliptic curves. ...|$|R

Given h and k, find the maximal integer n = n(h, k) such that all integer <b>postage</b> <b>values</b> from 1 to n can be made up.

The problem statement is usually modified by augmenting the solution sets with a stamp of value zero, and requiring that a letter carry exactly h stamps.|$|R

These stamps were semipostals: they had a purchase price (45¢) higher than their <b>postage</b> <b>value</b> (34¢), with the balance given to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's relief efforts. A special exception was thus made to the normal requirement by the United States Postal Service that subjects of stamps be deceased.|$|R

50|$|However, {{during his}} direction, Hulot's {{relations}} with the postal administration had wavered many times. Reluctant as soon as December 1855 to perforate stamps like the British Post Office began, Hulot was forced to adopt {{it at the end}} of 1861, with stamp issue in 1862. Worse, after Jacques-Jean Barre died in 1855, he didn't succeed to work with his son and new general engraver, Désiré-Albert and they end their association in August 1866. But their conflict continued next Autumn until the Commission of Mint and Medals decided that Barre son had to reengrave a laurel-crowned Napoleon III hallmark. Hulot created new stamps including the 5 franc stamp, the first <b>large</b> <b>postage</b> stamp of France, by putting together older material from Barre father and son until the 1870s.|$|R

This paper {{describes}} a two-stage {{system for the}} recognition of <b>postage</b> meter <b>values.</b> A feed-forward Neural Abstraction Pyramid is initialized in an unsupervised manner and trained in a supervised fashion to classify an entire digit block. It does not need prior digit segmentation. If the block recognition is not confident enough, a second stage tries to recognize single digits, {{taking into account the}} block classifier output for a neighboring digit as context. The system is evaluated on a large database. It can recognize meter values that are hard to read for humans. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{poster stamp}} was an {{advertising}} label, a little <b>larger</b> than most <b>postage</b> stamps, that {{originated in the}} mid-19th century and quickly became a collecting craze, growing in popularity until World War One and then declining by World War Two until they are now almost forgotten except by collectors of cinderella stamps.|$|R
50|$|The Mulready {{illustration}} {{was effectively}} a very elaborate frank indicating that postage had been pre-paid.

The one penny and two penny values were in the same black and blue colours as the same <b>value</b> <b>postage</b> stamps.|$|R

50|$|It seems {{also that}} the Spanish postal {{authorities}} tolerated the splitting of <b>large</b> denomination <b>postage</b> stamp into two stamps of a lower value. A local philatelist, for instance, owns an envelope postmarked in Manila on July 6, 1857 and addressed to one S.D. Felino Gil of Guagua, Pampanga. The envelope bore on its upper left hand corner a 10 quartos stamp cut diagonally to pass as a 5 quartos stamp. The explanation of this oddity {{seems to be that}} {{due to the lack of}} a 10 quartos stamps the stamp teller cut the stamp in half so he could have two 5 quartos stamps to conform in all likelihood with the local postal rate at that time.|$|R

50|$|For each driving post {{consignment}} the postage {{was calculated}} concerning the weight, the <b>postage</b> of <b>value</b> was only charged, if the consignment was declared by {{the means of}} value. For each rating-route the minimum of weight-postage {{was considered to be}} the letter postage. All consignments, for which a higher postage was calculated due to the application of the weight-tariff, it should be charged: for each pound per every 5 miles ½ Kreuzer or 2 Silberpfennig or the respective value in the country's currency. But for heavy letters the respective postage has to be charged according to the letter or driving post tariff. It is optional mailing the consignments unstamped or completely stamping them for the place of destination. The postage acquisition is especially calculated regarding the abovementioned tariff regulations for the delivery route of each individual administration. Returning and forwarding consignments are subject of the taxes for the delivery route for the way forth and back.|$|R
