5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|After Parliament was {{dissolved}} in June 1802, another election saw Coke again returned, although in a contested election that cost the candidates £35,000. With {{the death of}} William Pitt in 1806, the two Whig groups agreed to an alliance, which {{took the form of}} the Ministry of All the Talents; Fox was confirmed as Foreign Secretary, and Windham as Secretary for War and the Colonies. The government apparently offered Coke a peerage, which he refused, and primarily focused on the abolition of slavery, which was accomplished only after the death of Fox on 13 September 1806. Fox's death made Parliament <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its appeal to Coke, as they had been close friends. His attendance {{in the next two years}} was very limited, and the next occasion of note was his support of the Corn Laws, which were highly unpopular in Norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a short-haired girl would stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long hair in the early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> her hair in the process. Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, her uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not fit with the manga's setting and states that {{it is best to}} treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E

5|$|Suddenly, {{an image}} of Discord on the stained-glass windows comes to life, teasing the ponies and Celestia. Discord claims to have taken the Elements and alludes to {{where they can be}} located. Twilight {{believes}} Discord is referring to the hedge maze near the castle and the six race there. Discord appears in his true form and challenges the ponies to a game, telling them that the only rules are they are not allowed to fly or use magic (enforcing this rule by making the unicorns' horns and Pegasi's wings vanish), and that if any of them leave the game, he automatically wins. Despite their handicap, the ponies enter the maze, but they are soon separated by Discord's magic. He is able to individually test Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Fluttershy against their respected Elements, making them be momentarily hypnotized, <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their color, and become a polar opposite of their Element. Twilight encounters each of them after this point, aware of their personality shift, but oblivious to their encounter with Discord. Soon, they find Rainbow Dash, having regained her wings, flying away from the maze and betraying not only her Element of Loyalty, but also forfeiting the game by leaving; the maze falls around them and Discord boasts his victory, warning of an incoming storm of chaos.|$|E

25|$|On August 22, 2009, Mainichi Shimbun {{went further}} {{to predict that}} the DPJ could win over 320 seats, meaning almost all DPJ {{candidates}} would win. Mainichi noted that the DPJ appeared to be doing well {{in the western part}} of Japan, a traditional stronghold of the LDP, and that the LDP could lose all of its single-member constituency seats in 15 prefectures, including Hokkaidō, Aichi, and Saitama. Also, according to Mainichi, the Japanese Communist Party will probably retain its previous 9 seats, while the Komeito Party and the Social Democratic Party may <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their shares.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of water stress {{is an area}} of continuing research in viticulture. Of particular focus is the connection between yield size and the potential benefits of water stress. Since the act of stressing the vine does contribute to reduce photosynthesis-and by extension, reduce ripening since the sugars produced by photosynthesis is needed for grape development-it is possible that a stressed vine with high yields will only produce lots of under ripe grapes. Another interest of study is the potential impact on white grape varieties with enologists and viticulturists such as Cornelius Van Leeuwen and Catherine Peyrot Des Gachons contending that white grape varieties <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their aromatic qualities when subjugated to even mild forms of water stress.|$|E

The state capital was moved from nearby Chillicothe (its last {{location}} outside Columbus) to Columbus, Ohio in 1816, and the National Road (present U.S. Route 40 or more roughly Interstate 70) {{went through the}} center of Ohio. This road started at Baltimore and ending in Illinois. So, the focus of commerce in Ohio shifted from the communities along Zane's Trace {{to the center of the}} state. Among the cities the National Road crossed was Springfield, Ohio, where it arrived in 1836 and stopped for ten years while lawmakers argued about where it would go from there. Located at that terminus, Springfield especially boomed during those ten years.|$|E
25|$|Chewing gum {{is rather}} shelf stable {{because of its}} {{non-reactive}} nature and low moisture content. The water activity of chewing gum ranges from 0.40-0.65. The moisture content of chewing gum ranges from 3-6%. In fact, chewing gum retains its quality for so long that, in most countries, it is not {{required by law to}} be labeled with an expiration date. If chewing gum remains in a stable environment, over time the gum may become brittle or <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its flavor, but it will never be unsafe to eat. If chewing gum is exposed to moisture, over time water migration may occur, making the gum soggy. In lollipops with a gum center, water migration can lead {{to the end of the}} product’s shelf life, causing the exterior hard candy shell to soften and the interior gum center to harden.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the people}} in these {{countries}} have become educated enough and they realize {{their place in the}} world economy, they can also demand help from the core countries. Although unlikely, {{due to the fact that}} the core countries rely on the exploitation of the periphery, there have been pushes for core countries to help better the periphery countries. Some of the ideas suggested are to help aid the periphery countries in developing by exploiting them less, help the periphery countries <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their debt and raise the prices on goods coming from these countries to allow them to be more profitable. These policies are obviously not beneficial to the core countries and is mostly why they have never been adapted successfully but this is another way in which the periphery could rise to a higher status.|$|E

25|$|Though {{these events}} caused the Takeda family to <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{its power and}} influence, it {{remained}} intertwined with the ruling class of Japan. More importantly, the move to Aizu and subsequent events profoundly shaped what would emerge as Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu in the 19th century. One important event was the adoption of Tokugawa Ieyasu's grandson, Komatsumaru (1611–1673), by Takeda Kenshoin (fourth daughter of Takeda Shingen). Komatsumaru devoted himself {{to the study of}} the Takeda family's martial arts, and was subsequently adopted by Hoshina Masamitsu. Komatsumaru changed his name to Hoshina Masayuki (保科 正之), and in 1644 was appointed the governor of Aizu. As governor, he mandated that all subsequent rulers of Aizu study the arts of Ono-ha Ittō-ryū (which he himself had mastered), as well as the art of oshikiuchi, a martial art which he developed for shogunal counselors and retainers, tailored to conditions within the palace. These arts became incorporated into and comingled with the Takeda family martial arts.|$|E
25|$|Even when Attewell {{became the}} MCC's chief bowler and {{increased}} his aggreagte of wickets to around 150 from 1889 to 1892, {{he did not}} cement his Test spot, and improving pitches and a severe shortage of support bowling caused Attewell's average to blow out to 21 in 1893 – and his record of 111 wickets at 17.54 in 1894 was disappointing given how much the pitches helped a bowler of his type. Although for the following three years Attewell did remarkably well on all pitches considering Nottinghamshire had no other bowlers even approaching county standard, the great strength of English bowling meant he was not considered for a Test match after 1891. In 1898, Attewell's tireless bowling at last seemed to <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its sting, and he failed to reach 100 wickets {{for the first time}} in a decade. The extremely dry summer of 1899 showed Attewell's capacity to bowl and bowl all day really was no more: he took only 29 wickets at the extremely high (even on such pitches) cost of 34.62 – in county matches he took just 19 wickets for 38.73 each.|$|E

[...] However, Wallace objected to Poulton's suggestion that arctic birds and mammals are white to reduce heat loss by radiation, for which he argued {{there was no evidence}} in favour, while a thicker [...] "covering, such as actually occurs in all arctic animals" [...] would reduce heat loss effectively, and could be observed to do so.|$|E

500|$|In 1958, Tracy {{appeared}} in The Old Man and the Sea, {{a project that}} had been in development for five years. An adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's novella of the same name, Hemingway's agent, Leland Hayward, had previously written to the author: [...] "Of all Hollywood people, the one that comes the closest to me in quality, in personality and voice, in personal dignity and ability, is Spencer Tracy." [...] Tracy was delighted to be offered the role. He was told to <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his 210 pounds before filming began, but failed to do so. Hemingway thus reported that Tracy was a [...] "terrible liability to the picture", and had to be reassured that the star was being carefully photographed to disguise his weight. Appearing alone on screen {{for the majority of the}} film, Tracy considered The Old Man and the Sea the toughest part he ever played. In reviewing the performance, Jack Moffitt of the Hollywood Reporter said it was [...] "so intimate and revealing of universal human experience that, to me, it almost transcended acting and became reality." [...] Tracy received Oscar and BAFTA Award nominations for the work.|$|E
500|$|The {{independence}} of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after the American War of Independence caused Britain to <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its oldest and most populous colonies. British attention soon turned towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century. Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica ("British Peace"), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman. In the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain; {{by the time of}} the Great Exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the [...] "workshop of the world". The British Empire expanded to include most of India, large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world. Alongside the formal control that Britain exerted over its own colonies, its dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America.|$|E
