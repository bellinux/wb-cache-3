40|$|<b>Lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis L.) 'Kaimana' {{was named}} in 1982 {{to commemorate the}} 75 th ("diamond") anniversary of the {{establishment}} of the Hawaii Agricultural Experiment Station. 'Kaimana' means "diamond" in the Hawaiian language. The original seedling tree of 'Kaimana' grown at the Poamoho experimental farm on Oahu first produced fruit in 1965 at 10 years of age. This is truly a jewel of a lychee, producing excellent quality fruit. In addition, it has a more consistent bearing habit than any of the 14 Chinese lychee cultivars imported and tested in Hawaii during the past 110 years...|$|E

40|$|Development of <b>lychee</b> fruit (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis Sonn., cv. Kway May Pink) was studied from 21 to 103 {{days after}} anthesis, with {{specific}} {{emphasis on the}} pericarp. Pericarp structure was initially folded, with subsequent expansion closely associated with aril development. Cuticle thickness decreased from 8. 75 |j,m to 1. 88 μm at maturity, with micro-cracking of the pericarp surface observed 62 days after anthesis. Chlorophyll degradation and flavonoid production occurred simultaneously. Pericarp pH increased during ontogeny, and its possible interaction with pigment stability is discussed. Polyphenol oxidase activity decreased during fruit maturation, with peak activity prior to anthocyanin production. The L-ascorbic acid content of the pericarp decreased throughout development...|$|R
40|$|Polyphenol oxidase activity, {{anthocyanin}} concentration, endogenous ethylene {{production and}} anatomical features of mature <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis Sonn.) pericarp were studied {{to understand better}} post-harvest tissue browning. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity decreased significantly once fruit were harvested. Although anthocyanin degradation occurred, it was far slower than tissue browning. It is considered unlikely that pericarp browning is due to direct pigment degradation by polyphenol oxidase. Pericarp browning {{may in fact be}} caused by non-PPO mediated anthocyanin decolorization, coupled with localized PPO activity affecting secondary metabolites other than anthocyanin. Pericarp browning was correlated with moisture loss. The development of pericarp micro-cracking after harvest was observed, and may be involved in facilitating rapid pericarp moisture loss...|$|E
40|$|Mature <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis Sonn.) fruit were {{heat-treated}} at 60 C for 10 min {{to study}} heat-induced pericarp browning. Polyphenol oxidase (EC 1. 10. 3. 2) {{activity of the}} pericarp increased immediately, corresponding with rapid anthocyanin degradation, Tissue browning was observed 2 min after heating, with pigmentation distributed uniformly throughout the pericarp. The distribution of brown pigments was different than the highly localized browning observed under ambient desiccation. Although both ambient and heat-induced pericarp browning are visually similar, the anatomical distribution of brown pigmentation is quite distinct. The distribution of brown pigmentation was not consistent with anthocyanin localization. Following ambient desiccation, the mesocarp became colorless even though this represented the greatest concentration of pigment. Browning caused by heating may result from nonselective degradation {{of a range of}} compounds, including anthocyanin...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis) {{has been}} {{analyzed}} for cytokinins in buds {{before and after}} flower bud differentiation, using reversephase high performance liquid chromatography in combination with Amaranthus bioassay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring. Four cytokinins, zeatin, zeatin riboside, N 6 -(δ 2 -isopentenyl) adenine, and N 6 -(δ 6 -isopentenyl) adenine riboside, were detected in buds. There was an increase of cytokinin activity in the buds during flower bud differentiation. In dormant buds, the endogenous cytokinin content was low, and the buds {{did not respond to}} exogenous cytokinin application. Application of kinetin promotes flower bud differentiation significantly after bud dormancy. These results are interpreted as an indication that the increase in endogenous cytokinin levels during flower bud differentiation may be correlative rather than the cause of flower bud initiation...|$|E

30|$|The first {{plantation}} in {{this study}} is located in the lowland plain in Rende District, Tainan (TN; 22 ° 56 ′N, 120 ° 16 ′E). This plantation was originally an orchard but had been abandoned for more than 15  years. It is now used as a representative plantation for predicting potential growth in current cropland afforestation areas because no such old plantation exists in Taiwan (Lin et al. 2011; Cheng et al. 2016 a). Two stands, TN 1 and TN 2, were evaluated. TN 1 is an abandoned <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis) plantation with a stand age of 33  years. TN 2 is an abandoned wax apple (Eugenia javanica) plantation with a stand age of 25  years. Because of the long-term abandonment, understory vegetation such as Macaranga tanarius, Murraya paniculata, Celtis sinensis, Panicum maximum, and Alpinia speciose grows rigorously at both stands.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis Sonn.) is a non {{climacteric}} subtropical fruit {{indigenous to}} Southern China. Once harvested the brilliant red pericarp colour deteriorates rapidly, with the pericarp appearing brown within 24 to 48 hours after harvest. Although browning can be effectively controlled commercially, {{little is known}} of the browning mechanism involved. Browning in lychee is considered to occur through polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase degradation of the anthocyanin pigments. Although the proposed role of polyphenol oxidase activity in lychee browning is widely accepted, little direct evidence exists to confirm this. Current work on lychee postharvest browning under ambient storage condition questions the importance of enzyme mediated pigment degradation. Polyphenol oxidase activity was shown to decrease after harvest, with little change in total anthocyanin content of the pericarp. Results from in vivo work have highlighted the importance of vacuolar pH {{and its effect on}} pigment structure and stability. By lowering the pericarp pH in vivo it is possible to reverse already established pericarp browning...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{plantlet}} regeneration in {{the main}} commercial variety of <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis Sonn. cv Tai So) in Mauritius was achieved from callus cultures derived from young, tender leaf explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. Callogenesis was obtained in all media supplemented with auxin, but was most prominent in media supplemented with 2, 4 – D (1. 5 mgL- 1) with or without benzylamino purine and kinetin. Nodular compact callus obtained in the 2, 4 – D and BAP treatment proliferated and differentiated into shoots. When transferred to MS medium supplemented with BAP (2. 0 mgL- 1) and IAA (3. 0 mgL- 1). Regenerated shoots produced prominent roots when transferred to MS medium supplemented with IBA (2. 0 mgL- 1). Regeneration was predominantly through organogenesis.

40|$|The Author(s) 2009. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Ackee (Blighia sapida, Sapindaceae) is a multi-purpose fruit tree species of high economic importance, {{native to the}} Guinean forests of West Africa, and belongs to the same family as that of <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis). In this study, a set of 12 primer pairs for simple sequence repeats (SSRs) previously developed for lychee has been evaluated for polymorphism in 16 ackee trees from different populations. Seven primer pairs {{have been found to}} be transferable, and four have revealed polymorphisms. How-ever, the average number of alleles per locus has dropped from 4. 9 for lychee to 3. 7 for ackee. Characterization of the four polymorphic markers in 279 individuals belonging to 14 different ackee populations from Benin has revealed that the numbers of alleles per locus range from two to 14 with a mean number of 5. 8. The observed and expected heterozygosities range between 0. 020 to 0. 359 and 0. 020 to 0. 396, respectively...|$|E
40|$|After {{harvest of}} <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis Sonn.) {{pericarp}} browning occurs rapidly, this causes the fruit to submit short postharvest life. This study evaluated {{the effect of}} different concentrations of chitosan in delaying the browning of the pericarp and in maintaining the postharvest quality of lychees. Fruits of litchi ‘Bengal’ uniformly red pericarp were immersed for one minute in solution with different concentrations of chitosan (0 g. L- 1, 5 g. L- 1, 10 g. L- 1, 15 g. L- 1 and 20 g. L- 1). After drying the environment, the fruits were packed in polystyrene trays, covered with plastic wrap for 12 mm thick and stored at 19. 0 ± 2. 4 °C and 75 ± 5 % RH. Every two days, during eight days, the fruits were evaluated for weight loss, color of the pericarp, soluble solids and titratable acidity and vitamin C from the pulp of the pericarp and pulp. The weight loss increased linearly {{during the period of}} storage, independent of the concentration predominantly of chitosan. The concentrations of 5 and 10 g. L- 1 were the most effective in keeping the color of the pericarp for up to four days, without compromising other characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} and extension of <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis Sonn., Sapindaceae) monocultures in Thai upland watersheds {{has resulted in}} a landscape matrix with low complexity and high fragmentation of natural ecosystems. Lychee cultivation is characterised by high pesticide input, resulting in contami-nated water resources and agro-ecological communities of low diversity and limited attractiveness for beneficial organisms. Thus {{there is a need for}} alternative pest management and ecosystem preservation measures that can be integrated into the production system. This requires knowledge of the dynamic and complex interactions between pests, beneficial insects and vegetation on the field and landscape scales. Ground cover vegetation occupies a key position in the agro-ecosystem in relation to various ecological functions and services. This study analysed and classified the plant species found in the ground cover vegetation of 49 lychee orchards and ten other land-use types in the vicinity of two Hmong villages with different traditions of land use and management. On a landscape scale the team also examined the influence of functional landscape coherence on the constitution of two pest insect populations and on beneficial parasitic wasps, by recording their movements patterns in the lychee orchard and adjacent woodland. On the field scale, the studies were concentrated on the improvement of habitat condition...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis Sonn.) {{has a high}} {{commercial}} value; however, it has a short shelf-life {{because of}} its rapid pericarp browning. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the shelf-life of 'Bengal' lychee fruits stored after treatment with hydrochloric acid and citric acid, associated with cassava starch and plastic packaging. Uniformly red pericarp fruits were submitted to treatments: 1 -(immersion in citric acid 100 mM for 5 minutes + cassava starch 30 g L- 1 for 5 minutes), 2 -(immersion in hydrochloric acid 1 M for 2 minutes + starch cassava 30 g L- 1 for 5 minutes), 3 -(immersion in citric acid 100 mM for 5 minutes + polyvinyl chloride film (PVC, 14 µm thick)) and 4 -(immersion in hydrochloric acid 1 M for 2 minutes + PVC film). During 20 days, the fruits were evaluated for mass loss, pericarp color, pH, soluble solids and titratable acidity, vitamin C of the pulp and pericarp and activities of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase of the pericarp. The treatment with hydrochloric acid associated with PVC was the most effective in maintaining the red color of the pericarp for a period of 20 days and best preservation of the fruit. The cassava starch associated with citric acid, and hydrochloric acid did not reduce the mass loss and did not prevent the browning of lychee fruit pericarp...|$|E
40|$|Eight-year-old <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis Sonn.) trees, cv. ‘Bengal, ’ {{growing in}} {{krasnozem}} soil {{were subjected to}} soil water deficit from one month before flowering until harvest by covering the ground with polyethylene sheeting and withholding irrigation. The ratio of daytime stomatal conductance of un-irrigated to irrigated trees decreased 20 % during the three months of increasing water deficit. Predawn leaf water potentials of irrigated trees averaged about- 0. 3 MPa throughout the period, whereas they declined progressively to- 0. 9 MPa in unirrigated trees. Minimum daytime leaf water potential in the unirrigated trees decreased from- 1. 0 to- 1. 1 MPa {{at the beginning of}} the drought period to- 2. 2 to- 2. 4 MPa after three months, and calculated whole-plant conductance did not change with decreasing availability of water. The calculated soil-root water potential declined to less than- 1. 0 MPa in unirrigated trees. Capacitance effects on the relationship between leaf water potential and transpiration were significant only at low transpiration rates. Although unirrigated trees reduced soil water content at O- 30 cm depths to an equivalent water potential of- 1. 0 MPa, fruit shedding was significantly less than in irrigated trees. Water deficit had no effect on the fresh weight of pericarp, but caused increased seed size and decreased fresh weight of flesh, resulting in fruit from uninigated trees being 16 % lower in total fresh weight per fruit than fruit from irrigated trees...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of season and different substrates on rooting of air layers of <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensisSonn.) for the production of seedlings to ensure the formation of uniform and productive orchards. Air layers were done in plants of the Bengal cultivar using leafy and healthy woody branches, with about 0. 010 to 0. 015 m in diameter, in which were performed complete girdling with 0. 020 m wide at a distance of 0. 30 to 0. 40 m below the apex. Then the branches were wrapped in moistened substrate. The layering was made at six times of theyear (January, March, May, July, September and November) and two substrates were used (coconut fiber and sphagnum) in a 6 x 2 factorial design in a randomized block with ten replicates. After 90 days, layers were separated from the matrix plant and evaluated for rooting and callus formation, root number, considering only the primary roots, length, area and volume of the roots, beyond the dry weight of roots and calluses. The months of January, March, September and November showed the best results for all analyzed variables related to rooting. With respect to the substrates, the only difference was in January and March to the root number and dry weight of roots, where the sphagnum showed the best results. The month of July was more conducive to the formation of calluses. The period between September and March was more suitable to the propagation of lychee, when there were rooting percentages above 90 %, in addition to the formation of large amount of roots...|$|E
40|$|In Dade County, Florida, the {{production}} of tropical fruit is {{a major component of}} the agricultural industry with total sales amounting to $ 73. 5 million in the 1997 - 1998 season. Two types of fruit in particular, <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis) and longan (Euphoria longana), are rapidly emerging in economic importance with a combined annual value of over $ 19 million. For many lychee and longan growers, bird damage is perceived to be a significant constraint to production, yet there is no published information on the extent of damage caused by birds. In 1999, we initiated research to identify the bird species responsible for longan damage, quantify the extent of bird damage, and estimate monetary losses. Estimates of fruit loss in 3 longan orchards ranged from 4 % to 64 % which resulted in losses of $ 536 to $ 18, 182 per hectare. Common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula) were the most prevalent pest birds, but monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) were equally if not more destructive, resulting in 30 times more damage at the orchard where they were present. In 2000, we expanded the study to include lychee. Estimates of bird damage to longan ranged from 1 % to 28 % ($ 259 /ha to $ 17, 623 /ha) with the greatest damage occurring in the orchard subject to grackle and monk parakeet depredation. Bird damage to lychee was substantial (11 %, $ 477 /ha) in only lof 4 the groves studied. Monk parakeets were not observed to feed on lychee. We conclude that damage to longan and lychee by grackles is common but usually not great. In longan orchards frequented by monk parakeets, however, damage increases dramatically. Long-term bird management strategies should include exclusion with netting in high-damage areas as well as consideration of reduction in monk parakeet populations...|$|E
40|$|The <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis) is a fruit, {{native to}} south China, where its {{beginnings}} as a cultivated crop are lost in antiquity. To {{the people of}} south China, {{as well as to}} many persons of other lands into which it has been introduced and cultivated successfully, there is no fruit in the world more delicious. It is {{one of a number of}} delicious tropical and subtropical fruits with which the American public is only now beginning to become acquainted. Many persons throughout the united States have eaten "Chinese lychee nuts", which formerly were imported into this country from China in large quantities. The "lychee nut" is the dried form, having about the same relation to the fresh fruit as a raisin does to a grape. In recent years, many persons, in many parts of the country, have had the opportunity to sample fresh fruit produced in Florida. The lychee was introduced into the United States and established successfully in Florida about 1870. Trees were reported to be bearing in that State in 1883. Up to 15 years ago, however, the lychee was still grown very little in Florida, and then, only as a home garden tree. Today, it is being set out in commercial orchards, with possibly as many as 500 acres already planted. In 1952, the Florida Lychee Growers Association was founded by a group of forehanded individuals who saw the need for an organization to disseminate information on lychee culture and to assist in marketing the fruit. The Association's marketing report for 1955 shows 25, 649 pounds of fruit handled that year, and notes that the 1956 crop could reach 100, 000 pounds. It is interesting to note that 4, 000 - pounds, or roughly, one-sixth of the 1955 crop, were shipped into California an...|$|E
40|$|Soapberry bugs are {{worldwide}} seed predators {{of plants}} in the family Sapindaceae. Australian sapinds are diverse and widespread, consisting of about 200 native trees and shrubs. This flora also includes two introduced environmental weeds, plus cultivated <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis Sonn.), longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) and rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum L.). Accordingly, Australian soapberry bugs may be significant in ecology, conservation and agriculture. Here we provide the first account of their ecology. We find five species of Leptocoris Hahn in Australia, and list sapinds that do and do not serve as reproductive hosts. From museum and field records we map the continental distributions of the insects and primary hosts. Frequency of occupation varies among host species, {{and the number of}} hosts varies among the insects. In addition, differences in body size and beak length are related to host use. For example, the long-beaked Leptocoris tagalicus Burmeister is highly polyphagous in eastern rainforests, where it occurs on at least 10 native and non-native hosts. It aggregates on hosts with immature fruit and commences feeding before fruits dehisce. Most of its continental range, however, matches that of a single dryland tree, Atalaya hemiglauca F. Muell., which has comparatively unprotected seeds. The taxon includes a smaller and shorter-beaked form that is closely associated with Atalaya, and appears to be taxonomically distinct. The other widespread soapberry bug is the endemic Leptocoris mitellatus Bergroth. It too is short-beaked, and colonises hosts phenologically later than L. tagalicus, as seeds become more accessible in open capsules. Continentally its distribution is more southerly and corresponds mainly to that of Alectryon oleifolius Desf. Among all host species, the non-native environmental weeds Cardiospermum L. and Koelreuteria Laxm. are most consistently attacked, principally by L. tagalicus. These recent host shifts have biocontrol implications. In contrast, the sapinds planted as fruit crops appear to be less frequently used at present and mainly by the longer-beaked species...|$|E
40|$|Estudou-se os efeitos de auxilias exógenas e ácido bórico, no enraizamento de estacas de lichia (Litchi chinensis Sonn.). As estacas foram uniformizadas, com 25 cm de comprimento e 4 folhas cortadas pela metade. Cerca de 2, 5 cm da base das mesmas foi mergulhado nos tratamentos: H 2 O; Boro 150 µg/ml; IBA 5. 000 ppm, IBA 2. 000 ppm; IBA 5. 000 ppm + Boro 150 µg/ml; IBA 2. 000 ppm + Boro 150 µg/ml; NAA 3. 000 ppm; NAA 1. 500 ppm; NAA 3. 000 ppm + Boro 150 µg/ml; NAA 1. 500 ppm + Boro 150 µ/g/ml. A estaquia foi realizada no mês de setembro (Hemisfério sul), sendo que as estacas foram colocadas em bandejas de isopor, tendo como substrato vermiculita e mantidas sob nebulização intermitente. Os resultados obtidos permitiram concluir que o IBA 5. 000 ppm por 1 minuto foi o tratamento mais efetivo, proporcionando 83, 33 % de estacas enraizadas em 120 dias, enquanto o tratamento testemunha (H 2 O), apresentou somente 16, 67 % de estacas enraizadas.

40|$|Summary Effects of {{photosynthetic}} {{photon flux}} density (PPFD) on leaf gas exchange of <b>lychee</b> (<b>Litchi</b> chinensis Sonn.) were studied in field-grown “Kwai May Pink ” and “Salathiel” orchard trees and young potted “Kwai May Pink ” plants during summer in subtropical Queensland (27 ° S). Variations in PPFD were achieved by shading the trees or plants 1 h before measurement at 0800 h. In a second experiment, potted seed-lings of “Kwai May Pink ” were grown in a heated greenhouse in 20 % of full sun (equivalent to maximum noon PPFD of 200 µmol m– 2 s– 1) and their growth over three flush cycles was compared with seedlings grown in full sun (1080 µmol m– 2 s– 1). Young potted plants of “Kwai May Pink ” were also grown outdoors in artificial shade that provided 20, 40, 70 or 100 % of full sun (equivalent to maximum PPFDs of 500, 900, 1400 and 2000 µmol m– 2 s– 1) and measured for shoot extension and leaf area development over one flush cycle. Net CO 2 assimilation increased asymptotically in response to increasing PPFD in both orchard trees and young potted plants. Maximum rates of CO 2 assimilation (11. 9 ± 0. 5 versus 6. 3 ± 0. 2 µmol CO 2 m– 2 s– 1), dark respiration (1. 7 ± 0. 3 versus 0. 6 ± 0. 2 µmol CO 2 m– 2 s– 1), quantum yield (0. 042 ± 0. 005 versus 0. 027 ± 0. 003 mol CO 2 mol– 1) and light satura-tion point (1155 versus 959 µmol m– 2 s– 1) were higher in or-chard trees than in young potted plants. In potted seedlings grown in a heated greenhouse, shoots and leaves exposed to full sun expanded in a sigmoidal pattern to 69 ± 12 mm and 497 ± 105 cm 2 for each flush, compared with 27 ± 7 mm and 189 ± 88 cm 2 in shaded seedlings. Shaded seedlings were smaller and had higher shoot:root ratios (3. 7 versus 3. 1) than seedlings grown in full sun. In the potted plants grown out-doors in 20, 40, 70 or 100 % of full sun, final leaf area per shoot was 44 ± 1, 143 ± 3, 251 ± 7 and 362 ± 8 cm 2, respectively. Shoots were also shorter in plants grown in shade than in plants grown in full sun (66 ± 5 mm versus 101 ± 2 mm). Photosynthesis in individual leaves of lychee appeared to be saturated at about half full sun, whereas maximum leaf expan-sion occurred at higher PPFDs.
