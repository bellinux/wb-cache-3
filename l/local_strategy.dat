25|$|In {{the media}} and popular science, quantum non-locality is often portrayed as being {{equivalent}} to entanglement. While {{it is true that}} a pure bipartite quantum state must be entangled in order for it to produce non-local correlations, there exist entangled states that do not produce such correlations, and there exist non-entangled (separable) quantum states that present some non-local behaviour. A well-known example of the first case is the Werner state that is entangled for certain values of , but can always be described using local hidden variables. In short, entanglement of a two-party state is necessary but not sufficient for that state to be non-local. Moreover, it was shown that, for arbitrary number of party, there exist states that are genuinely entangled but admits a fully <b>local</b> <b>strategy.</b> It {{is important to recognize that}} entanglement is more commonly viewed as an algebraic concept, noted for being a precedent to non-locality as well as to quantum teleportation and to superdense coding, whereas non-locality is defined according to experimental statistics and is much more involved with the foundations and interpretations of quantum mechanics.|$|E

40|$|Nonlocality without {{entanglement}} is {{a rather}} counterintuitive phenomenon in which information may be encoded entirely in product (unentangled) states of composite quantum systems {{in such a way}} that local measurement of the subsystems is not enough for optimal decoding. For simple examples of pure product states, the gap in performance is known to be rather small when arbitrary <b>local</b> <b>strategies</b> are allowed. Here we restrict to <b>local</b> <b>strategies</b> readily achievable with current technology: those requiring neither a quantum memory nor joint operations. We show that even for measurements on pure product states, there can be a large gap between such strategies and theoretically optimal performance.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} strategy (abbr. the E-strategy) initiated by OBJ 2 {{is one of}} compromises between outermost and innermost reduction strategies. Although rewriting with the E-strategy is intuitively easy-to-understand, the straightforward implementation cannot lead to efficient rewriting. Then, the implementations of OBJ 3 and CafeOBJ use evaluated flags to implement reasonably rewriting with the E-strategy. However, rewriting with evaluated flags is not always equivalent to that without evaluated flags, which depends on <b>local</b> <b>strategies</b> given to function symbols. So far {{we did not have}} any useful guidelines on how to give <b>local</b> <b>strategies</b> to function symbols. In this paper, we present a sufficient but reasonable condition (i. e. how to give <b>local</b> <b>strategies</b> to function symbols) that two implementations of the E-strategy with and without evaluated flags are equivalent, and give its proof. 1.

Due to the none-determined and polynomial characteristics, these problems usually face to unreasonable searching budget. Hence combinatorial optimizations attracted numerous researchers to develop better algorithms. In recent academic researches, most focus on developing to enhance the conventional evolutional algorithms and facilitate the local heuristics, such as VNS, 2 -opt and 3 -opt. Despite the performances of {{the introduction of the}} <b>local</b> <b>strategies</b> are significant, however, these improvement cannot improve the performance for solving the different problems. Therefore, this research proposes a meta-heuristic evolutional algorithm which can be applied to solve several types of problems.
