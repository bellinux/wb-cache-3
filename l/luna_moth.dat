Thayer obtained a patent in 1902 to paint warships, both submarines and surface ships, using countershading, but failed to convince the US Navy to adopt his ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{reverse of}} countershading, with the belly {{pigmented}} {{darker than the}} back, enhances contrast and so makes animals more conspicuous. It is found in animals that can defend themselves, such as skunks. The pattern is used both in startle or deimatic displays and as a signal to warn off experienced predators. However, animals that habitually live upside-down but lack strong defences, like the Nile catfish and the <b>luna</b> <b>moth</b> caterpillar, have upside-down countershading for camouflage.|$|E
500|$|The {{caterpillar}} of the <b>Luna</b> <b>moth,</b> as {{discovered by}} Thayer, is in Cott's phrase [...] "countershaded {{in relation to}} [...] attitude", i.e. shaded with a light back grading to a dark belly, as also is the Nile catfish, Synodontis batensoda for the same reason: these animals (and other caterpillars including Automeris io and the eyed hawkmoth, Smerinthus ocellatus) habitually live 'upside down' with the belly uppermost. Similarly in the sea slug Glaucus atlanticus, the reverse countershading is associated with inverted habits. These animals are thus employing countershading in the usual way for camouflage.|$|E

2500|$|Some saturniids are {{strictly}} univoltine, producing only one generation a year, whereas others are multivoltine, producing {{more than one}} brood a year. Spring and summer broods hatch {{in a matter of}} weeks; autumn broods enter a state known as diapause and emerge the following spring. How the pupae know when to hatch early or hibernate is not yet fully understood, though research suggests day length during the larval fifth instar plays a major role, as well as cooling temperatures. Longer days may prompt pupae to develop early, while shorter days result in pupal diapause. The number of broods is flexible, and a single female may produce both fast-developing and slow-developing individuals, or they may produce different numbers of broods in different years or parts of the range. In some species [...] e.g. the <b>luna</b> <b>moth</b> (Actias luna) or Callosamia securifera (both [...] Saturniinae) , spring and summer broods look different, with different genes activated by environmental conditions.|$|E

40|$|Adaptations {{to divert}} the attacks of {{visually}} guided predators have evolved repeatedly in animals. Using high-speed infrared videography, we show that <b>luna</b> <b>moths</b> (Actias <b>luna)</b> generate an acoustic diversion with spinning hindwing tails to deflect echolocating bat attacks away from their body and toward these nonessential appendages. We pit <b>luna</b> <b>moths</b> against big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and demonstrate a survival advantage of ∼ 47 % for moths with tails versus those that had their tails removed. The benefit of hindwing tails {{is equivalent to the}} advantage conferred to moths by bat-detecting ears. Moth tails lured bat attacks to these wing regions during 55 % of interactions between bats and intact <b>luna</b> <b>moths.</b> We analyzed flight kinematics of moths with and without hindwing tails and suggest that tails have a minimal role in flight performance. Using a robust phylogeny, we find that long spatulate tails have independently evolved four times in saturniid moths, further supporting the selective advantage of this anti-bat strategy. Diversionary tactics are perhaps more common than appreciated in predator–prey interactions. Our finding suggests that focusing on the sensory ecologies of key predators will reveal such countermeasures in prey...|$|R

50|$|Based on {{the climate}} in which they live, the <b>luna</b> <b>moths</b> produce differing numbers of generations. In Canada and {{northern}} regions, they can live up to 7 days and will produce only one generation per year. These reach adulthood from early June to early July. In the northeastern United States around New Jersey or New York, the moths produce two generations each year. The first of these appear in April and May, and the second group can be seen approximately nine to eleven weeks later. In the southern United States, there can {{be as many as}} three generations.

His work, Metamorphosis, involving 20' tall pupating <b>luna</b> <b>moths,</b> officially opened the 2000 Henson International Festival of Puppet Theatre. In 2002, he and Michahelles initiated a midsummer pageant project in the Italian Alps village of Morinesio, drawing on local folklore and oral history to create a unique site-specific pageant. Inspired {{by the success of}} the now-annual tradition, they have seeded similar projects in diverse locales in Ukraine, Turkey, Italy, Texas, New York, and elsewhere. In 2006, Kahn was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to Trinidad and Tobago, to study the artistic and cultural structures behind Caribbean Carnival and Trinidadian [...] "Mas'", or costumed procession. More recent PAW works have included major commissions for Socrates Sculpture Park the NY Architectural League's Beaux Arts Ball, the PEN World Voices Festival, Houston's Buffalo Bayou Park, the Grand Opening of the High Line over Penn Rail Yards.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1960 he was {{sponsored}} by the American Institute of Biological Sciences on a lecture tour of the US to explicate his experiments. Later that year the US National Academy of Sciences sponsored him on a lecture tour of India. While in India in January 1961, Botting was befriended by J. B. S. Haldane, who decades earlier had applied statistical research to the natural selection of moths. In the 1960s, Haldane's wife, Helen Spurway, was also researching the genetics of giant silk moths of the Antheraea genus. Helen Spurway, J.B.S. and Krishna Dronamraju were present at the Oberoi Grand Hotel in Kolkata when 1960 US National Science Fair winner in botany Susan Brown reminded the Haldanes that she and Botting had a previously scheduled event that would prevent them from accepting an invitation to a banquet proposed by J.B.S. and Helen in their honour and scheduled for that evening. After the two students had left the hotel, Haldane went on his much-publicized hunger strike to protest what he regarded as a “U.S. insult." [...] Botting received the US National Pest Control Award when he demonstrated that his experiments had practical applications beyond producing finer silk. In 1964 he experimented with feeding caterpillars juvenile hormones and vitamin B12 to keep <b>Luna</b> <b>moths</b> (Actias <b>luna)</b> and Cecropia <b>moths</b> (Hyalophora cecropia) in the larval stage an instar longer than normal, resulting in larger cocoons and larger adult moths.|$|R

5000|$|Shawn Brommer in {{his review}} for School Library Journal said [...] "Fletcher's poetic prose makes use of gentle tempo and {{internal}} rhyme. Imaginative metaphors add to the text; as the moon sets, it sprinkles [...] "silver coins like a careless millionaire." [...] Careful use of second-person narrative draws readers into the text. Kiesler's luminous oil paintings portray the luscious moon glow, and a refrained use of brush stroke captures the mystery of nighttime when the familiar world becomes exotic, dazzling, and alive with nocturnal life. Warm hues evoke homey, autumn scenes." [...] Terry Day in her review for Library Media Connection {{described it as a}} beautifully written and illustrated book. [...] Publishers Weekly in their review said that [...] "Fletcher's lyrical, child-friendly images will linger in readers' minds. With a gentle nod to Margaret Wise Brown, the child's morning is the moon's setting Ca sleepy head winking/ falling/slow motion/ onto its pillow"), and the book ends appropriately with the girl bidding, [...] "Good night, harvest moon."" [...] Kirkus Reviews said [...] "Fletcher tracks that moon's nocturnal path in language rich in metaphor: [...] "With silent slippers / it climbs the night stairs," [...] "staining earth and sky with a ghostly glow," [...] lighting up a child's bedroom, the wings of a small plane, moonflowers, and, ranging further afield, harbor waves and the shells of turtle hatchlings on a beach. Using creamy brushwork and subtly muted colors, Kiesler depicts each landscape, each night creature from <b>Luna</b> <b>moths</b> to a sleepless child and her cat, as well as the great moon sweeping across star-flecked skies, from varied but never vertiginous angles." ...|$|R

The caterpillar will also have an underlying golden reddish‐brown color and become less active. As a pupa, this species is particularly active. When disturbed, if it feels threatened the moth will wiggle within its pupal case, producing a noise. Pupation takes approximately two weeks unless the individual is diapausing. The mechanisms for diapause are generally a mixture of genetic triggers, duration of sunlight or direct light during the day, and temperature.|$|E
