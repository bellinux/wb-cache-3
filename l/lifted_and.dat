5|$|Then Eärendil the Mariner, a half-elf {{from the}} House of Finwë, sailed to Valinor {{to ask the}} Valar for help. Then the Ban of the Noldor was <b>lifted,</b> <b>and</b> the Valar started the War of Wrath, in which Morgoth was finally overcome.|$|E
5|$|Approaches to {{the exits}} were also cleared, with minefields <b>lifted</b> <b>and</b> holes blown in the {{embankment}} {{to permit the}} passage of vehicles.

5|$|At 21:00 {{the first}} shells of what {{proved to be}} a two-hour North Korean {{artillery}} and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon. As the barrage rolled on, North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire. At 23:00 the barrage <b>lifted</b> <b>and</b> the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon, forcing it from the hill after a short fight. Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line.|$|E

5|$|Despite the police-backed intervention, the {{university}} continued on strike. The appointed institute heads failed {{to break the}} stalemate between internal and external forces, and by early 1982, discussions begun on a new list of candidates to the rectorship. Eventually, José Aristodemo Pinotti, a former dean of the School of Medical Sciences generally considered a moderate, was selected by the academic community and accepted by the governor. In the following week, on April 19, 1982, the intervention was <b>lifted,</b> <b>and</b> academic activities resumed normally.|$|E
5|$|If the {{quantity}} of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5×108 kg of water vapor are <b>lifted,</b> <b>and</b> {{the amount of energy}} released when this condenses is 1015 joules. This is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone, and more energy than that released during the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Iran {{temporarily}} blocked access on December 3, 2006, to YouTube {{and several}} other sites, after declaring them as violating social and moral codes of conduct. The YouTube block came after a video was posted online that appeared to show an Iranian soap opera star having sex. The block was later <b>lifted</b> <b>and</b> then reinstated after Iran's 2009 presidential election. In 2012, Iran reblocked access, along with access to Google, after the controversial film Innocence of Muslims trailer was released on YouTube.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of this design is that adjustment of <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> duration is continuous. However, in these systems, lift is proportional to duration, so <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> duration cannot be separately adjusted.|$|R

5|$|Many adult insects use six {{legs for}} walking and {{have adopted a}} tripedal gait. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied {{extensively}} in cockroaches and ants. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and {{the front and rear}} left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are <b>lifted</b> <b>and</b> moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be <b>lifted</b> <b>and</b> brought forward in turn and so on. The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, avoiding obstacles, climbing or slippery surfaces, four (tetrapod) or more feet (wave-gait) may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 1983, {{martial law}} was <b>lifted,</b> <b>and</b> amnesty was granted to many imprisoned Solidarity members, who were released.

The Polish government, however, refused to issue him a {{passport}} to travel to Oslo; Wałęsa's prize was accepted on his behalf by his wife. It later transpired that the SB had prepared bogus documents, accusing Wałęsa of immoral and illegal activities that {{had been given to}} the Nobel committee in an attempt to derail his nomination.|$|E

5|$|The wars {{had caused}} {{widespread}} devastation and famine, {{and one of}} the victims of the hunger and disease was Khrushchev's wife, Yefrosinia, who died of typhus in Kalinovka while Khrushchev was in the army. The commissar returned for the funeral and, loyal to his Bolshevik principles, refused to allow his wife's coffin to enter the local church. With the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin <b>lifted</b> <b>and</b> passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village.|$|E
5|$|With {{forest fires}} {{continuing}} to burn in neighboring Indonesia, heavy smog {{was a concern}} for the event. Unhealthy levels forced the cancellation of other events in Singapore in the week leading up to the Grand Prix. Race organisers, however, did not speculate whether the Grand Prix was also under threat of cancellation. It was later reported that the smog had <b>lifted</b> <b>and</b> that the race could go ahead without any restrictions.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war ended}} with the defeat of Japan in 1945, the ban on nonessential {{construction}} was <b>lifted,</b> <b>and</b> the state restarted construction and restoration activities in Constitution Square in 1948. These activities included restoring and re-roofing the buildings, adding furniture to the buildings, constructing walkways, erecting signs, and adding landscaping to the park. The restorations were completed in 1955. From 1960 to 1968, the state added a fence around the site, installed a new lighting and diorama system, constructed {{a replica of the}} square's original pillory, and renovated several buildings, including an early 19th-century brick schoolhouse which became the caretaker's residence.|$|E

5|$|Although closed, {{the line}} was not <b>lifted,</b> <b>and</b> was {{maintained}} as a long siding until 1972, {{on behalf of the}} Central Electricity Generating Board, who paid for its maintenance. This was to facilitate the maintenance of the stators from Keadby Power Station, which were too heavy to be transported over the bridge where the A161 road crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. When required, the heavy haulage company Pickfords would move a stator by road to Ealand depot, to the south of Crowle. It would then be loaded onto the railway, and moved across the canal to Belton, where it would be transferred back to the road vehicle. The A161 road bridge was replaced by Lindsey County Council in 1970, and the complicated manoeuvres became unnecessary. Consequently, the rails were removed in 1972.|$|E
5|$|At 22:30 the fog <b>lifted</b> <b>and</b> Kouma {{saw that}} a North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river {{directly}} in front of his position. Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|Bulbs are {{harvested}} for {{market in the}} summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before the bulbs are <b>lifted,</b> <b>and</b> is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Lincoln, the loyalist campaign stalled and only recommenced in late June when the victors had arranged the ransoming of their prisoners. Meanwhile, support for Louis's campaign was diminishing in France and he concluded {{that the war in}} England was lost. The French prince negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which he would renounce his claim to the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of excommunication would be <b>lifted</b> <b>and</b> Henry's government would promise to enforce the Magna Carta. The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion. In the absence of a settlement, Louis remained in London with his remaining forces.|$|E
