40|$|This study {{aimed to}} test whether {{shredded}} cardboard is an appropriate minimum-dust bedding material for heaves-affected horses. Results of standardized in vitro measurement of airborne dust and aeroallergen concentrations of cardboard bedding were significantly {{lower than those of}} common bedding materials. Six heaves-affected horses in clinical remission after pasturing were stabled for two months on cardboard bedding and fed grass silage. Pulmonary function tests (PFT: ventilatory mechanics, arterial blood gases, airway inflammation scoring, bronchoalveolar cytology) were performed before, during and after this period and after stabling the horses in poor hygienic conditions.

40|$|The spatial {{distributions}} {{of the brightest}} features in the far-UV spectrum of Comet Austin were measured, and {{it is found that}} they are generally similar to those found for Comet Halley during two rocket observations in 1986. As in Halley, the CO profile can be fit to a radial outflow profile for a source whose size is smaller than the instrumental spatial resolution. Neither the shape nor the magnitude of the extended atomic carbon profiles, however, can be satisfactorily explained by the photodissociation of CO. No evidence is found for an extended source of CO in the coma; thus, suggestions that the additional carbon can come directly from grains are difficult to accept since Austin is a <b>low-dust</b> comet. The presence of the O I 1356 A feature implies that there is a photoelectron excitation source in the coma. The measured O I 1304 A distribution is consistent with H 2 O being the dominant source of oxygen in the coma.

The aim {{of the study was to}} identify and measure the concentrations of fungal spores in three different horse stables by sampling both air and surfaces. Samples for each stall were collected from December, 2001 to November, 2002. The fungi recovered from both air and surface samples were Mucoraceae (40 % of samples), Penicillium (66, 3 %) and Aspergillus (67, 8 %). In most cases, more than one fungal species was cultured from each plate. For the fungi belonging to Aspergillus genus, the following species were isolated: Aspergillus niger (42 %), Aspergillus flavus (13 %), Aspergillus fumigatus (7, 3 %), Aspergillus terreus (5, 5 %). The frequency of fungal isolation from air samples showed slight differences when it was compared with the same values, Obtained from surfaces sampling. The prevalence of isolation of filamentous fungi from the surfaces and from the air remained fairly constant for each of the three horse stables included in the study. Airborne fungal concentrations calculated for each stall gave different results. Seasonal variations for air samples were also observed. Our data shows how a good management system, indipendently from the building structure, thought to minimize the risks of incidence of allergic respiratory diseases, should pay attention to the importance of utilizing materials with a <b>low-dust</b> producing potential, in order to produce a low environmental challenge...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of 98 galaxies of <b>low-dust</b> content, selected from the Spitzer Local Volume Legacy survey, aimed at examining {{the relation between the}} ultraviolet (UV) color, beta, and dust attenuation in normal star-forming galaxies. The IRX-beta diagram relates the total dust attenuation in a galaxy, traced by the far-IR (FIR) to UV ratio, to the observed UV color, indicated by beta. Previous research has indicated that while starburst galaxies exhibit a relatively tight IRX-beta relation, normal star-forming galaxies do not, and have a much larger spread in the total-IR to far-UV (FUV) luminosity for a fixed UV color. We examine the role that the age of the stellar population plays as the "second parameter" responsible for the observed deviation and spread of star-forming galaxies from the starburst relation. We model the FUV to FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) of each galaxy according to two broad bins of star formation history (SFH) : constant and instantaneous burst. We find clear trends between stellar population mean age estimators (extinction-corrected FUV/NIR, U-B, and EW(H-alpha)) and the UV color, beta; the trends are mostly driven by the galaxies best-described by instantaneous burst populations. We also find a significant correlation between beta and the mean age directly determined from the best-fit instantaneous models. As already indicated by other authors, the UV attenuation in star-forming galaxies may not be recovered with the UV color alone and is highly influenced by the stellar population's mean age and SFH. Overall, the scatter in the IRX-beta diagram is better correlated with beta than with the perpendicular distance. Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
40|$|Mineral {{aerosols}} {{are important}} atmospheric constituents owing to {{their interactions with}} climate and biogeochemistry. The interannual variability in atmospheric mineral aerosols is evaluated using a model simulation of 1979 – 2000 and mineral aerosol observations. Overall, the variability in monthly means between different years is not {{as large as the}} variability within a month for column amount, surface concentration, and deposition fluxes. The magnitude of the variability predicted in the model varies spatially and appears similar to that seen in the available observations, although the model is not always able to simulate observed high- and <b>low-dust</b> years. The area over which the interannual variability in the observing station data should be representative is estimated in the model simulation and is shown to be regional in extent. However, correlations between modeled surface concentrations at the stations and modeled deposition in the surrounding region is often low, suggesting that the observations of the variability of surface concentrations are difficult to extrapolate to variability in regional deposition fluxes. The correlations between modeled monthly mean optical depth and modeled deposition or mobilization are low to moderate (0. 2 – 0. 6) over much of the globe, indicating the difficulty of estimating mobilization or deposition fluxes from satellite retrievals of optical depth. In both the model and observations there are relationships between climate indices (e. g., North Atlantic Oscillation, El Niño, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and dust, although a 22 -year simulation is not long enough to well characterize this relationship. In this model, simulation of 1979 – 2000, dust concentration variability appears to be dominated by transport variability and/or transport and source covariance rather than source strength variability...|$|R
40|$|Narrow-band imaging surveys {{aimed at}} {{detecting}} the faint emission from the 5007 [O III] line of intracluster planetary nebulae in Virgo also probe high redshift z= 3. 1 Ly alpha emitters. Here {{we report on}} the spectroscopic identification of 9 Ly alpha emitters at z= 3. 13, obtained with the FORS spectrograph at Unit 1 of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT UT 1). The spectra of these high redshift objects show a narrow, isolated Ly alpha emission with very faint (frequently undetected) continuum, indicating a large equivalent width. No other features are visible in our spectra. Our Ly alpha emitters are quite similar to those found by Hu (1998), Cowie & Hu (1998) and Hu et al. (1998). Using simple population synthesis models, on the assumption that these sources are regions of star formation, we conclude that the nebulae are nearly optically thick and must have a very low dust content, in order to explain the high observed Ly alpha equivalent widths. For the cosmological and star formation parameters we adopted, the total stellar mass produced would seem to correspond to the formation of rather small galaxies, some of which are perhaps destined to merge. The implied star formation density in our sampled comoving volume is probably somewhat smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude as the star formation density at z= 3 derived by other authors from Lyman-break galaxy surveys. This result agrees with the expectation that the Ly alpha emitters are a low-metallicity (or <b>low-dust)</b> tail in a distribution of star forming regions at high redshifts. Finally, the Ly alpha emitters may contribute as many H-ionizing photons as QSOs at z= 3. Comment: 26 pages, 17 Postscript figures, ApJ in pres...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work is to advance {{the understanding of the}} structure and dynamics of the middle altitude region of the martian atmosphere. While numerous advancements {{have been made in the}} level of scientific understanding of Mars's upper and lower atmospheres over the past several decades, insight into the mechanisms of the middle atmosphere has come at a significantly slower pace due to the small number of datasets available for this region. Over the past decade this has begun to change, with renewed interest by NASA and ESA to send spacecraft to Mars. The result of these recent efforts is a growing database for Mars's middle atmosphere, enabling long-awaited and necessary studies characterizing the middle altitude region. Various numerical models of the martian atmosphere can now be validated and constrained using this database. We utilize the Mars Express/Spectroscopy for the Investigation of the Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Mars (MEX/SPICAM) density and temperature datasets to characterize the middle atmosphere as well as validate and constrain the coupled multi-dimensional Mars General Circulation Model-Mars Thermosphere General Circulation Model (MGCM-MTGCM) at middle altitudes in order to explore the underlying physics controlling the structure and dynamics at these levels. The results of this study stress the importance of proper dust prescription within the MGCM-MTGCM for accurately reproducing the density and thermal structure of the middle and upper atmosphere regions on Mars. Simulations conducted with horizontal dust opacities that are consistent with the SPICAM observation period (i. e. Mars Odyssey/THEMIS opacities) yield modeled densities and temperatures that are closer to the observed values than simulations conducted with "typical" dust conditions (i. e. Mars Global Surveyor/TES opacities). We show that the MGCM-MTGCM closely reproduces the observed densities during <b>low-dust</b> and high-dust scenarios but displays difficulty during the pre-dust-season "ramp-up" period (Ls not, vert, similar 120 - 200 °) during MY 27. In addition, we show that the MGCM-MTGCM accurately reproduces the temperature profiles below the mesopause, but, the mesopause altitude is too low and its temperature warmer (5 - 10 K) than observations. This may be related to nightside dynamical heating processes that require further refinement. In addition, CO 2 15 -μm cooling rates may be too small, which would be consistent with underestimated atomic O abundances...|$|R
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 2008 NASA and NOAA funded the ARCTAS and ARCPAC field campaigns as {{contributions}} to POLARCAT, a core IPY activity. During the campaigns the NASA DC- 8, P- 3 B and NOAA WP- 3 D aircraft conducted over 150 h of in-situ sampling between 0. 1 and 12 km throughout the Western Arctic north of 55 &deg; N (i. e. Alaska to Greenland). All aircraft were equipped with multiple wavelength measurements of aerosol optics, trace gas and aerosol chemistry measurements, as well as direct measurements of black carbon mass and the aerosol size distribution. Late April of 2008 proved to be exceptional in terms of Asian biomass burning emissions transported to the Western Arctic. Though these smoke plumes account for only 11 – 14 % of the samples within the Western Arctic domain, they account for 43 – 47 % of the total burden of black carbon. Light absorbing carbon from urban/industrial activities and biomass burning together account for 93 – 98 % of total light absorption in the middle troposphere. Light absorption by mineral dust accounts for the remaining absorption in the middle troposphere, but up to 14 % near the surface and in the upper troposphere below the tropopause. Stratifying the data to reduce the influence of dust allows us to determine mass absorption efficiencies for black carbon of 11. 2 &plusmn; 0. 8, 9. 5 &plusmn; 0. 6 and 7. 4 &plusmn; 0. 7 m 2 g− 1 at 470, 530 and 660 nm wavelengths. These estimates are consistent with 35 – 80 % enhancements in 530 nm absorption due to clear or slightly absorbing coatings of pure black carbon particulate. Assuming a 1 /&lambda; wavelength dependence for BC absorption, and assuming that refractory aerosol (420 &deg;C, &tau; = 0. 1 s) in <b>low-dust</b> samples is dominated by brown carbon, we derive mass absorption efficiencies for brown carbon of 0. 83 &plusmn; 0. 15 and 0. 27 &plusmn; 0. 08 m 2 g− 1 at 470 and 530 nm wavelengths. Estimates for the mass absorption efficiencies of Asian Dust are 0. 034 m 2 g− 1 and 0. 017 m 2 g− 1 . However the values are highly uncertain due to the limitations imposed by PSAP instrument noise. In-situ ARCTAS/ARCPAC measurements during the IPY provide valuable constraints for absorbing aerosol over the Western Arctic, species which are currently poorly simulated over a region that is critically under-sampled...|$|R
40|$|Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are {{the current}} standard-bearers for dark energy but face several hurdles for their {{continued}} success in future large surveys. For example, spectroscopic classification {{of the myriad}} SNe soon to be discovered will not be possible, and systematics from uncertainties in dust corrections {{and the evolution of}} SN demographics and/or empirical calibrations used to standardize SNe Ia must be studied. Through the identification of <b>low-dust</b> host galaxies and through increased understanding of both the SN [...] progenitor connections and empirical calibrations, host galaxy information may offer opportunities to improve the cosmological utility of SNe Ia. The first half of this thesis analyzes the sample of SNe Ia discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cluster Supernova Survey augmented with HST-observed SNe Ia in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields. Correlations between properties of SNe and their host galaxies are examined at high redshift. Using galaxy color and quantitative morphology to determine the red sequence in 25 clusters, a model is developed to distinguish passively evolving early-type galaxies from star-forming galaxies in both clusters and the field. With this approach, 6 early-type cluster member hosts and 11 SN Ia early-type field hosts are identified. For the first time at z> 0. 9, the correlation between host galaxy type and the rise and fall time of SN Ia light curves is confirmed. The relatively simple spectral energy distributions of early-type galaxies also enables stellar mass measurements for these hosts. In combination with literature host mass measurements, these measurements are used to show, at z> 0. 9, a hint of the correlation between host mass and Hubble residuals reported at lower redshift. By simultaneously fitting cluster galaxy formation histories and dust content to the scatter of the cluster red sequences, it is shown that dust reddening of early-type cluster SN hosts is likely less than E(B-V) < 0. 06. Hence, the early-type-hosted SNe Ia identified here occupy a more favorable environment to use as well-characterized high-redshift standard candles than other SNe Ia. The second half of this thesis analyzes a sample of 40 deep, very high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of nearby SN Ia host galaxies. These host galaxies are chosen from the Nearby Supernova Factory, the SDSS-II SN Survey, and Swift-observed SNe, with the requirement that they have passive stellar populations suitable for detailed absorption line measurements. From these spectra, ages and the abundances of multiple elements, including Fe, Mg, C, N, and Ca are derived. The correlation between SN decline rate and host galaxy age is rediscovered at high significance. SN decline rate is also shown to be correlated with host [Fe/H], [C/Fe], and [N/Fe]. In contrast to studies of mixed-host samples, however, no evidence is found supporting a correlation with SN Hubble residuals and host galaxy properties. The wide range in age spanned by the sample, in particular, suggests that age is not responsible for the host-mass [...] Hubble residual relation reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|A main {{characteristic}} of {{chronic respiratory disease}} is the long-lasting and recurring inflammatory process in the small airways – resulting in fibrosis of the alveolar tissue and thus an irreversible loss of respiratory capacity. In various human respiratory diseases like bronchial asthma a pro-coagulatory and antifibrinolytic environment {{has been shown to}} cause progressive fibrosis. Observations from veterinary medicine hint at a comparable misbalance of the hemostasis in chronic airway diseases of the horse. The goal of this prospective clinical study including a healthy control group was to measure the fibrinolytic activity in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of horses with chronic pulmonary disease and evaluate a possible pathogenetic association. Fibrinogen, D-dimers, plasminogen-activator-inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) and urokinase (u-PA) were to be examined in this study. Unfortunately, all tested assays for PAI- 1 and u-PA showed unreliable and inconsistent results. In addition to the hemostatic parameters, serum-amyloid-A in the BALF was determined as an acute-phase protein. Furthermore, all parameters were examined regarding changes to an inhalative therapy with glucocorticoids and <b>low-dust</b> environment. In this clinical trial 61 horses were presented to the Equine clinic for surgery and radiology of the Freie Universität Berlin under stationary conditions and underwent a three day preparticipation examination including general and specific clinical examinations, venous and arterial blood gas analyses, exercise tests, interpleural pressure measurements, radiography of the thorax, endoscopic and cytologic examinations of BALF. The subjects were classified as “healthy controls“ (group 1, n= 15), “COB in exacerbation“ (group 2, n= 18), “IAD/COB in remission“ (group 3, n= 14), “interstitial pneumopathy“ (group 4, n= 11) and “acute/subacute pneumonia“ (group 5, n= 3). Eight patients from group 2 and four patients from group 3 received a ten day inhalation therapy with the glucocorticoid budesonide (3 μg/kg BDW, bid) and were housed in a lowdust environment. A control examination largely identical to the preparticipation examination followed. Further laboratory analyses were conducted with the supernatant of the centrifuged BALF. Fibrinogen and D-dimers were determined on a fully-automatic analyzer using the immunoturbidimetric method. SAA was measured by the ELISA method. This quantitative analysis procedure was also intended to be applied for the examination of PAI- 1 and u-PA, however, this turned out to not be technically feasible. The median of fibrinogen in patients with lung diseases was considerably higher than the one in healthy horses. Moreover, the healthy control group showed a significantly (p=. 03) lower detectability of about 60 %, compared to group 2 (“COB in exacerbation”), where fibrinogen concentrations could be measured in 94 % of the cases. Thus, cases with a fibrinogen level above the determination limit of 0. 001 g/l were eleven times more likely of being diagnosed “COB in exacerbation” than being classified as “healthy” (Exp(B) = 11. 33). Furthermore, there was a weak positive correlation (rs=. 377; p=. 004) between the fibrinogen content and the percentage of neutrophils in the BALF. D-dimers could be detected exclusively in patients with the diagnosis “COB in exacerbation” and “acute/subacute pneumonia”. The majority of these results could be obtained only subsequent to a protein enrichment procedure. There was a positive correlation (rs=. 511; p=. 03) between the amount of D-dimers and the average respiratory rate. SAA could not be detected in more than two thirds of the samples (67. 2 %), while the median was 0. 05 μg/ml for both controls and affected horses. The therapeutic intervention resulted in a partial decrease of specifically the fibrinogen levels, but also the D-Dimer levels in the BALF. However, these differences could not be classified as significant. Due to a lack of appropriate testing methods to determine specific parameters of fibrinolysis, the aims of the presented study could only be reached in part. However, the observations reveal new insights for basic research in chronic respiratory diseases of the horse. The results allow the assumption that a misbalance in hemostasis accompanied by increased fibrin turnover {{plays a key role in}} the pathomechanism of equine pulmonary disease. Particularly with regard to irreversible alterations of lung tissue and persistent pulmonary function impairment, this research approach should be further pursued to reveal possible changes in fibrinolytic activity...|$|R
