2500|$|<b>Love</b> of God and <b>Love</b> of Neighbor. Two main {{questions}} arise from {{reflecting on the}} nature of <b>love</b> and its meaning in biblical faith: is it possible to <b>love</b> God without seeing him, and is it possible for <b>love</b> to be commanded? Before answering the question, it is quickly grounded that one must <b>love</b> their neighbor before they can <b>love</b> God, otherwise they are hypocritical. 1 Jn 4:20 says [...] "If anyone says, 'I <b>love</b> God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not <b>love</b> his brother whom he has seen, cannot <b>love</b> God whom he has not seen". We can, therefore, <b>love</b> God whom we cannot see by <b>loving</b> our neighbor whom we can see. <b>Loving</b> our neighbor is <b>loving</b> God. In the same manner it shows that <b>love</b> can be and is demanded of us. God demands that we <b>love</b> others before we <b>love</b> God so that our <b>love</b> is blameless and pure and not hypocritical.|$|R
