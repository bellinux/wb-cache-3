40|$|Adenovirus (AdV) {{morphogenesis}} is {{a complex}} process, many aspects of which remain unclear. In particular, it is not settled where in the nucleus assembly and packaging occur, and whether these processes occur in a sequential or a concerted manner. Here we use immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy (immunoEM) to trace packaging factors and structural proteins at <b>late</b> <b>times</b> <b>post</b> infection by either wildtype virus or a delayed packaging mutant. We show that representatives of all assembly factors {{are present in the}} previously recognized peripheral replicative zone, which therefore is the AdV assembly factory. Assembly intermediates and abortive products observed in this region favor a concurrent assembly and packaging model comprising two pathways, one for capsid proteins and another one for core components. Only when both pathways are coupled by correct interaction between packaging proteins and the genome is the viral particle produced. Decoupling generates accumulation of empty capsids and unpackaged cores...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAutographa californica {{multiple}} nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) ac 146 is {{a highly}} conserved gene in the Alpha- and Betabaculovirus genera that has an unknown function. Northern blot analysis and transcript mapping showed that ac 146 is transcribed at <b>late</b> <b>times</b> <b>post</b> infection as a 1. 2 kb mRNA. To determine the role of ac 146 in the baculovirus life cycle ac 146 knock out viruses were constructed. Transfection and plaque assays showed that all the ac 146 deletions produced a single cell phenotype indicating that no infectious budded virus (BV) was produced, however occlusion bodies were formed. The lack of BV production was confirmed by viral titration utilizing both qPCR and TCID 50. Analysis of BV and occlusion derived virus (ODV) revealed that AC 146 is associated with both forms of the virus and is modified specifically in ODV. This study therefore demonstrates that AC 146 is a late virion associated protein and {{is essential for the}} viral life cycle...|$|R

40|$|Several viruses {{manipulate}} the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) {{to initiate a}} productive infection. Determined viral proteins are able to change the host's ubiquitin machinery and some viruses even encode their own ubiquitinating or deubiquitinating enzymes. African swine fever virus (ASFV) encodes a gene homologous to the E 2 ubiquitin conjugating (UBC) enzyme. The viral ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBCv 1) is expressed throughout ASFV infection and accumulates at <b>late</b> <b>times</b> <b>post</b> infection. UBCv is also present in the viral particle suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway could {{play an important role}} at early ASFV infection. We determined that inhibition of the final stage of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway blocked a post-internalization step in ASFV replication in Vero cells. Under proteasome inhibition, ASF viral genome replication, late gene expression and viral production were severely reduced. Also, ASFV enhanced proteasome activity at late times and the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins surrounding viral factories. Core-associated and/or viral proteins involved in DNA replication may be targets for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that could possibly assist virus uncoating at final core breakdown and viral DNA release. At later steps, polyubiquitinated proteins at viral factories could exert regulatory roles in cell signaling...|$|R

Among the herbicide treatments, rice treated with oxadiazon, thiobencarb plus 2, 4 -D, and butachlor plus propanil followed by the <b>late</b> <b>POST</b> herbicides had grain yield increments of 23 - 25, 20 to 26, and 18 to 23 times that of the yield in weedy plots, respectively.

40|$|Swine {{generate}} reassortant influenza viruses {{because they}} can be simultaneously infected with avian and human influenza; however, the features that restrict influenza reassortment in swine and human hosts are not fully understood. Type I and III interferons (IFNs) act as {{the first line of defense}} against influenza virus infection of respiratory epithelium. To determine if human and swine have different capacities to mount an antiviral response the expression of IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and normal swine bronchial epithelial (NSBE) cells was evaluated following infection with human (H 3 N 2), swine (H 1 N 1), and avian (H 5 N 3, H 5 N 2, H 5 N 1) influenza A viruses. Expression of IFNλ and ISGs were substantially higher in NHBE cells compared to NSBE cells following H 5 avian influenza virus infection compared to human or swine influenza virus infection. This effect was associated with reduced H 5 avian influenza virus replication in human cells at <b>late</b> <b>times</b> <b>post</b> infection. Further, RIG-I expression was lower in NSBE cells compared to NHBE cells suggesting reduced virus sensing. Together, these studies identify key differences in the antiviral response between human and swin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Ecological shifts {{can promote}} rapid {{divergence}} and speciation. However, {{the role of}} ecological speciation in animals that reproduce predominantly asexually with periodic sex and strong dispersal, such as lacustrine cladocerans, is poorly understood. These life history traits may slow or prevent ecological lineage formation among populations. Proponents of the postglacial ecological isolation hypothesis for Daphnia suggest that some species have formed postglacially in adjacent, but ecologically different habitats. We tested this hypothesis with ecological, morphological, and multilocus coalescence analyses in the putative lacustrine sister species, Daphnia parvula and Daphnia retrocurva. Results Daphnia parvula and D. retrocurva showed strong habitat separation with rare co-occurrence. Lakes inhabited by D. parvula were smaller in size and contained lower densities of invertebrate predators compared to lakes containing D. retrocurva. In the laboratory, D. retrocurva was less vulnerable to invertebrate predation, whereas D. parvula was less vulnerable to vertebrate predation and was smaller and more transparent than D. retrocurva. The species are significantly differentiated at mitochondrial and nuclear loci and form an intermediate genetic divergence pattern between panmixia and reciprocal monophyly. Coalescence and population genetic modelling indicate a <b>Late</b> or <b>Post</b> Glacial <b>time</b> of divergence with a demographic expansion. Conclusions Despite their young age and mixed breeding system, D. parvula and D. retrocurva exhibit significant ecological and genetic divergence that is coincident {{with the formation of}} deep temperate glacial lakes. We propose that predation may have facilitated the rapid divergence between D. parvula and D. retrocurva and that intermediate divergence of aquatic cyclic parthenogens is likely more common than previously thought. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{how to make}} and use a three dimensional model in GSI 3 D, based on well data from the Geological Survey of Sweden’s well archive. The objective is to determine if {{it is possible to}} show a supposed fault scarp, the Bollnäs fault, in the bedrock and the valley morphology in a 3 D model based on the data available. During the last ice age, the land surface under the ice was depressed by several hundred meters. As the last ice sheet retreated, land uplift began and faulting occurred. These glacially-induced faults are dated to <b>late</b> or <b>post</b> glacial <b>times</b> since they are cutting post glacial sediments. The same goes for the Bollnäs fault. The scarp is seen through airborne light detecting and ranging, LiDAR, cutting surficial sediments but never outcrops in the bedrock. After examining and validating the well data in the mapped area, 430 of 478 wells were used to build the model, giving a 3 D model of the surficial deposits and the bedrock surface. In the model, the scarp cannot be seen in the bedrock, nor in the deposits nor in the valley morphology. Exporting the model to Arc GIS as a digital terrain model, a DTM, as a raster, shows that with the amount of data available a fair pixel resolution would be 150 m 2. With that resolution detailed landforms like fault scarps would not appear. The conclusion is that the amount of data is to low to accurately model small-scale features.   These findings aligning with earlier research on 3 D models. ...|$|R
