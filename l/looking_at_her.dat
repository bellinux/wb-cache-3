5|$|In {{the waiting}} room outside the morgue, the doctor tells Buffy that Joyce died of an {{aneurysm}} suddenly and painlessly. Left alone with Buffy, Tara tells her that her own mother {{died when she was}} 17 and she went through something similar. Dawn goes alone to the morgue to see Joyce's body. While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn has not come back, Buffy goes to look for her and finds her in the morgue, being attacked by the vampire. As Buffy fights and kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. <b>Looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother, Dawn asks where she went, as she reaches out to touch her cheek.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen-year-old Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a sunny {{high school}} senior who loves cheerleading and is dating a {{football}} player, Jared (Brandt Wille). She does not enjoy kissing Jared, however, and prefers <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> fellow cheerleaders. Combined with Megan's interest in vegetarianism and Melissa Etheridge, {{her family and friends}} suspect that she is in fact a lesbian. With the help of ex-gay Mike (RuPaul), they surprise her with an intervention. Following this confrontation, Megan is sent to True Directions, a reparative therapy camp which uses a five-step program (similar to Alcoholics Anonymous' twelve-step program) to convert its campers to heterosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Though {{there are}} {{standard}} descriptions of Dhumavati's form, some relatively recent paintings deviate from it. For example, an 18th-century painting by Molaram depicts Dhumavati {{sitting on a}} chariot pulled by two black scavenger birds with curved beaks. The painting follows the usual attributes like the winnowing basket, boon-giving gesture, but also depicts her young and beautiful with full breasts and adorned in gold finery, {{a stark contrast to}} her usual form. An early 20th-century painting from Varanasi depicts her riding a crow, holding a trident, a sword, a winnowing fan, and a bowl in her four arms, dark-complexioned, with sagging breasts, wearing white clothes and with cremation flames in the background. She is again adorned in gold finery and wears a gold-hewn lower garment, unusual for a widow's dress. Another 18th century Nepali manuscript depicts a complete deviation from her traditional descriptions. She is completely nude with high breasts, wears a pearl necklace and headband, stands on a peacock with legs apart, and holds a mirror while <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> reflection. A ring of fire surrounds her, possibly conveying cremation flames.|$|E

60|$|Siegmund {{lifted his}} head and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> He loathed {{the idea of having}} to move. He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> confusedly.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> steadfastly, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{feeling as}} one far away gazing down upon some strange element in life. Then a thought came to him.|$|R
25|$|Flockhart {{played the}} role of Helena in A Midsummer Night's Dream, a 1999 film version of Shakespeare's play. In 2000, she {{appeared}} in Things You Can Tell Just by <b>Looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>Her</b> and , later accompanying Eve Ensler to Kenya in order to protest violence against women, particularly female genital mutilation. Flockhart also starred in the Off-Broadway production of Ensler's The Vagina Monologues.|$|E

25|$|The Church {{had been}} {{practically}} abandoned {{for some years}} and was in a bad state of delapidation, but the beautiful carved work {{that had been done}} by William Bernard Sears, soon after the church was built, had not then been molested. My mother used to sit in the church and read the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments over the Chancel, and admire the gilded dove that Mr. Sears had placed high over the Pulpit. The 'Eye' which he also had made seemed to be <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> no matter where she sat.|$|E
6000|$|Pause. Kipps <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{and then}} was unable to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> again. She {{regarded}} him with interest. [...] "You left school?" [...] she remarked after a pause.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{a little}} puzzled. The glow upon {{her face and}} the {{sunlight}} upon her brown hair kept him silent. He was content to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and wonder.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nobody,' they answered, with contempt. Yet {{each one}} of them waited for him to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> hoped he would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> All except Annie, and {{something}} was broken in her.|$|R
25|$|Sister Shannon Masters, the Warrior Nun Areala, {{given the}} serial {{nature of her}} adventures has {{developed}} a wide circle of heroes around her making them into a family she otherwise would not have. That is seen in her foster sister joining the Warrior Nuns and her <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> fellow Sisters as just that, sisters. Initially uncertain of herself she has developed as a character though she has never lost her idealism or her love of God and Jesus Christ. She has formed strong bonds of affection with her surrogate sisters, Sasuki, Mary, and Sarah; her surrogate son, Jason; her parent figures, Father Gomez and Mother Superion; and with them has fought {{a wide variety of}} foes such as Demon Foster, Julius Salvius, and Helga.|$|E
25|$|Jagannathan {{was born}} Devendra Kula Vellalar family in 1926. Her first {{encounter}} with social injustice and poverty was by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother Nagammal who had to toil very hard and had to work {{even when she was}} in advanced stage of pregnancy. Despite being from a poor family she managed university education and was soon involved with the Gandhian Sarvodaya Movement. It was through Sarvodaya that she Sankaralingam, who was much later to be her husband. Sankaralingam hailed from a wealthy family, yet gave up his college studies in 1930 in response to Gandhi's call for non-co-operation movement and civil disobedience. At one stage Krishnammal even shared a stage with Gandhi and also met Martin Luther King. Sankaralinga later joined the Quit India Movement in 1942 and spent years in jail before India gained its independence in 1947. Having decided only to marry in independent India Sankaralingam and Krishnammal married in 1950. She would later head the Salt Satyagraha march in Vedaranyam, this time not in protest, but to commemorate the platinum jublee of the event in 2006.|$|E
500|$|In the aftermath, Hyun-jun and Seung-hee left NSS for {{a normal}} life. While Seung-hee waited at a {{lighthouse}} for Hyun-jun, {{he was driving}} up to meet her and propose.

60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> but {{he could}} not answer her; like all the others, when one <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> she seemed to shrivel beneath one's eyes and become worthless, malicious, and untrustworthy.|$|R

5000|$|... "She {{is forcing}} you to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> body," [...] Moroccan {{literature}} specialist Malti-Douglas says. [...] "There {{is a constant}} invitation to readers to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> body. I don't know of any other text that is so powerful." ...|$|R
500|$|But unlike {{previous}} allegorical literature {{with these}} themes, such as John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1678), Sherwood domesticated her story—all {{of the actions}} in the children's day-to-day lives are of supreme importance because they relate directly to their salvation. Emily, for example, succumbs to the temptation to eat some forbidden plums: “no eye was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> but the eye of God, who sees every thing we do, and knows even the secret thoughts of the heart; but Emily, just at that moment, {{did not think of}} God." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{flashing}} scene, Carell told Flannery that he [...] "wasn't staring at" [...] her breasts, rather, he was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> clavicle. Despite what it appears on camera, Flannery {{was not completely}} topless, as she was wearing pasties. The scene was shot several times; Flannery admitted that the shooting was excruiating {{and it felt like}} they had been shooting the one scene for [...] "14 hours". To preserve Flannery's modesty, the series' monitors were shut off and the memory card for the digital camera was removed. Carell actually took pictures during the Christmas party shoot. All of the photos were released online.|$|E
500|$|Hawks and Hepburn had a {{confrontation}} one day during shooting. While Hepburn was chatting {{with a crew}} member, Hawks yelled [...] "Quiet!" [...] until the only person still talking was Hepburn. When Hepburn paused and realized that everyone was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> she asked what was the matter; Hawks {{asked her if she}} was finished imitating a parrot. Hepburn took Hawks aside, telling him never to talk to her like that again since she was old friends with most of the crew. When Hawks (an older friend of the crew) asked a lighting tech who he would rather drop a light on, Hepburn agreed to behave on set. A variation of this scene, with Grant yelling [...] "Quiet!", was incorporated into the film.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> coldly. Worse, he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{as if she}} {{had been}} an utter stranger. Bulging with her meat and drink, he cut her dead; and, having done so, turned and walked into the next flat.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> very tendrilly. I may say, it's {{from him}} that I coppied MY look to Miss ----. He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> very tendrilly {{and held out}} his arms. She gev a suffycating shreek, and rusht into his umbraces.|$|R
60|$|Adam <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> It was {{so sweet}} to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> eyes, which had now a self-forgetful {{questioning}} in them--for {{a moment he}} forgot {{that he wanted to}} say anything, or that it was necessary to tell her what he meant.|$|R
500|$|As the Fringe {{division}} {{sets out}} to Roland's home, Roland injects Amanda's body {{with more of the}} serum, and she is brought back to life. By the time Fringe arrives, Roland gives himself up willingly, and they find Amanda dead again. Roland explains that though she was alive, when he looked into her eyes, he realized she wasn't the same person and thus terminated the process. As Roland and Amanda's body are taken away, Olivia breaks down in front of Peter; she questions that if Roland could tell that Amanda wasn't the same person by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> eyes, why couldn't Peter do the same with Fauxlivia? Peter is unable to answer her, and a distressed Olivia leaves on her own. As Walter takes Peter to get a milkshake, the two are identified by an Observer, who reports on his phone that [...] "he is still alive".|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{director}} David Lynch began casting for his psychological thriller Mulholland Drive. He interviewed Watts after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> headshot, {{without having}} {{seen any of}} her previous work, and offered her the lead role. Lynch later said about his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities {{for a lot of}} different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Conceived as a pilot for a television series, Lynch shot a large portion of it in February 1999, planning to keep it open-ended for a potential series. However, the pilot was rejected. Watts recalled thinking at the time, [...] "just my dumb luck, that I'm in the only David Lynch programme that never sees the light of day." [...] Instead, Lynch filmed an ending in October 2000, turning it into a feature film which was picked up for distribution.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{influence}} that the apparent death of Steve Rogers has on Carter, Atwell explained that [...] "It's only been a year and she's grieving him and I think what keeps her going is he was the greatest person she ever knew ... she's also determined {{to make sure that}} his work wasn't in vain." [...] Following the first season, Atwell noted that Carter did not [...] "win everyone’s respect", with Jack Thompson taking credit for her actions, for example, but [...] "she knows her value so she doesn’t need that praise". For the second season, executive producer Michele Fazekas explained that after Carter [...] "put a lot of things emotionally to bed", such as letting go of Captain America, she is now [...] "more open to <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> life and figuring out, does she want a relationship?" [...] Fazekas added that Carter would start to realize that [...] "not everybody has her ideals", even in the SSR.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{they all}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> for {{in her eyes}} was {{something}} that compelled theirs. Clement Maldon, who knew the world and how a she-wolf can fight for its cub, read in them a warning which caused him to change his tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Big Jim's" [...] wife gave <b>her</b> order. He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with respect. She had {{mentioned}} truffles; {{and he had}} not known that she knew what truffles were.

500|$|Despite no lie {{detector}} or DNA test given, both are {{sentenced to death}} in the electric chair. In a bid to spare Marge, Homer says that he acted alone. As he is sitting in the electric chair, it is suddenly revealed to Homer that he is on a new reality TV show, Frame Up that airs on Fox TV. The whole thing was just part of an elaborate hidden camera scheme, the [...] "man with the braces" [...] was the show's host, and Mrs. Bellamy is guest host Carmen Electra in disguise. Homer and Marge are reunited with the kids, and Homer is angry that he had to suffer so the show could get higher ratings. Carmen Electra tries to explain, but Homer is too busy <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> breasts. Chief Wiggum, on the other hand, is irritated that the police department used was wasted on what turned out to not even be a real case, but he learns he will be in the show and Eddie and Lou will be given producer credits.|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{gave the}} episode a 7.8/10 rating. Characterising the episode as [...] "the quiet before the storm, the {{seemingly}} innocuous bottle episode {{that ends up}} being the precursor to a slam-bang conclusion", he wrote that the episode [...] "gets the job done", specifically praising Tate for her ability to [...] "carry {{the weight of the}} episode". He highlighted the cliffhanger of the scene—when the Doctor realises that Donna met Rose, and subsequently deduces the universe is in danger—as the best moment in the episode; he wrote that it was [...] "a great moment, and sets up a premise suitably large for Davies' farewell episodes." [...] He criticised two major points of the episode: he thought the beetle prosthetic did not look convincing, and undermined Donna's questions of why people were <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> back; and he thought the episode was Davies' highlight reel, reminiscent of someone reminding the viewer of an event and then moving to the next slide. Closing, he wrote that {{there was a sense that}} [...] "something was missing from the proceedings", but commented that the episode [...] "serves as a good set up for the two-part climax of season four".|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, Shelly began {{a gimmick}} of being obsessed with Paul Burchill, who {{was using a}} pirate gimmick on SmackDown!. It began at the {{television}} tapings on February 1, when Burchill had picked her up to perform a piledriver, but instead carried her backstage after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> underwear. This obsession provoked a feud with Phoenix, when Shelly attacked Phoenix who was attempting to stop Shelly from attacking Cherry during a match between Burchill and Deuce Shade. As part of the feud, Shelly and Phoenix competed {{against each other in}} several matches, including a street fight at the television tapings on April 19. On the May 6, 2006 episode of Velocity, Shelly appeared as Burchill's valet for his match against Road Warrior Animal, and was referred to as his [...] "buxom wench". Returning to OVW, she became involved in Seth Skyfire's ongoing feud with Mike [...] "The Miz" [...] Mizanin and Roni Jonah. Upon her debut on the ECW brand in mid-2006, Martinez began using the ring name Ariel in OVW as well. In November 2006, Ariel unsuccessfully challenged Beth Phoenix for the OVW Women's Championship. Her final appearance in OVW came on January 25, 2007, when she and Jon Bolen defeated Stevens and Phoenix.|$|E

60|$|He did not answer, {{he did not}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> but lay as she {{had left}} him. She wiped {{her face with her}} handkerchief, waiting. Then she bent over him. He did not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She saw his {{forehead}} was swollen and inflamed with the sun. Very gently she wiped from it the glistening sweat. He closed his eyes, and she wiped his cheeks and his mouth. Still he did not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She bent very close to him, feeling her heart crushed with grief for him.|$|R
