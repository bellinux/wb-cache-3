5|$|Despite the <b>low</b> <b>gross</b> on {{its initial}} release, Manhunter grew in {{popularity}} by the 2000s {{and has been}} mentioned in several books and lists of cult films. These reappraisals often cite the success of Silence of the Lambs and its sequels {{as the reason for}} the increased interest in Manhunter, while still favoring the earlier film over its successors. Telling of this resurgence in appreciation are the film's ratings on review aggregation sites such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes. Compiled mostly from reviews written decades after its original release, Manhunter has a metascore of 78 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews, and a 94% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, from 33 reviews.|$|E
500|$|Stereotypes {{of alcoholics}} are {{often found in}} fiction and popular culture. The [...] "town drunk" [...] is a stock {{character}} in Western popular culture. Stereotypes of drunkenness may be based on racism or xenophobia, as in the fictional depiction of the Irish as heavy drinkers. Studies by social psychologists Stivers and Greeley attempt to document the perceived prevalence of high alcohol consumption amongst the Irish in America. Alcohol consumption is relatively similar between many European cultures, the United States, and Australia. In Asian countries that have a high gross domestic product, there is heightened drinking compared to other Asian countries, but it is nowhere near {{as high as it}} is in other countries like the United States. It is also inversely seen, with countries that have very <b>low</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product showing high alcohol consumption. In a study done on Korean immigrants in Canada, they reported alcohol was even an integral part of their meal, and is the only time solo drinking should occur. [...] They also believe alcohol is necessary at any social event as it helps conversations start.|$|E

In an interview with Sight & Sound magazine, Fincher addressed the film's <b>low</b> <b>gross</b> at the North American box office: [...] "Even with the box office being what it is, I still think there's an audience out there for this movie. Everyone has a different idea about marketing, but my philosophy is that if you market a movie to 16-year-old boys and don't deliver Saw or Seven, they're going to be the most vociferous ones coming out of the screening saying 'This movie sucks.' And you're saying goodbye to the audience who would get it because they're going to look at the ads and say, 'I don't want to see some slasher movie.'" ...|$|E

60|$|If {{the reader}} imagines, from the {{accounts}} {{which have been}} given thus far in this chapter of the pomp and parade of royalty, of the castles and the ceremonies, the titles of nobility, and the various insignia of rank and power, which we have alluded to so often, that the mode of life which royalty led {{in those days was}} lofty, dignified, and truly great, he will be very greatly deceived. All these things were merely for show--things put on for public display, to gratify pride and impress the people, who never looked behind the scenes, with high ideas of the grandeur of those who, as they were taught, ruled over them by a divine right. It would be hard to find, in any class of society except those reputed infamous, more <b>low,</b> <b>gross,</b> and vulgar modes of life than have been exhibited generally in the royal palaces of Europe for the last five hundred years. King James the First has, among English sovereigns, rather a high character for sobriety and gravity of deportment, and purity of morals; but the glimpses we get of the real, every-day routine of his domestic life, are such as to show that the pomp and parade of royalty is mere glittering tinsel, after all.|$|E
60|$|But Hermiston {{was not all}} of one piece. He was, besides, {{a mighty}} toper; he could sit at wine until the day dawned, and pass {{directly}} from the table to the Bench with a steady hand and a clear head. Beyond the third bottle, he showed the plebeian in a larger print; the <b>low,</b> <b>gross</b> accent, the low, foul mirth, grew broader and commoner; he became less formidable, and infinitely more disgusting. Now, the boy had inherited from Jean Rutherford a shivering delicacy, unequally mated with potential violence. In the playing-fields, and amongst his own companions, he repaid a coarse expression with a blow; at his father's table (when the time came for him to join these revels) he turned pale and sickened in silence. Of all the guests whom he there encountered, he had toleration for only one: David Keith Carnegie, Lord Glenalmond. Lord Glenalmond was tall and emaciated, with long features and long delicate hands. He was often compared with the statue of Forbes of Culloden in the Parliament House; and his blue eye, at more than sixty, preserved some of the fire of youth. His exquisite disparity with any of his fellow-guests, his appearance as of an artist and an aristocrat stranded in rude company, riveted the boy's attention; and as curiosity and interest are the {{things in the world}} that are the most immediately and certainly rewarded, Lord Glenalmond was attracted by the boy.|$|E
