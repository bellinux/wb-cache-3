40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{technique}} {{for the design}} of reflector shapes from prescribed optical properties (far field radiance distribution) and geometrical constraints, which is of high importance in the field of <b>Lighting</b> <b>Engineering,</b> more specifically for Luminaire Design. The reflector shape to be found is just a part of a set of pieces of what is known in <b>lighting</b> <b>engineering</b> as an optical set, and is composed of a lamp (light source), a reflector, a holding case and a glass that protects the system from dust and other environmental phenomena. Thus, we aim at the design and development of a system capable of generating a reflector shape in a way such that the optical set emits a given, user defined, far field radiance distribution. This problem can be put in the mathematical context of inverse problems, which refer to all the problems where, contrary to what happens with traditional direct problems, several aspects of the scene are unknown. Then, the algorithm is allowed to work backwards to establish the missing parameters. In order to do so, light propagation inside and outside the optical set must be computed and the resulting radiance distribution compared to the desired one. Finally, constraints on the shape imposed by industry needs must be taken into account, bounding the set of possible shape definitions. The general approach taken is based on a minimization procedure on the space of possible reflector shapes. The algorithm moves towards minimizing the distance, in the I 2 metric, between the resulting illumination far from the reflector and a prescribed, ideal optical radiance distribution specified at the far field by the user.

Then 1 -mu m thick GaN layers were {{deposited on}} the Si cantilevers by metal-organic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (MOCVD). Epilayers on cantilever areas were obtained crack-free, and the photoluminescence (PL) spectra verified the stress reduction and better material quality in these suspended parts of GaN. Back sides of the cantilevers were also covered with GaN layers, which prevented the composite beams from bending dramatically. This paper had proved the feasibility of integrating high-quality GaN epilayers with Si micromechanical structures to realize GaN-based micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{methods that}} can be used for modeling radiative properties of light sources and materials, in a radiosity computation algorithm. These methods have been designed in order to improve the photo-realistic rendering of complex architectural scenes as well as to allow illumination engineering applications. They are based on the accurate modeling of the spatial and spectral emittance distributions of the light sources, and the surface reflectance/transmittance distributions from measurement, and allow to calculate the exact colorimetric properties of the light sources and the surfaces. A method for changing radiosity inputs during the radiosity process, without recalculating the solution entirely is also proposed. This allows to simulate modifications in design or dynamic lighting effects more interactively.
