40|$|Leather is {{a natural}} {{material}} with many applications: automotive, domestic upholstery, buildings, aviation, maritime, personal safety, etc. For each of these sectors, fire behavior is a field of particular interest. Unfortunately, there are many testing methods and different flammability standards depending on material application and end use. Therefore, there are different ways of approaching the whole flammability issue. In this work, different approaches for analyzing the fire resistance <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> are examined: (i) influence {{of the type of}} tannage, (ii) influence of the type <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> (iii) influence <b>of</b> the type of retannage, (iv) influence of the type of fatliquor, and (v) influence of the use of flame retardants. The results indicate that leather presents natural fire resistance. However, the type <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> type <b>of</b> tannage, retannage and fatliquor effect the flammability behavior <b>of</b> <b>leather.</b> In addition, the use of flame retardants slightly improves the smouldering properties <b>of</b> <b>leather.</b> Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|The aims of this {{experiment}} were to identify carbohydrases in rumen <b>liquor</b> <b>of</b> cattle, {{and to determine}} optimum temperature and pH of enzymes, {{as well as to}} evaluate the effect of metal ions and chemical substances on enzymes activity. Optimum precipitation of the enzymes from local and imported cattle was reached at the concentration of 60 % and 70 % of ammonium sulphate, respectively. The enzymes (xylanase, mannanase, and amylase) had optimum temperature in the range of 50 - 60 °C, except for cellulase from imported cattle which had optimum temperature at 39 oC, optimum pH of the enzymes were 6 - 7 except for cellulase was at pH 4. The enzymes mostly needed methal ions as activators. EDTA and β-mercaptoethanol inhibited activity of cellulase from rumen <b>liquor</b> <b>of</b> local cattle, while enzymes from rumen <b>liquor</b> <b>of</b> imported cattle EDTA inhibited xylanase activity and β-mercaptoethanol inhibited mannanase and amylase activity. Activity of cellulase in rumen <b>liquor</b> <b>of</b> local cattle was higher than those of imported cattle. It is concluded that rumen <b>liquor</b> <b>of</b> imported and local cattles from abbatoir contained cellulase, xylanase, mannase and amylase that most of them had optimum temperature and pH at 50 - 60 oC and 6 - 7, respectively, and they needed methal ions as activators...|$|R
