40|$|The {{following}} text {{indicates the}} editorial procedure {{that was followed}} by the Board in coming out with the Yearbook. It also represents our editorial policy and general consensus position on the Yearbook: 1.) Editorial work on yearbook 1993 consisted of SELECTING and COMPILING posted articles on major topics that were presented on Okyeame in 1993. Articles selected for inclusion are ones that convey the spirit, depth and breadth of the range of viewpoints expressed. As much as possible articles are presented in their original style and language. Minor changes in spelling, sentence construction or re-arrangement may have been done to improve the clarity of presentation. Some postings may have been rewritten by the original authors and/or with the editors to circumvent copyright laws. 2.) Editorial comments are clearly marked as such. 3.) Preliminary <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> was posted on Okyeame for general scrutiny. Individual authors had up to MARCH 31, 1994 to withdraw their articles from inclusion or make minor modifications in consultations with the sectional editors. Changes that alter the tenor and character of the original debate, of which that posting was a part, could be rejected. The sectional editor exercised judgement in such matters. His decision, if need be, could be reviewed by the editorial committee. Final authority in such matters rested with the editorial committee. Also, individuals could use PEN NAMES for any or all of their articles as they wish...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is {{associated}} with a high risk of death from coronary artery disease and may modify the response to standard cardiovascular therapies. Treatment of subjects with CKD should ideally be based on evidence from randomized, clinical trials, but how often subjects with CKD have been excluded from these trials is uncertain. We undertook this study in order to quantify how often subjects with moderate to advanced CKD were excluded from large cardiovascular trials. MEDLINE and the reference <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> were searched in order to identify large, randomized, controlled trials of five different coronary artery disease therapies published between 1998 and 2005. Exclusion criteria and reported clinical characteristics of subjects were abstracted. Rates of exclusion and reporting of baseline characteristics of study participants were compared for CKD, diabetes, history of smoking, and hypertension. Eighty-six trials randomizing 411653 patients were identified. More than 80 % of trials excluded subjects with end-stage renal disease and 75. 0 % excluded patients with CKD. Subjects with diabetes, hypertension, or a history of smoking were excluded less than 4 % of the time. Baseline renal function of study participant was reported in only 7 % of trials. Patients with CKD are frequently excluded from coronary artery disease trials and renal function of randomized subjects is rarely reported. These findings reinforce the notion that available data on the treatment of coronary artery disease in subjects with CKD have significant limitations and should be generalized to the treatment of subjects with CKD cautiously...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} review was performed of publications {{relating to the}} results of urinary flow studies after hypospadias repair dating back to 1978, when {{what appears to be the}} first publication on this topic was found. The literature search was performed using the key words "hypospadias" combined with "urinary flow", "urine flow", "uroflow", "uroflowmetry", and "long-term". We also reviewed the abstracts and full-length articles cited in the reference <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles.</b> Criteria for inclusion in the present {{systematic review}} included descriptions of patient selection, surgical technique, the severity of disease (proximal vs distal), and the method used to determine uroflow, as well as a definition of urethral obstruction. In all, 339 article titles were found. Of these, 25 abstracts appeared relevant and the full text of these articles were reviewed, with 22 of the papers included in this review. Sixteen reports had appeared in the literature since 2001, compared with six between 1978 and 2000, suggesting an increasing interest in this topic. On the basis of the results of the present systematic review, we recommend that asymptomatic children operated on for hypospadias in infancy should have one flow study after toilet training, with that study repeated if the results are abnormal. It appears that early abnormal flows improve spontaneously, so that children operated on after toilet training who are asymptomatic should undergo their first uroflow measurement 1 year after surgery. Children with obstructed flow parameters or borderline flows should be followed until adulthood, until long-term follow up studies clarify the significance of abnormal flow parameters. Given the present findings, we anticipate that in the next two decades urologists will need to treat a number of men with strictures resulting from hypospadias repairs performed in childhood...|$|E

40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight cyclic volatile methylsiloxanes (cVMSs) are widely employed as emollients and carrier solvents in personal care formulations {{in order to}} acquire desired performance benefits owing to their distinctive physicochemical properties. Under current European legislation cosmetic ingredients such as cVMSs are required to be labeled on the product package only qualitatively, while {{for the assessment of}} environmental and consumer exposure quantitative information is needed. The aim of this study was therefore to measure concentrations of three cVMSs, namely octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D 6) in 51 cosmetics and personal care products (C&PCPs) that are currently available on the European market. The <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> comprised a variety of hair and sun care products, skin creams and lotions, deodorants including antiperspirants, liquid foundations and a toothpaste. The target compounds were extracted from the products with different organic solvents dependent on the product matrix, followed by gas chromatography analysis with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). D 5 was the predominant cVMS with the highest mean and median concentrations in all the C&PCP categories. The median concentrations of D 5, D 6 and D 4 were 142, 2. 3 and 0. 053 mg/g in deodorants/antiperspirants (n= 11); 44. 6, 30. 0 mg/g and below the limit of quantification (<LOQ; LOQ for D 4 = 0. 00071 mg/g) in cosmetics (n= 5); 8. 4, 0. 32 mg/g and <LOQ in skin care (n= 16); 9. 6, 0. 18 and 0. 0055 mg/g in hair care (n= 10); and, 34. 8, 0. 53 and 0. 0085 mg/g in sun care (n= 8) products, respectively.

40|$|AIM: To {{provide an}} update on the aetiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, staging and {{management}} of rectal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A comprehensive search of Ovid MEDLINE was performed with the reference <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> reviewed to ensure all relevant publications were captured. The search strategy was limited to the English language, spanning from 1946 to 2015. A qualitative analysis was undertaken examining patient demographics, clinical presentation, diagnosis, staging, treatment and outcome. The quantitaive analysis was limited to data extracted on treatment and outcomes including radiological, clinical and pathological complete response where available. The narrative and quantitative review were synthesised in concert. RESULTS: The search identified 487 articles in total with 79 included in the qualitative review. The quantitative analysis involved 63 articles, consisting of 43 case reports and 20 case series with a total of 142 individual cases. The underlying pathogenesis of rectal SCC while unclear, continues to be defined, with increasing evidence of a metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence and a possible role for human papilloma virus in this progression. The presentation is similar to rectal adenocarcinoma, with a diagnosis confirmed by endoscopic biopsy. Many presumed rectal SCC's are in fact an extension of an anal SCC, and cytokeratin markers are a useful adjunct in this distinction. Staging is most accurately reflected by the tumour-node-metastasis classification for rectal adenocarcinoma. It involves examining locoregional disease by way of magnetic resonance imaging and/or endorectal ultrasound, with systemic spread excluded by way of computed tomography. Positron emission tomography is integral in the workup to exclude an external site of primary SCC with metastasis to the rectum. While the optimal treatment remains as yet undefined, recent studies have demonstrated a global shift away from surgery towards definitive chemoradiotherapy as primary treatment. Pooled overall survival was calculated to be 86 % in patients managed with chemoradiation compared with 48 % for those treated traditionally with surgery. Furthermore, local recurrence and metastatic rates were 25 % vs 10 % and 30 % vs 13 % for the chemoradiation vs conventional treatment cohorts. CONCLUSION: The changing paradigm in the treatment of rectal SCC holds great promise for improved outcomes in this rare disease. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXTO: Sob a denominação demência frontotemporal (DFT) enquadram-se importantes síndromes demenciais de natureza degenerativa progressiva que acometem os lobos frontais e temporais em ambos os hemisférios. As DFTs podem ser agrupadas, segundo seus aspectos clínicos dominantes, em variante frontal, afasia progressiva não fluente e demência semântica. A proteína Tau tem papel importante na patogenia desses transtornos, e anormalidades conformacionais estão presentes em até 50 % dos casos de DFT esporádica. Do ponto de vista neuropatológico, as DFTs podem ser classificadas em Tau negativas e Tau positivas, estas últimas também classificadas entre as tauopatias. OBJETIVO: Neste trabalho será revisto o papel da proteína Tau na patogenia das DFTs. MÉTODOS: Busca simples no Scielo e na Pubmed por meio das palavras-chave: "tauopatias", "demência frontotemporal" e "proteína Tau". Foram revisados os artigos publicados a partir de 2000, e artigos anteriores de maior relevância, identificados a partir das referências estudadas. RESULTADOS: Dentre os trabalhos incluídos nesta análise, 12 abordam as tauopatias, sendo dez originais e sete de revisão. Foram identificados 20 artigos sobre DFT, sendo 16 artigos originais e quatro de revisão. CONCLUSÃO: A proteína Tau tem papel {{fundamental}} na patogenia das DFTs e outras doenças neurodegenerativas. O conhecimento desses mecanismos fisiopatológicos é o passo inicial para o desenvolvimento de estratégias terapêuticas. BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) {{represents an}} important group of neurodegenerative diseases, affecting temporal and frontal lobes of both hemispheres. FTD {{can be divided}} into three clinical subsyndromes: frontal variant, non-fluent progressive aphasia, and semantic dementia. Abnormalities of the metabolism of Tau protein are present in the physiopathology of FTD, and is found in approximately 50 % of sporadic cases, supporting the classification of the FTDs into Tau-negative and Tau-positive subtypes, the latter also called "Tauopathies". OBJECTIVE: To review the role of Tau in the pathophysiology of FTD. METHODS: Review of the literature on FTD published in the Pubmed and Scielo databases since the year 2000, using the keywords: Tau, Tauopathies, frontotemporal dementia. Relevant references previously published, as indicated in the reference <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles,</b> were also included. RESULTS: Through electronic search we identified 12 articles addressing Tauopathies (ten containing original data and seven reviews), and 20 articles (16 with original data and four reviews) on FTDs. CONCLUSIONS: There is consistent evidence in the literature to support the notion that Tau protein plays {{a crucial role in the}} pathogenesis of FTDs and other neurodegenerative dementias, and the knowledge on these mechanisms is necessary for the development of more specific therapies...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: After breast-conserving surgery of ductal {{carcinoma}} in situ (DCIS) of {{the breast}} or invasive breast carcinoma with an extensive intraductal component, tumor-positive surgical margins are frequently found. Therefore, {{the extent of the}} intraductal disease needs to be accurately determined preoperatively. METHODS: Data for this review were identified by search <b>of</b> PubMed. Reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> were cross-searched for additional literature. RESULTS: DCIS is accurately detected with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the typical malignant features are inconsistently seen and most often in high-grade DCIS or in DCIS with a small invasive component. The histopathologic extent of DCIS is more accurately demonstrated with MRI. However, overestimation due to benign proliferative lesions does frequently occur. An improved depiction of DCIS could lead to improved preoperative staging. Conversely, the identification of more extensive disease on MRI could give rise to unnecessary interventions. Therefore, MRI should be used carefully and preferable in specialized and experienced centers. CONCLUSSION: To date, {{there is no evidence that}} the use of MRI improves outcomes (ie, decreases recurrence rates) in patients with DCIS...|$|R

The combined data indicate that carbohydrate malabsorption is prevalent in children with SAM. Additional well-designed intervention studies are needed to determine whether outcomes of SAM complicated by carbohydrate malabsorption could be improved by altering the carbohydrate/lactose content of therapeutic feeds and to elucidate the precise mechanisms involved...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Research {{and data}} {{regarding}} in-flight medical emergencies during commercial air travel are lacking. Although volunteer medical professionals are {{often called upon}} to assist, there are no guidelines or best practices to guide their actions. This paper reviews the literature quantifying and categorizing in-flight medical incidents, discusses the unique challenges posed by the in-flight environment, evaluates the legal aspects of volunteering to provide care, and suggests an approach to managing specific conditions at 30, 000 feet. Methods: We conducted a MEDLINE search using search terms relevant to aviation medical emergencies and flight physiology. The reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> were reviewed to identify additional studies. Results: While incidence studies were limited by data availability, syncope, gastrointestinal upset, and respiratory complaints were among the most common medical events reported. Chest pain and cardiovascular events were commonly associated with flight diversion. Conclusion: When in-flight medical emergencies occur, volunteer physicians should have knowledge about the most common in-flight medical incidents, know what is available in on-board emergency medical kits, coordinate their therapy with the flight crew and remote resources, and provide care within their scope of practice.

Among the clinical conditions found in association with anxiety stands out the joint hypermobility (JH). ObjectiveTo carry out a systematic review of the clinical association between anxiety disorders and JH. MethodA survey was conducted in MEDLINE, PsychINFO, LILACS e SciELO databases up to December 2011. We searched for articles using the keywords ‘anxiety’, ‘joint’ and ‘hypermobility’ and Boolean operators. The review included articles describing empirical studies on the association between JH and anxiety. The reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> were systematically hand-searched for other publications relevant to the review. ResultsSeventeen articles {{were included in the}} analysis and classified to better extract data. We found heterogeneity between the studies relate to the methodology used. Most of the studies found an association between anxiety features and JH. Panic disorder/agoraphobia was the anxiety disorder associated with JH in several studies. Etiological explanation of the relationship between anxiety and JH is still controversial. ConclusionFuture research in large samples from the community and clinical setting and longitudinal studies of the association between anxiety and HA and the underlying biological mechanisms involved in this association are welcome...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence linking C-reactive protein (CRP) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Despite {{the abundance of}} literature, confusion exists regarding this association because of inconsistent results. MEDLINE and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases were carefully searched through July, 2009 combining the following terms "C-reactive protein" and "atrial fibrillation". Reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> and reviews were also screened to identify additional relevant studies. Of the 129 studies initially identified, 8 studies with 7507 subjects (719 with AF) {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. Analysis yielded a relative risk of 1. 63 (1. 43, 1. 86) for occurrence of AF when CRP level was above a cut off of 3 - 3. 5 mg/l. When 3 studies with data on a higher cut off of 4. 5 - 5. 0 mg/l were analyzed separately, the relative risk was 4. 03 (3. 1, 5. 25). Our study suggests that elevated CRP is associated with increased risk for AF. The risk appears incremental with higher CRP levels conferring proportionately increased risk. There is an urgent need for further large scale, well designed prospective studies to assess the relationship between CRP and AF. Keywords: Arrhythmia, Atrial Fibrillation, CRP, Inflammation...|$|R

Several predisposing factors have been suggested {{for the development of}} infections after elective surgeries. This study aimed to evaluate the rate of infectious complications following elective abdominal surgery.  Materials and Methods: This systematic review was performed via searching in databases such as Cochrane Library and MEDLINE until December 2014, and articles with available abstracts were included in the study. In addition, manual search was conducted within the reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles.</b> Inclusion criteria and quality of related articles were evaluated by two reviewers independently, and required data were extracted.   Results: Among related studies, the earliest article was published in 1988, and the most recent one was published in 2013. All studies were performed on adult patients. Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) were reported to be the third most frequent hospital-acquired infections, with the prevalence rate of 4. 7 - 25 % in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery.  Conclusions: According to the results of this study, postoperative infections are a global issue, leading to several health consequences and increased morbidity and mortality among different patients.

40|$|Background: Love, sex and {{the female}} traveller: romance tourism or female sex tourism? The {{phenomenon}} of women travelling in search of relationships with local men in developing countries has been studied for the last 20 years. However, it appears little known in travel medicine. Methods: Relevant literature was found through PubMed, ScienceDirect, ProQuest and Google Scholar. The reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> identified further sources. Results: Historical records of women travellers to far-away countries abound. Then, as now, women not only searched for the erotic 'other' but made romance and sex the purpose of their trip. Today, increasing numbers of women travel to destinations in developing countries where sex with local men is the main attraction. This pastime raises concerns {{not only for the}} women themselves but for the local men involved as well as their sex partners and the local communities. Conclusions: Although more research is necessary, comparing the criteria that describe men travelling for sex and relationships and women travelling for sex and relationships appears to suggest that there is very little difference between the two, regardless of what the pursuit is called. Women looking for sex with local men are sex tourists, too. Recognition of this fact needs to influence the pre and post travel care of female travellers...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Motivational Interviewing (MI) can {{effectively}} stimulate motivation for health behavior change, but the active ingredients of MI {{are not well}} known. To help clinicians further stimulate motivation, {{they need to know}} the active ingredients of MI. A psychometrically sound instrument is required to identify those ingredients. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe and evaluate the capability of existing instruments to reliably measure one or more potential active ingredients in the MI process between clients and MI-therapists. METHODS: We systematically searched MedLine, Embase, Cinahl, PsycInfo, Cochrane Central, specialised websites and reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles.</b> RESULTS: We found 406 papers, 60 papers were retrieved for further evaluation, based on prespecified criteria. Seventeen instruments that were specifically designed to measure MI or aspects of MI were identified. Fifteen papers met all inclusion criteria, and reported on seven instruments that assess potential active ingredients of the interactive MI process. The capability of these instruments to measure potential active ingredients in detail and as a part of the interactive MI process varies considerably. Three of these instruments measure one or more potential active ingredients in a reliable and valid way. CONCLUSION: To identify the potential active ingredients in the interactive MI process, a combination of the SCOPE (which measures potential technical active ingredients) and the GROMIT or the global ratings of the MISC 2 (to measure potential relational ingredients) seems favourable...|$|R

Method: Nine computerized databases were searched, and manual searches were conducted <b>of</b> reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> {{as well as two}} journals. In addition, key researchers in the field were contacted to determine whether they were aware of other relevant studies. The reviewers identified randomized controlled trials of multiple-session psychological treatments aimed at preventing or reducing traumatic stress symptoms in individuals within 3 months of exposure to a traumatic event. Details of the studies were independently extracted by two reviewers, and outcome data were entered into the Review Manager software package. Quality assessment was also conducted by two researchers independently. Results: Twenty-five studies examining a range of interventions were identified. For treatment of individuals exposed to a trauma irrespective of their symptoms, {{there was no significant difference}} between any intervention and usual care. For treatment of traumatic stress symptoms irrespective of diagnosis, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was more effective than waiting list or supportive counseling conditions.

Methods: We systematically searched MedLine, Embase, Cinahl, PsycInfo, Cochrane Central, specialised websites and reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles.</b> Results: We found 406 papers, 60 papers were retrieved for further evaluation, based on prespecified criteria. Seventeen instruments that were specifically designed to measure MI or aspects of MI were identified. Fifteen papers met all inclusion criteria, and reported on seven instruments that assess potential active ingredients of the interactive MI process. The capability of these instruments to measure potential active ingredients in detail and as a part of the interactive MI process varies considerably. Three of these instruments measure one or more potential active ingredients in a reliable and valid way. Conclusion: To identify the potential active ingredients in the interactive MI process, a combination of the SCOPE (which measures potential technical active ingredients) and the GROMIT or the global ratings of the MISC 2 (to measure potential relational ingredients) seems favourable...|$|R
40|$|Background Endometrial {{ablation}} {{has been}} widely implemented in the outpatient setting. Many different protocols of local anaesthesia during endometrial ablation are used and described. However, prospective studies to assess and evaluate these protocols appear to be scarce. Objectives To evaluate systematically the different local anaesthesia techniques in relation to pain perception during endometrial ablation. Search strategy Medline and Embase were systematically searched and reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> were checked for missed publications. Selection criteria All types of studies reporting the performance of endometrial ablation under local anaesthesia in ten or more women were included. Data collection and analysis Data about the procedure, the protocol of local anaesthesia, the acceptability and side-effects were extracted. Main results Twenty-five studies, involving 2013 women, were included. Applied anaesthesia techniques included intracervical, paracervical and intrauterine anaesthesia {{or a combination of}} these techniques. Women who received a combination of either intra-or paracervical anaesthesia and intrauterine injections reported significantly lower pain scores than those who received no local anaesthesia or intra-or paracervical anaesthesia alone (P = 0. 000), but the quality of evidence is low. The acceptability of endometrial ablation under local anaesthesia was high (77 - 94 %). Conclusion Endometrial ablation under local anaesthesia is a safe, feasible and acceptable procedure. The combination of either intra-or paracervical anaesthesia with intrauterine injections seems to be promising, but has to be investigated more thoroughl...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor {{the last}} 40 years, {{schizophrenia}} {{has been considered}} to be the result primarily of a dysfunction in brain dopaminergic pathways. In this review, it is described and discussed findings concerning nitric oxide-mediated neurotransmission in schizophrenia. Studies were searched in PubMed, SciELO, and LILACS using the terms schizophrenia and nitric oxide plasma levels or nitric oxide serum levels, with no time limit. The reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> were also hand-searched for additional articles. From 15 potential reports, 10 were eligible {{to be included in the}} review and meta-analysis. These studies included a total of 505 patients with schizophrenia and 339 healthy volunteers. No significant difference was found between patients and healthy controls regarding total nitrite plasma/serum levels (effect size g = 0. 285, 95 %CI = - 0. 205 to 0. 774, p = 0. 254). However, when studies with patients under antipsychotic treatment were examined separately, there was a significant difference between patients and healthy volunteers (effect size g = 0. 663, 95 %CI = 0. 365 to 0. 961, p < 0. 001), showing that patients under treatment have higher levels of plasma/serum nitric oxide than controls. These results suggest that antipsychotics increase nitric oxide plasma/serum levels and that the nitrergic pathway would be a fertile target for the development of new treatments for patients with schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionForestier’s disease {{affects the}} spinal column of {{primarily}} elderly men. It is not rare, {{but it is}} often undiagnosed {{and can lead to}} significant morbidity and mortality. When it affects the cervical spine, it can result in important otorhinolaryngological manifestations. ObjectiveTo analyze the pharyngeal and laryngeal symptoms of the Forestier’s disease. MethodsLiterature review of the Web of Knowledge, PubMed, and SciELO databases and of the ten most frequently cited journals in the field of otorhinolaryngology. Additionally, a manual search was performed for publications in the reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles,</b> mostly those <b>of</b> a historical nature. ResultsThe etiology of the disease is still unclear. Symptoms of complications are more significant than the disease itself. Dysphagia is the most common cervical symptom and has several involved mechanisms. Other symptoms are sleep apnea, pharyngeal globus, coughing, dysphonia, dyspnea, otalgia, and medullary compression. The diagnosis is verified by appropriate radiological study. Treatment is based on a conservative strategy. Patients with refractory dysphagia and respiratory impairment can be surgically treated. ConclusionForestier’s disease should be suspected in elderly patients with the major symptoms of complications, which are common in otorhinolaryngology practice and when identified, a multidisciplinary approach should be instituted as soon as possible. © 2014 Associação Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cérvico-Facial.

40|$|Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) (also {{known as}} contrast-induced nephropathy) is an abrupt {{deterioration}} in renal function {{that can be}} associated with use of iodinated contrast medium. Although the increase in serum creatinine concentration is transient in most cases, contrast-induced AKI may lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates in selected at-risk populations. This review summarizes the findings of a multidisciplinary panel composed of computed tomography radiologists, interventional radiologists, cardiologists, and nephrologists convened to address the specialty-specific issues associated with minimizing the incidence of contrast-induced AKI. As part of this initiative, the panel developed specialty-specific protocols for preventing contrast-induced AKI, taking into account, for example, the variations in patient risk profile, inpatient or outpatient status, and staffing resources that characterize various clinical settings. The 3 protocols, each reflecting a consensus of expert opinion, address the prevention of contrast-induced AKI in interventional radiology, diagnostic computed tomography radiology, and interventional cardiology settings. The protocols are presented {{in the context of a}} review of recent guidelines and published reports of trials that discuss contrast-induced AKI and its prevention. The panel reviewed materials retrieved by a PubMed search covering the period January 1990 through January 2008 and used combinations of key words associated with the prevention and treatment of contrast-induced AKI. In addition, the panel reviewed the reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> and the tables of contents posted on the Web sites <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> journals for relevant publications not retrieved in the PubMed searches...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the utility of}} zinc transporter- 8 (ZnT 8) in the improvement of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM) diagnosis and prediction, and to explore whether ZnT 8 is a potential therapeutic target in T 1 DM. Data Sources: A search was conducted within the medical database PubMed for relevant articles published from 2001 to 2015. The search terms are as follows: "ZnT 8," "type 1 diabetes," "latent autoimmune diabetes in adults," "type 2 diabetes," "islet autoantibodies," "zinc supplement," "T cells," "β cell," "immune therapy. " We also searched the reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles.</b> Study Selection: English-language original articles and critical reviews concerning ZnT 8 and the clinical applications of islet autoantibodies in diabetes were reviewed. Results: The basic function of ZnT 8 is maintaining intracellular zinc homeostasis, which modulates the process of insulin biosynthesis, storage, and secretion. Autoantibodies against ZnT 8 (ZnT 8 A) and ZnT 8 -specific T cells are the reliable biomarkers for the identification, stratification, and characterization of T 1 DM. Additionally, {{the results from the}} animal models and clinical trials have shown that ZnT 8 is a diabetogenic antigen, suggesting the possibility of ZnT 8 -specific immunotherapy as an alternative for T 1 DM therapy. Conclusions: ZnT 8 is a novel islet autoantigen with a widely potential for clinical applications in T 1 DM. However, before the large-scale clinical applications, there are still many problems to be solved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundBipolar {{disorder}} {{is characterized by}} debilitating episodes of depression and mood elevation (mania or hypomania). For most patients, depressive symptoms are more pervasive than mood elevation or mixed symptoms, and thus {{have been reported in}} individual studies to impose a greater burden on affected individuals, caregivers, and society. This article reviews and compiles the literature on the prevalence and burden of syndromal as well as subsyndromal presentations of depression in bipolar disorder patients. MethodsThe PubMed database was searched for English-language articles using the search terms “bipolar disorder,” “bipolar depression,” “burden,” “caregiver burden,” “cost,” “costs,” “economic,” “epidemiology,” “prevalence,” “quality of life,” and “suicide. ” Search results were manually reviewed, and relevant studies were selected for inclusion as appropriate. Additional references were obtained manually from reviewing the reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> found by computerized search. ResultsIn aggregate, the findings support the predominance of depressive symptoms compared with mood elevation/mixed symptoms in the course of bipolar illness, and thus an overall greater burden in terms of economic costs, functioning, caregiver burden, and suicide. LimitationsThis review, although comprehensive, provides a study-wise aggregate (rather than a patient-wise meta-analytic) summary of the relevant literature on this topic. ConclusionIn light of its pervasiveness and prevalence, more effective and aggressive treatments for bipolar depression are warranted to mitigate its profound impact upon individuals and society. Such studies could benefit by including metrics not only for mood outcomes, but also for illness burden...|$|R
40|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} proteins (BMPs) are a {{group of}} signalling molecules that belong to the transforming growth factor-β superfamily of proteins. Initially identified {{for their ability to}} induce bone formation, recent advances in the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms regarding BMPs have led {{to the use of the}} growth factor to accelerate bone healing. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that BMPs, BMP- 7 in particular, may present an alternative line of treatment other than the gold standard, autogenous bone grafting, in the treatment of fracture nonunion. We performed a literature search in September 2014 of PubMed and Embase using search terms, including "bone morphogenetic proteins", "BMP- 7 ", "non-union", "fracture healing" and "cost-effectiveness", reviewing the efficacy, safety, and cost of treatment of nonunions with BMP- 7. The authors further canvassed the reference <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> <b>articles</b> and used online search tools, such as Google Scholar. BMP- 7 uses both the canonical and noncanonical signalling pathways. The treatment of fracture nonunion with recombinant human BMP- 7 (rhBMP- 7) has a comparable efficacy with that of autogenous bone grafting with an average union rate of 87 % compared with 93 % for bone grafting. Furthermore, fewer complications have been described with the use of rhBMP- 7 compared with traditional bone grafting. We describe the signalling pathways that BMP- 7 uses to exert its effect on bone. In nonunions, rhBMP- 7 has been shown to have a similar efficacy to bone grafting with fewer complications...|$|R
