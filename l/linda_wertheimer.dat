He wanted calm conversation, analysis and explication.’ Critics agreed that he achieved this. In 1979, Time referred to All Things Considered as ‘surely the most literate, trenchant and entertaining news program on radio.” ...|$|E
50|$|Most {{stations}} in the Central and Eastern Time zones run Morning Edition live from 05:00 to 09:00 ET, repeating one or both hours through morning drive time. Some stations run only the two hours, others run up to seven hours. The repeats are automatically fed through the NPR satellite, and are updated as necessary by NPR anchors in the studio when breaking news events occur. In the past, Edwards would stay at his NPR office until the program feeds ended at noon in case there was anything that required an update. Today, with two hosts, one host generally stays in the studio while the other does field reporting or works on stories for future shows, and the transition is seamless, unless both hosts have {{to be away from}} the studio for some reason. In that instance, substitute NPR anchors John Ydstie and <b>Linda</b> <b>Wertheimer</b> host the re-feeds.|$|E
