5000|$|Logarithmic (often {{referred}} to as <b>log)</b> <b>scales</b> {{can be a very}} valid means of representing data, however if used without clearly being labelled as so, or displayed to a reader who is unfamiliar with the concept of <b>log</b> <b>scales,</b> a graph using a <b>log</b> <b>scale</b> can be misleading. <b>Log</b> <b>scales</b> put the data values in terms of a chosen number (the base of the log) to a particular power, the base is often e (2.71828...) or 10. For example, <b>log</b> <b>scales</b> may give a height of 1 [...] "unit" [...] for a value of 10 in the data and a height of 6 [...] "units" [...] for a value of 1000000 (1x10^6) in the data. <b>Log</b> <b>scales</b> have common usage in some fields, including the VEI (volcanic explosivity index) scale or the richter scale for earthquakes, magnitudes of stars in astronomy and the pH of acidic and alkaline solutions are also based on a form of <b>log</b> <b>scale,</b> but can have the effect of making data less immediately apparent to the eye. Often the reason for the use of <b>log</b> <b>scales</b> is that the graph's author wishes to display vastly effects of vastly different scales on the same axis, without <b>log</b> <b>scales</b> comparing quantities such as 10^3 versus 10^9 becomes impractical from a visual perspective. A graph with a <b>log</b> <b>scale</b> which was not clearly labelled as such, or a graph with a <b>log</b> <b>scale</b> presented to a viewer who did not have knowledge of logarithmic scales, would generally result in a representation which made data values look of similar size whilst in fact being of widely differing magnitudes. Misuse of a <b>log</b> <b>scale</b> can make vastly different values (such as 10 and 10 thousand) appear close together (on a <b>log</b> <b>scale</b> they would be only [...] "1" [...] and [...] "4" [...] ), or it can make small values appear to be negative due {{to the way in which}} logarithmic scales represent numbers smaller than the chosen value used as their base.|$|R

40|$|Experiments in an {{extraordinary}} turbulent boundary layer called the sink flow, displaying a perfect streamwise invariance, show a wide extent of logarithmic scaling for moments of streamwise velocity up to order 12, even at moderate Reynolds numbers. This is in striking contrast to canonical constant-pressure turbulent boundary layers that show such comprehensive <b>log</b> <b>scaling</b> only at ultra-high Reynolds numbers. This demonstrates that ultra-high Reynolds number is not necessary for comprehensive <b>log</b> <b>scaling</b> to occur; while specific details of the sink flow are special, the relevance to general turbulent boundary layers is that the sink flow {{underscores the importance of}} the streamwise invariance condition that needs to be met in a general flow for obtaining <b>log</b> <b>scaling.</b> Indeed, a simple heuristic theory shows that, for <b>log</b> <b>scaling</b> in the inertial sublayer, the invariance of dimensionless mean velocity and higher-order moments along a mean streamline is a necessary and sufficient condition. Ultra-high Reynolds number primarily appears to make these log scalings universal. Comment: 05 pages (including bibliography), 03 figures (figure # 3 has three subplots...|$|R

From 1979 to 2001 head and neck injury hospital discharge rates decreased for males and females under 65 years of age an average of 4. 0 to 7. 6 percent per year (for total decreases of 60 to 82 percent), while rates for those 65 years and over decreased on average 1. 2 percent per year for males and 1. 1 percent per year for females (for total decreases of 23 and 22 percent, respectively). Generally males under 65 years of age had higher rates of head and neck injury discharges than females under 65 years of age. For nearly all years in the study period, rates for males and females 65 years and over were similar. In 2001, among males and females, traumatic brain injuries (TBI) by age accounted for 50 – 70 percent of all head and neck injuries. Hospital discharge rates for TBI were generally higher for males than for females among the 15 – 24 and the 25 – 44 age groups (Appendix tables 17 a and 18 a). TBI rates for those under 65 years of age declined. TBI discharge rates for those 65 years and over did not change significantly over the 22 years. Figure 17.
