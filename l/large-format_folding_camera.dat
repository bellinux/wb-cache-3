5000|$|A <b>folding</b> <b>camera</b> is a <b>camera</b> type. <b>Folding</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>fold</b> into {{a compact}} and rugged package for storage. The lens and shutter are {{attached}} to a lens-board which {{is connected to the}} body of the camera by a light-tight folding bellows. When the camera is fully unfolded it provides the correct focus distance from the film. The key advantage of <b>folding</b> <b>cameras</b> is their excellent physical-size to film-size ratio when the <b>camera</b> is <b>folded</b> for storage.|$|R

5000|$|The use of <b>folding</b> <b>cameras</b> {{declined}} in the late 1930s with advances in lens technology allowing superior enlargement, high quality images on smaller negatives, and shorter distances between the lens and the film. 35mm film made small-sized cameras practical without using bellows. Lens technology allowed 120/620 cameras to use shorter focal distances, and the twin lens reflex cameras became popular. However, some 35mm cameras continued to be built as <b>folding</b> <b>cameras,</b> e.g., the original Kodak Retina. Medium format folders were produced in USSR until the 1960s.|$|R

50|$|The {{introduction}} of films enabled the existing designs for plate cameras {{to be made}} much smaller and for the base-plate to be hinged {{so that it could}} be folded up compressing the bellows. These designs were very compact and small models were dubbed vest pocket <b>cameras.</b> <b>Folding</b> rollfilm <b>cameras</b> were preceded by <b>folding</b> plate <b>cameras,</b> more compact than other designs.|$|R
50|$|Portable <b>folding</b> <b>cameras</b> {{dominated}} camera design {{from the}} 1890s to 1930s and were significant {{into the late}} 1940s. Specialized cameras such as the Polaroid SX-70 Instant film camera, and the Speed Graphic press <b>cameras</b> used <b>folding</b> designs into the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Desay Madu Jhyā is {{famed for}} being {{the only one of}} its kind. While most {{traditional}} windows are bay windows carved with elaborate details, Desay Madu Jhya is a latticed window with multiple frames. Its design looks like the bellows in an old <b>folding</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the name Sonnar had been used previously by the Contessa Company for one of their <b>folding</b> <b>cameras</b> and for the Tessar-type lens fitted to it. After Contessa became part of Zeiss Ikon the name Sonnar became Zeiss’s property.|$|R
50|$|Used <b>folding</b> <b>cameras,</b> TLRs, and box {{cameras are}} also a cheap option to shoot medium format. Many U.S.-made folders, {{including}} most of the mass-produced Kodak folders use the discontinued 620 film requiring the user to respool 120 film or modify the film spool to fit.|$|R

50|$|Many Mamiya models {{over the}} past six decades have become collectors' items. The {{earliest}} Mamiya Six medium-format <b>folding</b> <b>camera,</b> the 35 mm Mamiya-Sekor 1000DTL, the lightweight 35 mm Mamiya NC1000, the 6×6 cm medium-format C series of interchangeable-lens twin-lens reflex (TLR) cameras, and the press cameras of the Super/Universal series are highly valued. Mamiya also manufactured the last models in the Omega line of medium format cameras.|$|R
50|$|Simple {{reflecting}} viewfinders comprised a small forward-looking lens, a small mirror at 45° behind it, and a lens at the top; {{the user}} held the camera at waist level {{and looked down}} into the lens, where a small image could be seen. Such viewfinders were integrated into box cameras, and fitted to the side of <b>folding</b> <b>cameras.</b> These viewfinders were fitted to inexpensive cameras.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} Zeiss Ikon {{cameras were}} {{a range of}} medium and large format <b>folding</b> <b>cameras,</b> for film and glass plate photography. The most expensive was the Universal Juwel (Jewel) an Ica designed glass plate camera with origins in 1909. This was a favorite of both Ansel Adams and Dorothea Lange. Despite German production, the folding Super Ikonta was among the mainstays of British Army photographers during WWII.|$|R

50|$|Meyer {{was born}} in Tønsberg to an {{affluent}} family. Her father gave her a Kodak <b>Folding</b> <b>Camera</b> for her travels, {{which seems to have}} led to her professional choice later. She joined the Oslo Camera Club in 1932, and then traveled to Berlin in 1937 to study photography at the Reimann School, where she studied with Walter Peterhans and Otto Croy. She worked as an apprentice for Joszef Pécsi in Budapest before returning to Norway, where she spent the war years. Meyer produced material for various publications including National Geographic Magazine and Aftenposten.|$|R
