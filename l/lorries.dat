5000|$|The PAZ {{school bus}} met a Scania wood <b>lorry</b> at the 3rd {{kilometre}} of Sõõru - Nõva road, a narrow unpaved road. Having noticed each other, the drivers chose different strategies: {{the school bus}} driver, driving at a low speed, kept {{to the right side}} of the road in order to give the <b>lorry</b> more space to pass; the <b>lorry,</b> driving at about 70 - 80 km/h, began the manœuvre by braking heavily. On the unpaved road, braking led to cross-road oscillation of the <b>lorry,</b> leading the <b>lorry</b> driver to worry about a risk of falling off the road. The <b>lorry</b> driver compensated by temporarily unbraking and turning sharply left—towards the axis of the road—at an unfortunate time, leading the <b>lorry</b> to drive into the school bus at an angle of about 30 degrees. In the collision, the <b>lorry</b> [...] "skinned" [...] off the school bus' left side, killing 8 students born in 1982 - 1986.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, in {{the area}} to the east of the Jordan River garrisoned by the Ottoman Fourth Army, two Bristol Fighters {{reporting}} early in the day all Ottoman camps {{in the area}}, were quiet. After attacking a mass of cavalry at Ain es Sir they returned to base by flying over the Wadi Fara road. Here they dropped their remaining bombs on a column of 50 motor <b>lorries,</b> moving eastwards along the road towards the Jisr ed Damieh bridge over the Jordan River. A direct hit on one of the <b>lorries</b> blocked the road and in the late afternoon another two Bristol Fighters continued this attack.|$|E

5|$|On establishment, {{the force}} {{consisted}} of one mounted division, one infantry brigade and four infantry battalions (equivalent {{to a second}} infantry brigade without brigade support troops or a command structure), five batteries, six sections of artillery and transport consisting of 20 <b>lorries,</b> 17 tractors, 34 trucks, 300 donkeys, 11,000 horses and mules. Eight days later an additional 70 donkeys, 65 <b>lorries</b> in the 1040 Motor Transport Company, 110 camels in 'M' Company Camel Transport Corps, were added.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. The main components were sourced from well-established suppliers. VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver's seat was positioned {{close to the}} door, to ease reversing. The seat had several {{ways in which it}} could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in <b>lorries</b> by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles. Two-axle <b>lorries</b> were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E

5|$|General manager Kytölä {{travelled}} to France and West Germany in 1947 {{and early}} 1948 to buy military surplus {{materials from the}} Western Allies. He bought 425 White Motor Company M2 Half-Track vehicles, 186 lorry engines, 304 Cadillac V8 engines, 4 Mack ED diesel engines, 2 Hercules Diesel DFXE engines, 11,000 GMC wheels and one 45-tonne-capacity trailer. Trading was organised through the Ministry of Supply and the first delivery arrived in March 1948. The White Half-Track vehicles were without armour; Kytölä's idea was to equip them with superstructures for field or forest clearing, or to convert them into Four-wheel drive <b>lorries</b> by replacing the tracks with a conventional rear axle. In total, VAT sold 359 units as half-tracks, and 60 were converted into 4×4 or 4×2 vehicles. These <b>lorries</b> were sold as Vanaja VaWh. Some of the half-track vehicles were scrapped for parts; the last was sold in 1952.|$|E
5|$|VAT {{signed a}} {{contract}} to sell 200 <b>lorries</b> to Turkey in 1959. The first two vehicles were shipped from Finland in 1959 but the contract was terminated in an embarrassing way because the Bank of Finland refused to take Turkish liras in payment.|$|E
5|$|A {{programme}} of work {{is scheduled}} {{to take place in}} 2018 to replace expansion joints in both towers along with replacing the truss end links. Plans to replace these joints were postponed by the bridge management following the Scottish Government's commitment to the construction of the Queensferry Crossing; the original work proposals would have involved round-the-clock contraflows during the installation of ramps and mini-bridges to carry traffic over the work area, and heavy <b>lorries</b> being diverted.|$|E

5|$|As well {{as being}} a small producer, VAT had {{problems}} with unreliable deliveries and quality problems caused by the component suppliers. Semi-finished <b>lorries</b> often waited outside the factory for engines or other key components. The British diesel engines suffered from more quality problems compared with their Swedish and German competitors. The company's owners became increasingly reluctant to fund the unprofitable business.|$|E
5|$|Coal was {{transported by}} canal and a railway {{connection}} to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Beswick branch built in the early 1900s, {{but most of it}} was used locally, transported by road using horse and carts and motor <b>lorries,</b> much of it destined for the adjacent Bradford Ironworks. The company bought a 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive, Bradford, from the Avonside Engine Company of Bristol in 1928 to shunt wagons to the colliery siding.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, VAT {{delivered}} the first Vanaja VAKS <b>lorries,</b> which were intended for general use in garrisons, to the Defence Forces. The later versions were called AS-33. 155 units were produced. Vanaja NS-47 {{was the first}} Finnish 4×4 off-road lorry designed primarily for military use. A few dozen vehicles were ordered between 1962 and 1964, and were used for hauling 35 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons and heavy artillery.|$|E

5|$|The initial toll {{for cars}} was 3s (15p) {{for a single}} journey across the bridge, or 4/6 (22½p) for a return, while for <b>lorries</b> it was 14s (70p) and £1 respectively. The Saltash Ferry closed, but the Torpoint Ferry {{remained}} in operation; management of the ferry and the bridge is shared so the two crossings are not in direct competition with each other.|$|E
5|$|To help counter these effects, in 2012 {{the various}} Chamonix-Mont Blanc {{authorities}} introduced a climate and energy action plan, committing {{the region to}} a 22% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. The plan included proposals to improve air quality by banning those <b>lorries</b> from using the Mont Blanc Tunnel which were deemed {{to be the most}} polluting and which, at times, had reduced air quality to levels more usually associated with the streets of Paris.|$|E
5|$|At Nazareth, {{the initial}} {{attack by the}} Gloucester Hussars was {{strongly}} opposed during street fighting. The Congestion created by prisoners was increased by numerous German <b>lorries</b> parked along the narrow streets. As they were continuing their attack, the Gloucester Hussars were fired on by machine guns from the buildings on the high ground to the north-west and from balconies and windows. At 08:00 the Gloucester Hussars were reinforced by two squadrons and three troops of the 18th Lancers followed by a squadron of the 9th Hodson's Horse. They were subsequently counter-attack by German office workers who, despite being almost annihilated by the 13th Cavalry Brigade's machine guns, held off the British cavalry attack.|$|E
50|$|On 15 September 1948 a {{passenger}} train {{consisting of a}} tank engine and two coaches travelling 30 mph collided at an accommodation crossing with a Ford <b>lorry</b> carrying Poles and Hungarians {{going to work on}} a farm. As a result of the <b>lorry</b> running into the path of the train, three of the <b>lorry</b> passengers were killed and six others seriously injured, including the British driver. The train had minimal damage. The inquest recorded that the accident was caused by lack of caution by the <b>lorry</b> driver, noted that the view at the crossing point was very poor, and that the driver may not have heard the train's whistle over the noise of the <b>lorry</b> engine.|$|R

With the average age of <b>lorry</b> drivers in the UK being 53 and not enough younger drivers joining the industry it is predicted that if nothing is done by 2020 the industry will be 60,000 <b>lorry</b> drivers short.|$|R
