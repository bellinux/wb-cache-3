For moderate force, if the polymer elongation is small, the hydrodynamic interactions are not screened and the velocity and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>elongation</b> of the polymer are computed using the renormalization group method. Both the velocity and elongation are nonlinear functions of the driving force in this regime. For large elongation we found two regimes. For large force but finite chain length $L$ the hydrodynamic interactions are screened.

We studied the {{longitudinal}} growth of the short bones in {{the hand of a}} 15 -yr-old girl with PHP type Ia who had been followed for congenital hypothyroidism. Radiographs of the hand of the patient, who had been X-rayed every year since 2 yr of age, were studied. She showed cone-shaped epiphyses of the hand at 2 yr of age before showing brachydactyly. At 4 yr of age, she showed brachydactyly and an advanced bone age, and some short bones were prematurely fused at 6 yr of age. The short bones without cone-shaped epiphyses were also short {{as a result of a}} disturbance of the <b>longitudinal</b> bone <b>elongation.</b> In conclusion, the brachydactyly of PHP type Ia is thus considered to be caused by both early epiphyseal fusion with cone-shaped epiphyses and a disturbance of the <b>longitudinal</b> bone <b>elongation.</b> Key words: brachydactyly, longitudinal study, PHP type Ia, cone-shaped epiphyses, childre...|$|R
40|$|The {{transverse}} and longitudinal {{tensile properties}} of the oxide dispersion strengthened nickel-base alloys were determined at 760 C. The alloys with small amounts of gamma prime have strength levels suitable for turbine vane applications, while other highly alloyed, gamma prime strengthened superalloys have strengths typical of turbine blade materials. These alloys were produced by mechanical alloying and extrusion and the turbine blade alloys were also directionally recrystallized. Resultant grain aspect ratios varied from 1 : 1 to over 20 : 1.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} study was to develop and {{validate}} a method based on medical imaging to identify the parameters of a hyper-viscoelastic model suitable for describing the mechanical behavior of vascular tissues, focusing on the aorta. The method uses an inflation-extension test, and the model comprises one hyperelastic element in parallel with one or more Maxwell elements. Cylindrical samples of elastomeric silicone materials with a mechanical behavior similar to vascular tissues were placed in a circuit simulating hemodynamic flow through adequate controlled-pressure variation. Ultrasound B-mode image sequences were analyzed to measure the cyclic circumferential and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>elongations.</b> Precautions were taken a posteriori to resynchronize pressure and deformation signals, and thus minimize errors in the viscosity parameters estimated. The hyper-viscoelastic parameters of the samples were identified with reasonable accuracy as compared with the values obtained via standard measurements, namely tensile tests and dynamic mechanical analysis. However, the estimates of the viscosity parameters can be hampered in the case of stiffer samples. This limitation is bound to a restricted range of frequencies analyzed by the test, which mainly depends on the image acquisition rate. The use of the present method in the clinical environment for in vivo experiments can be foreseen provided that the local pressure measurements are available...|$|R

Although smoke signals {{have been known}} to break seed dormancy, whether they also affect seedling establishment and root development remains unclear. In order to test this, seedlings were treated with smoke solutions. Seedlings responded in a dose-dependent manner with significantly increased primary root lengths, due mainly to <b>longitudinal</b> cell <b>elongation,</b> increased numbers of lateral roots and impaired root hair development. Bioassay-driven fractionations and NMR were used to identify catechol as the main active compound for the smoke-induced root phenotype. The transcriptome analysis revealed that mainly genes related to auxin biosynthesis and redox homeostasis were altered after catechol treatment. However, histochemical analyses of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the inability of auxin applications to rescue the phenotype clearly indicated that highly localized changes in the root's redox-status, rather than in levels of auxin, are the primary effector. Moreover, H 2 O 2 application rescued the phenotype in a dose-dependent manner. Chemical cues in smoke not only initiate seed germination, but also influence seedling root growth; understanding how these cues work provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which plants adapt to post-fire environments...|$|R

40|$|Magnetostriction is a {{remarkable}} non-linear phenomenon which causes shape (and size) variations of a magnetized ferromagnet in response to different magnetic configurations. Its essence falls in the wide realm of magneto-elastic coupling and it is put to advantage in {{a wide array of}} technical applications. In fact, until recent times, nickel magnetostriction was successfully employed in sensing devices to capture acoustic and generally mechanical waves [p. 627 ff]Bozorth. It was indeed by studying a Nickel sample that, in 1842, James Joule discovered magnetostriction. From the theoretical standpoint, magneto-elastic (and electro-elastic) coupling provides an excellent example of a solid endowed with a vector microstructure Toupin, Brown 2, Tiersten. Yet microstructure, with its extra balance equations, is not the only interesting feature about magneto-elastic coupling. Indeed, microstructure interacts on a global scale, which means that a non-local theory is to be dealt with. Even more significant, owing {{to the nature of the}} magnetic phenomenon, the integral terms which account for the non-local character of the magnetic action may be improper or even singular (i. e. Cauchy-type), inside the material body (they are indeed potentials). From this property stems a number of important consequences, ranging from the need of two vector fields to fully describe the magnetic action inside magnetized matter (often named magnetic induction and magnetic field) to a substantial change in the character of the tension vector-to-unit normal relation Brown 2. Although much study has been devoted to magneto-elastic coupling Brown 1, Moonbook, Pao, Ogden, its treatment provides outstanding difficulties both from the theoretical and from the numerical standpoint. For the most part, available solutions cover the case of the so called para- or dia-magnetic materials Moon,Wallerstein, whose simplified magnetic constitutive law is responsible for different and conflicting force expressions Nobili,Zhou. The greatest source of trouble is the non-local nature of the interaction mixed with the potential-type nature of the integrals, which sets powerful numerical methods at a loss. In this contribution, a hard ferromagnetic thin-film beam-plate theory is described, whose greatest asset lies in leading to a system of ordinary nonlinear integro-differential equations, which may be tackled through some carefully deployed numerical techniques Nobili 2. The model was originally developed in Nobili for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>elongations.</b> The key step lays in matching the Euler [...] Bernoulli constrained kinematics with Maxwell equations in a layout where the magnetization vector is bound to follow the beam-plate axis (latent microstructure). Such treatment allows both the mechanical and magnetic problem to be reduced to a one-dimensional form. This outcome is obtained at the expense of letting the magnetization vector vary only along the longitudinal co-ordinate, which approximation, although severe from the domain-theory standpoint, is justified in a beam-theory spirit (and it is consistent with the traditional magnetic circuit approach). Furthermore, it allows involved constitutive laws to be dispensed with, whose major drawback lays in the difficulty of carrying through experimental results to numerically evaluate coupling coefficients...|$|R

Yet, {{the precise}} mechanisms {{of the earliest}} changes in tissue properties that characterize myocardial relaxation remain incompletely understood. Ten healthy volunteers (seven males), 25 - 43 yr, underwent tagged and cine MRI with high temporal resolution (25 - 35 ms). Normal strains including radial (E(rr)), circumferential (E(cc)), and longitudinal (E(ll)) strains, shear strains including E(cl) (circumferential-longitudinal), E(cr) (circumferential-radial), and E(rl) (radial-longitudinal), and principal strains (E(1), E(2), and E(3)) were calculated using a displacement field-fitting method. Temporal changes in angular strains indicative of shear and torsion release and normal strains were studied during late systole and early relaxation. The onset of individual relaxation strains was heterogeneous relative to LV filling. Shear strains (E(cr), E(rl), and E(cl)) and radial thinning were first to develop. Times of onset of E(cr), E(rl), E(cl), and E(rr) occurred 108, 93, 67, and 73 ms before aortic valve closure, respectively.

Here, we estimated in vivo deformations of the human AT during walking using simultaneous ultrasound and motion capture measurements. Ten subjects walked at three speeds (0. 75, 1. 00, and 1. 25 m/s) on a force-measuring treadmill. A custom orthotic secured a linear array transducer in two locations: (1) the distal lateral gastrocnemius muscle-tendon junction and (2) the free AT, on average centered 6 cm superior to calcaneal insertion. We used motion capture to record lower extremity kinematics and the position and orientation of the ultrasound transducer. A 2 D ultrasound elastography algorithm tracked superficial and deep tissue displacements within the free AT. We estimated AT elongation (i. e., change in length) relative to the calcaneal insertion by transforming the orthotic, transducer, and calcaneus kinematics into a common reference frame. Superficial and deep regions of the free AT underwent significantly different <b>longitudinal</b> displacements and <b>elongations</b> during walking. For example, we found that the superficial AT exhibited 16 - 29 % greater peak elongation than the deep AT during the stance phase of walking (p < 0. 01). Moreover, superficial-deep AT tissue deformations became less uniform with faster walking speed (p < 0. 01). Non-uniform deformations of the free AT, which could reflect inter-fascicle sliding, may enable the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to transmit their forces independently while allowing unique kinematic behavior at the muscle fiber level. status: publishe...|$|R

The deduced protein encoded by the cDNA contains a FH 1 domain rich in proline residues and a C-terminal FH 2 domain which is highly conserved amongst FH proteins. In contrast to FH proteins of other organisms, the predicted AFH 1 protein also contains a putative signal peptide and a transmem-brane domain suggesting its association with membrane. Cell fractionation by differential centrifugation demon-strated the presence of AFH 1 in the Triton X- 100 insoluble microsomal fraction. An Arabidopsis cDNA library was screened to identify proteins that interact with the C-ter-minal region of AFH 1 using yeast two-hybrid assays, and one of the isolated cDNAs encoded a novel protein, FIP 2. Experiments using recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli demonstrated that FIP 2 interacted directly with AFH 1. The amino acid sequence of FIP 2 has partial homology to bacterial putative membrane proteins and animal A-type K+ ATPases. AFH 1 may form a membrane anchored complex with FIP 2, which might be involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Key words: Actin — Cytoskeleton — FH protein — Membrane protein.

40|$|In {{order to}} fill the lack of {{knowledge}} about slender elements behavior at elevated temperatures, a European research project called FIDESC 4 has been funded by the RFCS. This project involves experimental testing, parametric numerical analyses and development of simple design rules. The present paper reports the characteristics and the results of the FIDESC 4 experimental test campaign performed at the University of Liege on slender steel columns at elevated temperatures. A total of eight columns have been tested, all of them with I shape section. Six columns were made of welded sections (some prismatic and some tapered members) and two columns were with hot rolled sections. The nominal length of the columns was 3 meters with the whole length being heated. The strength of the material (webs and flanges) was measured on sample before the tests. The order of magnitude of the initial geometrical imperfections was recorded. The columns were not restrained against <b>longitudinal</b> thermal <b>elongation.</b> The supports at the ends were cylindrical thus inducing a restrain against rotation in one plane while allowing rotation in the other plane. The allowed direction of rotation was chosen in each test to induce buckling around the strong or the weak axis. The load was applied at ambient temperature and maintained for a period of 15 minutes after which the temperature was increased under constant load. The load was applied concentrically on some tests and with an eccentricity in other tests. The load eccentricity was either applied at both ends, leading to constant bending moment distribution along the length, or at one end only, leading to a triangular bending moment distribution. Heating was applied by electrical resistances enclosed in ceramic pads. The columns and the ceramic pads were wrapped in ceramic wool insulating material. This technique was preferred to gas heating in a standard test furnace because it allows applying a slower and better controlled heating rate and thus obtaining a more uniform temperature distribution in the member. It is also easier to measured lateral displacements of the column. Preliminary blank tests were performed on unloaded specimen {{in order to determine the}} heating range to be used later on the loaded columns. The paper will also report on a modification of the heating technique that was applied and improved significantly the uniformity in the temperature distribution. Numerical simulations were performed before the tests using shell elements of the software SAFIR and assumed values of the material properties in order to predict the failure modes. It was essentially crucial to determine whether lateral supports at intermediate levels should be provided in order to ensure failure in the desired direction. Experience showed that the failure modes developed as predicted by the numerical simulations. Besides a thorough description of the experiments, the paper will also present the obtained results in terms of failure mode, ultimate temperature and evolution of longitudinal and transverse displacement.

The shape errors of simulated results show that the forming precision of the 08 Al sheet is better than that of the 2024 -O sheet, but all the deviations of the forming parts are less than 2. 0 mm excluding the head and tail regions of the forming parts in rolling direction...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{deformation}} of a composite hard ferromagnetic-elastic beam-plate structure is investigated. A sandwich structure, {{composed of two}} thin hard ferromagnetic layers, with a linear elastic lay-er in between, is considered. The deformation {{is due to the}} self generated magnetic field (magnetostriction). The aim is to assess the interaction forces among the perfectly bonded layers, through a consistent application of the classical nonlinear magneto-elastic theory. Once the general mechanical model is stated, the analysis is specialized to study <b>longitudinal</b> <b>elongation,</b> given its great relevance in technical applications. Owing to the non-local character of the magnetic action, a nonlinear integro-differential equation is derived. Some qualitative properties of the solution are pointed out and the asymptotic behavior near the end sections is examined in detail. A finite differences approach allows writing an approximating nonlinear system of equations in the non asymptotic part of the solution, which is solved through a Newton's iterative scheme. The numerical results are discussed and it is shown how the asymptotic part of the solution well approximates the full behavior of the structure. Furthermore, the longitudinal interaction force density is found to be singular at the end cross-sections, regardless of the assumed bonding type...|$|E
30|$|In general, it was {{expected}} that more QTLs for target traits with a mapping population derived from two contrasting parents would be detected (Bai et al. 2010). In our study, the mapping population derived from PYZX and P 02428 showed an extremely wide diversity in rice grain shape and chalkiness traits, thus it was ideal for identification of main and minor effect QTL. Using single environment analysis, 109 and 27 QTLs associated with grain shape and chalkiness were detected respectively. Among these, 58 (53.2  %) of the QTLs for grain shape were detected in two or more environments whereas only 6 (22.2  %) of the chalkiness-related QTLs were observed in more than one of the environments (Additional file 1 : Table S 3). This confirmed that chalkiness was considerably affected by environment and exhibited a pattern of instability, whereas rice grain shape was fixed as long as the panicle was normally differentiated and mainly controlled by genotype and had higher heritability (Bai et al. 2010). GS 3, which is reported as a major QTL for grain length and weight and a minor QTL for grain width and thickness in rice, encodes a putative transmembrane protein. It was located on the qGS 3.2 region in our QTL analysis, which was recurrent across four environments for GL, LWR, CS, PL and AS, showing the most stable expression and pleiotropic effects (Fan et al. 2006). The reported QTL of GL 7 (Wang et al. 2015 b) regulates <b>longitudinal</b> cell <b>elongation</b> and results in an increase in grain length and improvement of grain appearance quality. In our study, GL 7 was detected in the QTL region of qGS 7.2 (associated with CS, GW, LWR, PL and GL) and also displayed consistent heredity and pleiotropism. Similarly, we detected a new QTL cluster of qGS 5.2 associated with GW, LWR, CS and AS with high PVE levels and stable performance across multiple environments, representing potential targets for gene cloning. In addition, there were some new-found important QTL clusters, such as qGS 3.1 associated with AS, PL, CS, GL and LWR, qGS 7.1 associated with CS, LWR, GL and PL, and qPGWC 8 (qDEC 8) associated with PGWC and DEC, which offer an opportunity for improving grain appearance in rice for the future. As the main grain quality related traits, we intend to develop backcrossing introgression lines of the novel QTLs in the background of elite high-yielding varieties which should be useful to improve the grain quality. “Consumer-Targeted Rice Breeding” is emphasized especially in the rice quality area, and the grain shape QTLs should been utilized based on the specificity of consumer preference (Calingacion et al. 2014). The stable QTLs across multiple environments gained in this study enable incorporation of favorable alleles into agronomically superior germplasm by using technology of MAS combined with backcrossing method. Moreover, grain appearance quality had a close relation with milling quality (Lou et al. 2009). And milling yield of short and medium grain rice is typically higher than long grain rice (Kepiro et al. 2008). QTLs associated to more grain shape parameters (including GW, GL, LWR, CS, PL, and AS) had been analysis in this study, and different effects of the alterable combinations of target QTLs could probably strike a balance between grain shape and milling trait. In our practice, MAS have being performing by introgression of multiple QTL alleles of low chalk and grain length (preferred by local consumers of south China) into the elite restorer lines (R) and maintainer lines (B) in our lab, with the aim of improving the grain quality characters in hybrid rice.|$|R
40|$|The {{glenohumeral}} joint {{is the most}} dislocated major joint in the body; however despite such {{a high rate of}} injury, the proper treatment protocol remains unclear. Rehabilitation has proved to be insufficient with an 80 % chance of redislocation in teenagers and 10 - 15 % chance after the age of 40. Following surgical repair, nearly 25 % of patients still experience redislocation and complain of joint stiffness and osteoarthritis. In an attempt to improve these results, the normal function of the glenohumeral capsule has been evaluated using both experimental and computational methods. Recent data (strain and force patterns) suggests that the capsule functions multiaxially. Therefore, simple uniaxial methods may not be sufficient to fully characterize the tissue and identify the appropriate constitutive model of the tissue. Inconclusive data has been presented in the literature regarding the collagen fiber architecture and the mechanical properties of the capsule that make it unclear whether the capsule is an isotropic or a transversely isotropic material. For instance, the collagen fiber architecture has been shown by one researcher to be randomly distributed, while another researcher reported the fibers to be aligned. In addition, the axillary pouch {{has been shown to be}} the primary stabilizer of the {{glenohumeral joint}} in positions of extreme external rotation while the posterior region of the capsule has been shown to stabilize the joint in positions of extreme internal rotation. The rate of dislocations, however, is more frequent in the position of external rotation. Therefore, the overall objective of this work was to utilize a combined experimental - computational methodology to characterize the mechanical properties of the axillary pouch and posterior region of the glenohumeral capsule. Using an isotropic constitutive model, the stress-stretch relationship of the axillary pouch and posterior regions in response to two perpendicular tensile and finite simple shear elongations showed no statistical difference. Further, the constitutive coefficients of pure tensile and simple finite shear elongations in the direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the anterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament (longitudinal) were able to predict the response of the same tissue sample in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the anterior band (transverse). These similarities between the <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse <b>elongations</b> of the tissue imply that the capsule is an isotropic material and functions to resist dislocation the same in all directions, rather than just along the longitudinal axis of the anterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament, as previously thought. Further, the coefficients of the axillary pouch and posterior regions of the capsule showed no statistical difference, suggesting that these regions have similar mechanical properties, despite a difference in geometry. Thus, when developing finite element models of the glenohumeral capsule, an isotropic constitutive model should be utilized; and both the axillary pouch and posterior regions could be evaluated using the same coefficients. However, due to discrepancies when comparing the constitutive coefficients of tensile and shear elongations, an update to the constitutive model is required. With the proper representation of the glenohumeral capsule known, finite element models can be developed to pursue the understanding of normal joint function, including the effects of age and gender, as well as injured and surgically repaired joints...|$|R
40|$|Bridges are an {{important}} element of the infrastructure today. The technical competence has reached high levels in most countries and the limits given to a bridge designer are set by economic restrictions rather than technical skill. The ever lasting chase for more economic solutions and procedures includes both a wish for cheaper constructions as well as for a decrease in the following maintenance costs. The roller bearings used in conventional bridges are known to generate high costs both during construction and due to maintenance, and the possibility to remove these bearings and accompanying expansion joints are therefore investigated since several years. In Sweden, the absence of bridges built with integral abutments has made it difficult to test and evaluate this solution. In 2005, an international project called Intab was launched with the explicit aim to look at different solutions possible to use if joints and bearings are excluded. One of the most common discussed problems concerning bridges built without expansion joints is the accommodation of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>elongation</b> due to temperature variations. A bridge built with integral abutments is often supported by piles made of steel or concrete. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>elongation</b> of the superstructure induces a displacement and a moment in these piles, which in time may cause a fatigue failure. Therefore it is of big interest to look at the amplitude of these strains. Within the Intab project, a pilot object was built in Nordmaling, ~ 50 km south of Umeå. It is a 40 meter long and 5 meter wide composite bridge with two steel girders and a concrete deck. The steel piles in this bridge is equipped with strain gauges who are used both for longterm and shortterm measurements. The sampled data from longterm measurement is collected on a computer on site, and then downloaded through a traditional modem. The data from the shortterm measurement is sampled and collected immediately during the test. The shortterm test is performed during both summer and winter conditions, and consists of a lorry passing the bridge while different measurements are done. The result from the measurement is also compared to calculations and a 2 -D FE-model. It seems that short-term measurements performed during warmer months, May and October, show better agreement with the FE-simulations than the tests performed during the winter. The used FE-model is based on restrictions from Bro 2004. Regarding the long-term measurements, the obtained strain values are not in a range where fatigue can be considered as a severe problem.
