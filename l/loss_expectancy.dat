This study estimates the life <b>expectancy</b> <b>loss</b> attributable to the premature death of individuals who initially survived gun-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States. Design: Interpersonal TBI data were drawn from a surveillance system, and self-inflicted TBI data {{were obtained from the}} Web-based Injury Statistics and Reporting System. SCI data were obtained from a national database. Multiple decrement analysis was used to calculate the days of life lost to gunshot wounds to the brain and spinal cord, by race and gender, in the United States. Results: On average, across age, gender, and race, life expectancy in the United States is reduced by 3. 1 days because of the shorter lifespan for individuals who survive an initial gunshot wound to the brain or spinal cord. Black males bear a disproportionate burden, losing 9. 5 days, whereas white males lose 4. 6 days. Black and white females lose 1. 5 and 1. 0 days, respectively. Conclusions: We add these findings to the Lemaire study, resulting in a total of 106. 7 days of life <b>expectancy</b> <b>loss</b> from gunshot wounds for the U.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patients with limited-stage Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (HL) undergo frequent posttreatment surveillance CT examinations, raising {{concerns about}} the cumulative magnitude of radiation exposure. The {{purpose of this study}} was to project radiation-induced cancer risks relative to competing risks of HL and account for the differential timing of each. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adapted a previously developed Markov model to project lifetime mortality risks and life <b>expectancy</b> <b>losses</b> due to HL versus radiation-induced cancers in HL patients undergoing surveillance CT. In the base case, we modeled 35 -year-old men and women undergoing seven CT examinations of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis over 5 years. Radiation-induced cancer risks and deaths for 17 organ systems were modeled using an organ-specific approach, accounting for specific anatomy exposed at CT. Cohorts of 20 -, 50 -, and 65 -year-old men and women were evaluated in secondary analyses. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate the uncertainty of radiation risk projections. RESULTS: For 35 -year-old adults, we projected 3324 / 100, 000 (men) and 3345 / 100, 000 (women) deaths from recurrent lymphoma and 245 / 100, 000 (men, 95 % uncertainty interval [UI]: 121 - 369) and 317 / 100, 000 (women, 95 % UI: 202 - 432) radiation-induced cancer deaths. Discrepancies in life <b>expectancy</b> <b>losses</b> between HL (428 days in men, 482 days in women) and radiation-induced cancers (11. 6 days in men, [95 % UI: 5. 7 - 17. 5], 15. 6 days in women [95 % UI: 9. 8 - 21. 4]) were proportionately greater because of the delayed timing of radiation-induced cancers relative to recurrent HL. Deaths and life <b>expectancy</b> <b>losses</b> from radiation-induced cancers were highest in the youngest cohorts. CONCLUSION: Given the low rate of radiation-induced cancer deaths associated with CT surveillance, modest CT benefits would justify its use in patients with limited-stage HL...|$|R

Major advances in treatment of type 1 diabetes have occurred in the past 3 decades. Contemporary estimates of the effect of type 1 diabetes on life expectancy are needed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} life expectancy, {{standardized}} mortality ratios (SMRs), and {{causes of death}} in 6 groups of patients from Hong Kong with different rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), systemic vasculitis (SV), or systemic sclerosis (SSc) registered in 37 public hospitals between 1999 and 2008 were identified in the hospital registry. SMRs were calculated by comparing the mortality rate in patients with each disease with that in the general population. Life expectancy was calculated by abridged life-table analysis, and the causes of death were compared. RESULTS: In 2008, data on 8, 367 RA, 5, 243 SLE, 2, 154 AS, 1, 636 SV, 778 PsA, and 449 SSc patients were available in our registry. The age- and sex-adjusted SMRs were highest for SLE (5. 25 [95 % confidence interval 4. 79 - 5. 70]), SSc (3. 94 [95 % confidence interval 3. 20 - 4. 68]), and SV (2. 64 [95 % confidence interval 2. 36 - 2. 93]). In female patients, the <b>loss</b> in life <b>expectancy</b> was greatest for SSc (34. 1 years), SV (19. 3 years), and SLE (19. 7 years). In male patients, the <b>loss</b> in life <b>expectancy</b> was highest for SV (28. 3 years), SLE (27 years), and SSc (16 years). There were 2, 486 deaths {{during the study period}} (1999 - 2008), and the principal causes were infections (28 %), cardiovascular complications (18 %), cancer (16 %), and disease activity (7 %). Infection was {{the leading cause of death}} in SLE, RA, AS, and PsA, whereas deaths from disease-related activity and cardiovascular complications were most frequent in SSc. Cancer was the most common cause of death in SV. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that patients with SLE, RA, AS, PsA, SV, and SSc have increased mortality rates and reduced life expectancy. SLE has the highest adjusted SMR, and female SSc patients have the greatest <b>loss</b> in life <b>expectancy.</b> Infection is the leading cause of death, followed by cardiovascular complications and malignancies. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|Each {{presented}} pattern {{consisted of}} a 2 trial learning phase with mixed win–loss feedback, with a subsequent period of 6 – 15 consistent wins based on randomly determined length of pattern repetition and participant performance. This consistent period was designed to increase expectancy of win feedback during the period, the middle trial of which was taken to represent the high expectancy win trial. Participants were given a loss feedback to signal a pattern shift and represented the high <b>expectancy</b> <b>loss</b> trial. The subsequent trials in which participants were guessing the new pattern consisted of both win and loss feedback, which represented the low expectancy win and low <b>expectancy</b> <b>loss</b> trials. Variation between number of trials per pattern and selection of the middle pattern trial was conducted to prevent the possible confound of the participants expecting a pattern shift in later win trials and thus demonstrating decreasing win expectancy as pattern shifts became more likely due to {{a high number of}} consistent wins. Thirty pattern shifts were presented with an average number of 13 trials per pattern and a total task time of approximately 45.5  min, with five breaks following each 6 pattern shifts for SAM scale completion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The age {{at death}} from {{different}} diseases is a good indicator of their relative importance at the population level. METHODS: Use {{was made of the}} mortality data provided by the Flemish Community of Belgium on all deaths, WHO ICD- 10 coded, for the period 2000 - 2004. RESULTS: The mean {{age at death}} increases with time for nearly all diseases and for both sexes. This increase is highly significant for all-cause mortality. Deaths due to accidents and suicide cause the greatest <b>loss</b> of life <b>expectancy</b> for the individuals concerned. From the disease groups liver cirrhosis, lung and breast cancer have the greatest impact on life expectancy. Women die at higher ages than men for all diseases except lung cancer. They have a highly significantly greater <b>loss</b> of life <b>expectancy</b> due to lung cancer than men. The mean age at death during the period considered increases markedly for breast cancer (p< 0. 0001). This suggests an increased efficiency of both treatment and prevention of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Studying the mean age at death from different pathologies is an efficient and rapid way to evaluate the relative importance of different diseases and the changes in the health situation in a given population.

One way to test for selection bias is to determine whether baseline characteristics and participants’ outcomes predict dropout.
