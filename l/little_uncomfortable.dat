500|$|Mitch Pileggi was {{disappointed}} {{in the fact that}} the episode featured his character, Walter Skinner, getting beat up, something which had occurred in multiple episodes already by this point: [...] "I was feeling a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> with him getting his ass kicked so much, and I think the fans were, too." [...] Dave Grohl, the lead singer and guitarist of the Foo Fighters and former drummer for Nirvana, made a small cameo, along with his then-wife Jennifer Youngblood, in the episode during the scene wherein Modell sneaks into the FBI building. Grohl, who has an active interest in UFO lore, called the episode [...] "his acting debut".|$|E
500|$|At the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, Colbert, the {{featured}} guest, described President Bush's thought processes using {{the definition of}} truthiness. Editor and Publisher used [...] "truthiness" [...] to describe Colbert's criticism of Bush, {{in an article published}} the same day titled [...] "Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner—President Not Amused?" [...] E reported that the [...] "blistering comedy 'tribute' to President Bush ... left George and Laura Bush unsmiling at its close" [...] and that many people at the dinner [...] "looked a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> at times, perhaps feeling the material was a little too biting—or too much speaking 'truthiness' to power". E reported a few days later that its coverage of Colbert at the dinner drew [...] "possibly its highest one-day traffic total ever", and published {{a letter to the editor}} asserting that [...] "Colbert brought truth wrapped in truthiness". On the same weekend, The Washington Post and others also reported on the event. Six months later, in a column titled [...] "Throw The Truthiness Bums Out", The New York Times columnist Frank Rich called Colbert's after-dinner speech a [...] "cultural primary" [...] and christened it the [...] "defining moment" [...] of the United States' 2006 midterm elections.|$|E
500|$|The {{repercussions of}} the {{euthanasia}} for Dot's character {{have been described}} as [...] "extremely serious" [...] as she suffered from [...] "untold guilt and felt that she needed to be punished for the action." [...] The Executive Producer overseeing this storyline, John Yorke, has discussed the storyline in a speech given at the Bishops' Conference for clergy and other ministers in the Diocese of St Albans: [...] "Dot, as a good Christian, refused to help, until her love for her friend overcame her own fear of damnation. Riddled with an intolerable burden of guilt, she felt there was only one person she could talk to [...] The Dot and Ethel storyline played out in over four months with many similar scenes, to an average audience of 16 million viewers. Dot [...] explored the full panoply of religious belief before coming back to terms with her maker. When Alan Bookbinder took over as head of religious broadcasting at the BBC he described EastEnders for the weeks the Dot and Ethel story ran as 'the best religious programme on television' and compared [...] to Graham Greene. While we felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> in such exalted company, what it did show is that handled properly an audience is able to engage in, and relate to profound ethical debate." ...|$|E

500|$|Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV deemed [...] "Funk" [...] {{a bridge}} between [...] "Theatricality" [...] and the season finale, writing: [...] "It feels like the episode got itself in a funk, and when things get close to being awesome, it pulls back." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 6.8/10 for [...] "Passable", but deemed it the weakest episode of Glee thus far, while Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "just one big funked-up mess." [...] Broadway World Mary Hanrahan felt that: [...] "While [...] "Funk" [...] had some redeeming, even charming, moments, it did nothing {{to make up for}} the perplexing episode that preceded it and {{ultimately}} left much to be desired." [...] In contrast, Aly Semigran of MTV had enjoyed the preceding episode, yet still received [...] "Funk" [...] poorly, calling it: [...] "a step down from last week's strong 'Theatricality'." [...] As with Respers France, Semigran noted that Quinn's performance" [...] felt a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> and borderline 'offensive'." [...] In contrast, Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal enjoyed Quinn's song, which he called a [...] "magnificent surprise", praising the [...] "perfect jazzy–funk choreography". Flandez criticized the [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] performance, however, deeming it a [...] "song so bad it can't be saved by irony or nostalgia", and felt that [...] "Give Up the Funk" [...] was [...] "underdeveloped" [...] asking: [...] "Where's the soul? Anger? Passion? Emotion? Isn't that what this was supposed to be about?" ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the episode's {{release on}} DVD were mostly positive, calling the episode [...] "wickedly funny, {{no matter how}} offensive." [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press commented that [...] "What, in other hands, {{could have been a}} serious, even heart-wrenching story is on Family Guy a devilish burlesque — not to mention a wickedly astute {{examination}} of the current abortion clash." [...] Moore also noted, however, that [...] "the uninitiated, the faint-of-heart and, most of all, the anti-abortion crowd should maybe choose to take a pass." [...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times deemed the episode [...] "typical of that audacious Fox animated comedy, teeming with rapid-fire jokes and willfully offensive non sequiturs about disabled animals, God, Nazis, bodily functions and the sexual habits of 'Sesame Street' characters." [...] In a slightly more mixed review of the DVD release, Cindy White of IGN criticized the episode for its shock value, but appreciated [...] "that the writers didn't cop out in the end, and actually picked a side." [...] White went on to comment that it was [...] "hard to believe that the writers ever expected 'Partial Terms of Endearment' to make it to air" [...] and that [...] "even devoted, longtime fans of the show may be a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> with the subject matter." [...] White gave the release a 7 out of 10 rating. Assessing Family Guys impact on television, Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon commented on the portrayal of abortion: [...] "That Family Guy, that doofy, generally unfunny bastion of sophomoric jokes, should {{be one of the few}} shows brave enough to even address the topic is bananas [...] And that Fox wouldn't air the episode says we're still a long way from having anybody on 'Glee' or 'The Office' or 'House' look at those telltale lines on the stick and finally decide what millions of American women have — that they're just not ready for motherhood." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{coincide}} with Stephanie Scully's (Carla Bonner) return to Neighbours in April 2013, the serial released six webisodes on their YouTube channel that featured Steph {{talking to a}} psychiatrist (Trudy Hellier) before her release from jail.

The webisodes were directed by former Neighbours actor Scott Major. He explained that being part of Steph's original exit storyline did not influence his approach to directing the webisodes. He decided to film the webisodes in a different style to show viewers what it was like in Steph's head.

2500|$|In October 2010, the band's song [...] "Ties That Bind" [...] from Blackbird {{was listed}} by Total Guitar as the 41st {{greatest}} guitar {{song of the}} decade, with Ultimate Guitar Archive naming AB III the seventh best album of 2010 that December.

2500|$|In June five adult actresses {{met with}} Hall's {{district}} director, Heather Hutt, at the legislator's office on Artesia Boulevard in Compton and presented 650 signed petitions asking that the Assemblyman withdraw his [...] "condoms in porn" [...] bill.

The group expressed their disappointment with the bill {{and the fact that it}} had been created with no input from adult industry representatives. In an interview with AVN magazine, Chance stated the following,"We told [...] we have our own self-regulation..." [...] "We told her we wanted to have our voices heard. They'd had no performer input on this. About condoms and chafing and micro-tears, it didn't seem like she really knew all the details of that. She compared it to a dentist being forced to wear gloves, and maybe it's a <b>little</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> She didn't realize why we have to have sex from 45 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer, and why that was necessary. She didn't know that the dangers of it, like if the condom breaks, and that we could get more STI's with the micro-tears, and just the condoms in general: Swelling, yeast infections, things of that nature—she just had no idea." [...] "She also didn't know about the doctors with the FSC that help make the decisions," [...] Chance added. [...] "It's not just a couple of people in a building making decisions for the whole industry. They don't even make decisions on the moratoriums; a doctor does, and she had no idea about that and what the testing protocols—how the doctors work with them to make the most safe tests available; she had no idea." ...|$|E

He realized how much this man, who had once sought so feverishly for intimacies, had shrunken back upon himself, how solitary his motives had become, how rarely he had taken counsel with anyone in his later years.

60|$|It {{was about}} five o'clock in the evening when Jimmy stood on the Vancouver wharf beside an express wagon, from which the {{teamster}} had just flung down what appeared to him an inordinate quantity of baggage.

In this get-up he expected to pass muster as a professional yacht-hand, though as yet there were very few men who followed that calling in Vancouver or Victoria. Had he been brought up in England he might have felt a <b>little</b> more <b>uncomfortable</b> than he did, but the average Westerner is troubled by no false pride, and is usually willing to earn the money he requires by any means available.

40|$|The article {{concerns}} {{the problem of}} cultural memory {{in this particular case}} when the memory relates to the past, "belonging" to another person rather than the community of those who emember. It is in the Bieszczady Mountains, settled again after the Second World War and the displacements of the Boyko (Ukrainian) population, where one can now observe cultural practices used to reach for someone else's past, a kind of "development" and adjustment of this past with contempoprary needs of residents and tourists. The postwar and post-displacement Bieszczady region also has its new mytho-history, their own pioneering and hoodlum-like narratives of memory, which coexist with the memory of not-your past, still a <b>little</b> bit <b>uncomfortable,</b> but already recognised as a characteristic of the place. The author tries to show both the idea of the past as well as activities focused on memory, creating memory that is defined as practising memory. What is significant here is the transition from the ideas of the past to practising memory, which from the belief of the author that the ideas of the past of the Bieszczady have the potential to activate people...|$|R

60|$|Poor Mr. Casaubon felt (and {{must not}} we, being impartial, feel {{with him a}} little?) that no man had juster cause for disgust and {{suspicion}} than he. Young Ladislaw, he was sure, meant to defy and annoy him, meant to win Dorothea's confidence and sow her mind with disrespect, and perhaps aversion, towards her husband. Some motive beneath the surface had been needed to account for Will's sudden change of in rejecting Mr. Casaubon's aid and quitting his travels; and this defiant determination to fix himself in the neighborhood by taking up something so much at variance with his former choice as Mr. Brooke's Middlemarch projects, revealed clearly enough that the undeclared motive had relation to Dorothea. Not for one moment did Mr. Casaubon suspect Dorothea of any doubleness: he had no suspicions of her, but he had (what was <b>little</b> less <b>uncomfortable)</b> the positive knowledge that her tendency to form opinions about her husband's conduct was accompanied with a disposition to regard Will Ladislaw favorably and be influenced by what he said. His own proud reticence had prevented him from ever being undeceived in the supposition that Dorothea had originally asked her uncle to invite Will to his house.|$|R

40|$|A bicycle is {{becoming}} a more and more popular means of transport in towns and cities because it is affordable to {{a wider range of}} users and provides an intensive experience of the environment. Compared to cars, bicycles also require much less space {{and at the same time}} they do not pollute either with noise or emissions. To this end, we have to provide for adequate traffic areas through which cyclists will rapidly arrive at their destination and feel safe and comfortable. A comparison of a Slovenian and American handbook for designing cycling surfaces shows a lot of more daring solutions of the latter, which is logical, because the US has been introducing modern cycling infrastructure for a long time. However, I think that our guide is a bit too conservative and therefore needs updates and foremost a bit more daring. More attention should be paid to the cycling lanes and shared cycling facilities that are somewhat neglected in our country mainly because they are a <b>little</b> more <b>uncomfortable</b> bike areas. However, it is important to know that they can be made more comfortable and more user-friendly if we introduce some more appropriate measures. Another topic that needs a little more updating are crossroads and junctions. Crossroads yield significant delays and most accidents take place due to them. There are solutions for both of the problems - some of which are already in our guide, but, nevertheless, it is also necessary to take a step forward here. A guide should tell you something about measures on how to increase the popularity of cycling which are not related to cycling surfaces. It is all about promoting cycling and informing people about the benefits of using bicycles. A modernization of bike areas is definitely a time-consuming process that has to be tackled with a good long-term plan which includes a gradual introduction of innovations, gives new information, and encourages people to use bicycles...|$|R
