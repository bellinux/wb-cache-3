500|$|... "Planet of the Dead" [...] was {{advertised as}} Doctor Whos 200th story.

Davies personally disagreed about counting The Trial of a Time Lord as one serial—arguing that it [...] "felt <b>like</b> <b>four</b> stories" [...] to him—and grouping [...] "Utopia" [...] with its following episodes, but {{agreed that it was}} only an opinion which did not override any others. Gareth Roberts inserted a reference to the landmark—specifically, the bus number is 200—and Davies emailed the show's publicity team to advertise the special as such. Doctor Who Magazines editor Tom Spilsbury acknowledged the controversy in the magazine's 407th issue, which ran a reader survey of all 200 stories.|$|E
500|$|Hetfield {{stated that}} the album was written with [...] "a lot of passion". He said, [...] "There's two years of {{condensed}} emotion in this. We've gone {{through a lot of}} personal changes, struggles, epiphanies, it's deep. It's so deep lyrically and musically. [...] is just the best that it can be from us right now." [...] The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing. The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt {{and did not want to}} [...] "mess with it". Rock commented, [...] "I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else sounds. To me, this album sounds <b>like</b> <b>four</b> guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James. We liked the raw performances. And we didn't do what everyone does and what I've been guilty of for a long time, which is tuning vocals. We just did it, boom, and that was it." ...|$|E

Who knows, House of Music could be the last Tony Toni Toné album." [...] The band remained committed to promoting the record into 1997, including a February 28 taped performance at VH1's Hard Rock Live special. According to Mercury vice president Marty Maidenberg, an international tour for the album had been planned by October 1996, with concert dates in Japan and the United Kingdom, but it never materialized. In November 1997, Saadiq told the Philadelphia Daily News [...] "there should have been <b>like</b> <b>four</b> singles from that album. You'll have to call Mercury on that. It went Platinum with no promotional tour. We did our job and they made their money." [...] The group disbanded shortly afterwards, and each member went on to pursue an individual music career.|$|E

500|$|While {{leading the}} team, Blackley adopted a loose style of supervision. According to Opening the Xbox author Dean Takahashi, [...] "Blackley [...] ultra-organized. His idea of good {{management}} was to invite someone {{over for a}} gourmet dinner and have a casual conversation about work". However, Takahashi wrote that [...] "Blackley worked hard to inspire his team", and he described artist James Dollar's belief that, [...] "in contrast to other Looking Glass managers, he didn't take over tasks and make others feel stupid". During {{the first two years}} of production, the team was divided into small groups that worked on the game's elements separately. For example, Blackley programmed the game's physics, while Eric Twietmeyer and Tim Day created the terrain renderer. However, Doug Church later said that, while [...] "the team [...] a bunch of very cool stuff, the FBO, the flight model, the instructor, the renderer, so on", the result [...] "was almost <b>like</b> <b>four</b> separate programs, with no connection". Following the completion of the concurrently-developed System Shock, a significant part of that game's team—including Church, Marc LeBlanc and Rob Fermier—moved to Flight Unlimited to add connective material. At the time, Church said that it was difficult to meld the game's elements, but he later stated that they largely coalesced by the end.|$|E
500|$|After {{positive}} {{reviews from}} the heavy metal {{press and the}} release of the album Sleep's Holy Mountain (1992) on Earache Records, Sleep's label announced that they would release their follow-up record. Sleep had been touring in Europe with Cathedral and in the United States with Hawkwind in support of Sleep's Holy Mountain when the group felt they had to write new material. The new album {{was going to be an}} hour-long song. This song was written and practiced at sound checks, motel rooms and in friends' houses. Matt Pike said the songwriting process was long and that they were [...] "working on [...] for <b>like</b> <b>four</b> years. We also had two other songs that were working on that were really long, too—like 15 and 20 minutes. But we never recorded them." [...] Al Cisneros stated that smoking cannabis was important to the song's creative process: [...] "I was really dependent on the space I got into when I was using it, and some of the lyrics are about that...The line, 'Drop out of life ,' was kind of a creed at that point." [...] The song was originally known and performed live under the title [...] "Dopesmoker". After their tour, the group began to be interested in a Middle Eastern desert theme which led to Sleep referring to the song as [...] "Jerusalem" [...] during later practice sessions.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, the McNair and {{the band}} parted ways, with neither party giving a {{definitive}} rationale.

Nobody wants to hurt anyone, or to cut them out, but it was just <b>like</b> <b>four</b> adults getting a divorce, and their child is the band." [...] She has alternately explained that the split was due to the [...] "alternative lifestyles" [...] of McNair and the rest of the group and that McNair's musicianship was not as competent as the other members. The remaining trio recruited session drummer Josh Freese and engineers Sandy Solomon and Bernie Zwass to record a cover of Tom Waits' [...] "Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis" [...] at Plus Four Recordings Studios, in Sherman Oaks, California in June 1995 for the compilation album [...] Freese joined the group in November–December of that year in Los Angeles, California to record Rubbing Doesn't Help. Mould was unavailable, so the band relocated to Los Angeles and worked with producer Geza X at his home studio in attempt to make a more [...] "eclectic" [...] album that would represent the diversity of their songwriting. After hearing some demos, the band decided to hire him to produce the actual album and moved to Los Angeles for recording. The album produced the singles [...] "Open the Door" [...] and [...] "This Family" [...] (the former also had a music video), as well as the EP Fire All Your Guns at Once. The band immediately set out to tour in promotion.|$|E

2500|$|At {{a recent}} {{conference at the}} American Society of Human Genetics, there was a study {{presented}} by Melissa Wilson Sayres from the University of California Berkeley which called into question the amount to which people had more female ancestors than male.

[...] "Other people have suggested it's as few as four females for one male. We find that it's probably skewed, but it's more <b>like</b> <b>four</b> females to three males" [...] said Sayres.|$|E
2500|$|A 2010 audio {{analysis}} of the Strubbe tape by Stuart Allen and Tom Owen, who were described by the Cleveland Plain Dealer as [...] "nationally respected forensic audio experts," [...] concluded that the guardsmen were given an order to fire.

[...] Several seconds pass. Then, [...] "All right, prepare to fire!" [...] "Get down!," [...] someone shouts urgently, presumably in the crowd. Finally, [...] "Guard!... followed two seconds later by a long, booming volley of gunshots. The entire spoken sequence lasts 17 seconds. Further {{analysis of}} the audiotape revealed that what sounded <b>like</b> <b>four</b> pistol shots and a confrontation occurred approximately 70 seconds before the National Guard opened fire. According to The Plain Dealer, this new analysis raised questions about the role of Terry Norman, a Kent State student who was an FBI informant and known to be carrying a pistol during the disturbance.
