50|$|The Court of Appeal, {{consisting}} of Lord Denning MR, Salmon LJ and Megaw LJ held that applying a lower standard to the <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> because the instructor {{was aware of}} her inexperience would result in complicated shifting standards. It would imply, for example, that an inexperienced doctor owed his patient a lower standard of care if the patient was aware of his lack of experience. The standard of care for a <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> would be the usual standard applied to drivers: that of an experienced and skilled driver. The policy consideration that {{played a role in}} this decision was that the <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> was covered by insurance.|$|E

50|$|Any {{use of a}} {{hand-held}} mobile phone or similar device while driving, or supervising a <b>learner</b> <b>driver,</b> is illegal. This includes when stopped at traffic lights. The only exceptions are emergency calls to 999 or 112.|$|E
50|$|This {{means no}} {{three-wheeled}} vehicle can {{be driven by}} completing Compulsory Basic Training alone. Otherwise, a holder of a full car (category B) licence aged 21 or over may drive a three-wheeled vehicle of any power. A <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> with a provisional car entitlement cannot drive a three-wheeled vehicle unless they meet certain disability criteria.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, Sawalha {{presented}} the BBC One programme Mirror, Signal, Manoeuvre which followed <b>learner</b> <b>drivers</b> as they learnt {{to drive and}} took their driving tests {{with varying degrees of}} success. Sawalha was one of the <b>learner</b> <b>drivers</b> who ended up passing her driving test {{at the end of the}} second series. In the same year and on the same network, Sawalha also co-presented with Jeremy Milnes for the programme Keeping Up with the Joneses.|$|R
5000|$|First a {{candidate}} has {{to apply for}} a learner's licence. A learner's licence is allows a <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> {{to get in touch with}} an instructor and drive a motor vehicle solely for learning purpose. The learner's licence declares a date for the candidate to sit in the driving test to be held by BRTA.|$|E
50|$|Nettleship v Weston 1971 2 QB 691 is an English Court of Appeal {{judgment}} {{dealing with}} the breach of duty in negligence claims. In this case the court had considered {{the question of the}} standard of care that should be applied to a <b>learner</b> <b>driver,</b> and whether it should be the same as is expected of an experienced driver.|$|E
50|$|The {{transition}} for {{a learner}} license to an intermediate, provisional or probationary license typically requires a minimum age and usually requires the <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> {{to pass an}} on-road driving test, although in some jurisdictions there may be alternative licensing paths offered involving a continuous process of competency based training and assessment under the guidance and instruction of an accredited driver trainer.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, the {{approach}} of European graduated driver licensing systems places much greater emphasis on the training experiences of learner drivers prior to solo driving, with a lesser focus on license restrictions at the intermediate, provisional or probationary licensing phase. Young drivers in European graduated driver licensing systems are typically older, as minimum licensing ages are older than most other countries. As well, most <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> experience is obtained through professional driving instructors rather than through ad hoc supervision.|$|E
50|$|Acquiring a learner’s permit {{typically}} {{requires a}} minimum age and passing vision and knowledge (written) tests. Parental or guardian permission {{may be required}} if below a specified age. Those who hold a learner’s permit must generally drive {{under the supervision of}} a licensed driver that is aged 21 or above, not be affected by alcohol or other drugs, and there may be restrictions imposed on maximum speed that a <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> can drive, the types of road that can be driven, and even on the use of mobile phones (cell phones). There may also be limits imposed on the number of passengers in the vehicle, and learner drivers may be required to be free of moving violations and at-fault accidents or crashes for a minimum period of time before moving to the next stage. In many jurisdictions a <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> is required to display an L sign {{on the outside of the}} vehicle to indicate to other road users that training and supervised driving is being undertaken. Learner drivers may also be required to complete a logbook of their driving experience, which must be certified or countersigned by a supervising driver or driver trainer.|$|E

He was further charged for being an unaccompanied <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> and not displaying [...] "L" [...] plates on his car and admitted all charges to the police. In April 2013, he was tried in absentia at Antrim Magistrates' Court, and fined £700.|$|E

50|$|The Fault Principle {{is not a}} moral {{principle}} {{because a}} Defendant may be negligent without being morally culpable and vice versa. Atiyah pointed out that if {{the focus of the}} fault principle was to punish the offending party, why is there vicarious liability, and liability insurance, which allow the actual wrongdoer to escape paying the victim's compensation. He was also highly critical of the decision in Nettleship v. Weston 1971, because it imposed liability onto a <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> defendant, where moral culpability could not be established.|$|E
50|$|Driving {{licences}} may {{be obtained}} by any citizen of age 18 or above, subject to certain conditions. Initially, a provisional licence is issued, which restricts the holder to driving whilst accompanied by a driver who has held a full licence {{in the category of}} vehicle they are supervising the <b>learner</b> <b>driver.</b> The provisional licence may be exchanged for a full licence after the holder has passed the driving test. On reaching the age of 50, drivers may apply to have their licences renewed with a medical/fitness certificate. Many foreign driving licences permit one to drive in India for a period of one year.|$|E
5000|$|The {{minimum age}} for a Code 1 or 2 licence is 17, {{and for a}} Code 3 licence it is 18. At the age of 16 a Code 1 licence limited to {{motorcycles}} with engine capacity under 125 cc may be obtained. Learner's licences are valid for 24 months, and, except for Code 1 licences, require that the learner {{be accompanied by a}} fully licensed driver. It is not compulsory for a <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> to have a big red [...] "L" [...] on the rear window, but it is recommended so that other drivers can have patience with the driver.|$|E
50|$|The Bealach, as it {{is known}} for short, is {{unsuitable}} for <b>learner</b> <b>drivers,</b> large vehicles and motorhomes. Please use caution while travelling up and down the Bealach. The route is often impassible in winter.|$|R
40|$|Driving can be dangerous, {{especially}} for young and inexperienced drivers. To help {{address the issue}} of inexperience, a gamified logbook smartphone application was designed and developed for <b>learner</b> <b>drivers</b> in Queensland, Australia. The application aims to make it easy for <b>learner</b> <b>drivers</b> to record their mandatory practice sessions while the added gamification aims to encourage learners to undertake a wider range of practice. Previous research reported on a lab-based study of a gamified version and a non-gamified version of this application. This paper presents an updated design of the application and investigates the effect of the application when tested in the field. Results are provided from a within-groups field study undertaken with 25 <b>learner</b> <b>drivers</b> over a four-week period, during which the effect of the gamification on behavior change, perceived motivation and user experience was studied. Although results suggest that the gamified logbook was perceived as more enjoyable and motivating than the non-gamified version, no significant change in behavior was found. This encourages discussion on the effectiveness of gamification to encourage behavior change and the feasibility of using gamification in this particular context...|$|R
50|$|A 0 limit {{applies to}} the drivers of trucks, buses, {{articulated}} vehicles, vehicles carrying dangerous goods, pilot vehicles, taxis, all <b>learner</b> <b>drivers</b> and provisional drivers and RE class licensed motorcyclists in their first twelve months.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to October 2007, a [...] "provisional licence" [...] {{was issued}} which had more lax {{restrictions}} - {{on its first}} renewal, the holder could drive unaccompanied (but must continue to display L plates), and the accompanying driver did not need any experience, just a full licence. The third or further renewals of the licence - e.g. after failing a test and the expiration of the second licence - brought back the accompaniment requirement. This unusual arrangement led to a situation where a <b>learner</b> <b>driver,</b> having failed his driving test on a 2nd Provisional, could legally drive away from the test center unaccompanied.|$|E
50|$|Driving {{licences}} may {{be obtained}} by any UK resident {{over the age of}} 17, subject to certain conditions. Initially, a provisional licence is issued, which restricts the holder to driving whilst accompanied by a driver who is at least 21 years old, who has held a full licence in the category of vehicle they are supervising the <b>learner</b> <b>driver</b> in for at least three years, and does not allow the provisional licence holder to drive on motorways. The provisional licence may be exchanged for a full licence after the holder has passed the practical driving test. Upon reaching the age of 70, drivers may apply to have their licences renewed with their doctors' permission.|$|E
50|$|Any {{conviction}} for dangerous driving (or causing death by dangerous driving) for a driver holding a licence {{issued by the}} Driver and Vehicle Agency (Northern Ireland) or Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (for licences issued in England, Wales or Scotland) {{will result in a}} mandatory disqualification if the offence took place in the United Kingdom proper, Isle of Man or Republic of Ireland (see also Traffic violations reciprocity). The driver must return to being a <b>learner</b> <b>driver,</b> even if the offence did not result in death or grievous bodily harm, and an extended practical driving test, about 70 minutes long and about 30 minutes longer than the regular driving test, must be taken by the driver to regain his or her full driving licence.|$|E
50|$|Competition {{is open to}} {{both women}} and men, the only {{restriction}} being that competitors must at least hold a current <b>Learner</b> <b>Driver’s</b> Permit. It sometimes comes down {{to members of the}} same family competing for the trophies.|$|R
