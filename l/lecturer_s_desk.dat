Instead of espousing the factory {{production}} of hogs, the norm for the industry today, it gives alternative production techniques that should be useful to starting farmers, niche producers (including organic farmers), and anyone else {{who might want to}} raise hogs in a more ecologically sound and humane fashion.

Many of the ideas presented are actually old production systems revised with a new twist or two. Pasture farrowing and finishing and using hogs as grazers are methods employed since Grandpa 2 ̆ 7 s day.
