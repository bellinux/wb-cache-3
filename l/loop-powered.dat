For the existing smart pressure transmitter circuit is complex and unstable, this paper designed a simple and reliable circuit in accordance with HART physical layer specifications. The design uses AD 421 and AD 5700 - 1 constitute a 4 -to- 20 mA <b>loop-powered</b> smart transmitter circuit, is fully compatible with standard HART or other similar FSK protocols. The smart transmitter using this circuit has passed the HART certification by HART communication foundation. This implementation {{can be applied to}} other smart transmitters...|$|E
40|$|The AD 693 is a {{monolithic}} signal conditioning circuit which accepts low-level inputs {{from a variety}} of transducers to control a standard 4 – 20 mA, two-wire current loop. An on-chip voltage reference and auxiliary amplifier are provided for transducer excitation; up to 3. 5 mA of excitation current is available when the device is operated in the <b>loop-powered</b> mode. Alternatively, the device may be locally powered for three-wire applications when 0 – 20 mA operation is desired. Precalibrated 30 mV and 60 mV input spans may be set by simple pin strapping. Other spans from 1 mV to 100 mV may be realized with the addition of external resistors. The auxiliary amplifier may be used in combination with on-chip voltages to provide six precalibrated ranges for 100 Ω RTDs. Output span and zero are also determined by pin strapping to obtain the standard ranges: 4 – 20 mA, 12 ± 8 mA and 0 – 20 mA...|$|E

40|$|The AD 421 is a complete, <b>loop-powered,</b> digital to 4 mA to 20 mA converter, {{designed}} {{to meet the needs of}} smart transmitter manufacturers in the Industrial Control industry. It provides a high precision, fully integrated, low cost solution in a compact 16 -lead package. The AD 421 is ideal for extending the resolution of smart 4 mA to 20 mA transmitters at very low cost. The AD 421 includes a selectable regulator that is used to power itself and other devices in the transmitter. This regulator provides either a + 5 V, + 3. 3 V or + 3 V regulated output voltage. The part also contains + 1. 25 V and + 2. 5 V precision references. The AD 421 thus eliminates the need for a discrete regulator and voltage reference. The only external components required are a number of passive components and a pass transistor to span large loop voltages. The AD 421 can be used with standard HART FSK protocol communication circuitry without any degradation in specified performance. The high speed serial interface is capable of operating at 10 Mbps and allows for simple connection to commonly-used microprocessors and microcontrollers via a standard three-wire serial interface. The sigma-delta architecture of the DAC guarantees 16 -bit monotonicity while the integral nonlinearity for the AD 421 is ± 0. 01 %. The part provides a zero scale 4 mA output current with ± 0. 1 % offset error and a 20 mA full-scale output current with ± 0. 2 % gain error. The AD 421 is available in a 16 -lead, 0. 3 inch-wide, plastic DIP and in a 16 -lead, 0. 3 inch-wide, SOIC package. The part is specified over the industrial temperature range of – 40 °C to + 85 °C...|$|E
