Radio agencies estimate that about 750,000 people tuned in to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> series radio play beginning on February 14, 1983.

25|$|Also, free distribution, even if unauthorized, can be {{beneficial}} to small or new content providers by spreading and popularizing content and therefore generating a larger consumer base by sharing and word of mouth. Several musicians have grown to popularity by posting their music videos on sites like YouTube where the content is free to <b>listen</b> <b>to.</b> <b>This</b> method of putting the product {{out in the world}} free of DRM not only generates a greater following but also fuels greater revenue through other merchandise (hats, T-shirts), concert tickets, and of course, more sales of the content to paying consumers.|$|E
25|$|For example, in act 1, scene 2, the {{scenario}} is that Jenny and other girls are walking to Mahagonny. The music is surprisingly simple; {{just a simple}} solo with a short chorus and sparse orchestration. The music is not some baroque contrapuntal scheme, {{nor is it a}} Romantic forest of sound; rather, the music is very easy to <b>listen</b> <b>to.</b> <b>This</b> music setting matches with the idea of making music accessible to the public, and not just for educated artists. The music style also displays influences from popular music. During this time, American jazz was a sensation in Europe; since opera is set in America, {{it is not surprising that}} the tune and the beat have a jazz influence. The orchestration, also includes such non-classical instruments as a saxophone, a decidedly jazz instrument. By using a jazz style in the music, Weill immediately associates the action as happening in America. In addition to making a relatively exotic sound, Weill manages to incorporate the jazz style in the song without making it seem incongruous; the American and European music are seamlessly joined under Weill's hands.|$|E

In an interview with Artisan News, drummer Mike Mangini reflected, [...] "The biggest challenge for me was interpreting the initial music that was given to me, because there were no drums. So , 'All right, I need to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> really, as a whole piece to understand where I should kind of let loose or I should lay back a lot.' All that.

[...] Joginger Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave it a rating of 4 out of 5, praising the compositions and wrote [...] "Kudos to the film maker, Sohail Sen and Javed Akhtar for getting their thinking hats together and making something as innovative and fresh as What's Your Raashee?. <b>Listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> one for a unique experience.

500|$|... "From This Moment On" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Matt Bjorke of About.com deemed the song {{as one of}} the album's highlights, while Elizabeth Kessler of Yahoo! commented that [...] "hardly any song can compare to this love anthem! ... Everyone feels their insides tug as they <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> heart wrenching song." [...] Country Universe writer Kevin John Coyne did separate reviews for [...] "From This Moment On". While reviewing the duet, Coyne graded it a B and commented that it was mostly a showcase of White's vocals, [...] "who turns in some signature licks and makes Twain seem a bit bland in comparison. [...] However, it also gives the song a bit of a mid-eighties Peter Cetera vibe, which hasn’t held up well over time." [...] Coyne concluded, however, that the single release turned the track [...] "into a potent solo number," [...] and noted that [...] "the addition of a Spanish-flavored guitar that borrowed heavily from 'Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman' [...] gave the ballad added oomph." [...] He graded the single release at an A-. At the 1999 Canadian Country Music Awards, [...] "From This Moment On" [...] won the award for Vocal/Instrumental Collaboration of the Year.|$|E
500|$|... "Wipe Your Eyes" [...] is a mid-tempo piano-driven ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and thirty-four seconds. It {{contains}} sample of the recording [...] "Sabali" [...] which is written by Damon Albarn, Mariam Doumbia and Marc A. Moreau published by Chrysalis Music. [...] "Wipe Your Eyes" [...] starts with [...] "crooning by a chipmunk-like voice", and after that Levine professes [...] "I’m here to wipe your eyes" [...] to his broken-hearted romantic interest. Brittany Frederick of StarPulse criticized {{the opening of the}} song labeling it as [...] "jarring nonsensical sounds"; the sounds can also be heard in the background. However, according to her, [...] "they're minor issues with an album that is bound to get at least one song other than 'Payphone' stuck in your head." [...] Alt Rock Live's Keaton Fletcher in a review of Overexposed, wrote that the beginning of the song makes you ask yourself [...] "do you really want to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> song?" [...] However, he concluded that after its first thirty seconds it sounds like typical Maroon 5 song on which you feel smooth sexuality. A reviewer of Kiss 95.1 radio wrote that [...] "Wipe Your Eyes" [...] together with [...] "Love Somebody" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Goodbye" [...] "are 'fan favorites' songs".|$|E

500|$|Kirchherr, Voormann and Vollmer {{were friends}} who had all {{attended}} the Meisterschule, and shared the same ideas about fashion, culture and music. Voormann became Astrid's boyfriend, and moved into the Kirchherr home, where {{he had his own}} room. In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the Reeperbahn (in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the Kaiserkeller club. Voormann walked in and watched a performance by a group called the Beatles: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Sutcliffe and Best, their drummer at the time. Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> new music, and after being persuaded to visit the Kaiserkeller (which was in the rough area of the Reeperbahn), Kirchherr decided that all she {{wanted to do was to}} be as close to the Beatles as she could. The trio of friends had never heard this new music called Rock n' Roll before, having previously listened to only Trad jazz, with some Nat King Cole and The Platters mixed in. The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them." ...|$|E

J-Pop! was positive in his review, feeling that the composition sounded [...] "nostalgic"-like. A staff review from CDJournal discussed Utada's first greatest hits compilation Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1 and commended Utada's [...] "fine" [...] vocal delivery and composition." [...] Ian Martin from Allmusic also commended Jam and Lewis' collaboration, saying that [...] "providing {{stark contrast to the}} cheap, tinny sound that characterized much Japanese pop of the previous decade, with [...] "Wait & See" [...] and [...] "Addicted to You" [...] both featuring the production talents of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis." [...] Miko Amaranthine from Yahoo! Music listed the song at number four on his Top Ten Hikaru Utada songs, stating [...] ""Addicted to you" [...] is one of my favorites for a slightly greedy purpose [...] When I <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> song, I am reminded how much I love my marriage and am thankful I do not have to play the [...] "dating game"."

500|$|Beyoncé's {{version of}} [...] "Resentment" [...] {{received}} positive reviews from critics, {{most of whom}} noted the soulful vocal stylings used in the song. Bill Lamb of About.com complimented the song {{as one of the}} album highlights and described it as [...] "gospel-influenced" [...] and [...] "emotion filled" [...] song. A writer of Billboard magazine stated that Beyoncé [...] "shifts into emotive mode" [...] on this song from [...] "rockier, edgier" [...] sound of album and noted that the track [...] "calls to mind the subtle fervor and passion of the best girl groups of the '60s and '70s". Brian Hiatt from Rolling Stone marked the track as [...] "one of the most arresting moments" [...] on the album and described it as an [...] "anguished, sixties-tinged ballad". Spence Abbott of IGN also noted track as a stand out alongside [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and observed that [...] " [...] track goes straight for Aretha Franklin-inspired territory, with Beyoncé actually getting gritty and dropping her high octave range down a few pegs to get guttural and downright Old School soulful". Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the [...] "agitated goodbye" [...] builds a different kind of overwrought drama. Steve Jones of USA Today the song showcases Beyoncé's [...] "maturing vocal chops," [...] describing the song as spare and gritty. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song would have been better if performed by a trio of [...] "talented" [...] vocalists, such as Destiny's Child, rather than Beyoncé by herself. Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra felt that [...] "Doubters of Beyoncé's immense talent need only give one <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> track [...] from 2006's B'Day. It's a stunner — a visceral, emotional showcase that casts Beyoncé as a scorned, sorrowful woman. You can almost feel the pain in her delivery." [...] According to a writer of Irish Independent, the song gives a more soulful feel to B'Day. Jim Farber of Daily News called [...] "Resentment" [...] an [...] "old-school soul shouter". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker described the song as a [...] "fierce ballad". [...] "Resentment" [...] peaked at number 11 on the US Bubbling Under R/Hip-Hop Singles chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs.|$|E
