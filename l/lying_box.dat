40|$|The {{objective}} of the dissertation thesis was to analyse factors affecting preference of cubicle of Czech Fleckvieh dairy cows. Monitoring was carried in farm GenAgro Ricany a. s., a period of 12 months (June 2011 [...] May 2012). The {{objective of}} monitoring was one section - one quarter of stable (n = 98 cows). Total of 47 040 observations were analysed. Statistical evaluation of data was performed by STATISTICA 10. 0. In the sectionwas comprised of 103 comfortable stalls (cubicles) distributed into 3 rows [...] Row A [...] closest to feeding table (32 cubicles); row B [...] in the midle section (33 cubicles); row C [...] close to the side wall (38 cubicles). In all factors (number and stage of lactation, milk yield, number of arrival from milking parlour, temperature and humidity in stable and THI, height in the cross) was found significantly influence (p < 0, 01) on preference of cubicle row. In evaluation of preference of boxes it was found out, that the lowest occupation rate in whole observing was in those boxes, which are {{on the edge of}} rows. Also lower amount of visits was noted in boxes, which are surrounded from more than one side by wooden partition separating space for <b>lying</b> (<b>box)</b> from waterhole. On the contrary mostly occupied boxes were those, which are located in the middle of box rows. Further higher preference rate of left side when lying was found in all observed influences, identically at both outer rows. On the contrary dairy cows preferred right side when lying in middle row...|$|E

When Calvin gave his resignation, {{effective}} in August 1863, Harriet set to work preparing their first home in Hartford. Fluctuating costs caused by the American Civil War made the project difficult but Harriet enjoyed supervising the work. She wrote to her publisher James Thomas Fields, [...] "I go every day to see it—I am busy with drains sewers sinks digging trenching—& above all with manure!—You should see the joy with which I gaze on manure heaps to which the eye of faith sees Delaware grapes & D'Angouleme pears & all sorts of roses & posies". She named the building [...] "Oakholm". The home was complete enough that, by May 1, 1864, she wrote, [...] "I came here a month ago to hurry on the preparations for our house, in which I am now writing, in the high bow-window of Mr. Stowe's study, overlooking the wood and river. We are not moved in yet, only our things, and the house presents a scene of the wildest chaos, the furniture having been tumbled in and <b>lying</b> <b>boxed</b> and promiscuous." ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of floor quality on the behaviour and cleanliness of the diary cow‘s body. The analysis results show that cows housed in the section with the separated manure solids spent more time lying (41. 47 %) and also laid less in the corridor manure (0. 91 %) than the cows in the section with separated manure solids and the rubber mats where they were laying generally less (35. 71 %), they spent more time lying in the corridor manure (1. 55 %) and in terms of preference of lying area the cows clearly preferred the separated manure solids (25. 8 %). Based on observations we can say that cows housed in sections of slurry solid phase were cleaner (average 6. 13 points) than cows in the section with the rubber and a separated manure (averagely 7. 28 points). Nowadays the free housing systems with different types of litter and boxes are frequently used, while the proper littering influences the lying preferences of an animal. In practice, for the dairy cows the deepened <b>lying</b> <b>boxes</b> littered with natural materials such as sawdust, shavings, straw, dried manure and sand boxes or elevated boxes covered with a synthetic material, mattresses or mats are used...|$|R

This single consensus box is functional when placed either to the left or right of the core origin sequences.
