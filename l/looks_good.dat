5|$|Following the Peace of Paris in 1783, Seymour took a {{house in}} London with his brother Lord George Seymour and John Willett Payne. The three men became notorious socialites, joining the Prince of Wales on many of his {{drinking}} exploits across London: Seymour remained close friends with Prince George {{for the rest of}} his life. Seymour, already known for his good <b>looks,</b> <b>good</b> manners, height and martial bearing, rapidly gained a reputation for dissolution. In 1785 however, Seymour married Lady Anne Horatia Waldegrave, daughter of Earl Waldegrave and Maria Walpole (later Duchess of Gloucester) at the insistence of his family in a successful attempt to curtail his social activities. It was at this time that Seymour made his first foray into politics, becoming MP for Newport on the Isle of Wight before relinquishing the post two years later. In 1788 he became MP for Tregony, but in 1790 he switched to become MP for Wendover. Seymour remained in this position until 1796 when he changed his seat to Portsmouth, in which he remained until his death. He did not serve as an active politician in any of these positions, preferring his navy career to his political one.|$|E

Game Revolution's Calvin Hubble argued that the game only really <b>looks</b> <b>good</b> if played on a system with a powerful 3D card. Other graphical aspects received praise. The character animations were considered more detailed than similar games. The graphical presentation of the levels received specific praise from IGN: [...] "No other first person shooter has come close to Jedi Knights dizzying sense of scale and its vast levels." [...] The full-motion video sequences between levels received both praise and criticism.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1994 Fairchild air show, Holland was again selected as the command pilot for the B-52 demonstration flight. On 15 June 1994, Holland briefed the new wing commander, Colonel William Brooks, on the proposed flight plan. The demonstration profile—as briefed by Holland—included numerous violations of regulations, including steep bank angles, low-altitude passes, and steep pitch attitudes. Brooks ordered Holland not to exceed 45° bank angles or 25° pitch attitude during the demonstration. During the first practice session, on 17 June, Holland repeatedly violated these orders. Brooks witnessed this, but took no action. Pellerin flew with Holland on that flight and reported to Brooks that, [...] "the profile <b>looks</b> <b>good</b> to him; looks very safe, well within parameters." [...] The next practice flight on 24 June ended with the crash.|$|E

[...] In October 1905, Coach Yost said: [...] "In looking over the whole bunch, I do not see anyone who has improved more than Schulz. [...] He is bigger and stronger than ever, and I do not know a man in the world that has it the least bit over him in the center position. [...] I would not trade him for any other center rush in the country today. [...] He <b>looks</b> <b>good</b> to me for the All-America team right now".

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B–" [...] rating. He {{concluded}} that the episode {{is an example of}} [...] "propulsive fun" [...] and applauded its myriad of attention-grabbing sequences. However, he was critical of its plot, noting that [...] "the series pretty much just picks Cassandra to be the answer to a lot of questions" [...] concerning the show's mythology. Not all reviews were so glowing. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris wrote positively of the episode's filming, writing, [...] "visually, the episode <b>looks</b> <b>good</b> [...] but the scenes in the hangar are eye-poppers, with doors slowly opening and aliens walking forward, obscured by bright light." [...] However, she criticized the episode's plot, noting that [...] "Two Fathers" [...] was [...] "heading straight down a path already trodden by dozens of books, short stories, movies, and other television shows." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "If It Makes You Happy", {{underwent}} {{several different}} arrangements before {{being turned into}} a rock song. According to musician Jeff Trott, who co-wrote the song along with Crow, [...] "It started off as a twangy, David Lynch-esque sort of thing. Then [...] we played it like punk rock, really fast, as well as country and funky. You know, you get a song and put clothes on it to see what <b>looks</b> <b>good</b> and what doesn't, and usually when you find the right one it's pretty obvious. With that song it was real obvious!" [...] Trott initially wrote the song {{when he was a}} member of Pete Droge's backing band, but Crow added a second verse and strengthened the melody. Sheryl Crow also has contributions by notable musicians. For example, [...] "Sweet Rosalyn" [...] features saxophone by Steve Berlin of Los Lobos, while [...] "Everyday Is a Winding Road" [...] features harmony vocals by Neil Finn of Crowded House.|$|E

[...] Vibe Jason King complimented some of the material on the album, but was disappointed with the [...] "heavyweight producers" [...] not producing any [...] "masterpieces". Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic gave a positive opinion on Usher's development, writing [...] "He <b>looks</b> <b>good,</b> his material is smooth and seductive, {{and he has a}} nice voice, even if he tends to favor melisma". Erlewine also labelled the album as [...] "a classy, seductive affair" [...] but was ambivalent towards its material, {{due to the lack of}} memorable tracks. Entertainment Weekly Josh Tyrangiel said that the tracks [...] "blend harmlessly together", but was ambivalent towards the quality of the songs produced after Usher's four-year hiatus.|$|E

The actress, who starred in Dallas for nine years in the Seventies and Eighties, has not joined castmates Larry Hagman, 80 , Patrick Duffy, 62 , and Linda Gray, 71 , in the TNT reboot of the hit show, which premiered in the summer of 2012.

[...] In The Weekly Standard, John Podhoretz criticized the film's [...] "mindless worship of a nature-loving tribe and the tribe's adorable pagan rituals."

[...] If you love the philosophy {{and culture of the}} Na'vi too much, you will be led into evil rather than away from it." [...] Outten further added: [...] "Cameron has done a masterful job in manipulating the emotions of his audience in Avatar. He created a world where it <b>looks</b> <b>good</b> and noble to live in a tree and hunt for your food daily with a bow and arrow.... Cameron said, Avatar asks us to see that everything is connected, all human beings to each other, and us to the Earth.' This is a clear statement of religious belief. This is pantheism.

500|$|The {{inclusion}} of a Native American character in Star Trek: Voyager was suggested {{at an early stage}} {{in the development of the}} series. The producers were looking for an ethnic background which had not been seen before as a main character in the franchise. It was hoped that a Native American character would prove to be an inspiration in the same way that the appearance of Uhura in [...] later inspired Whoopi Goldberg and other African Americans. Executive producer Jeri Taylor said, [...] "It seemed to us that Native Americans needed that same kind of role model and that same kind of boost... the future <b>looks</b> <b>good,</b> you have purpose, you have worth, you have value, you will be leaders, you will be powerful. That was one character choice we had early on." [...] Taylor's notes from the early production in July 1993 describe the character as [...] "First Officer – a human native American male, a 'Queequeg' person who has renounced Earth and lives as an expatriate on another planet. A mystical, mysterious man with whom the Captain has some prior connection, not explained." [...] A month later, this description was expanded with the line, [...] "This man has made another choice – to re-enter the world of Starfleet." [...] Chakotay was not the first Native American character to appear in the franchise, with [...] "The Paradise Syndrome" [...] in the [...] of Star Trek: The Original Series showing a group of displaced humans following a Native-American-like culture.|$|E

Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day.
