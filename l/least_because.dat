5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{unless a}} new bishop {{has a family}} coat of arms, he {{typically}} adopts within his shield symbols that indicate his interests or past service. Devotion to a particular saint is represented by symbols established in iconography and heraldic tradition. In the Church of England, new bishops typically choose a coat that looks entirely non-clerical, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> their descendants may seek reassignment of the arms, and few of them {{are likely to be}} clerics.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how {{effective}} the Caesar cipher {{was at the}} time, but {{it is likely to}} have been reasonably secure, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> most of Caesar's enemies would have been illiterate and others would have assumed that the messages were written in an unknown foreign language. There is no record at that time of any techniques for the solution of simple substitution ciphers. The earliest surviving records date to the 9th century works of Al-Kindi in the Arab world with the discovery of frequency analysis.|$|E

5|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests can}} show {{a combination of}} results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} widely used in non-industrialized societies, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> they are far cheaper than modern medicines. The annual global export value of {{pharmaceutical}} plants in 2012 was over US$2.2 billion. In many countries there is little regulation of traditional medicine, but the World Health Organization is coordinating a network to encourage safe and rational usage. Medicinal plants face both general threats such as climate change and habitat loss, and the specific threat of over-collection to meet market demand.|$|E
5|$|The three vinyl LPs and booklet were housed {{inside a}} deep orange-coloured box. The 1991 CD release placed the cover photo {{on a white}} background, however, replicating {{the front of the}} {{original}} album booklet. As commentators noted in 1991, the necessary downsizing to CD dimensions meant that much of the effectiveness of the booklet photography was lost, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> the contents had also been trimmed down to just 36 pages.|$|E

5|$|After {{problems}} with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind the other with one minute between each aircraft, instead of flying in their normal 'V' formation. The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal did {{not always}} play their home matches at Highbury in the 93 years they were based there. During the Second World War the stadium {{was used as an}} ARP station and was bombed; Arsenal played their matches at White Hart Lane, home of North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, until Highbury re-opened in 1946. More recently, Arsenal's home UEFA Champions League matches in the 1998–99 and 1999–00 seasons were played at Wembley Stadium, as Highbury's already limited {{capacity}} had to be reduced to accommodate advertising hoardings. Arsenal's record at Wembley (P6 W2 D1 L3) was relatively poor, and after two seasons the club switched back to playing at Highbury, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> since Wembley closed for rebuilding in October 2000, {{it would not have been}} able to host their 2000–01 campaign.|$|E
5|$|Matilda's {{eldest son}} Henry {{slowly began to}} assume {{a leading role in}} the conflict. He had {{remained}} in France when the Empress first left for England. He crossed over to England in 1142, before returning to Anjou in 1144. Geoffrey of Anjou expected Henry to become the King of England and began to involve him in the government of the family lands. In 1147, Henry intervened in England with a small mercenary army but the expedition failed, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> Henry lacked the funds to pay his men. Henry asked his mother for money, but she refused, stating that she had none available. In the end Stephen himself ended up paying off Henry's mercenaries, allowing him to return home safely; his reasons for doing so remain unclear.|$|E

5|$|Nevill and June adopted Bamber {{when he was}} {{six months}} old. They sent him to St Nicholas Primary and the private Maldon Court prep school, along with Sheila, {{followed}} by Gresham's School, a boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, which he attended from September 1970. He was miserable there, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> of bullying and a sexual assault. He left Gresham's with no qualifications, but attended sixth-form college and in 1978 passed seven O-levels. Nevill paid for him to visit Australia, where Bamber took a scuba-diving course, then New Zealand. Former friends alleged that he had broken into a jeweller's shop while in New Zealand and had stolen an expensive watch. He had also boasted, they said, {{of being involved in}} smuggling heroin.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Army {{force in}} the area of Primosole Bridge came from the 213 Coastal Division {{commanded}} by General Carlo Gotti. Coastal divisions were second line divisions, usually formed from men in their forties and fifties, and were intended to perform labour or other second line duties. Recruited from the local population, their officers were mostly men who had retired but had then been called up again. Their morale was low, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> of their second rate equipment and weapons. It had been intended to improve their armaments with equipment seized from the recently disbanded Vichy French army, but when the arms arrived in Sicily, many of them had been made unusable, and some had the wrong type of ammunition or no ammunition at all.|$|E
5|$|The Queen lavished {{upon her}} {{favourite}} the royal manor of Woodstock {{and the promise}} of a fine palace commemorative of his great victory at Blenheim; but since her accession her relationship with Sarah had become progressively distant. The Duke and Duchess had risen to greatness not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> of their intimacy with Anne, but the Duchess's relentless campaign against the Tories (Sarah was a firm Whig), isolated her from the Queen whose natural inclinations lay with the Tories, the staunch supporters of the Church of England. For her part, Anne, now Queen and no longer the timid adolescent so easily dominated by her more beautiful friend, had grown tired of Sarah's tactless political hectoring and increasingly haughty manner which, in the coming years, were to destroy their friendship and undermine the position of her husband.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} trees in the world, {{according}} to a 2015 estimate, is 3.04 trillion, of which 1.39 trillion (46%) are in the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.61 trillion (20%) in the temperate zones, and 0.74 trillion (24%) in the coniferous boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates, {{and is based on}} tree densities measured on over 400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> the samples are mainly from Europe and North America. The estimate suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually and about 5 billion are planted. In the 12,000 years since the start of human agriculture, the number of trees worldwide has decreased by 46%.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{attempts}} to make everyone's Christmas wishes come true. At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries {{to be nice to}} Jessica, but ends up drinking too much at the party. In a drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, spends {{a good deal of the}} party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement. Andy subsequently drives away with a smile on his face.|$|E
5|$|Cromwell {{did much}} work through his many offices {{to remove the}} tasks of {{government}} from the Royal Household (and ideologically from the personal body of the King) and into a public state. He did so, however, in a haphazard fashion that left several remnants, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> he needed to retain Henry's support, his own power, {{and the possibility of}} actually achieving the plan he set out. Cromwell made the various income streams put in place by Henry VII more formal and assigned largely autonomous bodies for their administration. The role of the King's Council was transferred to a reformed Privy Council, much smaller and more efficient than its predecessor. A difference emerged between the financial health of the king, and that of the country, although Cromwell's fall undermined much of his bureaucracy, which required his hand to keep order among the many new bodies and prevent profligate spending that strained relations as well as finances. Cromwell's reforms ground to a halt in 1539, the initiative lost, and he failed to secure the passage of an enabling act, the Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539. He too was executed, on 28 July 1540.|$|E

5|$|Edward now {{expected}} Isabella {{and their}} son to return to England, but instead she remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back. Until 1322, Edward and Isabella's marriage {{appears to have been}} successful, {{but by the time the}} Queen left for France in 1325, it had deteriorated. Isabella appears to have disliked Hugh Despenser the Younger intensely, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> of his abuse of high-status women. Isabella was embarrassed that she had fled from Scottish armies three times during her marriage to Edward, and she blamed Hugh for the final occurrence in 1322. When Edward had negotiated the recent truce with Robert the Bruce, he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in Scotland, including the Beaumonts, close friends of Isabella's. She was also angry about the arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324. Finally, Edward had taken away her children and given the custody of them to Hugh Despenser's wife.|$|E
5|$|Frederick III of Brandenburg, since 1701 also Frederick I of Prussia, {{was born}} in Königsberg in 1657. Already {{in the last years}} of the reign of his father, the {{friendly}} relations with France established after Saint Germain (1679) had cooled down, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> of the Huguenot question. In 1686, Frederick William turned toward the Habsburg emperor, with whom he concluded an alliance on 22 December 1686. For this alliance, Frederick William relinquished rights on Silesia in favor of the Habsburgs, and in turn received the Silesian County of Schwiebus which bordered the Neumark. Frederick III, present at the negotiations as crown prince, assured the Habsburgs of the continuation of the alliance once he was in power, and secretly concluded an amendment to return Schwiebus to the Habsburgs, which he eventually did in 1694. Throughout his reign, Brandenburg-Prussia remained a Habsburg ally and repeatedly deployed troops to fight against France. In 1693, Frederick III began to sound out the possibility of an elevation of his status at the Habsburg court in Vienna, and while the first attempt was unsuccessful, elevation to a king remained the central goal on his agenda.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was caught}} by {{surprise}} at Le Mans but made a forced march north to Alençon, from where he could escape into the safety of Normandy. Suddenly, however, Henry turned back south towards Anjou, {{against the advice of}} his officials. The weather was extremely hot, the King was increasingly ill and he appears to have wanted to die peacefully in Anjou rather than fight yet another campaign. Henry evaded the enemy forces on his way south and collapsed in his castle at Chinon. Philip and Richard were making good progress, not <b>least</b> <b>because</b> it was now obvious that Henry was dying and that Richard would be the next king, and the pair offered negotiations. They met at Ballan, where Henry, only just able to remain seated on his horse, agreed to a complete surrender: he would do homage to Philip; he would give up Alice to a guardian and she would marry Richard {{at the end of the}} coming crusade; he would recognise Richard as his heir; he would pay Philip compensation, and key castles would be given to Philip as a guarantee.|$|E
