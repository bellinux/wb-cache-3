5000|$|Technological advancements {{within the}} {{industry}} allow for incorporating timers to limit the operations during specific {{hours of the day}} to reduce energy waste by only operating when occupants are likely to use hot water. Additional advancements in technology include pumps which cycle on and off to maintain hot water temperature versus a continuously operating pump which consumes more electrical energy. Reduced energy waste and discomfort is possible by preventing occurrences of hot <b>water</b> <b>line</b> siphoning in open-loop hot water circulation systems which utilize the cold <b>water</b> <b>line</b> to return <b>water</b> back to the water heater. Hot <b>Water</b> <b>Line</b> Siphoning occurs when water from within the hot <b>water</b> <b>line</b> siphons or is forced into the cold <b>water</b> <b>line</b> due to differences in water pressure between the hot and cold <b>water</b> <b>lines.</b> Utilizing [...] "normally closed" [...] solenoid valve significantly reduces energy consumption by preventing siphoning of non-hot water out of hot <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> during cold <b>water</b> use. Using cold water instantly lowers the water pressure in the cold <b>water</b> <b>lines,</b> the higher <b>water</b> pressure in the hot <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> force <b>water</b> through [...] "normally open" [...] thermostatic crossover valves and backflow check valves (which only prevent cold water from flowing into hot <b>water</b> <b>line),</b> increasing the energy demand on the water heater.|$|R

The study focuses on the Herschel spectral range {{in the context of}} new line detections with the PACS instrument from the Gas in Protoplanetary Systems project (GASPS). Aims. The paper presents an overview of the chemistry in the main water reservoirs in the disk around TW Hya. It {{discusses the}} limitations in the interpretation of observed <b>water</b> <b>line</b> fluxes. Methods. [...] . (abbreviated) Results. We report new line detections of p-H 2 O (3 _ 22 - 2 _ 11) at 89. 99 micron and CO J= 18 - 17 at 144. 78 micron for the disk around TW Hya. Disk modeling shows that the far-IR fine structure lines ([OI], [CII]) and molecular submm lines are very robust to uncertainties in the chemistry, while the <b>water</b> <b>line</b> fluxes can change by factors of a few. The <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> are optically thick, sub-thermally excited and can couple to the background continuum radiation field. The low-excitation <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> are also sensitive to uncertainties in the collision rates, e. g. with neutral hydrogen. The gas temperature plays an important role for the [OI] fine structure <b>line</b> fluxes, the <b>water</b> <b>line</b> fluxes originating from the inner disk as well as the high excitation CO, CH+ and OH lines. Conclusions. Due to their sensitivity on chemical input data and radiative transfer, <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> have to be used cautiously for understanding details of the disk structure. <b>Water</b> <b>lines</b> covering a wide range of excitation energies provide access to the various gas phase water reservoirs (inside and outside the snow line) in protoplanetary disks and thus provide important information on where gas-phase water is potentially located. Experimental and/or theoretical collision rates for H 2 O with atomic hydrogen are needed to diminish uncertainties from <b>water</b> <b>line</b> radiative transfer.
