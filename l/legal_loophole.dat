5|$|Despite loving Nikki, Victor {{begins to}} fall for Ashley Abbott (Brenda Epperson) and they have an affair, enraging Nikki to sleep with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Ashley’s brother and Victor’s {{business}} rival. Ashley becomes pregnant and Victor leaves Nikki, but when Nikki is diagnosed with cancer, Victor returns to her and Ashley aborts the child. When Nikki goes into remission, Victor {{wanted to be with}} Ashley, who had moved on with her psychiatrist Steven Lassiter (Rod Arrants); Steven later dies, and while Ashley wanted Victor back, he had returned to Nikki in an attempted to salvage their marriage, resulting in the birth of their son Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Victor and Jack later hire Leanna Love (Barbara Crampton) to write a biography on Victor, when in reality, Jack wanted the book to be a tell-all expose on Victor. Leanna later writes a chapter about Victor’s affair with Ashley and Nikki’s illness, causing Victor to believe Nikki was behind the publication. He divorces her and marries Leanna to prove to the press that he didn’t want to be with Ashley; their marriage was invalid, as the divorce wasn’t finalized. Victor later takes over Jack’s family company, Jabot Cosmetics, replacing him with Brad Carlton (Don Diamont). As a result, Jack spitefully marries Nikki, causing her relationship with Victor to become bitter. Victor marries Ashley, and years later; he tells Jack that he will give him back Jabot Cosmetics if he divorces Nikki. He agrees to do so, but Jack wasn’t given full control of the company due to a <b>legal</b> <b>loophole.</b> Victor has a heart attack during a confrontation with Jack, and while he leaves him for dead, Victor recovers. As Jack and Nikki’s marriage strained to due her alcoholism and pain killer addiction, she reconnected with Victor, who had decided to divorce Ashley.|$|E
25|$|With {{the return}} of Jobs, this {{rebranding}} to version 8 also allowed Apple to exploit a <b>legal</b> <b>loophole</b> to terminate third-party manufacturers' licenses to System 7 and effectively shut down the Macintosh clone market. Later, Mac OS 8.1 finally added the new filesystem and Mac OS 8.6 updated the nanokernel to handle limited support for preemptive tasks. Its interface is Multiprocessing Services 2.x and later, {{but there is no}} process separation and the system still uses cooperative multitasking between processes. Even a process that is Multiprocessing Services-aware still has a portion that runs in the Blue Box—a task that also runs all single-threaded programs and the only task that can run 68k code.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the {{constitution}} are entrenched, after a fashion. Section 268 of the Electoral Act declares that the law governing the maximum term of Parliament (itself part of the Constitution Act), along with certain provisions of the Electoral Act relating to the redistribution of electoral boundaries, the voting age, and the secret ballot, may only be altered either by three-quarters of the entire membership of the House of Representatives, or {{by a majority of}} valid votes in a popular referendum. Section 268 itself is not protected by this provision, so a government could legally repeal Section 268 and go on to alter the entrenched portions of law, both with a mere simple majority in Parliament. However, the entrenchment provision has enjoyed longstanding bipartisan support, and the electoral consequences of using a <b>legal</b> <b>loophole</b> to alter an entrenched provision would likely be severe.|$|E

25|$|Current {{economic}} development reflects a quite remarkable {{improvement of the}} Swedish economy since the crisis in 1991–93, so that Sweden could easily qualify {{for membership in the}} third phase of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, adopting the euro as its currency. In theory, by the rules of the EMU, Sweden is obliged to join, since the country has not obtained exception by any protocol or treaty (as opposed to Denmark and the United Kingdom). Nevertheless, the Swedish government decided in 1997 against joining the common currency from its start on 1 January 1999. This choice was implemented by exploiting a <b>legal</b> <b>loophole,</b> deliberately staying out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. This move is currently tolerated by the European Central Bank, which however has warned that this would not be the case for newer EU members.|$|E
25|$|In February 2011 the ADB {{approved}} a $1bn 10year-facility for water supply in seven or more cities. In December 2015 the ADB {{approved a}} loan to expand a {{water treatment plant}} on the Da River to supply Hanoi with drinking water, replacing contaminated groundwater that is currently used to supply the city's residents. The loan proceeds will {{also be used to}} connect households west of the city along the transmission line from the Da River to Hanoi. However, in 2016 the Hanoi People's Committee awarded a licence to build another water treatment plant on the Duong River west of the city in an area without a distribution network. The licence was awarded without bidding, using a <b>legal</b> <b>loophole</b> that allows to bypass competitive bidding that is prescribed in a decree on Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) passed as recently as 2015. The private company that received the license is Vietnam-Oman Investment Company (VOI) – a joint venture of the State General Reserve Fund of Oman, State Capital Investment Corporation of Vietnam, state-owned technology enterprise Newtatco, VietinBank Capital, and the Hanoi Water Limited Company (Hawacom).|$|E
500|$|A {{common factor}} {{affecting}} {{the flavors of}} Bordeaux wines is the harvest yields of Cabernet Sauvignon. Throughout Bordeaux there is a legal maximum permitted yield of 50 hectoliters (hl) per hectare (ha). With the aid of global warming and vigorous rootstocks, many Bordeaux vineyards can easily surpass 60 hl/ha, with some estates {{taking advantage of the}} <b>legal</b> <b>loophole</b> of plafond limite de classement ("ceiling limit classification") that permits higher yields during [...] "exceptional" [...] years. This has had an adverse effect on the quality of production from some producers who regularly use grapes harvested at excessive yields. In recent years there has been more of an emphasis on keeping yields low, particularly for an estate's Grand vin.|$|E

500|$|Jill begins {{an affair}} with wealthy Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) and was {{convinced}} he would ask her to marry him, but he {{told her it was}} just a fling. Mortified, she quickly remarried John, much to the dismay of his children. Jill wanted another child, but John felt he was too old. She quickly got pregnant before he had a secret vasectomy. He wanted her to have an abortion but she didn't, and gave birth to Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). John and Jill continuously had arguments and she had {{an affair with}} Jed Sanders. Mamie found out and told John, ending the marriage. They had a bitter custody battle, but John suffered another stroke. Mamie confessed her love to John; Jill then paid her millions to leave town. John gained custody of Billy and left for New York. Later, Jill found a letter from Phillip Chancellor II which named her the sole owner of the Chancellor Estate; she evicted Katherine. Katherine found a <b>legal</b> <b>loophole,</b> allowing her to stay on the estate. Billy Abbott and Brock Reynold's teenage daughter MacKenzie Browning began a romance. [...] Jill had a brief romance with a young web designer, Sean Bridges (David Lee Russek). Katherine allowed ex-con Larry Warton (Shark Fralick) to move in for housework, and Jill had an affair with him but kept it secret because of his social class. Katherine found out and confronted Jill, who denied it. Jill even insulted Larry, causing him to show up at a Jabot board meeting and expose the affair.|$|E
500|$|In 1966 a new clubhouse was built, {{but there}} was little further {{development}} of the ground, although in the late 1980s the North Stand, which had been condemned by council officials was demolished and the clubhouse extended. [...] In 1982 the club was nearly evicted from the ground by the local council after its name change to Thanet United. [...] A <b>legal</b> <b>loophole</b> was discovered which meant that the lease on the ground was held in the name of Margate F.C. and therefore the renamed club was technically no longer permitted to use the stadium, but this was eventually resolved and the club was allowed to remain. [...] Upon promotion to the Football Conference in 2001 the club spent £175,000 on improvements designed to bring the stadium up to the standard required for that level of football, but soon afterwards launched an ambitious scheme to completely redevelop the site. [...] The club moved out and the old stadium, which was constructed mainly from timber and corrugated iron, was demolished in early 2003, but the local council disputed the plans submitted. [...] Although planned to be completed by August 2003, the redevelopment process lasted for three years, delayed by issues regarding planning permission for the commercial facilities the club wanted to build in addition to the stadium itself. [...] The team ground-shared with other Kent clubs for three seasons, but club officials' failure to confirm a return date to Hartsdown led to Margate's expulsion from the Conference National in 2004. [...] In 2005 the club was finally able to return to the ground, albeit with pre-fabricated stands and temporary buildings in place. [...] Five years later, plans for the redevelopment of {{the north end of the}} ground, reportedly including the construction of a new terrace, a bar, and a three-storey hotel, were approved. [...] Club chairman Keith Piper also announced that companies had expressed interest in paying for the naming rights of individual stands or even the entire stadium.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{powerful}} of Qutb's ideas was his belief that many who said they were Muslims were really not. Rather, they were apostates. That not only gave jihadists [...] "a <b>legal</b> <b>loophole</b> around the prohibition of killing another Muslim," [...] but made [...] "it a religious obligation to execute" [...] these self-professed Muslims. These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce sharia law.|$|E
40|$|Rabbinic law is {{particularly}} {{well known for}} its use of legal dodges and technical circumventions. This dissertation focuses on three main questions about such loopholes: 1) Why is rabbinic law so replete with them? 2) Are they always permitted, and if not, what are the parameters of their use? 3) What does the use of <b>legal</b> <b>loopholes</b> reveal about rabbinic views {{of the relationship between}} intention and action? We attempt to answer these questions by analyzing a particular subset of rabbinic <b>legal</b> <b>loopholes</b> known as ha`arama (cunning). Tracing the history and use of ha`arama from tannaitic to amoraic sources, this work places rabbinic <b>legal</b> <b>loopholes</b> in context of Biblical and Ancient Near Eastern worldviews, Greco-Roman perspectives, and later contemporaneous Zoroastrian approaches. Working with both tannaitic and amoraic materials, with Palestinian and Babylonian sources, we observe a progression within rabbinic thinking on this front: from rigid legal formalism to a concern for the inner spirit of the law, and from emphasis on the inner spirit of the law to an interest in the inner spirit of the individual legal agent...|$|R

2500|$|Two {{days after}} being {{appointed}} {{to his new}} position, the Daily Telegraph newspaper published front-page allegations that Alexander had exploited a <b>legal</b> <b>loophole</b> to avoid the payment of capital gains tax on a property he had sold in 2007 alleging that he had profited from a [...] "morally dubious" [...] loophole to avoid paying capital gains tax. A few days earlier, the same newspaper had caused the resignation of Alexander's predecessor David Laws after finding irregularities in his expenses claims.

2500|$|Marie Avis Walker {{exploited}} a <b>legal</b> <b>loophole,</b> {{which had}} first been exposed by somebody who, {{earlier in the}} seventies, had applied for permission to build [...] "a small cabin of clay and wattles made, nine bean rows, and a hive for honey bee" [...] on the Isle of Innisfree. This application was rejected in a decision by Sligo County Council, who claimed that it would hinder public amenities. When Marie Avis Walker made use of the loophole, she was more successful. She was granted planning permission for a shopping centre development in which Frescati was retained in its entirety. The developers were concerned {{that she was able}} to do this, even though she was not the owner of the land. The law was changed as a direct result of this, and it is not possible now to seek planning permission for land which you do not own. This event was important for another reason: though Marie Avis Walker proved that the shopping centre and Frescati House could co-exist, Roches rejected the possibility, and in doing so demonstrated their opposition to preserving Frescati.|$|E

2500|$|Following World War II, {{the sales}} and {{popularity}} of Champagne surged once more. Since 1950, sales have grown steadily, quadrupling in total to over 200 million bottles. The increase in worldwide demand has prompted the French authorities {{to look into}} expanding the region's AOC zone to facilitate more production. There still exist the business dynamic between vine growers and Champagne houses with majority of the region's 19,000 growers selling their grapes to the nearly 300 Champagne houses in production. Over time Champagne has become not only {{a reflection of the}} terroir of the Champagne region but also a brand in itself, with the Champenois vigorously defending that brand and the uses of the term [...] "Champagne". The popularity and success of Champagne has inspired many imitators around the world (such as Cava in Spain, Sekt in Germany and several American sparklers) but also within France itself with sparkling Cremants. The name [...] "Champagne" [...] is a protected designation of origin in the European Union and all wines produced and sold in the EU must conform to those standards and not label a wine as [...] "Champagne" [...] unless it comes from the Champagne AOC (in the United States there is a <b>legal</b> <b>loophole</b> for semi-generic terms). In 1985, use of the term méthode champenoise was also outlawed with producers of [...] "champagne style" [...] sparkling wine opting to uses phrases like méthode traditionnelle to signify that their wine is made using the same production methods as Champagne.|$|E
