40|$|Background and Objectives: Periodontal {{disease is}} a chronic {{disorder}} with a high prevalence. There are few studies {{about the role of}} diet in prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of consumption of <b>Chicory</b> <b>leaf</b> extract in adjunct with non-surgical periodontal therapies on serum antioxidant and lipid status. Materials and Methods: This study was a double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial conducted on 40 patients in Sina Hospital of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences (Iran) in 2014.  The intervention (n= 20) and control groups (n= 20) were allocated using blocked randomization. The intervention group received 2 capsules (2 g) of <b>Chicory</b> <b>leaf</b> extract daily for 8 weeks. All subjects underwent non-surgical periodontal therapy during the intervention period. Anthropometric indices, 24 -hour diet records, total antioxidant capacity, malate di-aldehyde (MDA), uric acid, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG) and HDL-c was measured before and after intervention. Results: The mean level of total antioxidant capacity (1. 89 ± 0. 49; 1. 20 ± 0. 25, respectively; P< 0. 001) and uric acid (7. 15 ± 1. 98; 4. 48 ± 1. 34, respectively; P< 0. 001) increased in the intervention group compared with the control group post intervention. The mean level of MDA decreased in the intervention group compared with the control group post-intervention (3. 01 ± 1. 15; 3. 97 ± 1. 19, respectively; P. d< 0. 001). Cholesterol difference was not significant pre- and post-intervention between the two groups (P= 0. 35). The mean level of serum triglyceride (TG) was significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group post intervention (149. 50 ± 97. 88; 109. 35 ± 58. 00, respectively; P. d< 0. 001). The mean level of HDL-c was also significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group post treatment (42. 25 ± 8. 47; 39. 80 ± 8. 94, respectively; P. d< 0. 001).

The traditional farm weed management system was always compared to an innovative system. The innovative strategy was the combination among preventive methods (false or stale seed-bed technique), cultural methods (crop spatial arrangement adjusted in order to improve machinery effectiveness) and direct control methods (flaming, hoeing, etc.). Different kinds of flex tine and rolling harrows (patented by the University of Pisa) and flamers were used for false or stale seed-bed technique. Precision hoes and hoe-conformed rolling harrows, equipped with elastic tines for selective in-row weed control, were used for post emergence interventions. The innovative weed management systems always resulted in significant weed abundance reductions (from 70 to 100 %), relevant yield increases (from 10 to 100 %) and high contractions of manpower requirement (from 20 to 80 %) compared to the standard systems.

40|$|Introduction: Radicchio (Cichorium intybus L.) is a <b>leaf</b> <b>chicory</b> and {{is grown}} as a leaf {{vegetable}} which usually has white-veined red or purple leaves and {{it belongs to}} the Asteraceae family. In several countries is consumed mainly as salad, but no studies on their elemental composition  has been done, principally in Brazil. Objective: The aim of present work was to measure the macroelements (Na, K, Ca, Mg and P) and microelements (Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Zn, Al, Cd, Ni, Co and Si) in the <b>leaf</b> <b>Chicory</b> used as human nourishment in the Campo Grande, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Method: Chemical digests of samples were prepared using HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 and then placed in the microwave digestion system. After digestion, the concentrations of the elements in <b>Leaf</b> <b>Chicory</b> were determined by the technique of Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP–OES, Thermo Scientific - iCAP 6000 Series). Results obtained of the concentrations of <b>leaf</b> <b>chicory</b> were compared with the dietary reference intakes. Results: Detected concentration of macroelements in <b>leaf</b> <b>Chicory</b> decreases in the order: K > P > Ca > Mg > Na. As well as the concentration of microelements decreases in the order: Fe > Al > Si > Mn > Zn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Cd > Mo > Co. <b>Leaf</b> <b>Chicory</b> is excellent source of K, Ca, Mg, P, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo and Zn for children and adults. On the other hand, <b>leaf</b> <b>chicory</b> is not considered a source of sodium for children and adults. Concentration of K, Cr, Fe, and Al are above the limit recommended limit by FAO/WHO (1984) and others countries. Conclusions: <b>Leaf</b> <b>Chicory</b> has macro and microelements in ample amount; it can be used as an important part of people's diets. Since it not exceed allowable limits set by WHO and FAO, RDA/AI and UL. Competent organs have not evaluated concentrations of elements as Al, Cd, Ni, Co and Si in order to establish a tolerable upper intake level or RDA/AI for human. The lack of studies of adverse effects following excess intake of a nutrient does not mean that adverse effects do not occur.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to set up and improve innovative strategies and machines for physical (mechanical and thermal) weed control in organic or “integrated” vegetables production in many important areas of Northern, Central and Southern Italy. Therefore, on-farm experiments were carried out since 1999 on fresh marketable spinach, processing and fresh market tomato, cauliflower, savoy cabbage, greenhouse cultivated <b>leaf</b> beet, garlic, <b>chicory,</b> fennel and carrot. These research activities started are still ongoing. The traditional farm weed management system was always compared to one or more innovative strategies that were defined according to the characteristics of the environment (i. e. soil type and conditions, water availability, etc.), typology of cultivation, crop rotation, expected technical and economical results. The innovative strategies were the combination among preventive methods (false or stale seed-bed technique), cultural methods (i. e. crop spatial arrangement that was often adjusted in order to improve operative machines effectiveness) and direct control methods (flaming, precision hoeing, etc.). Different kinds of specific implement such as flex tine and rolling harrows (patented by the University of Pisa, patent n.

40|$|Abstract Background Quantitative {{real-time}} {{reverse transcriptase}} {{polymerase chain reaction}} (qRT-PCR) is a sensitive technique for quantifying gene expression levels. One or more appropriate reference genes must be selected to accurately compare mRNA transcripts across different samples and tissues. Thus far, only actin- 2 {{has been used as}} a reference gene for qRT-PCR in chicory, and a full comparison of several candidate reference genes in chicory has not yet been reported. Results Seven candidate reference genes, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADHD), actin (ACT), β-tubulin (TUB), glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate-dehydrogenase (GADPH), histone H 3 (H 3), elongation factor 1 -alpha (EF) and 18 S rRNA (rRNA) were selected to study the expression stability for normalisation of gene expression in chicory. Primer specificity and amplification efficiency were verified for each gene. The expression stability of these genes was analysed across <b>chicory</b> root and <b>leaf</b> tissues using geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper software. ACT, EF, and rRNA were the most stable genes as identified by the three different analysis methods. In addition, the use of ACT, EF and GAPDH as reference genes was illustrated by analysing 1 - FEHII (FEHII) expression in <b>chicory</b> root and <b>leaf</b> tissues. These analyses revealed the biological variation in FEHII transcript expression among the tissues studied, and between individual plants. Conclusions geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper analyses indicated that ACT, EF and rRNA had the highest expression stability across leaf and root tissues, while GAPDH and NADHD showed relatively low expression stability. The results of this study emphasise the importance of validating reference genes for qRT-PCR analysis in chicory. The use of the most stable reference genes such as ACT and EF allows accurate normalisation of gene expression in <b>chicory</b> <b>leaf</b> and root tissues. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} used 15 simple {{sequence}} repeat loci to characterize the genetic diversity of the germplasm that originated the current industrial chicory and to establish the relationships between and inside Cichorium intybus L. and Cichorium endivia L. Initially we analyzed 19 cultivated C. endivia accessions, 27 wild and 155 cultivated C. intybus accessions distributed among three groups: 83 root chicories, 42 Witloof and 30 leaf chicories. The leaf chicories comprised cultivars corresponding to the Radicchio, Sugarloaf and Catalogne subgroups. The latter has not been previously included in any genetic diversity study. Subsequently, 1297 individuals from the 15 modern root chicory cultivars at {{the origin of the}} breeding of the current industrial root chicory cultivars were analyzed. Although the accessions of C. endivia and C. intybus were clearly separated from each other, seven wild C. intybus individuals were genetically closer to C. endivia than to C. intybus, revealing complex genetic interrelationships between these species.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Leaf</b> <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus subsp. intybus var. foliosum L.) is a diploid {{plant species}} (2 n = 18) of the Asteraceae family. The term "chicory" {{specifies}} {{at least two}} types of cultivated plants: a leafy vegetable, which is highly differentiated with respect to several cultural types, and a root crop, whose current industrial utilization primarily addresses the extraction of inulin or {{the production of a}} coffee substitute. The populations grown are generally represented by local varieties (i. e., landraces) with high variation and adaptation to the natural and anthropological environment where they originated, and have been yearly selected and multiplied by farmers. Currently, molecular genetics and biotechnology are widely utilized in marker-assisted breeding programs in this species. In particular, molecular markers are becoming essential tools for developing parental lines with traits of interest and for assessing the specific combining ability of these lines to breed F 1 hybrids. RESULTS: The present research deals with the implementation of an efficient method for genotyping elite breeding stocks developed from old landraces of <b>leaf</b> <b>chicory,</b> Radicchio of Chioggia, which are locally dominant in the Veneto region, using 27 microsatellite (SSR) marker loci scattered throughout the linkage groups. Information on the genetic diversity across molecular markers and plant accessions was successfully assessed along with descriptive statistics over all marker loci and inbred lines. Our overall data support an efficient method for assessing a multi-locus genotype of plant individuals and lineages that is useful for the selection of new varieties and the certification of local products derived from Radicchio of Chioggia. CONCLUSIONS: This method proved to be useful for assessing the observed degree of homozygosity of the inbred lines as a measure of their genetic stability; plus it allowed an estimate of the specific combining ability (SCA) between maternal and paternal inbred lines {{on the basis of their}} genetic diversity and the predicted degree of heterozygosity of their F 1 hybrids. This information could be exploited for planning crosses and predicting plant vigor traits (i. e., heterosis) of experimental F 1 hybrids on the basis of the genetic distance and allelic divergence between parental inbred lines. Knowing the parental genotypes would allow us not only to protect newly registered varieties but also to assess the genetic purity and identity of the seed stocks of commercial F 1 hybrids, and to certificate the origin of their food derivatives...|$|E
