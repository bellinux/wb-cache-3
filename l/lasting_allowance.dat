50|$|The <b>last</b> <b>allowance</b> {{requires}} Unit 5 to {{be active}} for 3-4 days each month at 10-15% of maximum capacity. In a typical year without any major emergency use, Unit 5 is expected to generate 125 GWh; 100 GWh is from emergency preparedness activities and 25G Wh from actual emergency use.|$|R

50|$|After three races from April to June as a {{three year}} old, {{he planned to}} train at Saratoga but he {{suffered}} multiple minor injuries which would force him to take nine months off. Finally, he returned as a four year old in another allowance. To begin the race, he settled off the leaders in seventh before moving up to sixth by {{the first quarter of}} a mile. Surprisingly in just {{a quarter of a mile}} he moved from sixth to second and was only a head behind the leader. By the far turn he had opened up one and a half lengths before holding on to win by one length at the wire. Just a month later he would be back and running in his <b>last</b> <b>allowance</b> race of his career. He stayed very close behind the leader by just one length. He then took the lead by half a mile in. The rest of the race was just opening up the lead to a whopping nine lengths, defeating New Orleans Handicap winner Nate's Mineshaft.|$|R

60|$|This, then, was the den,--the {{arena in}} which was to take place a memorable interview. But the thought of waiting an hour for the dragon to appear was disquieting. Stephen remembered that he had {{something}} over nine hundred dollars in his pocket (which he had saved out of his <b>last</b> year's <b>allowance</b> at the Law School). So he asked Mr. Richter, who was dusting off a chair, to direct him to the nearest bank.|$|R

[...] "I've {{got enough}} money {{left out of}} my <b>last</b> month's <b>allowance</b> because I didn't waste it all on candy as you did. You'll have to pay me back when you get your next month's jink, remember. I'll ask the conductor to tell us {{when we get to}} Marsden. Uncle Fred's house isn't far from the station, and we'll be sure to know it by all the cherry trees round it." ...|$|R
60|$|In such engagements {{the time}} passed until I {{might very well}} expect an answer from my father. Two mails {{followed}} each other, and brought nothing. By the third I received a long and almost incoherent letter of remorse, encouragement, consolation, and despair. From this pitiful document, which (with a movement of piety) I burned as soon as I had read it, I gathered that the bubble of my father's wealth was burst, that he was now both penniless and sick; and that I, so far from expecting ten thousand dollars to throw away in juvenile extravagance, must look no longer for the quarterly remittances on which I lived. My case was hard enough; but I had sense enough to perceive, and decency enough to do, my duty. I sold my curiosities--or, rather, I sent Pinkerton to sell them; and he had previously bought, and now disposed of them, so wisely that the loss was trifling. This, with what remained of my <b>last</b> <b>allowance,</b> left me {{at the head of}} no less than five thousand francs. Five hundred I reserved for my own immediate necessities: the rest I mailed inside of the week to my father at Muskegon, where they came in time to pay his funeral expenses.|$|R

40|$|Social {{security}} of women during pregnancy and maternity The purpose of thesis is to analyse social {{security of}} women during pregnancy and maternity {{in the current}} legislation. The thesis is composed of introduction, main part and conclusion. The main part is divided into six chapters. Chapter one describes historical development of social security of women during pregnancy and maternity in the Czech republic. Folowing two chapters focuse on social security of pregnat women and parents of small children in connection with membership of the Czech republic in international organisations and the European union. Chapter four characterises system of sickness insurance and benefits that are provided in case of maternity (maternity benefits, pregnancy and maternity compensation benefits, sick pay, care benefits). Chapter five analyzes system of state social support with benefits provided to pregnant women and parents (parental allowance, birth grant, child <b>allowance).</b> <b>Last</b> - sixth chapter complements {{the subject of the}} thesis with protection of pregnant women and parents with small children in labour-law. Conclusion summs up social security of women during pregnancy and maternity. Social benefits are above standarts and system is functional.

50|$|Those {{eligible}} for unemployment benefits receive them in two ways. A basic daily allowance of about 25 â‚¬ goes to any person looking for employment. This allowance was meanstested, and {{the income of}} a spouse could disqualify a potential beneficiary. The <b>allowance</b> <b>lasts</b> {{as long as the}} recipient was unemployed. Those unemployed who are members of an unemployment fund (about 80 percent of Finns are) and who have worked for at least 26 weeks in the preceding 2 years are {{eligible for}} more substantial benefits amounting to the daily basic allowance plus 45 percent of the difference between their daily wage and the basic allowance. After 100 days the payment is reduced by 20 percent. Beneficiaries of the income-related allowance could receive it for 500 days in a 4-year period. Workers in their late fifties and older who had been unable to find work can be granted an unemployment pension equal to a disability pension until they reached the age when they would be eligible for an old-age pension. Unemployment benefits are administered by the Social Security Institute. The basic allowance is completely financed by the state. Employers and the state fund equal shares of 95 percent of the income-related payments and the beneficiary is responsible for the remaining 5 percent.|$|R
6000|$|Yet {{enough of}} her country {{was left in}} her to make her courageous and {{independent}} of her past. They say that when she got the news she cried a little, and then laid the letter and {{what was left of}} her <b>last</b> monthly <b>allowance</b> in Madame Ablas' lap. Madame was devastated. [...] "But you, impoverished and desolated angel, what of you?" [...] "I shall get some of it back," [...] said the desolated angel with ingenuous candor, [...] "for I speak better French and English than the other girls, and I shall teach THEM until I can get into the Conservatoire, for I have a voice. You yourself have told papa so." [...] From such angelic directness there was no appeal. Madame Ablas had a heart,--more, she had a French manageress's discriminating instinct. The American schoolgirl was installed in a teacher's desk; her bosom friends and fellow students became her pupils. To some of the richest, and they were mainly of her own country, she sold her smartest, latest dresses, jewels, and trinkets at a very good figure, and put the money away against the Conservatoire in the future. She worked hard, she endured patiently everything but commiseration. [...] "I'd have you know, Miss," [...] she said to Miss de Laine, daughter of the famous house of Musslin, de Laine & Co., of New York, [...] "that whatever my position HERE may be, it is not one to be patronized by a tapeseller's daughter. My case is not such a very 'sad one,' thank you, and I prefer not to be spoken of as having seen 'better days' by people who haven't. There! Don't rap your desk with your pencil when you speak to me, or I shall call out 'Cash!' before the whole class." [...] So regrettable an exhibition of temper naturally alienated certain of her compatriots who were unduly sensitive of their origin, and as they formed a considerable colony who were then reveling in the dregs of the Empire and the last orgies of a tottering court, eventually cost her her place. A republican so aristocratic was not to be tolerated by the true-born Americans who paid court to De Morny for the phosphorescent splendors of St. Cloud and the Tuileries, and Miss Helen lost their favor. But she had already saved enough money for the Conservatoire and a little attic in a very tall house in a narrow street that trickled into the ceaseless flow of the Rue Lafayette. Here for four years she trotted backwards and forwards regularly to work with the freshness of youth and the inflexible set purpose of maturity. Here, rain or shine, summer or winter, in the mellow season when the large cafes expanded under the white sunshine into an overflow of little tables on the pavement, or when the red glow of the Brasserie shone through frosty panes on the turned-up collars of pinched Parisians who hurried by, she was always to be seen.|$|R
