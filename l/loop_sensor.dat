50|$|Single sensor {{lightning}} detectors {{have been}} used on aircraft and while the lightning direction can be determined from a crossed <b>loop</b> <b>sensor,</b> the distance {{can not be determined}} reliably because the signal amplitude varies between the individual strokes described above,and these systems use amplitude to estimate distance. Because the strokes have different amplitudes, these detectors provide a line of dots on the display like spokes on a wheel extending out radially from the hub {{in the general direction of}} the lightning source. The dots are at different distances along the line because the strokes have different intensities. These characteristic lines of dots in such sensor displays are called “radial spread”.|$|E
50|$|In some {{instances}} the stoplight traffic detector {{will not change}} the light for small vehicles such as motorcycles, scooters and particularly bicycles, because the induction <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> fails to detect the small vehicle. A vehicle with sufficient mass of metal such as steel interacts with the sensor's magnetic field causing the light to change at the appropriate time. Motorcycles and scooters have much less mass than cars, resulting in a failure to detect the vehicle, while bicycles {{may not even be}} constructed with metal. This situation most often occurs at the times of day when other traffic is sparse as well as when the small vehicle is coming from a direction that does not have a high volume of traffic. Most sensor traffic lights are capable of detecting these vehicles, but are not properly adjusted or calibrated initially, after road construction such as re-surfacing, or set too high in an attempt to avoid false triggers.|$|E

40|$|To {{measure the}} {{amplitude}} and {{phase of the}} non-axisymmetric radial magnetic field generated by the locked mode, 12 saddle <b>loop</b> <b>sensors</b> are newly developed on the J-TEXT Tokamak.

40|$|Traffic {{detectors}} support most {{traffic management}} applications, {{so it is}} important that a detector performs as expected. This study evaluates the performance of four <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> models and the Remote Traffic Microwave Sensor (RTMS), adding to the body of sensor performance knowledge through the use of new analytical techniques. The study collected contact closure data from all five of the detectors and concurrent video data. Each <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> was deployed following Caltrans guidelines for at least 24 hours across dual loop detectors in each lane of I- 80, north of Oakland, CA. The research examined various distributions of the individual vehicle actuations from each of the detectors. This exercise found two <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> models locked up and not provide any data to the controller although they appeared fully functional from the front panel. The median on-time varied between the RTMS and the loop sensors, as well as from one <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> model to the next, which means the occupancy measurements will also change. The video was used to manually validate each vehicle passage over extended periods, preselected at random, with the errors classified by type (e. g., non-detected vehicle) and source (e. g., due to a lane change maneuver). The RTMS exhibited problems due to occlusion and reflections, while two of the loop sensors exhibited non-negligible problems. Then, the detector data are aggregated and used to evaluate the performance of each sensor under standard operation. Next, the results of two earlier evaluations of the RTMS are presented. The reports have not been formally published and to address the omission, this section recaps the relevant portions of those two studies {{in the context of the}} results presented above. This first effort considered the aggregated data reported by the RTMS using its internal controller emulation in comparison to dual loop detectors. The RTMS occupancy and flow measures are shown to be noisier than loops, though the velocity estimates are almost as good as those from single loops. The second study considers aggregate measurements from the contact closure data, comparing the RTMS against the dual loop detectors. For reference, the work also compared one loop against another in a dual loop detector, with the spacing between loops being greater than the spacing between the reference loops and the RTMS detection zone. As is illustrated in this study, the RTMS shows lane dependent results. ...|$|E

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection is {{a standardized}} technique to qualify electrical insulation in machines and power cables. Several techniques that analyze the waveform of the pulses {{have been proposed}} to discriminate noise from PD activity. Among them, spectral power ratio representation shows great flexibility in {{the separation of the}} sources of PD. Mapping spectral power ratios in two-dimensional plots leads to clusters of points which group pulses with similar characteristics. The position in the map depends {{on the nature of the}} partial discharge, the setup and the frequency response of the sensors. If these clusters are clearly separated, the subsequent task of identifying the source of the discharge is straightforward so the distance between clusters can be a figure of merit to suggest the best option for PD recognition.

40|$|Dual loop speed traps have a {{distinct}} advantage over single loop detectors because the speed trap detection system is redundant. Each vehicle is observed twice under normal operating conditions, once at each loop. The two observations are normally used to measure velocity, but as this paper demonstrates, the redundancy {{can also be used}} to assess the performance of the speed trap and identify detector errors. At free flow velocities, the time each detector is occupied by a vehicle (i. e., the on-time) should be virtually identical, regardless of the vehicle length. Many hardware errors will cause the two on-times to differ. Exploiting this property, we develop a formal methodology for testing speed traps off-line and suggest ways to extend the work to on-line testing. The work is used to evaluate several <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> units, revealing problems in two models. A second example shows how the work can be used to detect crosstalk between sensor units...|$|E
