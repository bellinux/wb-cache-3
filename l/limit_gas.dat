This paper compares the performance of two types of hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (PCF), namely photonic bandgap PCF and kagomé-style PCF, and assesses their potential for online determination of the Wobbe index. In contrast to bandgap PCF, kagomé-PCF allows for reliable detection of Raman-scattered photons even below 1200 cm− 1, which in turn enables fast and comprehensive assessment of the natural gas quality of arbitrary mixtures...|$|E

We measured conductances of both layers to H 20 and 02 {{at various levels}} of eggshell hydration. Both the mineral ayer of the eggshell and the shell membrane offer significant resistance to diffusion of water vapor and oxygen in eggshells of the snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina. Conductance to water vapor increases in both the membrane and mineral ayer with increasing hydration of the eggshell, but conductance to oxygen decreases under similar conditions. Removal of the mineral layer increases conductance to oxygen in moist and dry eggshells, but decreases conductance at intermediate l vels of dehydration. Removal of the mineral layer consistently increases conductance to water vapor. The eggshell membrane accounts for 24 - 76 ~o f overall resistance to diffusion of water vapor.

40|$|Reported {{here is a}} novel sensor that {{utilizes}} {{a zeolite}} film to selectively <b>limit</b> <b>gas</b> exposure of the sensing surface. A unique amperometric sensor design based on a non-porous mixed conducting sensing electrode enables {{the formation of a}} continuous zeolite film covering the entire sensor surface. The sensor was tested in a variety of oxygen containing gases. The sensor without a zeolite film responded strongly to both oxygen and carbon dioxide at a bias of 1. 8 V. In contrast, the sensor coated with a zeolite film showed a discernable, but diminished response to oxygen, and a more marked drop in response to CO 2 indicating that the diffusion of oxygen through the zeolite film is preferential to that of CO 2. The response of the zeolite coated sensor to a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases is attributed primarily to the oxygen content. Expanding this concept using a variety of different zeolite structures covering an array of sensors, complete analyses of complex gaseous mixtures could be performed in a very small device.

40|$|Abstract. Molecular {{diffusion}} is {{an important}} mechanism for gas transport in various natural and man-made systems. This is particularly the case with soil covers installed on acid-generating mine tailings, where oxygen availability has to be controlled. One {{of the most important}} roles of such covers is to <b>limit</b> <b>gas</b> flux, which depends on the effective diffusion coefficient De of the cover materials. This paper presents an experimental procedure and results from oxygen diffusion tests performed on different types of materials, at various degrees of saturation. The determination of De in the laboratory from the test data is based on analytical and numerical solutions to Fick’s laws. The ensuing values of De are compared to values calculated from available models that relate De to basic material properties, including porosity and degree of saturation. Statistical indicators are used to evaluate the accuracy of selected models, individually and on a comparative basis. It is shown that modified versions of the Millington–Quirk (M-Q) and Millington–Shearer (M-S) models provide De values close to the measured data. A semi-empirical expression, ensuing from these models and measurements, is proposed as a simple means of estimating De...|$|E

Results showed that initial H 2 partial pressure higher than 800 mbars had a strong inhibitory effect on methane production. The total substrate degradation yields were also impacted, indicating a direct inhibitory effect on hydrolysis. Interestingly, when H 2 and CO 2 were both added, they were consumed by homoacetogenesis/methanogenesis until CO 2 was completely exhausted. CO 2 was found to be the limiting element in case of H 2 inhibition. The reversibility of H 2 inhibition was also investigated by adding CO 2 at different reaction times. Results showed that hydrolysis and methanogenesis inhibitions were fully reversible after CO 2 addition even after 18 days of operation.

CRT glasses were found to be strongly susceptible to both the duration of the firing at the sintering temperature and the furnace atmosphere (oxygen, air, nitrogen).
