He suggested he could purchase new tapes so that the BBC would have no need to erase the originals, but this was also turned down. Of the original 22 programmes, only eight still survive complete. A compilation of six half-hour programmes, The Best of What's Left of Not Only...But Also was shown on television and has been released on both VHS and DVD.|$|E

[...] My songs were pretty horrendous to begin with. [...] They kept getting better and better. [...] When I graduated, I started playing at open mics in bars in Boston. [...] Eventually {{discovered}} that there were folk clubs where people were actually listening, and not drinking and carousing while you played. [...] I got involved in that circuit. [...] I think that's why I've become so lyric conscious — because of those listening rooms, where {{you really have to}} rely on words in those situations." ...|$|E
500|$|Soviet {{forces were}} able to counterattack in some cases. [...] For example, the 4th Panzer Division fell into an ambush set by Dmitri Leliushenko's hastily formed 1st Guards Special Rifle Corps, {{including}} Mikhail Katukov's 4th Tank Brigade, {{near the city of}} Mtsensk. Newly built T-34 tanks were concealed in the woods as German armor rolled past them; as a scratch team of Soviet infantry contained their advance, Soviet armor attacked from both flanks and savaged the German Panzer IV tanks. For the Wehrmacht, the shock of this defeat was so great that a special investigation was ordered. Guderian and his troops discovered, to their dismay, that the Soviet T-34s were almost impervious to German tank guns. As the general wrote, [...] "Our Panzer IV tanks with their short 75mm guns could only explode a T-34 by hitting the engine from behind." [...] Guderian also noted in his memoirs that [...] "the Russians already <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> things." [...] In 2012, Niklas Zetterling disputed the notion of a major German reversal at Mtsensk, noting that only a battlegroup from the 4th Panzer Division was engaged while most of the division was fighting elsewhere, that both sides withdrew from the battlefield after the fighting and that the Germans only lost six tanks destroyed and three damaged. For German commanders like Hoepner and Bock, the action was inconsequential; their primary worry was resistance from within the pocket, not without.|$|E

To overcome this suspicion Corrie <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words of Arabic and participated in a mock trial denouncing the [...] "crimes of the Bush Administration". While the ISM members were eventually provided with food and housing, a letter was circulated in Rafah that cast suspicion on them."Who are they? Why are they here? Who asked them to come here?"

2500|$|The Battle of Bunker Hill {{occurred}} on June 17, 1775, {{in the early}} stages of the American Revolutionary War, when the American forces as a whole were not yet an organized army. After the Siege of Boston, the British needed to secure control of the Charlestown Peninsula overlooking Boston from the north across the Mystic River, giving them command of Boston Harbor and ultimately Boston itself. The Committee of Safety <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days in advance that the British were going to try to occupy Dorchester Heights and Charlestown Peninsula. The Patriot forces decided to take the offensive, occupy the peninsula, fortify it, and deny the British the advantage of this important and strategic location. Word of British intentions spread fast among the colonies. General Thomas Gage mistakenly assumed that taking the peninsula from untrained colonial [...] "rebels" [...] would be an easy task.|$|E
2500|$|The casting and {{character}} {{was announced in}} late May 2009. Casey Deidrick had joined the cast as Chad. Deidrick revealed {{in an interview that}} he originally auditioned for the role of Tad. Despite very positive feedback, Brendan Coughlin was cast in the role of Tad. Deidrick's audition caught the attention of casting director, Marnie Saitta and he was soon called back to audition for the newly created role of Chad. Deidrick tested opposite Taylor Spreitler, whom he had previously met through a mutual friend. Deidrick <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks later that he had won the role and signed the standard four-year contract. In the spring of 2013, the series released a casting call for an actor matching Deidrick's description which led to speculation that the role of Chad was to be recast. At the time, Deidrick's screen time had declined dramatically and he had also booked several guest appearances in prime time. On June 20, 2013, Deidrick confirmed his departure from the series through Twitter and posted a picture of his final script. Deidrick's last air date was October 30, 2013. Michael Fairman revealed that Deidrick made the decision to leave the series earlier that year and also hinted at the possibility of the role being recast. Deidrick told Soap Opera Digest that he wouldn't be opposed to a decision to recast, if it happened. However, the actor also said he was open to return to the series for future guest stints. Of his departure, Deidrick said, [...] "I basically wanted to pursue other opportunities." [...] However, Deidrick was grateful for all he learned. In June 2014, a picture of a script autographed by the Days of our Lives cast members was auctioned off at a charity event, and Billy Flynn was one of the signatures. On August 12, 2014, the producers officially confirmed Flynn's casting to Soap Opera Digest. Flynn was cast in the role of Chad and his first airdate was September 12, 2014.|$|E

60|$|When he {{left that}} city he was but sixteen, and was, {{as he had}} cause to realize during the {{following}} twelve months, merely an average American boy, {{with a certain amount}} of alertness, self-reliance and common sense; though he might, perhaps, have had more of these desirable qualities, had he not been a trifle spoiled by his widowed mother before he went to Gorton school. He had, quite apart from his lessons, <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> useful things there which probably he would never have learned at home, but he had been suddenly recalled, and his mother had informed him that it was now impossible for him to enter the profession for which he had been intended. Frank did not understand all the reasons for this, but he knew that they were connected with the fall in value of some railroad stock and the failure of a manufacturing company in which his mother held shares.

60|$|Taking Feuerbach's romantic {{narrative}} of 1832, we find him averring that, about 4.30 P.M. on Whit Monday, May 26, 1828, a citizen, unnamed, was loitering at his door, in the Unschlitt Plas, Nuremberg, intending to sally {{out by the}} New Gate, {{when he saw a}} young peasant, standing in an attitude suggestive of intoxication, and apparently suffering from locomotor ataxia, 'unable to govern fully the movements of his legs.' The citizen went to the boy, who showed him a letter directed to the captain of a cavalry regiment. The gallant captain lived near the New Gate (654 paces from the citizen's house), and thither the young peasant walked with the citizen. So he could 'govern fully the movements of his legs.' At the house, the captain being out, the boy said, 'I would be a horseman as my father was,' also 'Don't know.' Later he was taken to the prison, up a steep hill, and the ascent to his room was one of over ninety steps. Thus he could certainly walk, and when he spoke of himself he said 'I' like other people. Later he took to speaking of himself as 'Kaspar,' in the manner of small children, and some hysterical patients under hypnotism. But this was an after-thought, for Kaspar's line came to be that he had only <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words, like a parrot, words which he used to express all senses indifferently. His eye-sight, when he first appeared, seems to have been normal, at the prison he wrote his own name as 'Kaspar Hauser,' and covered a sheet of paper with writing. Later he could see best in the dark.|$|E
