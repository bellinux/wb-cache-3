40|$|Cylactin® {{consists}} of dehydrated cells of {{a strain of}} Enterococcus faecium. It is authorised for use in feeds for chickens, turkeys and pigs for fattening, piglets, sows, calves and cats and dogs. The applicant is now seeking re-evaluation when used with calves and a new authorisation for use in feed for goat kids and lambs for rearing and for fattening at 1. 0 x 109 - 6. 6 x 109 CFU/kg feed. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics, except for kanamycin which is considered of no concern. There were no adverse effects seen in calves when Cylactin® was administered at a 100 -fold overdose. Consequently, Cylactin® is considered safe for calves for fattening and for rearing at the recommended dose. This conclusion was extended to kids for fattening and rearing. However, <b>lambs</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> are not considered a minor species and require a separate demonstration of safety which was not provided. No additional concerns would arise for consumers, users and the environment from the proposed extension of use. Seven trials made with calves for fattening or rearing were considered. Use of the additive with calves for fattening significantly increased final body weight and/or daily gain in four of five trials when used at a dose of 1 x 109 CFU/kg complete feed. An additional study with calves for rearing confirmed these results at the same dose. As the mechanism of action of the additive can be reasonably assumed to be same, the positive results seen in calves for fattening and rearing can be extrapolated to kids for rearing and fattening.

40|$|Traditionally, most {{smallholder}} {{farmers in}} Goma {{and elsewhere in}} Ethiopia engage in sheep and goat fattening to generate sufficient income to meet household requirements and other social obligations. A rapid assessment with IPMS project partners in Goma found that traditional sheep fattening is constrained by inadequate feed supply, low nutritive value of available feed resources, and lack of technical knowledge which resulted in prolonged fattening period and low economic return. Accidental death or loss of fattened animals for various reasons is another challenge for vulnerable smallholders, especially if sheep are purchased on credit. During discussion with various stakeholders, several potential interventions were identified to initiate a more commercially oriented small ruminant enterprise addressing some of the constraints with new interventions. These included i) reduced fattening periods through supplementary feed using locally available cotton seed meal (CSM), ii) piloting a community-based/managed livestock insurance scheme with 120 target farmers in Kilole PA, iii) introducing an innovative credit scheme through Oromia Credit and Saving Share Company (OCSSCo) for entrepreneurial fattening, and iv) introducing leguminous forage seed multiplication by model farmers. Meetings were held by the district OoA staff in some Peasant Associations to discuss identified problems and potential interventions. Subsequently, one pilot Peasant Association that agreed to include women in the program was selected. Other discussions/trainings were also held with farmers and project partners to develop community-based livestock insurance scheme and to increase knowledge and skills on supplementary feeding and forage (seed) production and selection of <b>lambs</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> Following the value chain approach, linkages were created with the woreda veterinary services and an oil extraction factory in the District capital which produced cotton seed meal; this had never {{been used in the}} District before. We facilitated the linkage of target farmers with OCSSCo. Data were collected from all 120 target farmers using a questionnaire and group discussion. The study showed that more than 74 % of the farmers managed to shorten the fattening period by 50 %, i. e. from six months to three months. In the course of first cycle, 510 sheep were fattened of which 15 died. Thirteen (13) were immediately refunded by the community-based livestock insurance scheme and 2 claims were rejected by the livestock insurance capital managing committee based on conditions spelled out in the by-laws. Average return from five sheep in one cycle was about Ethiopian birr (ETB) 1 450. Loan repayment by women participants was 100 %, and some male farmers defaulted. Scaling out is taking place, which includes fattening more sheep per cycle by some entrepreneurial female farmers. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} how forage triticale in diets <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> broilers influence the body weight and weight gain of broiler chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The survey was conducted on 400 chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> provenance Ross 308 for a period of 42 days. On this occasion, four groups of chickens were formed, with 100 chickens being treated in each group, as follows: K (classic mixture <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> broilers) and O-I (mixtures with triticale variety Kg 20), O-II (mixtures with triticale Favorit) and O-III group (mixtures with triticale Trijumf). The highest average body mass in the groups of chickens (male, female and chicks of both sexes), was scored by broiler chickens of O-II-group. The minimum food consumption for 42 -day-old chicks was achieved by group O-I (4. 275 kg), and the most by O-II group (4. 359 kg). Chickens of O-II- and III-O-group had the best feed conversion, while the chickens of O-I-group had a slightly poorer feed conversion. The mortality of the groups of chickens for the entire period of the study was the lowest in O-II-group, at 2. 0 %, and the highest mortality was found in O-III-group (6. 0 %). The production index was the highest in O-II-group (202. 726) and the lowest in O-I-group. The results achieved in this research indicate that the use of tested triticale cultivars significantly affected the weight gain and body mass of chicks and have nutritional and economic justification.

40|$|Amaferm is the {{fermentation}} {{product of}} a non-pathogenic and non-genetically modified strain of Aspergillus oryzae mixed with wheat bran as carrier. It is proposed {{to be used as}} feed additive to dairy cows and cattle <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at doses between 2 and 5 g head- 1 day- 1 in order to improve production performance. According to Regulation (EC) No 1831 / 2003, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) should deliver an opinion on the efficacy and the safety of the product Amaferm for the target animals, consumers, users and the environment. Amaferm {{has been shown to be}} capable of producing a positive effect on milk yield of dairy cows. However, evidence has only been provided for a dose of 3 g head- 1 day- 1 instead of the minimum recommended dose of 2 g head- 1 day- 1 claimed by the Applicant. However, only one out of four studies with cattle <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> showed a persistent improvement of weight gain and feed conversion with Amaferm. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers the data provided to be insufficient to draw final conclusions on efficacy of Amaferm in cattle <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> kept under common production conditions...|$|R

40|$|Utilization of Philiostigma reticulatum (DC.) Hochst. Pods and Cajanus Cajan (L.) Millsp. Leaves in Combination of Urea <b>for</b> <b>Fattening</b> Mossi Type and South Djallonke Sheep in Burkina. The study {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} Piliostigma reticulatum pods (PrP) and Cajanus cajan leaves (CcL) <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> sheep. The results indicate that both PrP and CcL provide adequate nutrition <b>for</b> growing <b>lambs.</b> However, when used to replace the cottonseed meal (CSM) on a same dry matter weight part basis, the substitution causes total nitrogen to decrease in the diet. These ingredients must be used in combination with adequate level of CSM and probably with a higher energy/nitrogen ratio. Benefit-cost analysis shows that diets involving less than 30 % of external inputs provide the highest benefits...|$|R
