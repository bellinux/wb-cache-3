The rest of the party arrived at the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, but quickly retreated back to Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Archie Comics, {{publisher}} of the main Sonic the Hedgehog comics, started a Sonic X series in 2005. It was originally set to run for only four issues, but was extended to 40 issues due to high demand. The last issue was released on January 1, 2009, and <b>led</b> <b>into</b> the first arc of the Sonic Universe series. The comics were written by Ian Flynn, who also authors the main comic series. Some issues were published in Jetix Magazine in the United Kingdom and Italy.|$|E

2500|$|By early summer, Forrest {{commanded}} a new brigade of [...] "green" [...] cavalry regiments. In July, he <b>led</b> them <b>into</b> Middle Tennessee under orders {{to launch a}} cavalry raid.

5|$|During the battle, the RAF had {{suffered}} a serious loss of experienced pilots. In mid-September, Fighter Command could call upon 1,492 operational pilots against an establishment of 1,662 – a deficiency of 10%. Many of the pilots were ineffective unless <b>led</b> <b>into</b> battle by experienced men. Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding's policy was to move in fresh squadrons from quieter areas to replace losses in the units in the south-east as they became exhausted. By early September, the system was breaking down as squadrons were becoming depleted before fresh units could be formed and take their place.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{was named}} to the 26-player roster for the {{national}} team's first training camp in 2016. The camp <b>led</b> <b>into</b> a match against Ireland on January 23. Harris suited up for the match but did not make an appearance. Harris was subsequently named to the 20-player roster for 2016 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying. The United States qualified to the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after a semifinal win against Trinidad & Tobago on February 19. The United States {{went on to win the}} tournament after defeating Canada 2–0.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Pollack’s career <b>led</b> <b>into</b> politics. A summer {{internship}} {{with the}} American Jewish Congress prompted a one-year role with the AJC. He {{worked as a}} lobbyist on legislation that would permit religious headwear for active military personal in noncombat settings. Pollack then relocated to Los Angeles to work for Winner & Associates, a leading political public relations firm. He was assigned to consult the Major Baseball League during the labor strife in the early-1990s. The inception of Pollack’s career in sports business occurred in 1992 when he realized—while flying from LA to New York—that there was a niche {{to fill in the}} industry.|$|E

5|$|The castle design {{formed an}} inner and an outer ward, {{surrounded}} in turn by a moat, now partially filled. The main {{entrance to the}} castle was the Gate next the Sea, next to the castle's tidal dock that allowed it to be supplied directly by sea. The dock was protected by a wall later named the Gunners Walk and a firing platform that may have housed a trebuchet siege engine during the medieval period. The Gate next the Sea <b>led</b> <b>into</b> an outer barbican, protected by a drawbridge, arrow slits and murder-holes, leading on into the outer ward.|$|E
5|$|The ground floor, {{accessed}} {{directly from}} the outside courtyard, <b>led</b> <b>into</b> a portcullis-protected, vaulted passage, eleven feet wide and extending {{the depth of the}} building. On either side of the passage were two vaulted rooms. The room nearest the entrance on the right was a guardroom or the porter's room, which housed a well; the back-right room, with a garderobe located in the south west turret (accessed via a passage running along the south wall), was for an official. The other two rooms to the left were used to house staff or storage.|$|E

5|$|Aristodemus: The lone Spartan {{survivor}} of the slaughter of the 300 at the Battle of Thermopylae had, with a fellow Spartiate, been dismissed from the army by Leonidas I because of an eye infection. However, his colleague had insisted on being <b>led</b> <b>into</b> battle, partially blind, by a helot. Preferring to return to Sparta, Aristodemus was branded a coward and suffered a year of reproach before Plataea. Anxious to redeem his name, he charged the Persian lines by himself, killing in a savage fury before being cut down. Although the Spartans agreed that he had redeemed himself, they awarded him no special honour, because he failed {{to fight in the}} disciplined manner expected of a Spartan.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{causeway}} was a large hall leading to a pillared open court surrounded by magazine chambers. The court <b>led</b> <b>into</b> the mortuary temple proper which housed statues of the king and where the offerings to the deceased took place. This was immediately adjacent to {{the eastern side of the}} pyramid, which was surrounded by an enclosure wall defining the sacred space. At the southeast corner of the enclosure was a small satellite pyramid for the Ka of the king. The internal chambers of the pyramid were entered in 1881 by Gaston Maspero, who thus discovered the pyramid texts. The burial chamber housed nothing but a black basalt sarcophagus sunk into the floor and a canopic chest. The sarcophagus proved to contain scattered bones, which may belong to Unas.|$|E

O'Brien {{was pleased with the}} run and said that Duke of Marmalade was still improving. On his final start of the year he was brought back to one mile for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in which he led until the last quarter mile, setting a strong pace, before finishing third to Ramonti and Excellent Art.|$|E

5|$|In 548, Emperor Justinian {{dispatched}} 8,000 {{men under}} Dagisthaeus, who {{together with a}} Lazic force set siege to the Persian garrison at Petra. As the Persians were well provisioned, the siege dragged on. Dagisthaeus had neglected to keep watch over the mountain passes that <b>led</b> <b>into</b> Lazica, and a far larger Persian relief force under Mihr-Mihroe arrived and raised the siege. Yet, the Persians lacked sufficient supplies, and so, after strengthening the garrison at Petra and leaving further 5,000 men under Phabrizus to secure its supply routes, Mihr-Mihroe left. In the spring of the next year, Gubazes and Dagisthaeus combined their forces, destroyed Phabrizus's army in a surprise attack, and pursued the survivors into Caucasian Iberia. In the same summer, they won another victory against a new Persian army, led by Khorianes. The allies failed, however, to prevent another Persian army from reinforcing Petra, and Dagisthaeus was recalled and replaced by Bessas.|$|E
5|$|King Leopold II, the Belgian {{king and}} {{ruler of the}} Congo Free State, {{acquired}} the Lado Enclave in South Sudan from Britain in 1894 {{as part of a}} territory exchange which gave the British a strip of land along the eastern Congo for Belgian access to the navigable Nile. However, the territory was overrun with Mahdist rebels who had established their stronghold at the town of Rejaf, which occupied a valuable position for trade along the Nile river. After a wave of new funding from the Belgian government in 1895, King Leopold ordered an expedition to be <b>led</b> <b>into</b> the Lado Enclave to expel the Mahdists and fortify Rejaf as a strategic military and trading outpost.|$|E
5|$|Like Yellowstone National Park before it, Yosemite National Park was {{at first}} {{administered}} by various units of the United States Army. Captain Abram Wood led the 4th Cavalry Regiment into the new park on May 19, 1891, and set up Camp A.E. Wood (now the Wawona Campground) in Wawona. Each summer, 150 cavalrymen traveled from the Presidio of San Francisco to patrol the park. Approximately 100,000 sheep were illegally <b>led</b> <b>into</b> Yosemite's high meadows each year. The Army lacked legal authority to arrest the herders, but instead escorted them several days' hike from their flock, which left the sheep vulnerable. By the late 1890s sheep grazing {{was no longer a}} problem, but at least one herder continued to graze his sheep in the park into the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|On 24 November 2008, 14 league {{games into}} the 2008–09 season, Fàbregas was named as the {{successor}} to William Gallas as club captain. However, just as Arsenal were getting back into the title race after a poor start to the season, the Spaniard was ruled out for four months after sustaining a knee injury against Liverpool. The Gunners eventually finished the season without any silverware, coming in fourth {{in the league and}} being knocked out at the semi-finals of the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. In tandem with Arsenal's policy to groom its young players, the team that Fàbregas <b>led</b> <b>into</b> the new season consisted mostly of the same young nucleus as before, with the likes of Nicklas Bendtner, Gaël Clichy, Abou Diaby, Denílson, Samir Nasri, Alex Song and Theo Walcott in tow.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 1998 a Yugoslav Army (VJ) {{border patrol}} ambushed over 200 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) insurgents and foreign mujahideen {{just west of}} Dečani, on the {{frontier}} between Albania and Yugoslavia. The ambush resulted {{in the deaths of}} four KLA fighters and 18 mujahideen (mostly citizens of Saudi Arabia). Another six KLA fighters were arrested by the Yugoslav authorities and charged with illegal entry and gunrunning. The VJ reported seizing a significant amount of arms and ammunition that the militants had been smuggling. One Yugoslav border guard was seriously wounded in the clash. According to Israeli historian Shaul Shay, the ambush represented the first clash of the Kosovo War between the VJ and foreign mujahideen. Human Rights Watch advisor Fred C. Abrahams suggests {{it is possible that the}} mujahideen were deliberately <b>led</b> <b>into</b> a trap by the KLA as part of a plan to reduce the influence of Islamic extremists within the KLA's ranks.|$|E
5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto the roof to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is <b>led</b> <b>into</b> the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E
