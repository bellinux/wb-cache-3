2500|$|The {{biggest change}} for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame {{construction}} from the unit-construction of the 1971 models. The new chassis was a perimeter design {{that was used to}} help give the Torino a quieter and more isolated ride. It featured an energy absorbing [...] "S" [...] shaped front end, torque boxes to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five solid cross members. The front suspension used an unequal length control arm design, with a computer selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> much like the fullsize Ford LTD. The rear used the [...] "Stabul" [...] four link suspension with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The new suspension and chassis had a wheel track at least [...] wider than the 1971 models. [...] Motor Trend stated the [...] "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" [...] in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, the heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks. [...] Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty rear upper control arms and bushings, a larger front sway bar, and the addition of a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option. [...] The only exceptions were that power brakes were standard on the Gran Torino Squire station wagons and a mandatory option for all [...] powered models. The power steering was revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> in the {{previous}} S-Class was switched to a spring link and torque strut.|$|E
2500|$|Also new, the {{double-wishbone}} front suspension had ball joints, {{upper and}} <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> coil springs and shock absorbers above the upper control arms; {{as well as}} trailing struts on the <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> The [...] "Magnum 500" [...] road wheels were now standard, but the new [...] "Machine" [...] 15x7inch slot-styled wheels were optional.|$|R

50|$|Many modern {{implementations}} {{replace the}} <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> by a wishbone. An anti-roll bar is optional and if present is attached by a ball-jointed rod to the spring-damper or by a ball or elastomerically jointed rod to the wishbone.|$|E
5000|$|A simple [...] "axle" [...] type {{which usually}} carries the <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and {{steering}} rack.|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} Independent damper struts {{with separate}} coil springs and gas-pressurised shock absorbers, triangular <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> with anti-dive geometry and stabiliser bar.|$|R
5000|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} upper and <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> with coilover shocks. A common misconception with this platform {{is that the}} front end has struts; however, since there is an upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> they are actually coilover shocks. Brakes were a vented rotor / single-piston caliper with Sport model Thunderbirds receiving a larger diameter rotor. The rear suspension consisted of upper and <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> with coil spring and shock. Varying sway bar diameters were used among the different models of Cougar and Thunderbird. All MN12 cars shipped from the factory with a 5 x 4.25" [...] (5x108mm) lugnut bolt pattern.|$|R
50|$|Other {{vehicles}} of the 1960s era, including some Vauxhalls, had lower ball joints with considerable end float, because the joint {{was always in}} tension as the spring and damper loads were applied via the <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> and were always non-zero.|$|E
50|$|A similar, but simpler {{concept to}} the Weissach axle {{is seen in}} the rear {{suspension}} of the second generation Mazda RX-7. Instead of an extra link, a special bushing is used in the same position in the <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> to perform a similar function.|$|E
50|$|All late model M3s {{received}} subframe re-inforcements {{and more}} aggressive front end suspension geometry {{due to the}} differences in caster and camber yielded by top hat design and <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> bushings. Additionally, front spring rate was increased in addition to spindle and control arm geometry changes.|$|E
50|$|Front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} MacPherson struts and the rear suspension is independent semi-trailing arms. In 1982, the front suspension was upgraded to include twin-pivot <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and {{the geometry of}} the rear suspension was revised.|$|R
2500|$|The 1970 Javelins {{featured}} a new front-end design {{with a wide}} [...] "twin-venturi" [...] front grille incorporating the headlamps and a longer hood. It also had a new rear end with full-width taillamps and a single center-mounted backup light. This was a one-year-only design. Side marker lights were now shared with several other AMC models. The exterior rear view mirror {{featured a}} new [...] "aero" [...] design {{and in some cases}} matched the car's body color. The three [...] "Big Bad" [...] exterior paints continued to be optional on the 1970 Javelins, but they now came with regular chrome bumpers. Underneath the restyle was a new front suspension featuring ball joints, upper and <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> coil springs, and shock absorbers above the upper <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> as well as trailing struts on the <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The B5 S4 is {{fitted with}} 4-wheel {{independent}} suspension. The front suspension is a multi-link design with four individual <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> per wheel. The rear suspension is an unequal length double wishbone design; the <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> are mounted to a subframe which also carries the differential housing. Shock absorbers, coil springs, and anti-roll bars are fitted front and rear.|$|R
50|$|A {{modified}} front suspension setup received <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> pivot points. The Series II update {{featured the}} addition of a new rear cross member, revised rear control arm assemblies with new style bushing and toe-control links to the semi-trailing arm rear suspension to better maintain the toe settings during suspension movements, resulting in more predictable car handling, noticeably over uneven surfaces, and improved tyre wear.|$|E
50|$|In the {{attached}} {{photograph of a}} double-wishbone suspension, the knuckle is shown attached to the upper control arm {{at the top and}} the <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> at the bottom. The wheel assembly is shown attached to the knuckle at its center point. Note the arm of the knuckle that sticks out, to which the steering mechanism attaches to turn the knuckle and wheel assembly.|$|E

50|$|In an automobile, {{the spindle}} {{is a part}} of the {{suspension}} system that carries the hub for the wheel and attaches to the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> The spindle is referred to as an upright in UK-built vehicles and in areas dominated by cars designed for the UK, like Australia, New Zealand etc.|$|R
50|$|The 1978 Fleetwood Brougham {{was built}} as body on frame construction. It used a ladder type frame with welded cross members. The front {{suspension}} used the traditional upper and <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> integral steering knuckle, arm and caliper support, integral hubs and rotors on spindles, {{tapered roller bearings}} with spherical joint, independent coil springs, link-type stabilizer bar, and hydraulic Direct Action shock absorbers.|$|R
5000|$|The Cobra R wheels were {{actually}} the optional 17" [...] x 8" [...] five-lug wheels from the soon-to-be-released 1994 Mustang GT, {{but they were}} painted gloss black with a chrome lug cover. The wheels were wrapped with Goodyear Gatorbacks, which were the standard Cobra tires. To give the car better front-end geometry, <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> from the 1994 Mustang were fitted.|$|R
5000|$|Front-wheel {{alignment}} {{was made}} easier with and with greater accuracy {{by moving the}} camber adjustment from the upper to the <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> on the double wishbone suspension, and the caster angle adjustments also moved from the upper control arm to the drag strut. At midyear, AMC's new top engine, the AMX 390 CID L [...] V8 became an option in the Ambassador line, bringing the total engine options up to four.|$|E
5000|$|Later that year, on December 23, 2014, another recall {{was issued}} for all Porsche 918 {{vehicles}} that were manufactured from February 25, 2014 to September 18, 2014 as the, [...] "front lower control arms may fracture." [...] The NHTSA stated that, [...] "fracture of a <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> while {{the vehicle is}} being driven {{increases the risk of}} a crash." [...] Remedy parts were not expected to be available until the end of February, 2015.|$|E
50|$|The Vega’s suspension, live rear axle, 53.2% front/46.8% rear weight distribution, low {{center of}} mass and neutral {{steering}} give good handling. Lateral acceleration capacities are 0.90 g (standard suspension) and 0.93 g (RPO F-41 suspension). Steering box and linkage are ahead of the front wheel centerline, with a cushioned two-piece shaft. Front suspension is by short and long arms, with <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> bushings larger than on the 1970 Camaro. Four-link rear suspension copies the 1970 Chevelle. There are coil springs all around.|$|E
50|$|While the engine, gearing, and chassis of the DA-4 were {{unchanged}} {{from the}} original Dixi 3/15 PS DA-1, the DA-4 was a step away {{from the original}} Austin design. The DA-4 was the first BMW automobile with independent front suspension, which used the ends of the transverse leaf spring to act as <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> with further wheel location performed by two diagonal leading arms.|$|R
50|$|The 321 was {{introduced}} {{at the start}} of 1939 as a successor to the BMW 320. It sat on a shortened version of the BMW 326 chassis. The 321 differed from the 320 in its front suspension, its larger tyres, and its styling. While the 320 used front suspension derived from the BMW 303, with a high mounted transverse leaf spring and <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> the 321 used the front suspension from the 326, with upper <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and a low mounted transverse leaf spring.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} other D3 sedans, the Ford Taurus is {{configured}} with four-wheel independent suspension, featuring MacPherson struts and rearward-facing lower L-arms with a stabilizer bar {{in the front and}} a multilink coilover shock setup with stamped steel <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and cast upper <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> in the rear. As with the previous-generation Taurus (Five Hundred) and the Ford Crown Victoria, the sixth-generation Taurus features four-wheel antilock disc brakes. On all models, AdvanceTrac combines traction control and stability control. Torque Vectoring Control and Curve Control is an option for all-wheel drive models.|$|R
50|$|The SY II {{received}} a revised front suspension {{to address a}} well-documented weakness in the front lower ball joints. Specifically, the original design had the ball joints under constant tension, which resulted in some complete failures of the joint (causing the wheel to detach from the suspension and steering) and premature wear requiring <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> replacements after as little as 30000 km. With the new design, the lower ball joints were now under compression, thus eliminating the premature wear issue.|$|E
50|$|If one of {{the ball}} joints does not carry spring load, it may be fitted with an {{internal}} anti-rattle spring to keep the ball preferentially in contact with one seat. This {{was the case in}} the BMC Mini of 1959 and its many derivatives, where the <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> carried no vertical loading, so the joint needed and anti-rattle spring, while the top joint, comprising identical parts, was always in compression due to spring (rubber cone) and damper loads, and so was not fitted with a spring.|$|E
50|$|Refined {{over several}} decades of two-digit Saab models, the 900's double {{wishbone}} suspension design provided excellent handling and road feel. The rear suspension comprised a typical beam axle design, stabilized with a Panhard rod. However, the attachment points between the axle and chassis made up an unusual configuration that, in essence, {{consists of two}} Watt's linkages {{at either end of}} the axle: A <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> attaches the axle to the bottom of the vehicle, while an upper link attaches at the top but faces towards the rear, unlike a typical 4-link design with both lower and upper links facing forward.|$|E
5000|$|The front {{suspension}} {{was fully}} independent, with MacPherson struts, pressed steel <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> and an anti-roll bar. The front suspension, {{together with the}} major mechanicals (engine and transmission) is remotely mounted on a front subframe. On front wheel drive models, the rear suspension is semi independent, consisting of a torsion beam axle linked to trailing arms, with double conical coil springs and direct acting telescopic hydraulic shock absorbers, with certain models also having an anti roll bar.|$|R
25|$|The Fairlane/Torino {{continued}} to be constructed with unit-construction like the 1967 models. The new car {{continued to}} use the same suspension as 1967 models, which was coil springs pivot mounted on an upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> and a strut stabilized <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> in front, with long semi-elliptical leaf springs on a solid axle in rear. A heavy-duty suspension option was available for V8 powered cars, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. Steering was recirculating ball system, with power steering optional. All cars came standard with four-wheel drum brakes, although front disc brakes and power assist were options.|$|R
25|$|Newly {{available}} for the Mustang GT for 2010 were two performance packages. The 3.73 Axle Package featured higher performance front brake pads, a more aggressive 3.73:1 rear axle, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system. The Track Package featured higher performance front and rear brake pads, stabilizer bars and rear <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> from the GT500, uniquely tuned shocks and struts, Pirelli summer tires (includes automatic upgrade to 19-inch wheels), a 3.73:1 rear axle with carbon plates in the differential, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system.|$|R
