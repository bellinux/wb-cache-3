5|$|While both {{settings}} seem {{to suggest}} that Madonna's characters live in the barrio and may be Latina themselves, the portrayal of Madonna in the dancing scenes (lush, flashy, colorful) contrasts with the <b>Latinos</b> <b>in</b> the street (sparsely worn out dresses). She dances around and even flirts but does not get really involved with them as the last scene shows Madonna dancing off the screen. The video symbolizes the link between Latino culture and Catholicism. The two characters symbolize the restrained and passionate sides of Catholicism, which author Rettenmund has described as Madonna's take on the religion.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, the Democratic-dominated state {{legislature}} {{passed a bill}} requiring payment of a poll tax for voting, which effectively disenfranchised most blacks, and many poor whites and <b>Latinos.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the legislature established white primaries, ensuring that minorities {{were excluded from the}} formal political process. The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties. The Socialist Party became the second largest party in Texas after 1912, coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the United States during fierce battles in the labor movement and the popularity of national heroes like Eugene V. Debs. The Socialists' popularity soon waned after their vilification by the United States government for their opposition to US involvement in World War I.|$|E
