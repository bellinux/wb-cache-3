25|$|Yala {{is one of}} the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 {{bird species}} of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed {{bee-eater}} and brown-capped babbler. The number of waterbirds inhabiting wetlands of Yala is 90 and half of them are migrants. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck, garganey), cormorants (little cormorant, Indian cormorant), large waterbirds (grey heron, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, Asian openbill, painted stork), medium-sized waders Tringa spp., and small waders Charadrius spp. are among the most common waterbirds. Black-necked stork and lesser adjutant are many of the rare birds that {{can be seen in the}} park. The migrant great white pelican and resident spot-billed pelican are also have been recorded. Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include <b>lesser</b> <b>flamingo,</b> pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, godwits, and ruddy turnstone. The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew. Rock pigeon, barred buttonquail, Indian peafowl, black stork, black-winged stilt, and greater flamingo are among the other bird species. Crested serpent eagle and white-bellied sea eagle are the raptors of the park. The forest birds are orange-breasted green pigeon, hornbills, Old World flycatchers, Indian paradise flycatcher, Asian barbets, and orioles.|$|E

5000|$|According to Chris Magin, the RSPB's {{international}} {{officer for}} Africa, [...] "The chance of the <b>lesser</b> <b>flamingoes</b> continuing to breed {{in the face}} of such mayhem are next to zero. This development will leave <b>lesser</b> <b>flamingoes</b> in East Africa facing extinction". Seventy-five percent of the world's <b>lesser</b> <b>flamingoes</b> are born on Lake Natron. Currently a group of more than fifty East African conservation and environmental institutions are running a worldwide campaign to stop the planned construction of the soda ash factory by Tata Chemicals Ltd of Mumbai, India and National Development Corporation of Tanzania.

50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>flamingo</b> may be {{the most}} {{numerous}} species of flamingo, with a population that (at its peak) probably numbers up to two million individual birds. This species feeds primarily on Spirulina, algae which grow only in very alkaline lakes. Presence of flamingo herds near water bodies is indication of sodic alkaline water which is not suitable for irrigation use. Although blue-green in colour, the algae contain the photosynthetic pigments that give the birds their pink colour. Their deep bill is specialised for filtering tiny food items. The <b>lesser</b> <b>flamingo</b> also feeds on shrimp.|$|E
50|$|Lac de Guiers is {{designated}} an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International; the key {{species are}} <b>lesser</b> <b>flamingo</b> (Phoeniconaias minor), glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), African spoonbill (Platalea alba), white-winged tern (Chlidonias leucopterus) and river prinia (Prinia fluviatilis).|$|E

50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>{{flamingo}}</b> (Phoenicoparrus minor) is {{a species}} of flamingo occurring in sub-Saharan Africa with another population in India.

50|$|Wildlife {{includes}} springbok, oribi, blesbok and red hartebeest. Numerous {{bird species}} occur, including the great crested grebe, knob-billed duck, pink-billed lark, black-bellied bustard, African grass-owl and bigger birds like the yellow-billed duck, greater flamingo, <b>lesser</b> <b>flamingo,</b> whiskered tern, osprey {{and a few}} fish eagle.|$|E

50|$|The birds {{migrate from}} Etosha, {{in the border}} state of Namibia. Greater {{flamingos}} feed on brine shrimps (Artemia), worms and tiny crustaceans, while the <b>lesser</b> <b>flamingos</b> feed on algae; all are plentiful in the warm shallow waters of salt pans.|$|R
50|$|There are sandy islets of thorny scrub, {{forming a}} {{wildlife}} sanctuary and {{a breeding ground}} for some of the largest flocks of greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>flamingos.</b> Wildlife, including the Indian wild ass, shelter on islands of higher ground, called bets, during the flooding.|$|R
50|$|The {{prominent}} wildlife {{species in}} the sanctuary are reported to number 165 bird species. The sanctuary is of international importance due to its population of 250,000 <b>lesser</b> <b>flamingo</b> (Phoenicopterus minor) and greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus), which visit the sanctuary every year during the winter period to breed, after the rainy season, when the water sources are full.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} season of 2007/8 almost two {{thousand}} pairs of <b>lesser</b> <b>flamingo</b> bred on the island, producing an estimated 9,000 chicks.
