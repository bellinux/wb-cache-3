50|$|Like {{the other}} 650-cc models, the Trophy gained unit {{construction}} in 1963. This traded some smoothness for {{performance as a}} few pounds were lost. Coil ignition replaced the magneto. For 1964, the bike received stronger front forks, which improved handling. The Smiths Chronometric instruments were replaced by the magnetic type. In 1965, a <b>locating</b> <b>pin</b> for finding top dead center was added to allow timing {{without the use of}} a dial gauge.|$|E

50|$|To {{ensure that}} the rail tracks on the train ferry or car float and the linkspan align {{precisely}} {{it is necessary for}} the ship to have a ledge at its stern onto which the linkspan is rested. To be certain that the rail tracks do not have a step at the junction of ship and linkspan, this ledge or shelf must be of a depth {{the same as that of}} the end of the linkspan. It is also fitted with a <b>locating</b> <b>pin</b> that ensures the linkspan is in the exact athwart ships (sideways) position.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lens mount}} is not {{identical}} across all variants, thus {{there is a}} marked difference between a BNC and BNCR mount, for instance. BNCR is only the current convention {{as it was the}} last version of the camera and in relatively current use through until the 1990s. The mount contains four pronged flanges only one of which contains a notch towards the center. This notch is used to align the mount to a <b>locating</b> <b>pin</b> located approximately 45 degrees clockwise {{from the top of the}} camera's lens mount. This radial indexing is of particular importance when shooting an anamorphic format (CinemaScope or Panavision, or equivalent). The mount is locked into place using a friction locking ring which, in conjunction with the four prongs of the flange, creates a very strong lens seating. The quality of this design has been a key influence in the design of the Arri PL and Panavision PV mounts, both of which are the main film camera mounts in use today, and both of which have four-pronged flanges oriented based on locating pin-notch combinations. The Arri PL mount in particular is very similar in appearance to the BNCR mount, the only immediately apparent difference being the ability to seat any of the four notched prongs against the <b>locating</b> <b>pin.</b> (The flange focal distance and diameter also differ.) ...|$|E

50|$|From March 1942, {{there was}} less {{pressure}} to placed the CA-12 into production as multiple USAAF units, operating a mixture of P-40 and P-39 fighters, were being deployed in strength to northern Australia; the RAAF had also began to receive new Kittyhawk fighters as well. In June 1943, manufacturing work upon the original order for 105 CA-12s was completed. During production of this batch, several modifications and improvements were incorporated onto the CA-12, these included the strengthening of the spinner back plates and belly tank <b>locating</b> <b>pins,</b> the installation of underwing night flying identification lights, and a revised electrical starter system; many of these modifications would be retrofitted onto early production models at operational bases as well.|$|R
5000|$|The mount itself {{contains}} four pronged flanges, one {{of which}} contains a <b>locating</b> <b>pin</b> in the center. This pin is normally seated {{at the bottom of}} the camera lens mount, the usual location where a complementary hole exists. The mount is locked into place using a friction locking ring which, in conjunction with the four prongs of the flange, creates a very strong lens seating. This has become a crucial factor in recent years, as bigger lenses with zoom capabilities, longer focal lengths, or larger lens elements have raised the bar on requirements for mount stability.|$|E
50|$|Bolsters {{could be}} fixed in place, or be removable. Some {{had as many}} as five bolsters. Some designs had {{multiple}} sockets and a pair of bolsters could be moved between them. The bolsters could even be allowed to swivel around a central <b>locating</b> <b>pin,</b> and curved steel rubbing strips on the wagon deck. The design of bogie bolster wagons had developed from earlier timber wagons: these were short four-wheeled wagons, each carrying a single swivelling bolster. A pair of such wagons could carry a large treetrunk to a sawmill, but they required either the tree to take the full tension of the train or for a suitable number of match wagons to be marshalled between the two bolster wagons. The long, but relatively lightweight, bogie bolster replaced this with a single wagon.|$|E
50|$|The mount {{contains}} four pronged flanges {{which each}} contain a notch towards the center. Any {{of these four}} notches {{can be used to}} align the mount to a <b>locating</b> <b>pin</b> located approximately 45 degrees clockwise {{from the top of the}} camera's lens mount. This means that the lens can be oriented in any of four different configurations, which may be decided by factors such as focus puller position, camera position, and preference to working with meters or feet (if a lens has different line indicators on each side). The mount is locked into place using a friction locking ring which, in conjunction with the four prongs of the flange, creates a very strong lens seating. This has become a crucial factor in recent years, as bigger lenses with zoom capabilities, longer focal lengths, or larger lens elements have increased the need for mount stability due to the greater stress placed upon the mount by these devices.|$|E
5000|$|In movie cameras, the {{two most}} popular mounts in current usage on {{professional}} digital cinematography cameras are Arri's PL-mount and Panavision's PV-mount. The PL-Mount is used both on Arri and RED digital cinematography cameras, which [...] are the most used cameras for films shot in digital. The Panavision mounts are exclusively used with Panavision lenses, and thus are only available on Panaflex cameras or third-party cameras [...] "Panavised" [...] by a Panavision rental house, whereas the PL-mount style is favored with most other cameras and cine lens manufacturers. Both of these mounts are held in place with <b>locating</b> <b>pins</b> and friction locking rings.

40|$|Accurate, {{reliable}} and economical methods of determining stress distributions {{are important for}} fastener joints. In the past the contact stress problems in these mechanically fastened joints using interference or push or clearance fit pins were solved using both inverse and iterative techniques. Inverse techniques {{were found to be}} most efficient, but at times inadequate in the presence of asymmetries. Iterative techniques based on the finite element method of analysis have wider applications, but they have the major drawbacks of being expensive and time-consuming. In this paper an improved finite element technique for iteration is presented to overcome these drawbacks. The improved iterative technique employs a frontal solver for elimination of variables not requiring iteration, by creation of a dummy element. This automatically results in a large reduction in computer time and {{in the size of the}} problem to be handled during iteration. Numerical results are compared with those available in the literature. The method is used to study an eccentrically <b>located</b> <b>pin</b> in a quasi-isotropic laminated plate under uniform tension...|$|R
40|$|Compliant {{mechanisms}} with ultrahigh precision motion {{are being}} increasingly used for several applications including micromeasurement, micro/nanomanipulation, microfabri-cation, and so on. Flexure linkages offer inherent advantages of being frictionless, highly repeatable, and having great design flexibility. Monolithic fabrication of these mecha-nisms limits {{the use of}} multiple materials for optimized design and is expensive or infeasi-ble especially for three-dimensional mechanisms. An alternative method of assembling components of a compliant mechanism is considered in this paper and design for assem-bly guidelines are put forth. It is found that if each of the connections of a compliant mechanism is constrained exactly using two pins as per the traditional practice, internal stresses are generated in the links and their warping does not allow the desired operation of the mechanism. The proposed guidelines, which are based on Grubler’s criteria, include a simple formulation to determine number of <b>locating</b> <b>pins</b> {{to be used in the}} entire assembly. Further, these guidelines also determine the locations of these pins. Several compliant mechanisms were fabricated and assembled using these guidelines and were found to be working satisfactorily.

40|$|In {{machining}} process, fixture {{is used to}} {{keep the}} position and orientation of a workpiece with respect to machine tool frame. However, the workpiece always cannot be at its ideal position because of the setup error and geometric inaccuracy of the locators, clamping force, cutting force, and so on. It is necessary to predict and control the workpiece locating error which will result in machining error of parts. This paper presents a prediction model of a workpiece locating error caused by the setup error and geometric inaccuracy of locaters for the fixtures with one locating surface and two <b>locating</b> <b>pins.</b> Error parameters along {{6 degrees of freedom}} can be calculated by the proposed model and then compensated by either using the “frame transformation” function of a numerical control (NC) system or modifying NC codes in post-processing. In addition, machining error caused by the workpiece locating error can be predicted based on a multi-body system and homogeneous transfer matrix. This is meaningful to fixture design and machining process planning. Finally, a cutting test has shown that the proposed method is practicable and effective...|$|R

50|$|Various {{materials}} {{are used in}} the construction of compression driver diaphragms including titanium, aluminium, phenolic impregnated fabric, polyimide and PET film, each having its own characteristics. The diaphragm is glued to a voice coil former, typically made from a different material from the dome, since it must cope with heat without tearing or significant dimensional change. Polyimide film, Nomex, and glassfibre are popular for this application. The suspension may be a continuation of the diaphragm and is glued to a mounting ring, which may fit into a groove, over <b>locating</b> <b>pins,</b> or be fastened with machine screws. The diaphragm is generally shaped like an inverted dome and loads into a series of tapered channels in a central structure called a phase plug, which equalizes the path length between various areas of the diaphragm and the horn throat, preventing acoustic cancellations between different points on the diaphragm surface. The phase plug exits into a tapered tube, which forms the start of the horn itself. This slowly expanding throat within the driver is continued in the horn flare. The horn flare controls the coverage pattern, or directivity, and as an acoustic transformer, adds gain. A professional horn and compression driver combination has an output sensitivity of between 105 and 112 dB/watt/meter. This is substantially more efficient (and less thermally dangerous to a small voice coil and former) than other tweeter construction.|$|R
