2500|$|Some {{drinkers}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> {{sugar or}} honey, creating mate dulce or mate doce (sweet mate), instead of sugarless mate amargo (bitter mate), a practice {{said to be}} more common in Brazil outside its southernmost state. Some people also <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> lemon or orange peel, some herbs or even coffee, but these are mostly rejected by {{people who like to}} stick to the [...] "original" [...] mate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wheat sold badly last fall, and Elcot has, no doubt, {{his share}} of worries?" [...] he suggested. [...] "You {{naturally}} wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> to them?" ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Aldclyffe read, or {{pretended to}} read after the lawyer. When he had finished, five {{lay in the}} group he had selected. 'Would you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> to the number?' he said, turning to the lady.|$|E
5000|$|Franklin <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> his wit <b>to</b> {{many of his}} forecasts, {{much like}} his {{counterpart}} Lixion Avila {{and in contrast with}} the often dry commentary of other forecasters. For example: ...|$|R

2500|$|Examination {{of other}} major van Eyck works reveals similar {{developments}} from the underdrawing, {{and in the}} course of painting, in these works. [...] It seems van Eyck, perhaps acting with clerical advisers, although he appears to have been a considerable reader himself, <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> further complexity <b>to</b> his compositions in the course of work on them.|$|R
6000|$|... "She sings {{almost as}} well as I do, and I shall <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> her songs to the many I already know," [...] said the blackbird, who had lovely concerts in the meadow all by himself.|$|E
60|$|I said I {{had asked}} for letters at the post-office, but there were none for Mr. Redmond. I did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> that I had been ashamed, after the first week, to write to my mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "It does," [...] Cathro admitted, grimly, [...] "but if {{what you}} wanted was a written {{certificate}} of character I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> this, that never did any boy sit on my forms whom I had such a pleasure in thrashing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Leo, [...] "looked at in {{the right}} way, that is in thy way, the thing is simple." [...] I {{think he would have}} <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>add,</b> [...] "as lying," [...] but as the phrase would have {{involved}} explanations, did not. [...] "Yet, Ayesha," [...] he went on, [...] "hast thou thought that this discovery of thine will wreck the world?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Imagine your aunt's {{wanting to}} know!" [...] I had to {{separate}} from Miss Tita with only those words, though I should have <b>liked</b> immensely <b>to</b> <b>add,</b> [...] "For heaven's sake meet me tonight in the garden!" ...|$|R
50|$|Jimmy has A.D.D and {{the other}} {{students}} can’t relate on why Jimmy does the things he does, so the teacher {{comes up with a}} plan so every student knows what it feels <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have <b>A.D.D.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It was all right, sir," [...] said Brune, without visible emotion; [...] "I escaped and {{returned}} to my colors--the Confederate colors. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> that before deserting from the Federal service I had earnestly asked a discharge, on the ground of altered convictions. I was answered by punishment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure, yes, and the {{day before}} yesterday, and seemed quite disappointed. 'Is there {{anything}} Monsieur would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> to his message?' I asked. 'No,' said he, 'or stay, tell him that all goes well in the north, but he must not leave Paris until I see him.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very good, but don't buy it {{when any}} other {{customer}} {{is in the}} shop. And, by the way, take Mrs. Lumley's portmanteau--the lock needs mending--to Jones's in Sloane Street to be repaired. One thing more, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> a few lines to that manuscript I gave you to keep in your safe.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [40] I should <b>like</b> further <b>to</b> <b>add</b> the {{expression}} of my indebtedness to two works by Herr Julius Lippert, Der Seelencult in seinen Beziehungen zur alt-hebraischen Religion, and Die Religionen der europäischen Culturvölker, both published in 1881. I have found them full of valuable suggestions.|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{kept the}} store at Coniston," [...] {{answered}} Cynthia, smiling a little sadly. She would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have <b>added</b> that William Wetherell {{would have been}} a great man if he had had health, but she found it difficult to give out confidences, especially when they were in the nature of surmises.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot but conclude," [...] he said, [...] "that your errand {{involved}} the recital {{to my wife}} of some trouble in which you find yourself. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> that if a certain amount is needed to set you free from any debts you may have contracted, {{in addition to this}} annuity, you will not find me unreasonable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add,</b> Lady Delahaye," [...] I continued, [...] "that our housekeeper, who {{has been}} in the service of my family for over thirty years, has willingly {{undertaken}} the care of the child, and I can assure you, in case you should have any anxieties concerning her, that she will be as safe under our charge as in your own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> some {{beauty to}} life," [...] said Anne dreamily. [...] "I don't exactly {{want to make}} people KNOW more [...] . though I know that IS the noblest {{ambition}} [...] . but I'd love to make them have a pleasanter time because of me [...] . to have some little joy or happy thought that would never have existed if I hadn't been born." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You TRUST? Look yer, young man," [...] she said, {{with her}} quick, fierce, little laugh, [...] "I reckon you TRUST a heap too much!" [...] She would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have <b>added,</b> [...] "with your {{freckled}} face, red hair, and little eyes"--but {{this would have}} obliged her to face them again, which she did not care to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord Nunneley," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "I am only {{anxious to}} do what Lady Olive wishes. If you will go home and tell her exactly what you have told me, I should <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>add</b> {{that it is only}} her {{happiness}} that I wish, and that if she desires to release me, I shall accept her decision without a murmur." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jonathan is an {{openly gay}} man. But {{he is not}} overly camp or effeminate. He is well spoken but can unleash his sharp wit on others. Bodie was often asked by fans about his own sexuality. The actor {{took it as a}} {{compliment}} because he felt like he portrayed Jonathan's homosexuality in an accurate manner. Bodie had to tone down his own [...] "over-the-top" [...] personality while playing Jonathan. He <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> his own ideas into the characterisation but during filming directors often refused. Bodie quipped that he did not do the role justice unless directors told no more than times. Bodie said that he has a similar energy to Jonathan who is always trying to cheer the other characters up. He said that he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> play such characters because you can be more creative. He added that Jonathan often gets to play out the show's comic relief because he is not [...] "necessarily straight laced, boring or the lead character." ...|$|R
60|$|We need {{scarcely}} {{say that}} the mountain {{turned out to be}} a British man-of-war. Ruby was quickly introduced to his future messmates, and warmly received by them. Then he was left to his own free will during the remainder of that day, for the commander of the vessel was a kind man, and did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> to the grief of the impressed men by setting them to work at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have known}} it for some time," [...] said Andre-Louis. [...] "Though I didn't suspect your attack of the disease to be quite so violent. Well, God knows I loved her, too, quite enough to share your thirst for killing. For myself, the blue blood of La Tour d'Azyr would hardly quench this thirst. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> to it the dirty fluid that flows in the veins of the unspeakable Binet." ...|$|E
6000|$|As for Reggie Nettlecraft and his wife, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> {{that they}} are getting on quite as well as could be expected. Reggie has joined his Sissie on the music-hall stage; and all those who have {{witnessed}} his immensely popular performance of the Drunken Gentleman before the Bow Street Police Court acknowledge without reserve that, after [...] "failing for everything," [...] he has dropped at last into his true vocation. His impersonation of the part {{is said to be}} [...] "nature itself." [...] I see no reason to doubt it.|$|E
50|$|Scenario 1: The {{decision-maker}} {{could make}} their Vacation Activity decision while knowing what Weather Condition will be <b>like.</b> This corresponds <b>to</b> <b>adding</b> extra informational arc from Weather Condition to Vacation Activity {{in the above}} influence diagram.|$|R
5000|$|Concluding: [...] "When {{asked by}} the Commons Culture Media and Sport elect Committee CMS {{committee}} what he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see as a priority in the DCMS document arising from the 'Understanding the Future' consultation, Mr MacGregor responded 'I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see <b>added</b> there the need to conserve and research the collections, so that the collections can really play the role across {{the whole of the}} United Kingdom that they should.'So would we." ...|$|R
60|$|I said I {{would gladly}} do so, and thanked {{her for the}} permission; then she {{immediately}} offered to accompany me. I protested very ungallantly that I was a fast walker, and reminded her that the sun was excessively hot, and I should also have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> that she was excessively fat. She replied {{that it did not}} matter; so polite a person as myself would know how to accommodate his pace to that of his companion. Unable to shake her off, I started for my walk in a somewhat unamiable mood, the stout lady resolutely trudging on at my side, perspiring abundantly. Our path led us down to a little cañada, or valley, where the ground was moist and abounding with numerous pretty flowers and feathery grasses, very refreshing to look at after leaving the parched yellow ground about the estancia house.|$|R
60|$|And {{thus the}} hours passed away, all too quickly, {{and each of}} them strove to be merry, in order to keep up the spirits of the other. But it is not in human nature to feel cheerful with a lump of ice upon the heart! Dinner was even more dismal than breakfast, and Pigott, who had been {{informed}} of the impending misfortune, and who was distrustful of Philip's motives, though she did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> to the general gloom by saying so, made, after the manner of half-educated people, a painful and infectious exhibition of her grief.|$|E
60|$|Recollection of the {{subsequent}} proceedings is not, so far as I am concerned, amusing. By a miracle of good luck--they say Providence watches over certain of us--the incident happened in Carlsruhe, where I possess a German friend, an official of some importance. Upon {{what would have been}} my fate had the station not been at Carlsruhe, or had my friend been from home, I do not care to dwell; as it was I got off, as the saying is, by the skin of my teeth. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> that I left Carlsruhe without a stain upon my character, but that would not be the truth. My going scot free is regarded in police circles there to this day as a grave miscarriage of justice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wayne's varsity {{players of}} last year have been barred by the directors. They made their choice, and so should abide by it. They have had their day, and so should welcome the {{opportunity}} of younger players. But I am constrained to acknowledge that neither they nor the great body of undergraduates welcomed the change. This, more than anything, proves to me the evil of championship teams. The football men, the baseball men, the crew men, and all the student supporters want to win all the games all the time. I {{would like to ask}} you young gentlemen if you can take a beating? If you cannot, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> that you are not yet fitted to go out into life. A good beating, occasionally, is a wholesome thing.|$|E
60|$|Grace {{suggested}} {{communication with}} the clergyman of the parish; but the North Hill {{turned out not to}} belong to St. Norbert's proper, being a part of a great moorland parish, whose focus was twelve miles off. A district was in course of formation, and a church was to be built; but in the meantime the new houses were practically almost pastorless, and the children and their matron must take their chance on the free seats of one of the churches of St. Norbert's. The staff of clergy there were so busy that no one <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> extra parochial work to their necessary duties, and there was not sufficient acquaintance with them to judge how they would view Mr. Mauleverer's peculiarities. Clerical interference was just what Rachel said she did not want; it was an escape that she did not call it meddling.|$|R
5000|$|Customers order their pita {{based on}} the main {{ingredient}} (offerings include Philly cheesesteak, falafel and chicken souvlaki, {{with the exception of}} their [...] "garden pita") and then the customer specifies the other ingredients they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be <b>added</b> from selection of cheeses, (offerings include feta, cheddar, and Swiss), a salad bar (offerings include alfalfa sprouts, jalapeño, and pineapple), and a selection of sauces and spreads (including tzatziki, Caesar salad dressing, and honey mustard).|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} ten locomotives {{proved to}} be extremely useful during the First World War, hauling heavy munitions and military supply trains from the marshalling yard at Three Bridges to Newhaven or Littlehampton harbours. Up to sixty supply trains a day were being handled by these two ports. Locomotives in the class were capable of hauling trains of up to 1,000 tons at 30-35 mph, but were equally useful when hauling troop trains. The railway would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have <b>added</b> <b>to</b> their number, but wartime restrictions on locomotive building prevented this.|$|R
