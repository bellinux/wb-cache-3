5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{is managed}} {{as part of}} the Tomaree National Park. Access to the lighthouse is difficult, either through a narrow spit of sand at <b>low</b> <b>tide</b> or by boat.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreck of}} the SS Vina, a cargo steamer built in 1894, {{can be seen at}} <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b> In 1944, she was {{anchored}} offshore for use as an RAF target when a gale dragged her to her present location and sank her. After the war, some of the wreck was salvaged as scrap. The remains of the Vina are accessible at <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> but visiting them is potentially hazardous as the wreck is quickly cut off and submerged by the incoming tide. A warning sign on the wreck advises anyone reaching it to return to the beach immediately.|$|E

5|$|The atoll {{consists}} of four islets: Acadia, Pandora, Westward and Edwards. The last three of these can be accessed on foot from Acadia at <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b> The islets were named by Harald Rehder and John Randall, who visited the atoll during an expedition by the Smithsonian Institution in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The beach of Weston Bay lies on {{the western}} edge of the town. The upper part is sandy, but the sea retreats a long way at <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> exposing large areas of mud flats (hence the colloquial name of Weston-super-Mud). The tidal range in this part of the Bristol Channel is great, and since beach and mud flats are on a gentle slope, it is inadvisable to try to reach the sea at <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> as the sand gives way to deep mud which has often {{resulted}} in loss of life over the years. Driving on the beach is permitted in certain areas, but occasionally the drivers are caught unawares as they drive too close to the sea and break through the sand into the underlying mud, and are then stuck.|$|E
5|$|After {{the closure}} of Dunston Staithes in 1980, the Swing Bridge {{downstream}} of the stations seldom had to be opened. (Because Bessie Surtees was low lying, {{it was able to}} pass underneath the bridge at <b>low</b> <b>tide.)</b> However, on 15 December 1975, Bessie Surtees collided with the Swing Bridge, forcing it to close for the rest of that weekend.|$|E
50|$|The inner islands {{comprise}} Mataora (Round Rock), Pararaki (Seagull Rock) and Motuotamatea (Snapper Rock). Mataora {{connects to}} the mainland at <b>low</b> <b>tides,</b> as does Motuotamatea on very <b>low</b> spring <b>tides.</b> Pararaki is separated from Mataora by a 20 meter wide channel.|$|R
5000|$|Daby, Woodley and Indian Island {{are in the}} North Bay and {{all three}} are within the City of Eureka. <b>Low</b> <b>tides</b> reveal two more islands named Bird Island and Sand Island which was formed from dredge spoils left in the early 20th century. [...] A large {{eelgrass}} bed in the South Bay which may be exposed at <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> is locally known as Clam Island.|$|R

5|$|At around 1:30am {{the tide}} had risen {{enough to allow}} the LFEE's {{floating}} fire engine to arrive on the scene. Braidwood had called for the engine five hours previously, but the <b>low</b> <b>tide</b> had hampered its progress from its downriver mooring at Rotherhithe. Once it arrived it was effective in bringing under control the fire that had taken hold in the Speaker's House.|$|E
5|$|By the 17th century, {{coastal erosion}} had {{undermined}} the castle's walls. In 1627, Charles I {{announced that he}} would repair the fortification but instead the ruins were dismantled in 1631 by Sir John Oglander. A new fortification, Sandown Fort was built in its place, positioned further inland, but the possible remains of the foundations of the original castle are still visible along the shore at <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} coast are Goat Cave and Clamshell Cave. The latter is 10m high, about 6m wide at the entrance, and some 45m long, and {{on one side of}} it the ridges of basalt stand out like the ribs of a ship. Near this cave is the {{pyramidal}} rock islet of Am Buachaille ('The Herdsman'), a pile of basalt columns seen fully only at <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b> Other outlying rocks include Eilean Dubh to the north-west and a series of skerries stretching for half a kilometre to the south-west. On the southwest shore are Boat Cave and Mackinnon's Cave (named after a 15th-century abbot of Iona), which has a tunnel connecting it to Cormorant Cave. These caves lie to the south-west and can be accessed from the bay of Port an Fhasgaidh at <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b> In 1945 a mine exploded near Boat Cave, causing damage to the cliff face which is still visible. Mackinnon's Cave is 107 metres long.|$|E

5|$|The {{beach is}} popular with summer tourists, {{and has a}} {{campsite}} on the nearby fields. The beach has a snack bar and restaurant and associated amenities to cater for the increased public demand in recent years. There is an expansive rocky beach at <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> with a stretch of sand towards the far west, and views of the Bristol Channel and the coastline of Somerset, with the landmark white roof of Butlins, Minehead.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} {{islands of the}} Monach Islands (Heisgeir), Ceann Iar, Ceann Ear and Shivinish are {{connected}} at low tides. It is said {{that at one time}} it was also possible to walk all the way to Baleshare, and on to North Uist, five miles away at <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b> In the 16th century, a large tidal wave was said to have washed the route away.|$|E
5|$|A new wooden {{northern}} jetty {{was added}} in 1872 which allowed {{the removal of}} the original western landing place. Another jetty was built on the south west corner in 1898 which reached deep water even at <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> thus allowing steamers to use the pier at all states of the tide. This was damaged in a gale in 1903, and although it was rebuilt in 1909, it closed in 1916 and was dismantled in 1923. The northern jetty had also been damaged in the 1903 storm but was replaced by the present steel structure in 1905.|$|E

40|$|Somalian {{populations of}} the {{intertidal}} gastropod Nerita textilis Gmelin show a vertical separation between resting (mid-upper eulittoral) and feeding (lower eulittoral) zone. During high tides and mostly diurnal <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> some snails remain scattered (SF), while other form aggregations (AF) at lower levels of the rocky shore. During the mostly nocturnal <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> both SF and AF migrate downward to feed on microalgae. © 1984, Brill. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
50|$|The {{mangrove}} oyster {{is found}} in tropical intertidal zones. It grows on the bark of the stilt sections of mangrove trees, which are exposed during <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> and covered during high tides. It {{can also be found}} on some other suitable intertidal substrates in its range. This oyster has evolved to survive exposed to the air during <b>low</b> <b>tides.</b> The mangrove oyster is found on Caribbean and Atlantic South American shorelines. and West African shorelines.|$|R
5|$|A salvage {{attempt was}} ordered by Secretary of State William Paget only {{days after the}} sinking, and Charles Brandon, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of {{practical}} details. The operation followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship and fastened to two empty ships, or hulks. At <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> the ropes were pulled taut with capstans. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|E
5|$|At 6:49 pm fire crews {{waiting to}} connect to Phoenix {{reported}} she was having difficulty getting close enough because of <b>low</b> <b>tide</b> conditions. Despite the problems requiring pilot and commander Arvid Havneras to perform an extraordinarily hazardous docking procedure, at 7:00 pm Phoenix was ready to pump at the Marina lagoon, two blocks away from the first fire. By this time the whole neighborhood was threatened with destruction by fire. Fire crews were manning hoses laid in anticipation; firefighters at the burning buildings were instructed to hold their ground, that they would soon have more water.|$|E
5|$|At <b>low</b> <b>tide</b> {{extensive}} {{areas of}} mudflats (the Steart and the Berrow Flats) are exposed, providing important feeding and over-wintering grounds for waders (shorebirds). Invertebrate fauna including six nationally rare species and eighteen nationally scarce species {{can be found}} in the ditches and ponds around the shores. Consequently, Bridgwater Bay is a National Nature Reserve, and is managed by Natural England. Some of the potential risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E

5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at <b>low</b> <b>tide,</b> and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E
5|$|Determined to {{make one}} last show of defiance, Maxwell ordered the marines to wade towards the proas at <b>low</b> <b>tide</b> and open fire on them. This {{achieved}} no hits, but did persuade the Dayaks to move further offshore, and they departed entirely when the Ternate was spotted. The following day the survivors embarked on board Ternate, Maxwell having lost not one man on either the shipwreck or the island. At Batavia the crew were reunited with Amherst and his party, who had sent Ternate to search for them and subsequently chartered the East Indiaman Caesar {{for the remainder of}} the journey to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{plentiful}} {{in the waters}} surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at <b>low</b> <b>tide.</b> The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.|$|E

30|$|Bird {{abundance}} {{on a beach}} {{can change}} over short time intervals. In particular, birds respond to short-term variation in weather and tide (Ferns 1983). During storms, ocean-feeding birds, like pelicans, gulls and terns, halt foraging and roost on beaches. <b>Low</b> <b>tides</b> attract birds that forage in the intertidal zone (Neuman et al. 2008). Hubbard and Dugan (2003) found that <b>low</b> <b>tides</b> draw birds to forage in the intertidal zone in the spring, whereas in the fall, bird abundances are higher at high tide.|$|R
