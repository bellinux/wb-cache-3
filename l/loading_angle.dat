40|$|Direct {{torque control}} (DTC) {{is a new}} control method for {{rotating}} field electrical machines. DTC controls directly the motor stator flux linkage with the stator voltage, and no stator current controllers are used. With the DTC method very good torque dynamics can be achieved. Until now, DTC {{has been applied to}} asynchronous motor drives. The purpose of this work is to analyse the applicability of DTC to electrically excited synchronous motor drives. Compared with asynchronous motor drives, electrically excited synchronous motor drives require an additional control for the rotor field current. The field current control is called excitation control in this study. The dependence of the static and dynamic performance of DTC synchronous motor drives on the excitation control has been analysed and a straightforward excitation control method has been developed and tested. In the field weakening range the stator flux linkage modulus must be reduced {{in order to keep the}} electro motive force of the synchronous motor smaller than the stator voltage and in order to maintain a sufficient voltage reserve. The dynamic performance of the DTC synchronous motor drive depends on the stator flux linkage modulus. Another important factor for the dynamic performance in the field weakening range is the excitation control. The field weakening analysis considers both dependencies. A modified excitation control method, which maximises the dynamic performance in the field weakening range, has been developed. In synchronous motor drives the <b>load</b> <b>angle</b> must be kept in a stabile working area in order to avoid loss of synchronism. The traditional vector control methods allow to adjust the <b>load</b> <b>angle</b> of the synchronous motor directly by the stator current control. In the DTC synchronous motor drive the <b>load</b> <b>angle</b> is not a directly controllable variable, but it is formed freely according to the motor’s electromagnetic state and <b>load.</b> The <b>load</b> <b>angle</b> can be limited indirectly by limiting the torque reference. This method is however parameter sensitive and requires a safety margin between the theoretical torque maximum and the actual torque limit. The DTC modulation principle allows however a direct <b>load</b> <b>angle</b> adjustment without any current control. In this work a direct <b>load</b> <b>angle</b> control method has been developed. The method keeps the drive stabile and allows the maximal utilisation of the drive without a safety margin in the torque limitation...|$|R

40|$|Stepping motors {{are well}} suited for {{open-loop}} positioning tasks at low-power. The rotor position of the machine can simply be controlled by the user. Every time a next pulse is sent by the user, the stepping motor driver excites the correct stator phases to rotate the rotor over a pre-defined discrete angular position. In this way, counting the step command pulses enables open-loop positioning. However, when the motor is overloaded or stuck, {{the relation between the}} expected rotor position {{based on the number of}} step command pulses and the actual rotor position is lost. This is called step loss. Open-loop stepping motor methodologies do not detect this step loss or stall. While the absolute rotor position is lost, the open-loop control continues to send unnecessary and unwanted step command pulses. This can lead to excessive vibrations, wear and noise. Especially for dynamically demanding applications, step loss should be avoided or at least be detected. Using a mechanical position sensor to achieve closed loop control would increase the cost and complexity of the system and omits the straightforward open loop control. Therefore in this paper, a sensorless estimator based on a Phase Locked Loop is presented which provides feedback of the <b>load</b> <b>angle,</b> even during transients. The <b>load</b> <b>angle</b> contains information about the torque generation and the margin to step loss. To estimate the <b>load</b> <b>angle,</b> the back-EMF is considered. This algorithm can be used with the typical full-, half- and micro-stepping algorithm and only needs one current and one voltage measurement and electrical parameters such as resistance and inductance to estimate the back-EMF and subsequently estimate the <b>load</b> <b>angle.</b> The proposed algorithm is validated through measurements on a hybrid stepper motor...|$|R
