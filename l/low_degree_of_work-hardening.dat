The increase in the feed in machining was found to lead to an increase, up to 55 %, in yield strength of the OFC specimens. Intensive sub-surface deformation and a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>work-hardening</b> in the near-surface layer are attributed to this effect. Increase of feed resulted in an increase of deformation depth ɛIII and work-hardening ΔH detected via SEM and nanoindentation.

40|$|The stress–strain {{behaviour}} of cold-sprayed Ta coatings, deposited onto Al {{and steel}} substrates, was studiedby depth-sensing spherical and sharp (Berkovich) indentation testing, and {{was compared to}} that of anannealed Ta sheet. The mechanical properties of the coatings, free of any scale-dependence, are insensitive tothe presence of a lamellar structure, indicating strong, tight bonding between cold-sprayed Ta particles. Accordingly, the coatings are isotropic. The stress–strain curves reveal that the coating material experiencedsome <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>work-hardening</b> during cold-spraying; indeed, the sprayed particles were plasticallydeformed at impact. This was confirmed by line profile analysis on XRD patterns. The consistency between theresults from different indentation testing techniques provides a means to cross-validate the entire analysis...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUsing {{functional}} Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) {{and long}} connected speech stimuli, we addressed {{the question of}} neuronal networks involved in prosodic integration by comparing (1) differences in brain activity when hearing connected speech stimuli with high and <b>low</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> prosodic expression; (2) differences in brain activity in two different diotic listening conditions (normal speech delivery to both ears, i. e., NN; and low-pass-filtered speech delivery to both ears, i. e., FF); and (3) effects <b>of</b> high and <b>low</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> prosodic information in the NN and FF conditions. Twelve right-handed French men listened passively to the stimuli. Each stimulus induced a specific cerebral network, the flat one weakening activations, which were mainly reduced to the bilateral STG for both listening conditions. High <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> prosodic information were found to trigger right specific activations in a wider neuronal network involved in speech integration (such as BA 44, BA 21 - 22 and BA 39 - 40) than <b>low</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> prosodic information did. More precisely, the right BA 44 {{was found to be}} specifically involved in the process of F(0) modulations, which are the main acoustic correlate of prosody. Not only do the results achieved in the present experiment using 30 -s-long connected speech stimuli show the involvement of a bilateral neuronal network but they also strongly suggest that high <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> prosodic information elicit activations in a wider neuronal network involved in speech perception than <b>low</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> prosodic information do...|$|R
