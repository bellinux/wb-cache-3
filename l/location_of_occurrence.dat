Besides the amplitude properties, regarding to power quality, {{it is important to}} know the structure of their harmonic spectrum. For that purpose, characteristic surges (energization and deenergization of an unloaded 35 kV underground cable, energization of an unloaded 10 kV underground cable and deenergization of a 10 kV overhead line, with a multiple appearance of the arc between the circuit breaker contacts) were analyzed. The signals were obtained by an experiment, so the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> noise makes them much more complex to analyze than the simulated ones. Their harmonic decomposition was performed by digital signal processing methods - Empirical Mode Decomposition and Short Time Fourier Transform. The obtained results were compared to the calculated ones, which allowed us to draw conclusions related to applied methods efficiency and characteristic harmonics values that occur during the switching surges. The performed analysis allows us to get a deeper insight into transient processes in the real transmission power lines. The obtained results can be especially useful to detect the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> various types of surges and for development of real-time power quality monitoring systems...|$|R

50|$|Machine tool {{monitoring}} {{is explained}} with Acoustic Emission (AE) Sensors. AE Sensor is commonly {{defined as the}} sound emitted as an elastic wave by a solid when it is deformed or struck, caused by the rapid release of localized stress energy. Therefore, it is an occurrence phenomenon which releases elastic energy into the material, which then propagates as an elastic wave. The detection frequency range of acoustic emission is from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. Rapid stress-releasing events generate a spectrum of stress waves starting at 0 Hz and typically falling off at several MHz. AE {{can be related to}} an irreversible release of energy. It can also be generated from sources not involving material failure including friction, cavitation and impact. The three major applications of AE sensors phenomena are: a) Source location - determine the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> an event b) Material mechanical performance - evaluate and characterize materials/structures; and c Health monitoring - monitors the safety operation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{the past}} 10 {{years it has}} become clear that {{biological}} movement is made up of sub-routine type blocks, or motor primitives, with a central controller timing the activation of these blocks, creating synergies of muscle activation. This paper shows {{that it is possible to}} use a factorial hidden Markov model to infer primitives in handwriting data. These primitives are not predefined in terms of <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> within the handwriting, and they are not limited or defined by a particular character set. Also, the variation in the data can to a large extent be explained by timing variation in the triggering of the primitives. Once an appropriate set of primitives has been inferred, the characters can be represented as a set of timings of primitive activations, along with variances, giving a very compact representation of the character. Separating the motor system into a motor primitive part, and a timing control gives us a possible insight into how we might create scribbles on paper. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many studies {{focused on}} the {{development}} of crash analysis approaches have resulted in aggregate practices and experiences to quantify the safety effects of human, geometric, traffic and environmental factors on the expected number of deaths, injuries, and/or property damage crashes at specific locations. Traffic crashes on roads are a major cause of road crashes in the metropolitan area of Xi’an. In an attempt to identify causes and consequences, reported traffic crashes for six years in Xi’an were analyzed using a sample of 2038 reports. The main types of information from such reports were extracted, coded, and statistically analyzed. Important results were obtained from frequency analyses as well as multiple contributory factors related to traffic crashes, including crash severity, time and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence,</b> geometry of the road, AADT and v/c.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the important, facilitating role {{architectural}} design plays in social interaction within long-term care facilities (LTCFs) serving people with dementia. Here, we apply space syntax, a set of theories and techniques {{for the analysis of}} spatial configurations, as an objective measure of environmental characteristics. Almost 150 rounds of behavioral observations were collected in the social spaces of 3 LTCFs. Using the visibility and proximity metrics of space syntax, the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> various social activities in relation to the furniture and spatial layout on architectural floor plans have been identified. The results did not confirm the space syntax hypothesis that spaces with greater visibility and proximity promote more social inter-action. Further analysis revealed that when in settings with better visibility and accessibility, the residents were {{more likely to engage in}} low levels of interaction. High-level social interactions actually were more likely to occur in settings providing greater privacy (eg, less visibility and accessibility). The findings suggest an important nuance that architectural configuration factors impact not only the likelihood but also the type of conversations likely to occur in certain locations. This would have implications for both design and staff training on how best to utilize social spaces for therapeutic effect, particularly within the context of person-centered care...|$|R
40|$|The Lublin region, one of {{the main}} {{agricultural}} regions in Poland, has very favorable conditions for agricultural production but the development of the agricultural sector has been very slow there. This is due, among other factors, to the extensive farming used on large areas and the fragmentation of fields with numerous fragments of natural ecosystems. In Lublin Province, cereals comprise the highest proportion of the crop structure, especially wheat, but farmers also often cultivate maize, oilseed rape, sugar beet, and legumes for consumption. The biological diversity of agricultural areas is enhanced by growing traditional plant species and varieties. Crop species are accompanied by segetal weeds, sometimes very expansive, sometimes rare and endangered by extinction. In recent years, the following have been the dominant weed species in the region’s crop fields: Galium aparine, Convolvulus arvensis, Papaver rhoeas, Viola arvensis, and Veronica persica. However, there are several <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> Muscari comosum (a strictly protected species) and the following unique species: Adonis aestivalis, Anthemis tinctoria, Caucalis platycarpos, Galium tricornutum, and Thymelaea passerina.
