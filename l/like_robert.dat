5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, <b>like</b> <b>Robert</b> Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E

It will ultimately serve over 570 students, mostly matriculating from other charter schools in the area.|$|E
5|$|Submarine films <b>like</b> <b>Robert</b> Wise's 1958 Run Silent, Run Deep {{constitute}} a distinctive subgenre {{of the war}} film, depicting the stress of submarine warfare. The genre makes distinctive use of the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in the 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges and the many times repeated ping of sonar, {{as well as the}} threatening sounds of a destroyer's propellor and of an approaching torpedo.|$|E

This allowed them switch between slide and fretted guitar playing readily, which was an advantage in rhythm accompaniment.|$|E

25|$|Both {{contemporary}} {{friends and}} foes tended {{to exaggerate the}} Soviet role in the Republic of Mahabad. While Kurdish nationalist leaders Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou and Jalal Talabani stressed Soviet friendship and support, others <b>like</b> <b>Robert</b> Rossow Jr., the American Charges d'Affaires in neighboring Azerbaijan, and historian William Linn Westermann branded the republic a Soviet puppet state. This notion was also widespread amongst Kurdish tribal leaders, many of whom disagreed with Qazi's leadership.|$|E

This did not stop other actors, <b>like</b> <b>Robert</b> De Niro, Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, and Joe Mantegna, from expressing interest in the film.
