5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, the ship was fitted with a degaussing coil to protect her against magnetic mines. In 1942, the ship's aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were removed. Throughout the war, her radar suite was upgraded; in March 1941, she was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed. The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at <b>low</b> <b>range.</b> The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter radar. Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{movement}} has aspects {{of both a}} fugue and a ritornello movement. In the first fugal section, the voices enter in the sequence tenor, alto, soprano I, soprano II, bass, expanding from middle range to the extreme parts, just as the theme expands from the repeated first notes to sighing motives leading upwards. In the second fugal section, the instruments begin in low registers, and the voices build, with every part first in extremely <b>low</b> <b>range,</b> from bass to soprano I. In both sections, the instruments open the fugue, but play with the voices once they enter.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil to protect them against magnetic mines. Leipzig had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo tubes. In 1942, Nürnbergs aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed. Throughout the war, the ships' radar suites were upgraded; in March 1941, Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed.

25|$|The Norden {{operated}} by mechanically turning the viewpoint so the target remained stationary in the display. The mechanism {{was designed for}} the low angular rate encountered at high altitudes, and thus had a relatively <b>low</b> <b>range</b> of operational speeds.

25|$|The {{vibration}} {{produced by}} the player's lips has harmonics, i.e., it has frequency components falling exactly in the ratio 1:2:3 etc. However, the non-harmonic spacing of the instrument's resonances means that the harmonics of the fundamental note are not systematically assisted by instrument resonances, as is usually the case for Western wind instruments (e.g., in a clarinet, the 1st 3rd and 5th harmonics of the reed are assisted by resonances of the bore, at least for notes in the <b>low</b> <b>range).</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{object-oriented}} metrics suite {{proposed by}} Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) is a measurement approach towards improved object-oriented design and development practices. However, existing studies evidence traces of collinearity between {{some of the}} metrics and <b>low</b> <b>ranges</b> of other metrics, two facts which may endanger the validity of models based on the CK suite. As high correlation may be an indicator of collinearity, in this paper, we empirically determine to what extent high correlations and <b>low</b> <b>ranges</b> might be expected among CK metrics. To draw as much general conclusions as possible, we extract the CK metrics from a large data set (200 public domain projects) and we apply statistical meta-analysis techniques to strengthen the validity of our results. Homogeneously through the projects, we found a moderate (~ 0. 50) to high correlation (> 0. 80) between some of the metrics and <b>low</b> <b>ranges</b> of other metrics. Results of this empirical analysis supply researchers and practitioners with three main advises: a) to avoid the use in prediction systems of CK metrics that have correlation more than 0. 80 b) to test for collinearity those metrics that present moderate correlations (between 0. 50 and 0. 60) c) to avoid the use as response in continuous parametric regression analysis of the metrics presenting low variance. This might therefore suggest that a prediction system may not {{be based on the}} whole CK metrics suite, but only on a subset consisting of those metrics that do not present either high correlation or <b>low</b> <b>ranges.</b> ...|$|R
