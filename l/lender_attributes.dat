40|$|Data from {{a survey}} of Midwest {{producers}} are {{used to examine the}} credit source decisions of farm borrowers. The <b>lender</b> <b>attributes</b> preferred by producers are identified in terms of their importance in selecting credit providers. The influence of farm business information on farmers= interest rate sensitivity and loyalty is investigated. Regression results indicate that patrons of the Farm Credit System {{are more likely to be}} highly price sensitive. Furthermore, the likelihood for strong borrower loyalty is found to be higher for smaller, less leveraged, and more tenured farms and by those who source financing from bank institutions.

40|$|Interest-free {{loans are}} a common feature of low-income rural economies. In much of the {{economics}} literature, lending at zero and positive interest are viewed as being highly segmented in the community, with interest-free loans {{an essential component of}} long-term mutual consumption agreements between households. An alternative interpretation is that zero-interest loans are a credit contract that, in lieu of interest, includes an option allowing the lender to tax the borrower at a future date. This option can take a variety of forms, including the provision of labor or draft animal services or possibly a future loan. In this paper, we develop and test a model of household contract choice between zero- and positive-interest rate loans that builds on this alternative perspective. It highlights the role of borrower and <b>lender</b> <b>attributes</b> and the economic environment in which they interact in determining contract choice. Enforcement considerations are secondary. We use a unique household-level data set for rural China for the mid- 1930 s to examine key predictions of the model. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Microloan markets allow {{individual}} borrowers {{to raise}} funding from multiple individual lenders. We use a unique panel data set that tracks the funding dynamics of borrower listings on Prosper. com, the largest microloan {{market in the}} United States. We find evidence of rational herding among lenders. Well-funded borrower listings tend to attract more funding after we control for unobserved listing heterogeneity and payoff externalities. Moreover, instead of passively mimicking their peers (irrational herding), lenders engage in active observational learning (rational herding); they infer the creditworthiness of borrowers by observing peer lending decisions and use publicly observable borrower characteristics to moderate their inferences. Counterintuitively, obvious defects (e. g., poor credit grades) amplify a listing's herding momentum, as lenders infer superior creditworthiness to justify the herd. Similarly, favorable borrower characteristics (e. g., friend endorsements) weaken the herding effect, as <b>lenders</b> <b>attribute</b> herding to these observable merits. Follow-up analysis shows that rational herding beats irrational herding in predicting loan performance...|$|R
