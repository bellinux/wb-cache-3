Among them, maximum tensile and bending stresses induced {{in the rim}} and tensile stresses induced in the arm under the action of centrifugal forces are the main causes of flywheel failure. Due to these causes there is a definite Fatigue <b>Life</b> and <b>Safety</b> Factor of the flywheel. Hence in this work, evaluation of fatigue <b>life</b> and <b>safety</b> factor of flywheel are studied using finite element method. The models of flywheel having four, six and eight no. arms are developed for FE analysis. The FE analysis is carried out for different cases of loading applied on the flywheel and the minimum fatigue <b>life</b> and <b>safety</b> factor are determined. From this analysis {{it is found that}} fatigue <b>life</b> and <b>safety</b> factor both increases as the number of arms increases...|$|R

25|$|Extensive {{upgrades}} over {{a recent}} eighteen-month interval {{have addressed the}} <b>life</b> <b>safety</b> issues, including replacement of the football players' facilities, and an extensive seismic retrofit of those sections not subject to fault shearing. The work {{was the subject of}} several lawsuits from neighborhood and environmental groups, who were concerned about such extensive construction on top of a major fault. During the reconstruction, the Cal Bears have played at AT Park in San Francisco for one season. The modifications completed in Summer 2012 involved the cutting of the stadium into four independent sections, followed by the demolition of the two segments directly over the rubble zone. The north and south ends are formed of new bridging sections that rest upon floating mats (foundations that do not penetrate the surface, rather sitting upon plastic sheets over level graded gravel and sand) where they pass over and near the fault, with appropriate sliding connections between the sections for the safety of spectators and the ability to absorb the relative rotation between the east and west fixed sections and the new north and south mobile sections.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{the first}} {{standard}} for home smoke alarms, NFPA 74, {{was established in}} 1967. In 1969, the AEC allowed homeowners to use smoke detectors without a license.

Smoke alarm sensitivity requirements in UL 217 were modified in 1985 to reduce susceptibility to nuisance alarms. In 1988 BOCA, ICBO, and SBCCI model building codes begin requiring smoke alarms to be interconnected and located in all sleeping rooms. In 1989 NFPA 74 first required smoke alarms to be interconnected in every new home construction, and in 1993 NFPA 72 first required that smoke alarms be placed in all bedrooms. NFPA began requiring the replacement of smoke detectors after ten years in 1999.|$|E
