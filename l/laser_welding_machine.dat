40|$|Abstract. The {{laser head}} with fixed focus optics is {{commonly}} used for the deep penetration laser welding. In such case the geometry and position of the beam waist are defined by the focusing lens. If the laser beam incident on the focusing lens is not well collimated but divergent and its divergence can be varied by proper adaptive optical elements, then also the geometry and position of the focus will be changeable. In this way {{it is possible to}} affect the energy coupling from the laser beam to the keyhole walls and thus to control the geometry and quality of the weld. In this paper we present a theoretical and numerical study of the beam shaping by adaptive optics and its influence on the weld quality. For the CO 2 <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> the adaptive optics was realized by a deformable mirror and its effect was tested also experimentally.

30|$|In this work, an FEM–ANN based {{integrated}} {{approach is developed}} for accurate computation of bend angle during laser bending process. Initially three-dimensional nonlinear thermo-mechanical FEM based numerical model is developed for computation of bend angle for given process conditions. The absorptivity used in the numerical model was then tuned by using inverse analysis technique. In this technique, FEM simulations were repeated by varying the values of absorptivity. The value of absorptivity for each set of process condition was estimated by comparing the bend angle obtained in the numerical and experimental studies so that the computational error of bend angle is less than 5  %. Based on the estimated values of absorptivity and the corresponding input process conditions, an ANN based model was developed for fast and accurate prediction of absorptivity. Then, the ANN based absorptivity was employed in the FEM model for computation of bend angle. Within the scope of process conditions {{used in the present}} work, the proposed approach was found to be accurate in the computation of bend angle with an average error of 4.14  %. The estimated absorptivity is a fitting parameter as it serves the purpose of correctly estimating the bend angle.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} powder {{metallurgy}} for op-toelectronic packages {{in order to}} reduce the cost of laser packages. Conventional die compaction (DC) and metal injection molding (MIM) are used for the shaping of powder metallurgy. The distin-guishing types of inherent porosity in DC and MIM steels have their respective effects on the defect mechanisms of <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> joints. For DC steel with 85 % relative density and continuous porosity, the rising gas pressure pushes the molten metal out of the welding regions, resulting in weak and unstable welding joints. For MIM steel with more than 95 % relative density, the laser power dom-inates the defect mechanisms, and the defect-free welding joints with optical spot size of 400 µm can be attained by using laser power of less than 1. 0 kW. Although elimination of inherent poros-ity in MIM steel under optimum welding condition can give rise to additional postwelding-shift (PWS), it is still controlled to less than 2 µm, resulting in optical coupling loss of less than 15 %. The advantage of applicability of the MIM method to several materials makes it possible to employ SS 316 L, Kovar, and Invar, which have the characteristic of better property for <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> but difficult <b>machining,</b> as the metal housing in low-cost lightwave communica-tion system.

Laser processing parameters investigated include laser power (2 – 4 kW), welding speed (0. 75 – 7. 5 m/min), joint gap (0 – 0. 6 mm) and defocusing distance (- 1 mm and - 2 mm). Two post-weld heat treatments (i. e. stress relief annealing, solution treatment and aging) are investigated and compared with the as-welded condition. Although some welding defects such as underfill and porosity have been observed, high quality welds can be obtained using a high power Nd:YAG laser. Underfill defect is found to increase but the porosity area decreases with increasing welding speed. The use of the filler wire decreases the underfill defect. However, the porosity area increases with increasing joint gap. The hardness is maximum in the fusion zone (FZ) followed by a sharp decrease in the heat affected zone (HAZ) to the base metal (BM). The low temperature annealing process increases the hardness of the fusion zone but the combination of the high temperature solution treatment followed by aging decreases the fusion zone hardness almost to the base metal values. Tensile testing shows that the joint efficiency varies between 95 and 105 %. The porosity and underfill are the two main defects for failure in the FZ and HAZ, respectively.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were as follows: (i) to investigate the feasibility of laser welding in fusing a dissimilar joint of cobalt-chromium and titanium metal alloys (ii) to evaluate the properties of the welded joints between cobalt-chromium and titanium alloys. Thirty plastic models of (1 × 3 × 42) mm were prepared with conical shoulder shape as following ISO 6871 - 1 dental base metal casting alloys. Models were divided equally into two experimental groups (15 cobalt-chromium and 15 titanium) and one control group of 26 specimens of cobalt-chromium. Each model was invested and moulded into mould rings with a special investment material. The specimens were placed in oven at room temperature. Temperature of the oven was then increased gradually for each alloy following manufacturer’s recommendations. Following casting, the specimens were allowed to cool down at room temperature. All cast specimens were then retrieved from the investment and finished. Each specimen was cleaned utilizing acetone solution. All specimens of titanium were then checked by using X-ray to ensure that all specimens were porosity free before cutting and laser welding. Specimens of each alloy were laser welded using Nd-YAG (Manfredi Jewellaser 50, Italy) <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> under power voltage of 270 W, pulse duration of 10 ms, and welding spot diameter of 1. 0 mm.

Two specimens were selected randomly for examination under Scanning Electron Microscope to investigate the topography of the specimen after laser welding. All data were then statistically analysed using t-test and/or Mann Whitney test. Tensile strength tests results showed that the value of stress was significantly lower in laser welded specimens 401. 87 MPa, (124. 64) when compared to the control specimens 813. 07 MPa, (50. 075), at p= 0. 000.

Despite the advantages of conduction <b>laser</b> <b>welding,</b> it is yet to be exploited significantly for industrial applications and there are very few applications for which this mode of operation is used. This paper is aimed at presenting different varieties of applications for conduction <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> using a fibre laser. This ranges from high quality aluminium <b>welds</b> to <b>laser</b> brazing of stainless steel to metal foams. The objective {{of this paper is to}} highlight the main features of conduction <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> process and exemplify some conduction <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> applications...|$|R
40|$|<b>Laser</b> beam <b>welded</b> joints from {{structural}} steels StE 355 and StE 690 were tested under pulsating tension loading. The fatigue test results of as welded specimens {{are in good}} agreement with fatigue behaviour of conventianal <b>welded</b> joints. For <b>machine</b> finished <b>welded</b> joints of StE 355 an increase in fatigue limit of about 100 MPa was obtained. An estimated local fatigue limit of defect free weld metal {{can be used as}} an input quantity for fatigue design of <b>laser</b> <b>welded</b> StE 355 components by the local concept...|$|R
40|$|Precise <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> plays a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} production of high-tech goods, particularly in precision engineering. In this working field, precise adjustment and compensation of positioning tolerances of the parts to be welded with respect to the laser beam is of paramount importance. This procedure mostly requires tedious and error-prone manual adjustment, which additionally results in a sharp increase in production costs. We therefore developed a system which automates and thus accelerates this procedure significantly. To this end, the <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> is equipped with a camera to acquire high resolution images of the parts to be welded. In addition, a software framework is developed which enables precise automatic position detection of these parts and adjusts the position of the welding contour correspondingly. As a result, the machine is rapidly prepared for welding, and it is much more flexible in adapting to unknown parts. This paper describes the entire concept of extending a conventional <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> with means for image acquisition and position estimation. In addition to this description, the algorithms, the results of an evaluation of position estimation, and a final welding result are presented. ...|$|R
