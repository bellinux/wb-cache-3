5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that <b>life</b> <b>changes</b> and develops through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} hospitalized {{psychiatric}} patients and a randomly selected non-therapy group {{responded to the}} Schedule of Recent Experiences questionniare. In {{order to determine the}} magnitude of <b>life</b> <b>change</b> events for the two groups, <b>Life</b> <b>Change</b> Unit totals were derived for the years 1966 and 1967. To test the hypothesis that patients in psychiatric treatment have experienced a quantitatively significant greater amount of <b>life</b> <b>change</b> than a group of non-therapy subjects, an analysis of variance was used to determine whether there were significant differences between the scores for the two groups. For the year 1966, no significant difference was found between the therapy and non-therapy samples. For the year 1967, {{there was a significant difference}} between the mean <b>Life</b> <b>Change</b> Unit scores for the two groups. As a result of these findings, it is concluded that an accumulation of <b>life</b> <b>change</b> events may serve to precipitate mental health change, and that that probability of such health change occurring is significantly greater when there is a clustering of <b>life</b> <b>change</b> events during any given year than when such a clustering does not occur...|$|R

Concerning individual events, the only significant differences in frequency were that more patients changed residence in Sydney (p= 0 · 006) and more controls had a child leave home for reasons other than marriage (p= 0 · 03).
