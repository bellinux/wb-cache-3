In the first section, I will show that deontological moral theories are helpless when faced with the challenge of either justifying or deriving a standard of proof for criminal trials. In the second section, I will show that existing moral theories of punishment (especially Retributivism) in fact are nothing of the sort, in that they lack the resources to justify or derive a schedule of punishments or even a nonarbitrary definition of the just deserts for any given crime. Put differently, while Deontic theories stress the importance of convicted defendants receiving their just deserts, they have no machinery for figuring out what the just deserts are for any given crime.

40|$|This Symposium {{within the}} Conference on Coincidence Spectroscopy has been {{arranged}} {{in order to}} honour the contribution of Werner Nakel to our field. It is my task to introduce Werner Nakel and his contributions to coincidence spectroscopy. It was in the mid eighties that Werner Nakel showed me the first Tubingen data on inner shell ionisation of heavier atoms by impact of fast electrons. I am afraid to say that I {{did not respond to}} his request for theoretical support, as it was known that simple approaches, e. g. via the plane wave Born approximation, did not work and a proper investigation involving continuum solutions of the Dirac equation promised to be rather tedious. However, I finally became involved with the relativistic (e, 2 e) problem after all. An attempt [1] to "improve " on one of the approximations (neglect of spin flip contributions) used in the first serious attack on the problem by Doris Jakubassa-Amundsen [2], indicated that the problem was worth a concentrated effort. So I am speaking here as the senior member of the Belfast-Cambridge-Frankfurt collaboration, which eventually accepted the challenge of the Tiibinger experimental (e, 2 e) data. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> my real task and first give you an outline of the his career of Werner.

6000|$|But now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> another point, {{or rather}} to two other points, with which I propose to occupy myself. How far does the {{experience}} of the last fourteen years justify the estimate which I ventured to put forward of the value of scientific culture, and of the share--the increasing share--which it must take in ordinary education? Happily, in respect to that matter, you need not rely upon my testimony. In the last half-dozen numbers of the [...] "Journal of Education," [...] you will find a series of very interesting and remarkable papers, by gentlemen who are practically engaged in the business of education in our great public and other schools, telling us what is doing in these schools, and what is their experience of the results of scientific education there, so far as it has gone. I am not going to trouble you with an abstract of those papers, which are well worth your study in their fulness and completeness, but I have copied out one remarkable passage, because it seems to me so entirely to bear out what I have formerly ventured to say about the value of science, both as to its subject-matter and as to the discipline which the learning of science involves. It is from a paper by Mr. Worthington--one of the masters at Clifton, the reputation of which school you know well, and at the head of which is an old friend of mine, the Rev. Mr. Wilson--to whom much credit is due for being one of the first, as I can say from my own knowledge, to take up this question and work it into practical shape. What Mr. Worthington says is this:-- ...|$|R

The course, held in a dance studio, met twice a week for 80  minutes. In most cases, {{the first half of the}} class was a contemplative movement practice led by my colleague (at different times, the movement included some combination of lying, sitting, and standing; walking, both straight and in circles/while turning; students moving solo, paired, or as a group; practicing various breathing styles; proceeding as an animal; and other actions). This was followed by journaling and conversation, and then we <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> lecture and discussion, which I or a guest led, about some aspect of “mindbodyness,” with reference to the day’s reading.|$|R

Various approximation schemes invented during the last 40 years are presented. The problems arising from these approximations necessarily truncating or destroying the exponential form are discussed and ways to deal with them are described. I am pleased to welcome my old friend Fritz Coester at this session. As you probably know he did play a seminal role in the invention of the Coupled cluster method (CCM). Besides, Fritz always was a benevolent observer and critic of the later developments of the method.

40|$|My talk {{today will}} go {{through a series of}} quotes by public servants, Ministers and academics, to provide some {{background}} to the Public Service Act and its reliance on explicit values. I hope that copies of my speech will be available after this session. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> first <b>to</b> my predecessor, Helen Williams: “Values have traditionally {{played a central role in}} the context of public service ethics and can be traced back to both Weberian philosophy and to the influence of developments such as the British Northcote-Trevelyan reforms which were introduced as a reaction to the previous climate of patronage and favouritism. ” (Williams, 1999) Values and ethics, until recently have been implicit, not explicit. They were achieved through the application of specific rules, rather than through the understanding of concepts. The application of the merit principle is an example. “The application of merit based employment focused on establishing and refining a process – setting specific selection criteria, correctly advertising the position, receiving written applications, convening a panel, shortlisting, interviewing, obtaining referee reports and making a recommendation to a delegate. In effect, there was protection through process. ” (Williams, 1999) Rules can be impediments to efficiency and flexibility Detailed rules, however, while ensuring good process, did not ensure efficiency. The cost of government and the increasing expectations of citizens have led to a rigorous review of the funding of public services and the efficiency with which they are performed...|$|R
40|$|I {{appreciate}} {{the opportunity to}} talk here tonight concerning the economic challenges facing the global economy. My opening remarks for this panel are intended to be broad-based, covering a wide range of issues. Still, I {{will not be able to}} cover all topics and so I hope that we can have a vigorous question and answer session later, in which I will have a chance to address additional concerns about the status of the global economic recovery generally and U. S. monetary policy in particular. As usual, the remarks I make here tonight represent my own views and do not necessarily reflect the views of other FOMC participants. My remarks are divided into three parts. First I will comment on the strength of the global economy. Asia has been a leader in the worldwide recovery following the very large global shock of late 2008, and I expect that leadership to continue during the remainder of 2010 and into 2011 and beyond. Next, I will <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the U. S. economy, which is also growing, although not as strongly as some parts of Asia. My expectation is that growth in the U. S. is likely to continue at the current pace, or perhaps slightly faster, during the remainder of 2010 and into 2011. Finally, I will <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the ongoing sovereign debt turmoil in Europe and try to assess a few of the implications for the global economy. My sense is that, while the sovereign debt crisis in Europe is indeed a serious matter, the global recovery at this point looks very strong and seems unlikely <b>to</b> be derailed. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> first <b>to</b> the strength of the global recovery...|$|R
40|$|In {{defining}} the powers and {{duties of the}} three branches of government, the U. S. Constitution never explicitly referred to Science, except in the patent clause. But many technical responsibilities are implied in references to weights and measures, the census, and the like. Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and in particular Benjamin Franklin, were highly literate in science, but it was their disciple, President John Quincy Adams who promoted {{as a matter of}} policy a direct role of the government in science [...] in particular with respect to astronomy, land surveys and navigation [...] all physical sciences. Some agencies of government [...] notably the National Bureau of Standards and the Department of Agriculture were founded in the early days of the Republic with scientific and technical missions. Since then the involvement of the government with science has waxed and waned but the major expansion of the interaction between physics and government occurred after World War II when physicists demonstrated the power of their craft during mobilization of science in support of the war effort. In discussing the interaction of physics with government we should distinguish ''science in government'' [...] scientific input into policy making [...] from ''government in science,'' which is the support and management of that part of the overall scientific endeavor for which the government has responsibility. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> first <b>to</b> the subject of physics in government. An overwhelming fraction of governmental decisions today have scientific and technical components; decisions ignoring these components are wasteful at best and can imperil the nation. For this reason governmental bodies at all levels solicit scientific advice [...] or at least give lip service to the need for such advice. When such advice was deliberately avoided, as President Reagan did before announcing his Strategic Defense Initiative in March 1983, the technically unattainable goal ''to make nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete'' was proclaimed...|$|R
40|$|Quantified NPs in {{questions}} lead {{to three}} distinct interpretations. The narrow scope reading of (1) requires answers like (2. a), the functional reading, answers like (2. b), and the pair-list reading, answers like (2. c). (1) Which dish did every boy make? (2) a. (Every boy made) pasta. b. (Every boy made) his favorite dish. c. Al (made) the pasta, Bill the salad, and Carl the pudding. There are reasons for distinguishing these three readings {{that relate to}} grammatical properties of the question itself, and not to their answers. First, in cer tain syntactic configurations pair-list readings are absent (cf. (3), (4)). Second, many quantifiers do not allow for pair-list readings (cf. (5), (6)). (3) Which bOYI [tl [made every dish]]? (4) a. Bill. b. #The boy that likes it best. c. #The pasta (were made by) AI, the salad, (by) Bill, and the pudding, (by) Carl. (5) Which dish did mostlseveralla few/no boys make? (6) a. Pasta. b. Their favorite dish. c. #AI the pasta, and Bill the salad. This article will try to explain why pair-list readings are possible with uni versal quantifiers but not with others. I will argue that those readings involve con joined question acts. While conjunction of speech acts is a natural concept, other Boolean operations aren't, and hence quantifiers that are not generalized conjunc tions cannot scope over question acts. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> first <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> existing approaches to pair-list readings. 2. Approaches to Pair-List readings 2. 1 Quantifiying into Questions There are three major approaches to pair-list interpretations (cf. the overviews in Szabolcsi (1 997) and Pafel (1 999)). For Hamblin (1 973), a question denotes {{the set of the}} meanings of its congruent answers; for Karttunen (1 977), the set of true con gruent answers. In (7), this is given by a characteristic function. Pair-list interpreta tions involve quantification into such question meanings, cf. (8). (7) Which dish did Bill make...|$|R
40|$|Ancient mythology, {{literary}} fiction, {{and modern}} science fiction films all recount a similar cautionary tale: human ingenuity {{gives rise to}} a powerful invention, but through human fallibility and, in some tellings, venality, the invention becomes a monster and turns on its creators. Perhaps the most famous example is Mary Shelley 2 ̆ 7 s Frankenstein, in which Dr. Frankenstein 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to fashion a living man from the dead remains of others succeeds, only then to go horribly awry. Such stories are timeless because they warn of the dangers of indelible features of human nature: hubris and short-sightedness. Recent large-scale catastrophes such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon Gulf oil spill and the 2011 tsunami-induced radiation leakage at the Fukushima nuclear power facility are only the latest reminders of the limits of human ingenuity and the continuing relevance of the Frankenstein story. But if the unintended consequences of human ingenuity can sometimes prove disastrous, at other times, they may <b>turn</b> out <b>to</b> be felicitous. We are all familiar with accidental inventions like penicillin, Post-it Notes, and the microwave oven. Spandrels are a more whimsical example. A spandrel is the space between a curved arch and a rectangular boundary; although an artifact of architecture and geometry, since ancient times, artists and architects have used spandrels to enhance the beauty of buildings. We see a similar process in nature: evolution, {{or in the case of}} human culture, our own artifice, retrofits organs and capacities that were originally selected for one purpose to serve some very different purpose. Feathers evolved as insulation but proved useful for flight. Evolutionary biologists debate the causal origins of sophisticated human language, but it certainly did not evolve to enable the writing of sonnets or the delivery of lectures on law. The late evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould popularized the term “exaptation” to refer to this phenomenon, expressly analogizing it to spandrels in architecture. So much for literature, science, and art. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>turn</b> now <b>to</b> something about which I am more qualified to express an opinion: law. The law contains numerous examples of retrofitting. Legal institutions, doctrines, and texts that were originally thought to serve one purpose can come to serve quite different purposes...|$|R
6000|$|He was {{altogether}} easy about it, {{and this}} made Strether now see how at bottom, {{and in spite}} of the shade of shyness that really cost him nothing, he had from the first moment been easy about everything. The shade of shyness was mere good taste. People with manners formed could apparently have, as one of their best cards, the shade of shyness too. He had leaned a little forward to speak; his elbows were on the table; and the inscrutable new face that he had got somewhere and somehow was brought by the movement nearer to his critics There was a fascination for that critic in its not being, this ripe physiognomy, the face that, under observation at least, he had originally carried away from Woollett. Strether found a certain freedom on his own side in defining it as that of a man of the world--a formula that indeed seemed to come now in some degree to his relief; that of a man to whom things had happened and were variously known. In gleams, in glances, the past did perhaps peep out of it; but such lights were faint and instantly merged. Chad was brown and thick and strong, and of old Chad had been rough. Was all the difference therefore that he was actually smooth? Possibly; for that he WAS smooth was as marked as in the taste of a sauce or in the rub of a hand. The effect of it was general--it had retouched his features, drawn them with a cleaner line. It had cleared his eyes and settled his colour and polished his fine square teeth--the main ornament of his face; {{and at the same time}} that it had given him a form and a surface, almost a design, it had toned his voice, established his accent, encouraged his smile to more play and his other motions to less. He had formerly, with a great deal of action, expressed very little; and he now expressed whatever was necessary with almost none at all. It was as if in short he had really, copious perhaps but shapeless, been put into a firm mould and turned successfully out. The phenomenon--Strether kept eyeing it as a phenomenon, an eminent case--was marked enough to be touched by the finger. He finally put his hand across the table and laid it on Chad's arm. [...] "If you'll promise me--here on the spot and giving me your word of honour--to break straight off, you'll make the future the real right thing for all of us alike.
