50|$|The {{usage of}} Brush {{electric}} arc lights spread quickly. Scientific American reported in 1881 {{that the system}} was being used in:800 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> rolling mills, steel works, shops, 1,240 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> woolen, cotton, linen, silk, and other factories, 425 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> large stores, hotels, churches, 250 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> parks, docks, and summer resorts, 275 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> railroad depots and shops, 130 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> <b>mines,</b> smelting works, 380 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> factories and establishments of various kinds, 1,500 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> <b>lighting</b> stations, for city <b>lighting,</b> 1,200 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> England and other foreign countries.A total of over 6,000 lights which are actually sold.|$|R

5|$|The {{underground}} {{prison was}} shot in real caves left by mining at Griffith Park, in the Bronson Canyon, previously used as the Batcave and in the 1930s Flash Gordon serial. Shots of {{the interior of the}} mine were captured at night so it appeared like the setting was underground. Since Narita and his crew weren't allowed to drill holes for <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> <b>mine</b> shafts, illumination had to come from practical lights that appeared {{to be part of the}} set. The elevator descent into the bowels of the mine was simulated by pasting fake rocks to a canvas being cranked in the background of the scene. While Zimmerman believed Shatner would hate the fight between Kirk and his doppelgänger, the actor enjoyed the theatrical sequence, and contributed to the choreography with his knowledge of judo and karate.|$|R

50|$|In {{the same}} year Clanny {{completed}} his first lamp consisting of a candle in a glass surround. Below the glass was a trough containing water through which air was forced {{by a pair of}} bellows. Fumes bubbled out through another water chamber above. A paper 'On the Means of procuring a Steady <b>Light</b> <b>in</b> Coal <b>Mines</b> without the Danger of Explosion' was read before the Royal Society on 20 May the following year.|$|R
50|$|Court {{was born}} in Warwick and educated at King Henry VIII Grammar School in that town. He trained at Guy's Hospital and became MRCS in 1863 and LRCP in 1864. He practised in Staveley, Derbyshire, and was {{consulting}} surgeon to the Derbyshire Miners' Union. It was here that he discovered that the nystagmus was caused by poor <b>lighting</b> <b>in</b> the <b>mines</b> and persuaded the owners to install proper lighting to supplement the miners' lamps. He also worked on ankylostomiasis and published the influential book Miners' Diseases.|$|R

40|$|Lighting {{plays an}} {{important}} role <b>in</b> underground <b>mining</b> operations. Underground mines are completely dependent on artificial sources of illumination. Without proper and effective lighting, there is much probability of accidents and less productivity. In order to maintain effective <b>lighting</b> <b>in</b> underground <b>mines,</b> measuring of illuminance and luminous energy is very much necessary. Because, humans receive the bulk of their information visual, {{the quantity and quality of}} illumination is critical to the safe and efficient operation. This paper explains the making of illumination and luminous energy measurements, photometer and factors which effect on accuracy of photometer. It also deals with the photocell characteristics and the probability of errors takes place while measuring...|$|R
25|$|Despite an {{accident}} {{caused by a}} candle igniting gas at the Clifton Hall Colliery on 18 June 1885, in which 178 miners lost their lives, the Fletcher family, owners of Ladyshore refused to introduce safety lamps into the pits {{even though they were}} working the same mine (coal seam) which was known to be a gassy coal. This stubborn streak resulted in one of the largest court cases involving coal <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> England which brought {{about the end of the}} use of candles and other open <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> coal <b>mines.</b> The case also had implications for the use of other equipment, such as electrical lighting and tools, which may have endangered the lives of miners.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of electrical apparatus for signaling or <b>lighting</b> <b>in</b> coal <b>mines</b> {{was accompanied by}} electrically-initiated explosions of flammable gas and dust. Technical standards were developed to identify the features of electrical apparatus that would prevent electrical initiation of explosions due to energy or thermal effects. Several physical methods of protection are used. The apparatus may be designed to prevent entry of flammable gas or dust into the interior. The apparatus may {{be strong enough to}} contain and cool any combustion gases produced internally. Or, electrical devices may be designed so that they cannot produce a spark strong enough or temperatures high enough to ignite a specified hazardous gas.|$|R
50|$|In Wolverhampton, Elwell and Parker {{began to}} {{manufacture}} accumulators (lead-acid batteries). From 1883 they manufactured dynamos. The business began to expand: there was soon {{a demand for}} dynamos, from the Manchester Edison Company and from Trafalgar Colliery in the Forest of Dean, for electric <b>lighting</b> <b>in</b> the <b>mine.</b> (This {{is thought to be}} the first time electric lighting was used underground.) Elwell-Parker dynamos supplied <b>lighting</b> <b>in</b> industrial works, and equipment was supplied for a tramway in Blackpool in 1885, the first electric tramway in the country. A prototype battery-powered tram was tested on the tramway in Birmingham. Several prototype electric cars were built. Between 1884 and 1887, further patents were taken out by Parker and Elwell for electrical equipment. In 1887 he developed a process to extract phosphorus and chlorate of soda by electrolysis.|$|R
50|$|The coal was cleaned of {{non-combustible}} {{debris and}} sorted into general sizes for different uses. In {{addition to the}} coal processing facilities, there also were coking ovens which processed the coal, transforming it into coke which was used for metal processing by Phelps Dodge at other facilities. The coking ovens produced carbon monoxide gas, which was captured and then burned to create steam for generating electricity for mine machinery and electric <b>lighting,</b> both <b>in</b> the <b>mines</b> and <b>in</b> the towns around the mines.|$|R
40|$|Lighting systems provide mine workers {{improved}} {{visibility and}} contribute to improved safety, productivity, and morale. Lighting is critical to miners, since they depend heavily on visual cues to spot fall of ground, pinning & striking and slipping & tripping hazards. Most conventional systems of <b>lighting</b> are used <b>in</b> <b>mines</b> are extracting a lots of power and deal with major maintenance problems. Apart from the conventional grid-power lighting systems, additional emergency lighting system using green energy is mandatory in case of grid-power failure or in disaster situation of the underground mines. The luminous efficacy increases with switching frequency while providing eye comfort to user. Even though CFL has low power consumption for solar photovoltaic (SPV) power system, but CFL’s electrical requirements are not easily met by hard-switched inverters due to their higher switching losses at higher frequencies and preheat and ignition voltage of CFL results lower efficiency. This paper demands well suited high frequency inverter and a series interrupting type charge controller for illumination at remote areas...|$|R

And utilize the mining results to develop data allocation schemes {{so as to}} improve the overall performance of a mobile system. Firstly frequent user moving patterns are captured from a set of log data in a mobile environment. Then <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of <b>mining</b> results of user moving patterns and the properties of data objects, a data allocation scheme is developed for proper allocation of personal data. It is shown that user-moving pattern {{is very important in}} devising effective data allocation schemes, which can lead to significant performance improvement in a mobile computing system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract] : Within {{coal mine}} operations, both {{day and night}} time {{production}} and use of heavy equipment is required. The current lighting systems used for operation at night are not as efficient as {{what they should be}} due to high-wall set-backs. High-wall set backs were implemented to prevent high-wall slippages in which sections of the high-wall fall into the mining pit and cause undesirable effects. As high-wall setbacks have altered the geometry of the high-walls the older models of lighting plant now provide less efficient lighting into the coal mining pit. Currently there are few if any designs for lighting plants that can be used effectively on the high-wall <b>in</b> the <b>mining</b> pit area. This is a problem because there are major disadvantages such as obstructions in the pit, glare and reflection issues with using lighting plants inside the mining pit. Before high-wall setbacks became a significant attribute of the coal mining pits the best position for lighting of the coal mining pit was above the high-wall but now this method is no longer suitable for most conventional designs of lighting plant. The following research and design project elaborates on the key aspects that have caused the problems to do with <b>lighting</b> <b>in</b> the coal <b>mining</b> pit including high walls, high-wall slippages and high-wall setbacks, an overview of open cut coal mining, and a conceptual design process to develop a new design for a portable high-wall lighting plant. Hopefully by the design of the new lighting plant system it will help to overcome the issues of ineffective <b>lighting</b> <b>in</b> the pit...|$|R

Having a change in heart, the elders desired {{to have a more}} civil conversation with Joseph about his actions and sent a letter of apology to him by means of seven of his friends. Joseph travelled back from Arimathea to Jerusalem to meet with the elders, where they questioned him about his escape. He told them this story; On the day of the Preparation, about the tenth hour, you shut me in, and I remained there the whole Sabbath in full. And when midnight came, as I was standing and praying, the house where you shut me in was hung up by the four corners, and there was a flashing of <b>light</b> <b>in</b> <b>mine</b> eyes. And I fell to the ground trembling. Then some one lifted me up from the place where I had fallen, and poured over me an abundance of water from the head even to the feet, and put round my nostrils the odour of a wonderful ointment, and rubbed my face with the water itself, as if washing me, and kissed me, and said to me, Joseph, fear not; but open thine eyes, and see who it is that speaks to thee. And looking, I saw Jesus; and being terrified, I thought it was a phantom. And with prayer and the commandments I spoke to him, and he spoke with me. And I said to him: Art thou Rabbi Elias? And he said to me: I am not Elias. And I said: Who art thou, my Lord? And he said to me: I am Jesus, whose body thou didst beg from Pilate, and wrap in clean linen; and thou didst lay a napkin on my face, and didst lay me in thy new tomb, and roll a stone {{to the door of the}} tomb. Then I said to him that was speaking to me: Show me, Lord, where I laid thee. And he led me, and showed me the place where I laid him, and the linen which I had put on him, and the napkin which I had wrapped upon his face; and I knew that it was Jesus. And he took hold of me with his hand, and put me in the midst of my house though the gates were shut, and put me in my bed, and said to me: Peace to thee! And he kissed me, and said to me: For forty days go not out of thy house; for, lo, I go to my brethren into Galilee. Gospel of Nicodemus. Translated by Alexander Walker ...|$|R
