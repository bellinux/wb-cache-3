In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a <b>liquid</b> <b>mixture</b> of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E

When the ternary mixture is distilled, it produces anhydrous ethanol on the top stream of the column.|$|E
25|$|Both batch and {{continuous}} distillations {{can be improved}} by making use of a fractionating column {{on top of the}} distillation flask.

40|$|Nowadays, thermophysical {{properties}} of hydrocarbon mixtures {{play a vital}} role in process industries. A thermophysical asset of the solvent mixture properties provides information for distillation, extraction operations, material balance and energy balance in process industries. They also play an important role in solving problems in heat transfer, mass transfer and fluid flow. Studies on different thermophysical {{properties of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> within a wide ranges of composition and temperatures are valuable sources of information that can be used to examine the relationship between the internal structure of the system and its physical properties. Though a lot of work has been done in the case of pure liquids, data on thermophysical properties of <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> are not available for many systems. Hence the thermophysical properties of <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> have been studied for four binary <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> in the current investigation. Thermophysical properties of the following hydrocarbon binary <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> have been determined by using Oswald Viscometer and Pycnometer at 303. 15, 308. 15 and 313. 15 K. 1, 4 Dioxane + Bromobenzene 1, 4 Dioxane + Ethylbenzene Acetophenone + P-Xylene Acetophenone + O-Xylene The thermophysical properties such as density, viscosity of binary <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> were determined experimentally over the entire composition range at 303. 15 K, 308. 15 K and 313. 15 K. The experimentally determined thermophysical properties of the binary <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> were used to calculate the excess molar volume, VE and viscosity deviations Δη. The excess thermophysical properties of <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> provide additional information regarding molecular interactions. Hence the intermolecular interactions of the mixtures are discussed with the help of excess properties. A perusal of the literature revealed that the predictions of thermophysical properties of <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> was scarce. With an aim, the thermophysical properties of density, viscosity, excess molar volume VE, and viscosity deviations Δη of <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> were predicted using various nonlinear models. The excess values of thermophysical properties of binary hydrocarbon <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> were correlated using Redlich-Kister polynomial equation to obtain their coefficients and standard deviations. Grundberg-Nissan, Krishnan-Laddha, McAllister and Jouyban-Acree viscosity models were used for predicting the viscosity of hydrocarbon <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The parameters of McAllister model were determined using a programming software and other models parameters were determined using polynomial equations. The experimental values and model predictions were compared to get the standard deviation for each model. The observed values of excess molar volume VE, viscosity deviations Δη data for the hydrocarbon mixtures support the main factor of gradual disruption of the self-associated aromatic hydrocarbon molecules and confirm that the hydrogen bonds and dipolar interaction in aromatic hydrocarbons makes VE and Δη positive and negative deviations. The weak physical intermolecular interactions between the aromatic hydrocarbon molecules dominate over the structure-breaking effect of hydrocarbon mixtures on the addition of aromatic hydrocarbons. Interactions between the <b>liquids</b> in hydrocarbon <b>mixtures</b> are strong and weak dispersive type interactions. Redlich-Kister polynomial equation represented the excess molar volume and viscosity deviations which is indicated accurately well by percent standard deviation of less than 1. 25. The viscosity data tailored to Grundberg-Nissan, Krishnan-Laddha, Jouyban–Acree and McAllister models to derive the binary coefficients. Standard deviations have been considered between the fitted outcomes and the calculated data is helpful in deliberate mixing behavior of the binary mixtures. It can be concluded that in all cases, the data values found correlated with the corresponding models very well for this mixtures. The molecular interactions existing between the components and comparison of <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> were also discussed. The obtained experimental and correlation data is greatly reducing the difficulties in a tedious experimental work and provides a faster way of predicting the property values. The use of data correlation enables for prediction of data in future. Once a correlation is known with strong relationship between the variables of the study, then the prediction will be more accurate. Other than that, the use of these correlation models provides knowledge on the real behaviour of the <b>liquid</b> <b>mixtures</b> using only the experimental results and properties of the pure components...|$|R

25|$|Distillation is {{the process}} of {{separating}} the components or substances from a <b>liquid</b> <b>mixture</b> by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture.

In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction.|$|E
25|$|Continuous {{distillation}} is {{an ongoing}} distillation in which a <b>liquid</b> <b>mixture</b> is continuously (without interruption) fed into the process and separated fractions are removed continuously as output streams occur over time during the operation. Continuous distillation produces {{a minimum of two}} output fractions, including at least one volatile distillate fraction, which has boiled and been separately captured as a vapor, and then condensed to a liquid. There is always a bottoms (or residue) fraction, which is the least volatile residue that has not been separately captured as a condensed vapor.|$|E
25|$|The diagram on {{the right}} shows a {{negative}} azeotrope of ideal constituents, X and Y.

The top trace again illustrates the condensation temperature of various compositions, and again, above the top trace the mixture must be entirely vapor phase. The point, A, shown here is a boiling point with a composition chosen very near to the azeotrope. The vapor is collected at the same temperature at point B. That vapor is cooled, condensed, and collected at point C. Because this example is a negative azeotrope rather than a positive one, the distillate is farther from the azeotrope than the original <b>liquid</b> <b>mixture</b> at point A was. So the distillate is poorer in constituent X and richer in constituent Y than the original mixture. Because this process has removed a greater fraction of Y from the liquid than it had originally, the residue must be poorer in Y and richer in X after distillation than before.|$|E

2500|$|The Farmers General held a {{monopoly}} of the production, import {{and sale of}} tobacco in France, and the taxes they levied on tobacco brought revenues of 30 million livres a year. However this revenue began to fall because of a growing black market in tobacco that was smuggled and adulterated, most commonly with ash and water. Lavoisier devised a method of checking whether ash had been mixed in with tobacco: [...] "When a spirit of vitriol, aqua fortis or some other acid solution is poured on ash, there is an immediate very intense effervescent reaction, accompanied by an easily detected noise." [...] Lavoisier also noticed that {{the addition of a}} small amount of ash improved the flavour of tobacco. [...] Of one vendor selling adulterated goods he wrote [...] "His tobacco enjoys a very good reputation in the province... the very small proportion of ash that is added gives it a particularly pungent flavour that consumers look for. Perhaps the Farm could gain some advantage by adding a bit of this <b>liquid</b> <b>mixture</b> when the tobacco is fabricated." [...] Lavoisier also found that while adding a lot of water to bulk the tobacco up would cause it to ferment and smell bad, the addition of a very small amount improved the product. Thereafter the factories of the Farmers General added, as he recommended, a consistent 6.3% of water by volume to the tobacco they processed. To allow for this addition, the Farmers General delivered to retailers seventeen ounces of tobacco while only charging for sixteen. To ensure that only these authorised amounts were added, and to exclude the black market, Lavoisier saw to it that a watertight system of checks, accounts, supervision and testing made it very difficult for retailers to source contraband tobacco or to improve their profits by bulking it up. He was energetic and rigorous in implementing this, and the systems he introduced were deeply unpopular with the tobacco retailers across the country. This unpopularity was to have consequences for him during the French Revolution.|$|E
