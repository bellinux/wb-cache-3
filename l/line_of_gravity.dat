40|$|I T is {{our purpose}} to discuss {{one of the}} most {{important}} syndromes seen in the practice of adult medicine, and to suggest measures for symptomatic relief based upon knowledge of bodily mechanics and function. We refer especially to a type of obesity which appears to be exogenous in origin, aris-ing in persons whose dietary habits lead to a caloric intake beyond their daily requirements. It is not easy to determine whether individuals with the re-laxed habitus are predisposed to the train of events which follows, but it is apparent that when medical attention is sought these patients present the posture of relaxation. The gradual accumulation of adipose tissue in the normal depots for fat gives the appearance of rotundity, and the state is usually designated as corpulency. The accumulation of fat in the third decade is relatively symptomless. Friends will comment on the gain in weight, and subjects will note the expanding girth with the attendant strain on buttons and realize that they must discard belts for suspenders. At this stage some dyspnea will be noted on exertion, and a few suffer from symp-toms referable to strain of the spinal column. In the fourth decade the appearance of the individual is one of increas-ing corpulency, with a tendency toward a florid complexion. The normal curves of the spine are accentuated. The added weight of fat of the ab-dominal wall and viscera moves the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> forward, and to compen-sate for this the major portion of the thorax is moved backward, accentuat-ing the lumbar curve.

40|$|Spinopelvic {{alignment}} {{refers to}} the interaction between pelvic orientation, spinal curvatures, and the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> In a healthy modern human, this alignment is characterized by reciprocal curves/orientation of the sacrum, lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, and cervical lordosis. In an economic sagittal posture, these curvatures keep the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> close {{to the center of}} the acetabulum. The purpose of this study is to explore the spinopelvic alignment in extinct hominins. We examined spinopelvic alignment of a single representative from each of the following hominin groups: Australopithecus, Homo erectus (H. erectus), H. neanderthalensis, and early H. sapiens. Pelvic incidence, lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, and cervical lordosis for each representative was estimated and compared with that of modern humans. Three basic spinopelvic alignments were found: (1) the sinusoidal alignment with moderate to high spinal curvatures and pelvic incidence found in H. erectus and H. sapiens; (2) the straight alignment with small spinal curvatures and small pelvic incidence found in Neandertal lineage hominins; (3) the compound alignment found in Australopithecus, with moderate pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis, and nearly straight cervical spine. Our results indicate that balanced upright posture can be achieved in different alignments. Each hominin group solved the requirements of erect posture in a slightly different way. Moreover, we propose the term “cranio-spino-pelvic balance” to substitute “spino-pelvic balance. ” From an evolutionary perspective, not only changes in the pelvis have conditioned the evolution of the spinal curvatures but also changes in the equilibrium of the head likely also affected this balance.

The theory and techniques of Structural Integration (SI) are derived from the elemental fact that human bodies are organized in space, subject to the pull <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> If gravitational force is effectively managed through the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity,</b> mechanical stress is mini-mized allowing freedom of movement and econo-mical use of energy. All deviations from ideal structural alignment create unnecessary stress on the organism. Sound as this concept is, it is not unique to SI but is at least professed by most physical thera-peutic and exercise techniques. What appears unique to this method, however, is its holistic concept which emphasizes the mechanisms asso-ciated with structural imbalance and their far-reaching effects upon adaptability, efficiency, and behavior, and the unusual techniques employed for intervention and change.

We propose a universally applicable 3 D coordinate system that corrects {{for changes in}} pelvic inclination and that allows the localization of any point in the pelvis at rest or under dynamic conditions on magnetic resonance images (MRI) of pelvic floor disorders in a scanner- and software independent manner. The proposed 3 D coordinate system called 3 D Pelvic Inclination Correction System (PICS) is constructed utilizing four bony landmark points, with the origin set at the inferior pubic point, and three additional points at the sacrum (sacrococcygeal joint) and both ischial spines, which are clearly visible on MRI images. The feasibility and applicability of the moving frame was evaluated using MRI datasets from five women with pelvic organ prolapse, three undergoing static MRI and two undergoing dynamic MRI of the pelvic floor in a supine position. The construction of the coordinate system was performed utilizing the selected landmarks, with an initial implementation completed in MATLAB. In all cases the selected landmarks were clearly visible, {{with the construction of}} the 3 D PICS and measurement of pelvic organ positions performed without difficulty. The resulting distance from the organ position to the horizontal PICS plane was compared to a traditional measure based on standard measurements in 2 D slices. The two approaches demonstrated good agreement in each of the cases. The developed approach makes quantitative assessment of pelvic organ position in a physiologically relevant 3 D coordinate system possible independent of pelvic movement relative to the scanner. It allows the accurate study of the physiologic range of organ location along the body axis ("up or down") as well as defects of the pelvic sidewall or birth-related pelvic floor injuries outside the midsagittal plane, not possible before in a 2 D reference line system.

This study was designed toinvestigate the effects of genu valgum and genu varum deformity on the static and dynamic balance indices. Material and Methods: A total of 90 non-athletic female university students were assigned in one of thethree experimental groups; normal knee (n= 30), genu varum (n= 30) and genu valgum (n= 30), according totheir knee conditions. Static and dynamic overall stability index (OSI), anterior-posterior stability index(APSI), medial-lateral stability index (MLSI) and falling risk were evaluated three times by Biodex balancesystem, and the average of each index were recorded. Results: No significant difference was seen between groups in term of dynamic and static OSI and APSI,while significant lower stability was found in the genu varum group compared to normal groups in term ofdynamic and static MLSI (p< 0. 05). A significant increased in falling risk was also seen in genu varumgroup, compared to the normal group (p< 0. 05).

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the role of the neural arches in transmission of weight in the lower thoracic and the lumbar regions of the vertebral column. Based on simple mechanical principles of weight transmission, various parameters were chosen for measurements at each vertebral level. In 44 adult male dry vertebral columns measurements were made from T 5 to L 5 levels. The area of the inferior surface of the body at each vertebral level was compared with the area of the inferior articular facet, the cross sectional area of the laminae (lamina index), the pedicle index and the arch index. The inclination of the pedicles in relation to the body was also measured at each level. On the basis of the above measurements it was deduced that the compression force in the lower thoracic and lumbar regions is transmitted through two parallel columns, one anterior (formed by bodies and intervertebral discs) and one posterior (formed by successive articulations of laminae with each other at their articular facets). This study suggests that a considerable part of the weight of the upper limbs and the thoracic cage is transmitted through the ribs to the posterior column (laminae) through the costo-transverse articulations and ligaments. Because of the inclined position of the fifth lumbar vertebra, {{a significant part of the}} compressive force from the body is transmitted to the laminae in spite of the anterior inclination of the pedicles at this level. Because of the anterior concavity of the spine in the thoracic region, weight is transferred from the posterior to the anterior column through the inclined pedicles and in the lumbar region, where the concavity is posterior, a part of the compressive force of the anterior column is transmitted to the posterior. Thus, the compressive force in the curvilinear thoracolumbar column tends to deviate towards the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> The implications of these findings in relation to clinico-pathological disorders of the spine are discussed...|$|E

The study is both analytic and comparative; that is, objectives include both analysis of the funtioning of the anatomical system of the foot, and comparison of this system in several closely related organisms exhibiting very different types of positional behavior. The investigation utilizes the joint-link approach of Dempster, and focuses on the functional complex rather than the single structure. Analysis of a particular complex, such as a joint, integrates anatomical data relating to muscle and ligament size and disposition and joint configuration, with osteometric data pertaining {{to the size of}} articular surfaces and the shape and proportions of the osseus structures. Several new osteometric measurements have been derived which are more relevant in assessing function than previously used linear measures. ^ The four species with which this study is concerned exhibit very different types of positional behavior. Chimpanzees exhibit the widest range of behavior, being at home in the trees or on the ground. Gorillas are more terrestrial but are also capable of arboreal activities. The foot of these African pongids is more 2 ̆ 2 generalized 2 ̆ 2 than that of humans or orangs. The mobile tarsus can be stabilized in certain positions, and the powerful hallux {{can be used in a}} wide range of prehensile and non-prehensile activities. ^ Humans use the foot as a base of support and as a propulsive organ in bipedal striding and running. The stabilized tarsus and adducted hallux are used as levers in raising the center of gravity and are unsuited for activities in which the foot is used as a prehensile organ. The high, narrow tarsus, which adds resiliency to this part of the foot, necessitates a number of 2 ̆ 2 balancing 2 ̆ 2 adaptations to maintain body weight over the base of support and prevent uncontrolled movement and consequent strain at the talo-crural joint, in particular. For similar reasons, the long axes of the tibiae are parallel, and the plane of the talo-crural and subtalar joints are perpendicular to the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> during bipedal activities. ^ Orangs are highly arboreal, usually supporting the body using the limbs in tension in a small branch setting. The highly prehensile foot emphasizes the lateral digits rather than the hallux in grasping the substrate. The tarsus is extremely mobile, especially in inversion, in order to allow foot placement in a wide variety of positions. Increased mobility, which occurs at the talo-crural as well as the subtalar and transverse tarsal joints, is a result of differences between this and the other species in both osseus and soft-part (especially ligamentus) morphology. As a consequence, the tarsus is ill-suited for compressive weight-bearing, or for use as a lever for the plantar flexors of the foot in this species. In keeping with the emphasis on digital prehension, the lateral metatarsals and phalanges are extremely elongated, and the hallux is reduced in the orang. ^ When the total morphological pattern of the foot is considered, it is apparent that humans and African pongids are more similar to each other than they are to orangs. Somewhat different conclusions may be drawn if single structures only are compared. Generalizations regarding both habitus and heritage are commonly made from limited comparisons of anatomical structures. Problems with this practice are discussed in this dissertation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to design a netball {{specific}} balance assessment. A literature review revealed a lack of suitable assessments for this athletic population. Existing tests failed to replicate sport specific movements, measured variables inappropriate for dynamic balance assessment, failed to indicate the origin of balance deficiencies, disregarded the quality of the movement being performed, failed to indicate the movement strategy used for balance corrections, gave no indication of segmental orientation, used equipment that is not accessible to many practitioners, only assessed static balance, used non sport specific conditions such as eyes closed and unstable surfaces or failed to report the reliability of the tests. Prior to designing a netball specific balance assessment two elite level games of netball were analysed for the frequency of jump landings by jump direction, bi-lateral and uni-lateral landings, turns in the air, and jumps upon landing. Jump landings were chosen for analysis because previous research reported that jump landings and twisting on jump landings represented the greatest injury risk in netball (Otago, 2004; Powell & Barber-Foss, 2000). Forward jumps were performed most frequently (42 %) followed by vertical (32 %) and lateral jumps (26 %). Uni-lateral landings (67 %) were most common, as were jumps with no turn in the air (60 %). It was less common to perform a second jump immediately upon landing (28 %). There were marked differences between player positions in terms of jump direction and the number of jumps performed whereas whether a turn was performed in the air or whether the jump was landed on one or two limbs was more consistent between positions. In general, players could be split into end court and mid court by their landing profile. The exceptions were goal attack who had much in common with the mid court players and wing defence who had much in common with end court players. 12 Based on these findings and previous research on injury mechanisms, three movements were chosen for assessment: A single leg squat, a forward jump, and a forward jump with a turn in the air. The single leg squat was performed to a self selected depth whilst intensity of both jumps was standardised by controlling jump distance and jump height. Deviations from the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> were calculated at the knee, hip and trunk as calculated from video footage using SiliconCoach to assess balance. Fourteen female netballers (16. 8 ± 2. 4 years) performed three successful trials of each movement on two separate testing occasions approximately one week apart. The reliability of the assessment was determined for within day and between days. The mean ICC values for each body segment, during each movement across the four variables ranged from 0. 62 – 0. 81 indicating ‘moderate’ (ICC > 0. 61) test- retest reliability. The typical errors averaged across all body segments for the single leg squat, forward jump and jump with a turn were 1. 1 cm (ICC = 0. 71), 1. 8 cm (ICC = 0. 72) and 2. 6 cm (ICC = 0. 62) respectively indicating ‘moderate’ reliability. The errors were considered too great for use in indicating the magnitude and origin of balance deficiencies and a more sensitive measure is required. The tests may be useful to give an indication of an athlete’s movement competency prior to engaging in training for example knee movement in a single leg squat may indicate knee movement in a more dynamic forward jump...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 53 - 62). Study Rationale: Disequilibrium {{while standing}} increases an individual's risk of injury, {{especially in the}} elderly population. To maintain upright posture, the body's center of mass must be stabilized in a central, equilibrium location over the feet, which act as the base of support (BOS) during standing. Segmental postural impairments such as forward head position, thoracic and lumbar kyphosis, misalignment of the knees, and foot/ankle abnormalities are all implicated in the literature as disrupting this relationship, subsequently contributing to instability and increased fall risk. These findings are equivocal, however, and certain individuals {{are better able to}} compensate for these imbalances than others. This suggests that a global approach to assessing postural alignment, accounting for any compensatory joint position changes, may provide a more accurate way to distinguish alignment imbalances that may lead to falls. To objectively identify and rehabilitate instability in patients and clients, health practitioners such as Physical Therapists and Personal Trainers require quantitative measures to determine how far these individuals have migrated from equilibrium positions. Purposes and hypotheses: The present study suggests a method for calculating global posture offset measures, using computerized posture analysis software, from coronal and sagittal view photographs of individuals during quiet standing. It was expected that these measures would accurately predict deviations of the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> (LOG) (i. e., the ground projection of the body's center of mass measured with a force plate) away from an equilibrium position within the BOS. It was also expected that postural alignment abnormalities and/or deviations of the LOG would decrease the size of an individual's stability limits during a multi-directional leaning task, the NeuroCom Balance Master's Limits of Stability (LOS) test. To assess how physical activity behaviors may have affected the posture and balance relationship, participants responded to items on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) questionnaire regarding physical activity and leisure time behaviors. It was expected that individuals who failed to meet the American College of Sports Medicine's 2011 minimum physical activity recommendations, and/or spent greater amounts of time watching television, would have greater deviations from ideal postural alignment and lesser balance control than those who reported meeting these recommendations and watched less television. Major findings: Healthy, adult participants (N= 98, age range 18 - 75 years) with greater global coronal and sagittal posture offsets had greater deviations of the LOG away from an equilibrium position. These global posture offset measures predicted the location of the LOG (as estimated by center of pressure (COP) position) within 0. 57 cm in the medial/lateral direction and 1. 33 cm in the anterior/posterior direction. The resulting regression equations successfully predicted COP positions in an additional cross validation sample (N= 20) of healthy adults with similar demographics. Postural offsets and COP positions were not significantly related to maximum excursions on the LOS test; however, postural offsets were inversely correlated with directional control scores, and both postural offsets and COP positions were positively correlated with movement velocity on this test. Demographic variables and BRFSS responses to neuromotor physical activity participation and TV-watching time were able to explain 42. 8 % of the maximum excursions participants attained on the LOS test. No relationships between physical activity behaviors or television-watching time and postural alignment were discovered. Conclusions: Overall, the findings in the present study suggest that postural alignment deviations are capable of influencing the location of the LOG during quiet standing. Global posture offset measures, provided by computerized posture analysis software, may offer health practitioners an objective, reliable method for identifying disequilibrium in their patients and clients. While the LOG location during quiet standing was not directly related to the maximum excursions participants achieved on the LOS test, it was related to the movement strategies participants employed when leaning toward targets, indicating that postural alignment may indirectly influence one's stability limits. Finally, physical activity and sedentary behaviors were poor predictors of postural alignment and balance performance. It is possible that no direct relationship exists between these measures, or, that self-reported physical activity behaviors are not the best measure to use when investigating the relationships between postural alignment, balance control, and fitness level...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The spectropolarimetric {{signature}} of models of small-scale magnetic features is well understood at {{the centre of}} the solar disc, but has been little studied near the solar limb, mainly because the detailed geometry of the flux tubes must then be taken into account in a realistic analysis. We present multi-ray calculations of Stokes profiles through arrays of 2 -D magnetohydrostatic models of small flux tubes. We compare the Stokes profile shapes and Stokes based diagnostics (Q to V ratio, V amplitude, magnetic <b>line</b> ratio, centre <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> wavelengths, etc.) resulting from plane-parallel and 2 -D flux-tube models at different limb distances for two lines in the visible and an infrared H-band line. For the visible lines around 5250 ˚A all the diagnostics we have studied, {{with the exception of the}} Q and U to V ratio, are significantly affected by the finite size of the flux tubes and the passage of the rays through non-magneti...|$|R
50|$|The CarterCopter {{concept is}} a {{gyrocopter}} with an unusually stiff, relatively heavy rotor, supplemented with conventional wings. At low speed, the vehicle flies as a gyrocopter, and can pre-spin the rotor for a vertical takeoff and very brief hover (about 5 seconds), and can land {{more or less}} vertically. Several technical challenges make flying a slow rotor difficult, but rotor stability is achieved through {{the combination of the}} rotor tip weights' location ahead of the blade center <b>line</b> (forward center <b>of</b> <b>gravity)</b> and the center of lift aft of the blade center line.At high speed (above about 100 mph) the aircraft flies mostly using the fixed wings, with the rotor simply windmilling. The rotor spins with a tip speed below airspeed, which means that the retreating blade flies completely stalled. On a helicopter this would cause massive lift dissymmetry and insoluble control issues but the fixed wings keep the aircraft in the air and stable.|$|R
