5|$|Because of {{regulations}} {{imposed by the}} Writers Guild of America, only those employed as writers for Saturday Night Live were allowed to write sketches for the program. Henson and his puppeteers merely performed the scripts for the segments—they {{were not involved in}} the writing process. Saturday Night Live cast members did not enjoy working with The <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Gorch segments. Writing assignments for The <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Gorch sketches were given to Saturday Night Live staff as a penalty for being the least-liked among the production team. Writers generally regarded the routines as childish.|$|E

Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited.
