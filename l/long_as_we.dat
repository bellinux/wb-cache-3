5|$|So <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} {{speak on behalf of}} or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E
25|$|There {{is nothing}} magical about {{the choice of}} symbols for the values of Boolean algebra. We could rename 0 and 1 to say α and β, and as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> did so {{consistently}} throughout {{it would still be}} Boolean algebra, albeit with some obvious cosmetic differences.|$|E
25|$|If a {{being is}} {{essentially}} omnipotent, {{then it can}} also resolve the paradox (as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> take omnipotence not to require absolute omnipotence). The omnipotent being is essentially omnipotent, and therefore {{it is impossible for}} it to be non-omnipotent. Further, the omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible—just like the accidentally omnipotent—and have no limitations except the inability to become non-omnipotent. The omnipotent being cannot create a stone it cannot lift.|$|E

25|$|The {{threshold}} {{points are}} difficult to locate, because the Earth System is very complex. Instead of defining the threshold value, the study establishes a range, and the threshold is supposed to lie inside it. The lower end of that range {{is defined as the}} boundary. Therefore, it defines a safe space, in the sense that as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> are below the boundary, we are below the threshold value. If the boundary is crossed, we enter into a danger zone.|$|E
25|$|Compatibilists {{maintain}} that mental reality {{is not of}} itself causally effective. Classical compatibilists have addressed the dilemma of free will by arguing that free will holds as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> are not externally constrained or coerced. Modern compatibilists {{make a distinction between}} freedom of will and freedom of action, that is, separating freedom of choice from the freedom to enact it. Given that humans all experience a sense of free will, some modern compatibilists think it is necessary to accommodate this intuition. Compatibilists often associate freedom of will with the ability to make rational decisions.|$|E
25|$|The omnipotent being cannot {{create such}} a stone because its power {{is equal to}} itself—thus, {{removing}} the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, {{it is possible for}} non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his The City of God:For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{actively}} {{participating in}} the current discussions on evolutionary theory and genetics, Mosterín has also tackled issues like the definition of life itself or the ontology of biological organisms and species. Following in Aristotle’s and Schrödinger’s footsteps, he has been asking the simple question: what is life? He has analyzed the main proposed definitions, based on metabolism, reproduction, thermodynamics, complexity and evolution, and found all of them wanting. It is true that all organisms on Earth share many characteristics, from the encoding of genetic information in DNA to the storage of energy in ATP, but these common features merely reflect the inheritance from a common ancestor that possibly acquired them in a random way. From that point of view, our biology is the parochial science of life on Earth, rather than a universal science of life in general. Such a general biology seems impossible, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> do not detect and come to know other forms {{of life in the}} galaxy (if they exist). Concerning the ontological thesis of Michael Ghiselin and David Hull on the individuality of biological species, Mosterín shows that they are neither classes nor individuals in the usual meaning of these words. He tries to extend and make more precise the available conceptual framework of the discussion. Specifically, he shows the formal equivalence of the set-theoretical and the mereological (or part and individual) approach, so that everything that can be said about the classes can be translated into the jargon of individuals, and the other way around. All these concerns converge in his recent philosophy of animality, which combines the ontology of animals as paradigmatic individuals with the insights and results of biological research. This general theory of animals provides a solid foundation for the development of anthropology, conceived as the science of human primates.|$|E
25|$|At 5:30pm on 30 May 1940 a {{telephone}} request {{was made by}} the naval officer in charge at Margate that the Lord Southborough be launched and go across the channel to Dunkirk to help in the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force and the French Army. The lifeboat with her coxswain Edward Parker and her crew aboard headed off to Dunkirk, along with 18 other lifeboats which had been commandeered to help. The Margate crew were one of only three RNLI lifeboat crews used in the evacuation that were allowed to take their own lifeboat across. Many of the others were crewed by Navy ratings. Lord Southborough was second to arrive at the Dunkirk beaches, with the Ramsgate lifeboat Prudential (ON 697) arriving a little before. The two lifeboats spent their first hours on the beaches ferrying soldiers from the shore to larger ships in deeper water off shore. The Lord Southborough has been credited with having brought off 600 military personnel from the beaches of Dunkirk, but the true figure is thought to be far greater than this. 500 of these were conveyed from the beach at La Panne to the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Icarus. The Commanding Officer of the destroyer, Lieutenant Commander E. G. Roper, said of the Lord Southborough’s crew On behalf of every officer and man on this ship, I should like to express to you our unbound admiration for the magnificent behaviour of the crew of the lifeboat Lord Southborough…. The manner in which, with no thought of rest, they brought off load after load of soldiers under continuous shelling, bombing and aerial machine-gun fire will be an inspiration to us all as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> live. We are proud to be the fellow countrymen of such men. The Lord Southborough’s Coxswain Edward Parker was one of the two lifeboat coxswains who were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for their services at Dunkirk the other being Harold Knight coxswain of the Ramsgate Lifeboat.|$|E

[...] He emphasized that [...] "Our battle against terrorism... will require strength, courage and endurance. We will not yield to this threat...

500|$|Shortly after forming, {{they gave}} their first public {{performance}} on October 23, 1991, at the Quad of California State University, Northridge. The {{blueprint for the}} group's major-label debut album, demo tape Rage Against the Machine, was laid on a twelve-song self-released cassette, the cover image of which featured newspaper clippings of the stockmarket section with a single match taped to the inlay card. Not all 12 songs made it onto the final album—two were eventually included as B-sides, while three others never saw an official release. Several record labels expressed interest, and the band eventually signed with Epic Records. Morello said, [...] "Epic agreed to everything we asked—and they've followed through... We never saw a [...] conflict as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> maintained creative control." ...|$|E
500|$|Wainwright {{was signed}} to DreamWorks in 1996. Waronker paired the singer with {{producer}} Jon Brion, {{and together they}} spent [...] "most of 1996 and 1997" [...] recording 56 songs on 62 rolls of tape. Costs for the recording sessions reached between $700,000 and $1,000,000. Wainwright admitted that he and Brion took their time recording the album in Los Angeles, and considered the extended time a [...] "blessing" [...] and [...] "luxury", claiming that [...] "most people have two weeks to record their first album". According to Wainwright, Waronker [...] "didn't care how long it took, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were doing good work." [...] Waronker {{was pleased with the}} final product, and he and Wainwright agreed on the twelve tracks that made up the album.|$|E
500|$|After their marriage, Montgomery leased {{his farm}} to a tenant. His wife's grandfather, Judge Beekman, {{gave them a}} cottage on the Post Road north of the Beekman Arms in Rhinebeck in which to reside. Montgomery bought some {{surrounding}} land and set to work fencing, ploughing fields, building a grain mill, and laying {{the foundation for a}} larger home called [...] "Grasmere", though it was yet to be completed {{at the time of his}} death and the tiny cottage was his only residence in Rhinebeck. He said that he was [...] "Never so happy in all my life", but followed that up by saying [...] "This cannot last; it cannot last." [...] Three months after their marriage, Janet told him of a dream she had in which Montgomery was killed in a duel by his brother. Montgomery replied by saying [...] "I have always told you that my happiness is not lasting... Let us enjoy it as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> may and leave the rest to God." ...|$|E

500|$|Colbert is {{the central}} {{character}} in the 2007 book I Am America (And So Can You!). Co-written with Paul Dinello and the writers of The Colbert Report, I Am America delves into what the character considers {{to be the most}} pressing issues facing America. The book takes influence from the literary endeavors of the character's pundit models, such as O'Reilly's The O'Reilly Factor (2000) and Hannity's [...] (2004), which Colbert says he [...] "forced" [...] himself to read as a reference. I Am America is considered a pure extension of the Report; the written medium allowed the writers to employ different styles, such as long-format arguments, that they could not have used on television. [...] "You can actually spend 20 pages talking about religion whereas in the show, two pages is about as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> hold any one idea", Colbert explains. In doing this, the writers [...] "discovered things that [...] cared about that... they didn't know he cared about before".|$|E
500|$|Psycho-Pass further {{suggests}} {{that the price of}} living without stress includes overriding the individual's needs in favor of general social value. It is morally and socially acceptable to kill individuals who may potentially commit crimes, so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> accept that the harm that a criminal causes to society outweighs the harm we cause to an individual who is falsely charged. In other words, the Sibyl System operates on the principles of opportunity cost and acceptable risk. But relying on the Sibyl System paradoxically creates a society which fears no crime as a whole, but individuals who personally fear the consequences of the Sibyl System's verdicts. As such, Urobuchi himself has said that one of the series' central thematic ideas is [...] "fear" [...] as seen through Shogo Makishima's feeling of being out of place - because the Sibyl System cannot recognize him for what he actually is, he feels displaced and deviant within the structure of society itself.|$|E
500|$|With {{the entry}} of the United States into World War II in late 1941, Landis wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, inquiring as to the wartime status of {{baseball}}. The President responded urging Landis to keep baseball open, foreseeing that even those fully engaged in war work would benefit from inexpensive diversions such as attending baseball games. [...] Many major leaguers enlisted or were drafted; even so Landis repeatedly stated, [...] "We'll play as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can put nine men on the field." [...] Although many of the teams practiced at their normal spring training sites in 1942, beginning the following year {{they were required to}} train near their home cities or in the Northeast.
