Lamy passed François Perrodo's No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari at Rivage corner {{to take over the}} LMGTE Am lead. Patrick Long in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi Proton Racing car overtook Perrodo at Les Comes to take over second position in the same category. Fässler closed the gap to Heidfeld in the No. 12 Rebellion Racing vehicle but was spun by Albuquerque's RGR Sport car after moving in front of the vehicle upon lapping it at La Source resulting in heavy damage to the No. 7 Audi car's front-end, <b>littering</b> debris on the track. This was partly because Fässler braked early for the corner due to slower cars. Baxi DC Racing's No. 35 Alpine and the Abu Dhabi's No. 88 Porsche made heavy contact causing the former to sustain a right-rear puncture, <b>littering</b> the track with debris on the Kemmel Straight, and stopping {{on the side of the}} track. Calado's engine failed which prevented him from clinching victory in LMGTE Pro and he went into his garage to retire. Derani locked his tyres at La Source, allowing Lapierre to close the gap, and the French driver overtook Derani around the outside while lapping Franchitti's Ford GT at Fagnes to move into the LMP2 lead.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, the park {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} vandalism, <b>littering,</b> and wildfires caused by off-roading, and Roxy Ann Road became nearly impassable {{because of lack of}} maintenance. Medford police officers had to devote much of their time to patrolling the mountain, made difficult by the park's remote location. To alleviate these problems, the city regraded Roxy Ann Road in 1998, and installed two gates near the park entrance two years later. By 2006, vandalism had decreased by 70 percent.|$|E

Since 2013 commercial dog-walkers have been required to apply for licences to walk dogs in the park and are allowed to walk only four dogs at a time. In September 2013 a cyclist was successfully prosecuted for speeding at 37mph in the park.

40|$|Aims We {{explored}} the decomposition rates of single- and mixed-species <b>litter,</b> the litter-mixing effect {{and the effect}} of component <b>litters</b> in a mixture on decomposition. Methods In a <b>litter</b> bag experiment, shoot <b>litters</b> from two dominant grasses (Leymus chinensis and Stipa baicalensis) and one legume (Melissitus ruthenica) were decomposed separately and as a mixture from May 2010 to September 2011 in the Hulun Buir meadow steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. We separated the <b>litter</b> mixture into its individual component <b>litters</b> (i. e. the different single-species <b>litters)</b> and analyzed the changes in <b>litter</b> mass remaining and <b>litter</b> nitrogen (N) remaining during single-and mixed-species <b>litter</b> decomposition. Important Findings (i) <b>Litter</b> mixing had significant positive effects on <b>litter</b> decomposition. The litter-mixing effect was strongest for the mixture of S. baicalensis and L. chinensis <b>litters,</b> followed by the mixture of S. baicalensis and M. ruthenica <b>litters.</b> (ii) Single-species component <b>litters</b> decomposed faster in the mixtures than separately (positive effect), but these effects were not significant for legume species M. ruthenica <b>litter.</b> Relative to single-species <b>litter</b> decomposition, the decomposition rates of the two grass (S. baicalensis and L. chinensis) <b>litters</b> significantly increased when they were mixed with each other or with M. ruthenica <b>litter.</b> (iii) For each species <b>litter</b> type, the percentage of <b>litter</b> N remaining during decomposition (NR) differed between the single-species <b>litter</b> and mixed <b>litter</b> treatments. The NR of S. baicalensis <b>litter</b> was higher when it was decomposed in the mixture than in isolation. However, the NR of L. chinensis <b>litter</b> was lowest in its mixture with M. ruthenica among the treatments. Regardless of its decomposition in the mixture or in isolation, the NR of M. ruthenica <b>litter</b> varied little among treatments. There was a significant positive relationship between the NR and percentage of initial <b>litter</b> mass remaining in both the single <b>litter</b> and mixed <b>litter</b> treatments. These results suggest that N transfer may happen among component <b>litters</b> in mixture and further affect the decomposition...|$|R

To assess this effect, samples of <b>litters</b> were collected in South-eastern France, according to two different methods previously used in other studies, one keeping intact the structure of the <b>litter</b> layers (non-constructed <b>litter)</b> and the other requiring the construction of the <b>litter,</b> using mainly the surface <b>litter</b> layer (constructed <b>litter).</b> The comparison of flammability results showed that the sampling method had a significant effect on <b>litter</b> bulk-density, rate of spread and rate of consumption, intact <b>litter</b> being more flammable than reconstructed <b>litter</b> that was artificially compacted. The type of vegetation had a significant effect on <b>litter</b> depth, ignitability, sustainability, consumability and combustibility (except on rate of spread) and the <b>litter</b> composition could explain in part this fire behaviour. The effect of the construction of <b>litters</b> on flammability parameters and its magnitude also differed according to vegetation types. Intact <b>litter</b> structure appeared to be an important driver of its flammability, especially of combustibility and consumability. The assessment of these flammability components will differ when using constructed <b>litter</b> samples instead of intact <b>litter</b> samples, especially according to vegetation types. Future research on <b>litter</b> flammability should take into account the bias due to the <b>litter</b> sampling method when the <b>litter</b> is constructed...|$|R
5|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include <b>littering,</b> improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E
5|$|On Bermuda, the {{hurricane}} brought sustained winds estimated between , with higher gusts. A minimum pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.30inHg) was recorded, though a lower pressure {{may have occurred}} on the island as the barometer had been falling at the time. The strong winds downed power lines and felled trees, <b>littering</b> insular streets with debris. As a result, power outages occurred and loss of telecommunications was reported. Radio stations based on the island went silent due to the power loss. An emergency backup power generator at King Edward Memorial Hospital was used to restore electrical power to the facility. However, oil lamps were still used in place of any form of electrical lighting. Several slate roofs were torn from their buildings from the strong winds. Heavy rainfall associated with {{the hurricane}} flooded long stretches of roadway. Some roads were blocked and rendered impassable by the rainfall. At the local harbor, six vessels were inundated by the strong offshore wave action. Overall, property damage on the island was estimated at $400,000.|$|E
5|$|The Yukon Quest's rules allow race {{officials}} latitude {{on whether}} to assess a time penalty or monetary fine on mushers who violate one or more regulations. The most serious penalties can be assessed for mistreating dogs. Racers have been forcibly removed from the race for inadequate dog care; the most recent instance of this took place in 2008, when Donald Smidt was removed. More common are minor time and monetary penalties. For example, Dan Kaduce was fined $500 of his eventual $9,000 winnings for missing roll call at a mandatory meeting in 2007. Fines of $500 also have been levied for not attending the finish banquet, <b>littering,</b> not wearing start and finish bibs, or losing veterinary records. These minor penalties can {{have an effect on}} the race. In 2009, Hugh Neff, then in second place, was penalized two hours for mushing on the Circle Hot Springs road. As a result, he finished four minutes behind Sebastian Schnuelle, the winner.|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{investigated}} whether microbiota has been adapted to decompose a given <b>litter</b> type {{but we have}} limited information about the specific role of microarthropods in <b>litter</b> decaying processes. This experiment studied functional redundancy of microarthropods in a <b>litter</b> decomposition system by interchanging mesofauna among three different <b>litter</b> types. The study hypothesized that total micro- arthropod densities would be lower in foreign <b>litter</b> type than in original (‘home’) litter; and <b>litter</b> with foreign mesofauna would decompose slower than with native one. Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris), Turkey oak (Quercus cerris) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) <b>litter</b> were stored in microcosms with original microbiota. Microarthropods from the same (‘home’) or different (‘foreign’) type of <b>litter</b> were inoculated to microcosms. <b>Litter</b> mass loss and total density of collembolans, oribatid and other mites were recorded {{at the end of}} incubation (3 and 12 months). <b>Litter</b> quality determined total density of microarthropods irrespective of the origin of animals. <b>Litter</b> mass loss values differed in the three <b>litter</b> types. For pine <b>litter,</b> the origin of microarthropods had significant effects on <b>litter</b> mass loss. In oak <b>litter,</b> mainly microarthropod density influenced decomposition. Neither the origin nor the density of animals influenced the decomposition rate of black locust <b>litter.</b> <b>Litter</b> quality may have determined the different patterns of decaying. Mesofauna may enhance <b>litter</b> decomposition stronger in recalcitrant <b>litter</b> than in high-quality <b>litter...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of 20 -day <b>litter</b> weight on behavior and heart rate variability (HRV) of piglets under stress. Methods Forty four original <b>litters</b> were categorized as high <b>litter</b> weight (HW) <b>litters</b> (n = 22) and low <b>litter</b> weight (LW) <b>litters</b> (n = 22) by 20 -day <b>litter</b> weight. From each original HW <b>litter,</b> three males and three females were randomly selected after weaning and the 12 piglets from two original <b>litters</b> with similar age of days were regrouped into one new high <b>litter</b> weight (NHW) <b>litter</b> (11 NHW <b>litters</b> in total). The original LW <b>litters</b> were treated with a same program, so that there were 11 new low <b>litter</b> weight (NLW) <b>litters</b> as well. The latencies to first fighting, fighting frequencies and duration within three hours were recorded after regrouping and the lesions on body surface within 48 hours were scored. Besides, HR (heart rate, bpm, beats per minute) and activity count (ACT), time domain indexes and frequency domain indexes of the piglets were measured in an isolation trial to analyze the discrepancy in coping with stress between the original HW and LW <b>litters.</b> Results The results exhibited that piglets from the HW <b>litters</b> launched fighting sooner and got statistically higher skin lesion score than those from the LW <b>litters</b> (p = 0. 03 and 0. 02, respectively). Regarding the HRV detection, compared with the HW <b>litters,</b> the LW <b>litters</b> exhibited a lower mean HR (p< 0. 05). In the isolation test, a highly significant higher ACT value was observed between the HW <b>litters,</b> compared to the LW <b>litters</b> (p< 0. 01). Significant differences were observed in standard deviation of R-R intervals, standard deviation of all normal to normal intervals, and most frequency-domain indicators: very low-frequency, low-frequency, and high frequency between the HW and LW <b>litters</b> as well. The difference in LF:HF was not significant (p = 0. 779). Conclusion This study suggests that compared with <b>litters</b> of low 20 -day <b>litter</b> weights, <b>litters</b> with higher 20 -day <b>litter</b> weight take more positive strategies to cope with stress and have stronger HRV regulation capacity; HW <b>litters</b> demonstrate better anti-stress and adaptation capacity in the case of regrouping and isolation...|$|R
40|$|Freeze {{events can}} {{strongly}} influence many ecosystem processes. However, {{the effects of}} freeze events on <b>litter</b> production, <b>litter</b> quality, and decomposition are rarely documented. In this study, <b>litter</b> fall was measured monthly for 2 years. Two <b>litter</b> decomposition experiments were also performed using freeze-damaged <b>litter</b> and non-damaged <b>litter</b> in a loblolly pine forest. The freeze event in November 2009 caused a pronounced pulse of needle <b>litter</b> fall. The freeze-damaged needle <b>litter</b> was shown to have higher N concentration and lower C/N ratio compared with the normal falling needle <b>litter.</b> This finding indicates that freeze damage significantly increased needle quality because of incomplete nutrient resorption. The decomposition of freeze-damaged needle <b>litter</b> was faster than that of normal falling yellow needle <b>litter</b> and slower than that of hand-picked green needle <b>litter.</b> The decomposition rate constant (k) was negatively correlated with the C/N ratio in the needle <b>litter.</b> Our results also showed that the different climatic conditions influence patterns of <b>litter</b> decomposition. This study suggests that freeze events significantly alter <b>litter</b> quantity and quality, thus affecting <b>litter</b> decomposition rates in a loblolly pine forest in central China...|$|R

5|$|As North Korean {{soldiers}} advanced, {{they began}} to envelop both A and B Companies, and 30 minutes after the first shots were fired, both companies were ordered to withdraw, one platoon at a time. C Company, kept in reserve during the engagement, retreated without coming in contact with North Korean forces. A Company, under the heaviest attack, attempted a gradual withdrawal which quickly became disorderly, as men ran from the hill, some without weapons and ammunition, being strafed by North Korean machine guns the entire time. Panic quickly overtook {{many of the men}} of the battalion, and they started running past the designated rally points, all the way to Pyongtaek. Others, too scared to retreat, remained in their foxholes and were captured by the North Korean forces. One officer attempted to stay behind and search for survivors, before he and three others were allegedly captured and executed by North Korean forces. Company commanders gathered what men they could and began moving south, though one-fourth of 1st Battalion was killed, missing or captured immediately after the brief fight. The retreating elements left a trail of equipment behind, <b>littering</b> the road back to Pyongtaek with ammunition, helmets, and rain gear. In the disorderly retreat one platoon from A Company was left behind, and had to retreat through a railway for cover.|$|E
5|$|At West Palm Beach, the {{majority}} of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped, <b>littering</b> streets with broken trunks. Winds downed road signs on many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course. Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well. Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage, except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed.|$|E
40|$|The {{transformation}} of leaf <b>litter</b> into fecal pellets by saprophagous macroarthropods {{has long been}} suggested {{to play an important}} role in <b>litter</b> decomposition by altering microbial processes. However, conflicting results are reported in the literature, and it is currently not clear to what extent varying initial <b>litter</b> quality contributes to distinct microbial responses to the {{transformation of}} <b>litter</b> into feces. Here we performed a screening test using a wide range of distinct leaf <b>litter</b> from 26 tree species. We fed these <b>litters</b> to the macroarthropod species i during one week under controlled conditions, and compared microbial responses in uningested leaf <b>litter</b> with that of feces produced from the 26 different leaf <b>litter</b> types. We assessed substrate induced respiration (SIR) as an integrative measure of microbial responses. We found that <b>litter</b> SIR was highly variable across species and well related to initial <b>litter</b> quality. However, variability in feces SIR was strongly reduced and only weakly related to initial <b>litter</b> quality. Moreover, the difference between feces and <b>litter</b> SIR decreased with increasing <b>litter</b> SIR as a result of higher microbial stimulation in <b>litter</b> with low associated <b>litter</b> SIR. Our data clearly showed that the direction and magnitude of microbial stimulation in feces depend strongly on the <b>litter</b> type. Therefore, the consequence of <b>litter</b> transformation into macroarthropod fecal pellets for microbial decomposers and possibly for subsequent decomposition of feces is specific to <b>litter</b> species...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbandoned {{lands are}} {{increasingly}} {{used to establish}} fast-growing tree plantations, and are often rapidly colonized by a high density of herbaceous undergrowth. These weeds are generally removed since they compete with trees for resources, in particular soil nutrients. However, mixing herbaceous <b>litter</b> with the <b>litter</b> of planted trees could also stimulate the activity of decomposers and associated nutrient release due to an increase of <b>litter</b> quality (lower C:N ratio), plant diversity (more diverse <b>litter</b> traits) and water holding capacity. The objective {{was to determine the}} impact of herbaceous <b>litter</b> on the <b>litter</b> decomposition process of white spruce and hybrid poplar <b>litters</b> alone or in mixtures. <b>Litter</b> mass loss rate, nutrient release and decomposer communities were monitored on single and mixed-species <b>litters</b> using litterbags during two years in three plantations types (hybrid poplar, white spruce and mixed plantations). <b>Litters</b> within mixtures were separated by species to identify species-specific responses of leaf mass loss. N release of all <b>litter</b> types increased with the presence of herbaceous <b>litter.</b> This finding could be linked to the greater abundance of decomposers and fungal biomass brought about by the herbaceous <b>litter.</b> Addition of herbaceous <b>litter</b> had no effect on spruce <b>litter</b> mass loss but had positive effects on poplar and mixed spruce/poplar <b>litter</b> mass loss. Abundance of fungi and mites was more affected by <b>litter</b> quality, whereas the abundance of collembola was more affected by the diversity of resources than by <b>litter</b> quality. In these 10 -year plantations with poplar, increased <b>litter</b> mass loss for poplar and mixed <b>litters</b> and N release associated to the presence of herbaceous <b>litter</b> showed that weeds may change soil C sequestration and N cycling...|$|R
40|$|Few {{mechanisms}} that determine the assemblage structure of mites have been identified. Whilst the relative abundance of soil fauna {{is known to}} change with humus form, {{the degree to which}} the quantity of <b>litter</b> inputs play a part in these changes has not been investigated. We tested the response of oribatid and mesostigmatid mites in <b>litter</b> and soil layers to increasing levels of birch Betula pubescens <b>litter</b> to test whether <b>litter</b> mass could affect the mite assemblage. Six <b>litter</b> treatments (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 ×natural <b>litter</b> mass and complete <b>litter</b> removal) were established in November 2004 and the soil and <b>litter</b> communities sampled in October 2005. Species composition of oribatids was distinct for the soil and <b>litter.</b> There was no apparent effect of increasing <b>litter</b> mass on the soil mite assemblage. In the <b>litter</b> layer, the number of oribatids g− 1 of <b>litter</b> showed a strong negative relationship with increasing <b>litter</b> mass whilst the number of mesostigmatids g− 1 of <b>litter</b> was unresponsive to <b>litter</b> mass. Hence, the relative abundance of these two groups altered with increasing <b>litter</b> mass. The response of the oribatid groups Oppiidae and Poronota followed this negative relationship with <b>litter</b> mass but Phthiracaridae appeared less affected. Consequently, there was a subtle shift in the relative abundance of these groups with increasing <b>litter</b> mass. Our results demonstrate that oribatids as a whole and within groups respond in a predictable manner to increases in <b>litter</b> mass whilst mesostigmatids are unresponsive. Whilst there are undoubtedly biological and physical aspects that vary with <b>litter</b> mass, <b>litter</b> mass itself, is able to explain some patterns in the assemblage of oribatid mites. ...|$|R

In sections of Gulfport, large fires were sparked by downed power lines and fed by broken natural gas pipes. Debris on roadways prevented firefighters from reaching the fires, allowing them to spread. Similar destruction was seen to the east at Biloxi, where the hurricane's winds tore the roofs off many buildings. Beachfront communities were {{in a state of}} disarray, with large trees uprooted, debris <b>littering</b> the ground, and accumulations of sand on parts of roads like U.S. 90. Damage to schools in Harrison County—particularly in Gulfport and Biloxi—was extensive. Most homes in the area survived the storm, which was locally estimated to have been a once-in-50-year event, with relatively little damage. Several buildings along the coast in the Biloxi area sustained severe damage, but many of the older houses near the Gulf of Mexico there fared remarkably well. Winds brought down large highway signs, in some cases striking nearby buildings. Along the coast, Elena caused beach erosion, damaged coastal structures and recreational beach facilities, and dislocated navigational buoys and markers in various ports, several of which were closed pending Coast Guard inspection.

40|$|The {{decomposition}} {{rates of}} plant <b>litter</b> mixtures often deviate from the averaged rates of monocultures of their component <b>litter</b> species. The mechanisms behind these non-additive effects in decomposition of <b>litter</b> mixtures are lively debated. One plausible explanation for non-additive effects {{is given by}} the improved microenvironmental condition (IMC) theory. According to this theory, plant <b>litter</b> species, whose physical characteristics improve the microclimatic conditions for decomposers, will promote the decomposition of their co-occurring <b>litter</b> species. We tested the IMC theory in relation to leaf <b>litter</b> and soil moisture in two contrasting moisture conditions in a dry subarctic mountain birch forest with vascular plant leaf <b>litters</b> of poor and high quality. The non-additive effects in mass loss of <b>litter</b> mixtures increased when moisture conditions in <b>litter</b> and soil became more favourable for plant <b>litter</b> decomposition. The sign of this increase (antagonistic or synergistic) in non-additive effects was more predictable for <b>litter</b> mixtures of poor <b>litter</b> quality. Although the specific mechanisms underlying the IMC theory depended on the <b>litter</b> quality of the <b>litter</b> mixtures, a standardized water holding capacity (WHC) was the <b>litter</b> trait most {{closely related to the}} non-additive effects in mixtures of both poor and high quality <b>litter</b> types. Furthermore, we found that higher dissimilarity in WHC traits between the component <b>litter</b> species in a mixture increased synergistic effects in <b>litter</b> mixtures under limiting moisture conditions. However, under improved moisture conditions, increased antagonistic effects were observed. Thus, we found clear support for the IMC theory and showed that climatic conditions and leaf <b>litter</b> physical traits determine whether the non-additive effects in <b>litter</b> mixtures are antagonistic or synergistic. Our study emphasizes the need to include <b>litter</b> physical traits into predictive models of mixing effects on plant <b>litter</b> decomposition and in general suggests climate specificity into these models. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|<b>Litter</b> {{decomposition}} is {{a fundamental}} ecosystem process in which breakdown and decay of plant detritus releases carbon and nutrients. Invasive exotic plants may produce <b>litter</b> that differs from native plant <b>litter</b> in quality and quantity. Such differences may impact <b>litter</b> decomposition and soil respiration in ways that depend on whether exotic and native plant <b>litters</b> decompose in mixtures. However, few field experiments have examined how exotic plants affect soil respiration via <b>litter</b> decomposition. Here, we conducted an in situ study of <b>litter</b> decomposition of an annual native grass (Eragrostis pilosa), a perennial exotic forb (Alternanthera philoxeroides), and their mixtures in an annual grassland in China to examine potential invasion effects on soil respiration. Alternanthera <b>litter</b> decomposed faster than Eragrostis <b>litter</b> when each was incubated separately. Mass loss in <b>litter</b> mixes was more rapid than predicted from rates in single species bags (only 35 % of predicted mass remained at 8 months) showing synergistic effects. Notably, exotic plant <b>litter</b> decomposition rate was unchanged but native plant <b>litter</b> decomposition rate was accelerated in mixtures (decay constant k = 0. 20 month- 1) compared to in isolation (k = 0. 10 month- 1). On average, every <b>litter</b> type increased soil respiration compared to bare soil from which <b>litter</b> was removed. However, the increases were larger for mixed <b>litter</b> (1. 82 times) than for Alternanthera <b>litter</b> (1. 58 times) or Eragrostis <b>litter</b> (1. 30 times).

However, some games, such as the Halo series, (except for Halo PC and Custom Edition, which allow AI and custom objects and characters), allow filming only through puppetry.

However, Chris Burke intentionally hosts This Spartan Life in these unpredictable conditions, which are fundamental to the show. Other works filmed using puppetry are the ILL Clan's improvisational comedy series On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack and Rooster Teeth Productions' Red vs. Blue. In recamming, which builds on puppetry, actions are first recorded to a game engine's demo file format, not directly as video frames. Without re-enacting scenes, artists can then manipulate the demo files to add cameras, tweak timing and lighting, and change the surroundings. This technique is limited to the few engines and software tools that support it.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 20 German infantry and armoured divisions {{trapped in the}} Falaise pocket around 12 were still operating {{with a degree of}} combat-effectiveness. As these formations retreated eastwards they fought desperately to keep the jaws of the encirclement—formed by the Canadians in Trun and St. Lambert, and the Poles and Americans in Chambois—from closing. German movement out of the pocket throughout the night of 19 August cut off the Polish battlegroups on the Mont Ormel ridge. On discovering this Stefanowicz conferred with Koszutski. Lacking sufficient means to either seal the pocket or fight their way clear, the two decided that the only chance of survival for their force was to hold fast until relieved. Although the Polish soldiers on Point 262N could hear movement from the valley below, other than some mortar rounds that landed among the positions of the 8th Infantry Battalion the night passed uneventfully. Without possession of Point 262S the Poles were unable to interfere with the large numbers of German troops slipping past the southern slopes of the ridge. The uneven, wooded terrain, interspersed with thick hedgerows, made control of the ground to the west and southwest difficult by day and impossible by night. As it grew light on 20 August Szydłowski prepared to fulfil his orders of the previous day and organised two companies of his 9th Infantry Battalion, supported by the 1st Armoured Regiment, for an attack across the road towards Point 262S. However, hampered by the wreckage <b>littering</b> the pass the attack soon bogged down in the face of fierce German resistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of private piers situated upon {{the western and}} northern ends of Galveston Bay were destroyed {{as a result of}} Debra's storm surge. Damage primarily constituted to roofs, glass, sign boards, antennas, and certain sea vessels; abundant damage was caused by rising waters due to torrential rains. Approximately 90cattle were killed on the western edge of Galveston Island. Furniture was thrown from the luxury Buccaneer Hotel into its swimming pool, shattering a large window. In Fort Worth, the entrance to the Tabernacle Baptist Church was completely destroyed, with its remnants <b>littering</b> the adjacent road. The largest quantity of damage to sea vessels was consolidated near the Kemah-Baytown area. Widespread damage from winds and tides was evident in the Hitchcock area, where three men were rescued after attempting to endure the hurricane at a fishing camp, although they were later rescued. In the Houston area, damage was limited to power lines and downed trees. At the former Houston International Airport, air transport was terminated, and water transportation was impeded as vast ships remained in ports. Onlookers were advised not to touch downed power lines, and electricity was knocked out at a hospital and roads were immersed in floodwaters. Most rail and road traffic in Houston was significantly interrupted.|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} 30 years {{there has been}} a general trend in the US to reuse <b>litter</b> for longer periods of time. Factors driving this trend have been {{improved}} health programs, better housing and equipment, increased use of <b>litter</b> amendments, shortages and higher cost of bedding, and nutrient/waste management issues. There are four interrelated components to managing built up <b>litter.</b> These include managing for proper <b>litter</b> moisture and temperature, and reducing the challenge from disease and ammonia stress. Farm-related factors that contribute to poor <b>litter</b> conditions may include; wet or poor bedding quality, inadequate <b>litter</b> depth, poor site drainage, house condensation problems, improper management of the drinkers, cooling and ventilation systems, and not maintaining uniform bird density in houses. Controlling the depth of <b>litter</b> in a built up program can be an important tool in managing <b>litter</b> temperatures. Disease challenges associated with built up <b>litter</b> can be minimized by reducing <b>litter</b> moisture and ammonia, <b>litter</b> treatments to alter microflora populations, and timely plus effective removal of cake between flocks. The proper use of <b>litter</b> treatments and managing the factors influencing wet <b>litter</b> conditions are often key to reducing ammonia levels with built up <b>litter.</b> Failure to management <b>litter</b> quality in a built up <b>litter</b> program can be very costly and have negative environmental consequences...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the effect}} of <b>litter</b> mixture on {{decomposition}} has been well documented, {{few studies have examined}} the relationships between richness and relative abundance of leaf species in <b>litter</b> mixture and changes in universal fungal communities during the decomposition process in temperate forests. In this study, we used the litterbag method and included three leaf <b>litter</b> species, i. e., aspen (Populus davidiana Dode), birch (Betula platyphylla Sukaczev) and oak (Quercus mongolica Fischer ex Ledebour), to investigate the mass loss rate and diversity of universal fungal communities in each <b>litter</b> treatment, which were sampled in situ after 180, 240, 300 and 360 days of decomposition (between 2012 and 2013) in broadleaved mixed forests in Chinese temperate forests. Eight mixture proportions were examined: pure aspen <b>litter</b> (10 A), pure birch <b>litter</b> (10 B), pure oak <b>litter</b> (10 O), 50 % aspen <b>litter</b> mixed with 50 % birch <b>litter</b> (5 A: 5 B), 50 % aspen <b>litter</b> mixed with 50 % oak (5 A: 5 O), 50 % birch <b>litter</b> mixed with 50 % oak <b>litter</b> (5 B: 5 O), 10 % birch <b>litter</b> mixed with 80 % aspen <b>litter</b> and 10 % oak <b>litter</b> (1 B: 8 A: 1 O), 30 % birch <b>litter</b> mixed with 40 % aspen <b>litter</b> and 30 % oak <b>litter</b> (3 B: 4 A: 3 O). Over 360 days of decomposition, approximately 46. 6 %, 43. 6 %, 28. 0 %, 54. 4 %, 40. 2 %, 39. 5 %, 54. 5 % and 49. 46 % of <b>litter</b> mass was lost from 10 A, 10 B, 10 O, 5 A: 5 B, 5 A: 5 O, 5 B: 5 O, 1 B: 8 A: 1 O and 3 B: 4 A: 3 O, respectively. In addition, the number of fungal denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands showed a positive correlation with mass loss rate, indicating a positive feedback between leaf <b>litter</b> decomposition and universal fungal communities in the leaf <b>litter.</b> The results revealed that the 5 A: 5 B, 1 B: 8 A: 1 O and 3 B: 4 A: 3 O <b>litter</b> mixtures had a synergistic effect on the <b>litter</b> mixture, while the 5 A: 5 O and 5 B: 5 O <b>litter</b> mixtures had a nearly neutral effect on the <b>litter</b> mixture. Thus, leaf <b>litter</b> species composition and relative abundance seem to be more important than leaf <b>litter</b> richness in driving the direction and magnitude of <b>litter</b> mixture decomposition...|$|R

5|$|Utor caused {{extensive}} {{power outages}} in Cebu, Leyte, and Boracay, resulting in widespread loss of telecommunication. A single electric pole in northern Cebu caught fire during the storm, cutting out power to eight peripheral towns. Downtown Tacloban also suffered a blackout. Off of Boracay, a boat operator was killed after their ship capsized. Another 67ships, {{which consisted of}} speedboats and ferries, sunk during the storm's passage. Buildings were unroofed and trees were torn apart on the island, <b>littering</b> its beaches with debris. A barge was forced by large waves into the pier at San Agustin, Romblon, resulting in the spilling of 25,000L (6,600gal) of diesel fuel. Two children were killed in Tacloban and Capiz {{as a result of}} falling trees; an additional three people in Capiz were feared to have drowned due to floods. Two thousand people became stranded after the Philippine Coast Guard cancelled the operation of 43ferry services. Similarly, 8,000people became stranded at seaports after the coast guard barred vessels from sailing. Extensive damage occurred in Occidental Mindoro, where 422homes were destroyed and an additional 1,421damaged. Rough seas caused the outriggers on a ferry between Batangas and Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro to break apart, causing the ship to begin disintegrating offshore. However, the 104passengers and crew on board were able to escape and were later rescued. Further north in southern Luzon, roads and bridges were rendered impassable after sustaining damage.|$|E

40|$|Leaf <b>litter</b> {{decomposes}} on {{the surface}} of soil in natural systems and element transfers between <b>litter</b> and soil are commonly found. However, how <b>litter</b> and soil organic matter (SOM) interact to influence decomposition rate and nitrogen (N) release remains unclear. Leaf <b>litter</b> and mineral soil of top 0 - 5 cm from six forests were incubated separately, or together with <b>litter</b> on soil surface at 25 A degrees C for 346 days. <b>Litter</b> N remaining and soil respiration rate were repeatedly measured during incubation. <b>Litter</b> carbon (C) and mass losses and mineral N concentrations in <b>litter</b> and soil were measured at the end of incubation. Net N transfer from soil to <b>litter</b> was found in all <b>litters</b> when incubated with soil. <b>Litter</b> incubated with soil lost more C than <b>litter</b> incubated alone after 346 days. For <b>litters</b> with initial C: N ratios lower than 52, net N-min after 346 days was 100 % higher when incubated with soil than when incubated alone. <b>Litter</b> net N-min rate was negatively related to initial C: N ratio when incubated with soil but not when incubated alone. Soil respiration rate and net N-min rate did not differ between soil incubated with <b>litter</b> and soil incubated alone. We conclude that soils may enhance <b>litter</b> decomposition rate by net N transfer from soil to <b>litter.</b> Our results together with studies on <b>litter</b> mixture decomposition suggest that net N transfer between decomposing organic matter with different N status may be common and may significantly influence decomposition and N release. The low net N-min rate during <b>litter</b> decomposition along with the small size of <b>litter</b> N pool compared to soil N pool suggest that SOM rather than decomposing <b>litter</b> is the major contributor to plant mineral N supply...|$|R
30|$|<b>Litter</b> {{collection}} {{started in}} September 2014 at site A and September 2015 at site B.

In 2016, <b>litter</b> was collected throughout the year. <b>Litter</b> traps were emptied once per month. In 2014 (the first year), we separated <b>litter</b> into leaf <b>litter</b> and non-leaf fractions (fine branches ≤ 2.5 [*]cm in diameter, bark, reproductive structures, animal detritus, and other unidentified fine <b>litter).</b> However, only about 5 % of the total was in the non-leaf fraction and we therefore stopped separating <b>litter</b> thereafter. <b>Litter</b> amounts were very low in February and June 2016, and we therefore collected the <b>litter</b> together with the one trapped in the following month. All <b>litter</b> samples were weighed after oven-drying at 60 [*]°C for 48 [*]h.|$|R
40|$|Global {{changes such as}} {{increasing}} CO 2, rising temperature, and land-use change are likely to drive shifts in <b>litter</b> inputs to forest floors, but the effects of such changes on <b>litter</b> decomposition remain largely unknown. We initiated a <b>litter</b> manipulation experiment to test the response of <b>litter</b> decomposition to <b>litter</b> removal/addition in three successional forests in southern China, namely masson pine forest (MPF), mixed coniferous and broadleaved forest (MF) and monsoon evergreen broadleaved forest (MEBF). Results showed that <b>litter</b> removal decreased <b>litter</b> decomposition rates by 27 %, 10 % and 8 % and <b>litter</b> addition increased <b>litter</b> decomposition rates by 55 %, 36 % and 14 % in MEBF, MF and MPF, respectively. The magnitudes of changes in <b>litter</b> decomposition were more significant in MEBF forest and less significant in MF, but not significant in MPF.
