25|$|Bankhead {{received}} a Tony Award nomination for her {{performance of a}} bizarre 50-year-old mother in the short-lived Mary Coyle Chase play, Midgie Purvis (1961). It was a physically demanding role and Bankhead insisted on doing the stunts herself, including sliding down a staircase bannister. She received glowing reviews, but the play itself suffered from numerous rewrites and failed to last beyond a month. Her last theatrical appearance was in a revival of another Williams play, The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore (1963), directed by Tony Richardson. She had suffered a severe burn on her right hand from a match exploding while she <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> it was aggravated by the importance of jewelery props in the play. She took heavy painkillers, but these dried her mouth, and most critics thought that Tallulah's line readings were unintelligible. Like Antony and Cleopatra, the nadir of her career, she only made five performances, {{and in the same}} unhappy theater.|$|E
25|$|The first {{automatic}} electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, {{an associate of}} Thomas Edison. George Andrew Darby patented the first European electrical heat detector in 1902 in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas {{had no effect on}} the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that {{paved the way for the}} modern smoke detector. In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a cold cathode tube that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.|$|E
500|$|Cooper {{boarded the}} aircraft, a Boeing 727-100 (FAA {{registration}} N467US), and took seat 18C (18E by one account, 15D by another) {{in the rear}} of the passenger cabin. He <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> ordered a bourbon and soda. On-board witnesses described him as a man in his mid-forties, between [...] and [...] tall. He wore a black lightweight raincoat, loafers, a dark suit, a neatly pressed white collared shirt, a black necktie, and a mother of pearl tie pin.|$|E
60|$|Ughtred <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> fresh <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> smoked for <b>a</b> moment thoughtfully.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> fresh <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> smiled on Wolfenden thoughtfully.|$|R
60|$|Wolfenden <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> fresh <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> gazed thoughtfully {{into the}} little cloud of blue smoke.|$|R
2500|$|On 19 July Latham {{took off}} from Cap Blanc-Nez, very near Sangatte, but after only [...] his Antoinette IV {{suffered}} engine failure and Latham had to ditch in the Channel, thereby performing the world's first landing of an aircraft on the sea. The undamaged fuselage remained afloat, so he <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> awaited rescue by the French torpedo-destroyer Harpon that was following. After recovery of the aircraft, the engine was examined and a stray piece of wire was found inside the engine. [...] Levavasseur stated that the misfire was caused by this wire.|$|E
2500|$|Silva {{asked him}} where he shot the picture and was looking around to take the photo too. Carter pointed to a place [...] away. Then Carter {{told him that he}} had chasing the vulture away. He was {{completely}} shocked by the situation he had just photographed. He said to Silva [...] "I see all this, and all I can think of is Megan". Megan was his young daughter. He <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> became more and more emotional by the minute. [...] "I can't wait to hug her when I get home." [...] A few minutes later they got into the small UN plane and left Ayod for Kongor.|$|E
2500|$|Later, Dick <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> blew {{smoke in}} Jen's {{direction}} {{while she was}} eating. Jen asked for Dick to stop, but he did not. Jen then reached to get the cigarette from Dick several times to which Dick began to burn Jen with his cigarette. Jen began to yell that Dick burned her on purpose. This incident ended with Dick yelling at Jen. Jen burst into tears and Jameka pulled Jen away from the confrontation and to the bathroom. Neither Jen nor Dick was expelled from the House and Jen was evicted on Day 55. Jen said to the Associated Press: [...] "I definitely {{think he should have}} been kicked out, but obviously he was definitely entertainment for the show, so that's why he was not." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{thanked him}} silently. Lady Caroom {{was on her}} feet, and Sybil and she went out for their wraps. Lord Arranmore <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> fresh <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> sent for his bill.|$|R
60|$|The Prince sighed softly, <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette.</b> Lady Carey <b>and</b> Felix {{were already}} smoking.|$|R
60|$|The waiter {{was busy}} {{now with the}} removal of their luncheon. To Arnold, the {{necessary}} exchange of commonplaces was an immense relief. It was several minutes before they were alone again. Then she leaned across towards him. She had <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> now, <b>and,</b> although she was very thoughtful, she seemed more at her ease.|$|R
60|$|Nigel <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> {{pushed the}} box across to his companion.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Thurwell <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> {{drew his}} {{remaining}} letters toward him.|$|E
60|$|He <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> {{passed the}} box {{across the table}} to her.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Waddington rose {{slowly to}} his feet. He <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> sniffed it, <b>and</b> {{looked at it}} disparagingly. It was very fine Turkish tobacco and one of Burton's extravagances.|$|R
50|$|The next day, Betty {{walks into}} the front yard with <b>a</b> <b>lit</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> Bobby's BB gun and begins {{shooting}} at her neighbor's pigeons as they fly.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a little}} after sunrise one bright morning in September that Benham came up on to {{the deck of the}} sturdy Austrian {{steamboat}} that was churning its way with a sedulous deliberation from Spalato to Cattaro, <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> himself <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> seated himself upon a deck chair. Save for a yawning Greek sailor busy with a mop the first-class deck was empty.|$|R
60|$|Captain Francis <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> smoked thoughtfully for {{a moment}} or two.|$|E
60|$|Lord Dredlinton {{shrugged his}} shoulders. He <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> {{dismissed}} the subject.|$|E
60|$|The rescue-party set off. Martin <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> {{waited in}} the porch.|$|E
50|$|Maintaining an anti-careerist, anti-music {{industry}} attitude, {{the band}} rarely granted interviews. Instead, {{they got the}} music press to come to them with their live shows (which also included the drum machine). Mosshart chain-smoked while singing, rarely speaking to the audience; at a New York City show following the ban on public smoking, Mosshart went on stage with three bottles of water, <b>lit</b> up <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> proceeded to smoke constantly from the first song to the last note of the set. In 2004 Mosshard and Hince bought a house together in Dalston.|$|R
60|$|Whereupon he <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> fresh <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> did {{not speak}} a word until we had reached our destination. Isobel had gone to bed, and our sitting-room was empty. I turned up the lamp, and pushed a chair towards him. In various small ways {{he seemed to have}} succeeded in effecting a {{wonderful}} change in his appearance. His hair was differently arranged, and much greyer. His face was pale and drawn as though with illness. But for his voice and his broad, humorous mouth I doubt whether I should immediately have recognized him.|$|R
5000|$|Weekes also {{secretly}} {{negotiated with}} the Chief Constable of the South Wales Constabulary, David East, and with local union leaders, {{to ensure that the}} dispute was policed by local constabularies - {{in order to avoid the}} violent clashes seen elsewhere during the strikes. He made sure that the unions provided sufficient cover to maintain pumps and safety inspections so that work could resume promptly once the strike was over. Towards the end, while touring his pits, he was observed talking to pickets at the gates of Bedwas Navigation Colliery. During the conversation, he <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> - <b>and</b> the gesture was interpreted in high places as [...] "collaboration".|$|R
60|$|I <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> {{stood on}} the {{hearthrug}} with my hands behind me.|$|E
60|$|Scremerston {{was in an}} {{attitude}} of deep dejection. Logan <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> waited.|$|E
60|$|Wesson <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> {{threw the}} match {{out of the}} window before replying.|$|E
50|$|Maintaining an anti-careerist, anti-music {{industry}} attitude, {{the band}} rarely granted interviews. Rather, {{they got the}} music press to come to them with their minimalist yet powerful live shows (which also included the drum machine), the pair maintaining an air of tension by subverting the expected role of stage performer. Mosshart chain-smoked while singing, rarely speaking to the audience, whilst Hince violently ripped blues riffs from his instrument. At a New York City show following the ban on public smoking, Mosshart went on stage with three bottles of water, <b>lit</b> up <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> proceeded to smoke constantly from the first song to the last note of the set.|$|R
6000|$|Lord Lilac did {{not long}} remain. [...] Lord Lilac {{did not come}} again. [...] He softly <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> [...] <b>And</b> sought some other social set [...] Where, in some other knots or rings, [...] People were doing cultured things, [...] --Miss Zwilt's Humane Vivarium [...] --The little men that paint on gum [...] --The {{exquisite}} Gorilla Girl.... He sometimes, in this giddy whirl [...] (Not being really bad at heart), [...] Remembered Shakespeare with a start-- [...] But not with that grand constancy [...] Of Clement Shorter, Herbert Tree, [...] Lord Rosebery and Comyns Carr [...] And all the other names there are; [...] Who stuck like limpets to the spot, [...] Lest they forgot, lest they forgot.|$|R
30|$|To {{reduce the}} {{incidence}} of smoking-related fires, many European countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Italy, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Spain and Portugal (Singh & Jain 2009; Babrauskas et al. 2011; Guillame et al. 2008), have mandated that furniture fabrics must pass a standard test to ensure that they are resistant to <b>a</b> <b>lit</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> burning match, and this is normally achieved by treating furniture’s cover fabric and/or supporting foam with flame retardants.|$|R
60|$|He made {{a little}} grimace, but <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> turned up his coat collar.|$|E
60|$|Holmes had <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> was {{shooting}} little darting glances {{all over the}} room.|$|E
60|$|It {{was already}} past seven. I <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> strolled on towards the station.|$|E
5000|$|Edie's {{worsening}} {{drug addiction}} begins taking its toll. Her relationship with Andy deteriorates and she becomes a pariah among the Factory crowd. One night, {{while in a}} drug-induced stupor, she falls asleep with <b>a</b> <b>lit</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> nearly dies in the ensuing apartment fire. Vogue, which once championed her as the newest [...] "it" [...] girl, now refuses to hire her; editor Diana Vreeland (Illeana Douglas) explains that Edie is considered [...] "vulgar" [...] due to her current lifestyle.|$|R
60|$|At the top, {{from the}} cage, {{he looked down}} over the {{clustering}} red roofs {{of the town and}} the tower of the church, and then going to the southern side sat down <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> Red Herring <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> stared away south over the old bramble-bearing, fern-beset ruin, at the waves of blue upland that rose, one behind another, across the Weald, to the lazy altitudes of Hindhead and Butser. His pale grey eyes were full of complacency and pleasurable anticipation. Tomorrow he would go riding across that wide valley.|$|R
50|$|Ellen {{was furious}} {{to learn that}} Johnny had an affair many years and had secret daughter. Their {{marriage}} broke up as a result and Johnny moved in with Jenny and Nick. Overtime, Jenny and Johnny became closer and shared a kiss. Ellen burned her house down after falling asleep with <b>a</b> <b>lit</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> she and Minnie moved in with Carmen and Sam. When Ellen had a one-night stand with an old friend, Johnny was angry and took Minnie off {{on a trip to}} the U.S.A to visit the set of her favourite soap opera Tides of the Heart.|$|R
