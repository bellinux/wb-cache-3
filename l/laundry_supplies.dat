40|$|Fragranced {{consumer}} products (such as cleaners, air fresheners, <b>laundry</b> <b>supplies,</b> and personal care products) {{are widely used}} in homes, businesses, institutions, and public places. While prevalent, these products can contain chemicals that harm human and environmental health, and that are found in stormwater, wastewater, and water bodies such as Puget Sound. Moreover, these chemicals are typically not disclosed on product labels or material safety data sheets. This presentation provides results from an analysis of fragranced {{consumer products}}, the hazardous and undisclosed chemicals in those products, and their presence in water systems in the region. Among 24 best-selling products tested (including ones called "green" or "organic"), more than 150 volatile organic compounds were identified, {{many of which are}} classified as toxic or hazardous, but virtually none of which were listed on any product label or material safety data sheet. Results point to a need for improved understanding and disclosure of product constituents, and their fate and transport in water systems, and effects on human and environmental health. ...|$|E

5000|$|On August 8, 1924, George Van Waters and Nat Rogers {{opened a}} small firm in Seattle, Washington, USA, {{buying and selling}} naval supplies, paint, raw {{materials}} and cotton linters. When Van Waters & Rogers entered the <b>laundry</b> <b>supply</b> business, it {{paved the way for}} the company’s future in chemicals. Near the end of the 1920s, the company moved into a 5,000 sq ft facility just south of downtown Seattle and, soon after, it expanded into the entire facility and plant next door. In 1936, Van Waters & Rogers’ sales topped $1 million, and by the end of the decade the company was closing on the $2 million mark. Locations were added in Portland, Oregon, Spokane, Washington and Los Angeles, California. A notable addition was the industrial chemicals division headed by Glen McElvain, a chemical salesman who was instrumental in the acquisition of local chemical companies. In the 1940s, sales increased from $2 million in 1940 to more than $18 million in 1949. Acquisitions led to market entries in San Francisco and Texas and the first two women were appointed to officer positions. In 1949, Van Waters & Rogers celebrated its 25th anniversary.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The rapid {{urbanization}} and {{the constant}} expansion of urban areas during the last decades have locally led to increasing water shortage. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems {{have the potential to}} be an important contributor to urban water self-sufficiency. The goal {{of this study was to}} select an environmentally optimal RWH strategy in newly constructed residential buildings linked to rainwater demand for laundry under Mediterranean climatic conditions, without accounting for water from the mains. Methods: Different strategies were environmentally assessed for the design and use of RWH infrastructures in residential apartment blocks in Mediterranean climates. The harvested rainwater was used for laundry in all strategies. These strategies accounted for (i) tank location (i. e., tank distributed over the roof and underground tank), (ii) building height considering the number of stories (i. e., 6, 9, 12, and 15), and (iii) distribution strategy (i. e., shared <b>laundry,</b> <b>supply</b> to the nearest apartments, and distribution throughout the building). The RWH systems consisted of the catchment, storage, and distribution stages, and the structural and hydraulic calculations were based on Mediterranean conditions. The quantification of the environmental performance of each strategy (e. g., CO 2 eq. emissions) was performed in accordance with the life cycle assessment methodology. Results and discussion: According to the environmental assessment, the tank location and distribution strategy chosen were the most important variables in the optimization of RWH systems. Roof tank strategies present fewer impacts than their underground tank equivalents because they enhance energy and material savings, and their reinforcement requirements can be accounted for within the safety factors of the building structure without the tank.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the relative independent contributions of mobility and mental function to the prevalence rate of incontinence {{in a long-term}} care hospital and to establish the baseline prevalence rate and cost of incontinence before implementation of a continence program. DESIGN: Prevalence survey. SETTING: Long-term care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All 457 inpatients (mean age of men 73. 6 years, of women 73. 8 years) who met the defined criteria for degree of urinary and fecal incontinence, mobility and mental function. Of the 447 questionnaires that were returned 12 were incomplete. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Degree of urinary and fecal incontinence and costs of incontinence as measured by nursing time spent dealing with incontinent patients, <b>laundry</b> and incontinence <b>supplies.</b> RESULTS: The prevalence rate of urinary incontinence was 62 %, fecal incontinence 46 % and combined incontinence 44 %. The mean time spent each day dealing with incontinence was 52. 5 minutes per patient. The total annual cost of incontinence per patient was $ 9771. Mobility and mental function were independent predictors of frequency of urinary and fecal incontinence. Frequency of incontinent events was the strongest predictor of quantity of linen soiled, but immobility was the strongest predictor of nursing time spent dealing with incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate of urinary incontinence depends on patient characteristics and the definition of incontinence. A management approach to incontinence could lower <b>laundry</b> and <b>supply</b> costs, and improvements in mobility could reduce nursing time spent dealing with incontinence...|$|R

40|$|Hoteliers’ {{efforts to}} improve the {{environmental}} sustainability of their operations would be promoted by having a consistent industry-wide measure for benchmarking current operations and tracking the effect of environmental sustainability initiatives. This type of measure can also assist external stakeholders, such as the hotel guests and regulatory entities, to gauge hotels’ environmental sustainability efforts. This report presents the results of an exploratory study that develops such a measure, using resource consumption records of 984 U. S. hotels over a period of eight years. The measure is based on an analysis of resource consumption–related expenses found in these hotels’ year-end operating statements, for electricity, water and sewer, maintenance other expenses, and <b>laundry,</b> linen, and <b>supplies</b> for both the rooms and for food and beverage services. Using a multivariate data analysis technique called exploratory factor analysis, the measure developed in the study consists of two parts: an operating factor that comprises large weights from electricity, water and sewer, and maintenance expenses, and a behavioral factor, which is largely driven by <b>laundry,</b> linen, and <b>supplies</b> for both rooms and F 2 ̆ 6 B operations. In general, costs found in the operating factor are under management control, but the costs in the behavioral factor are subject to guests’ activities. By normalizing the average of each of these two factors at zero, hotels that score above zero on each factor are spending more than other hotels, and those with a score below zero are more efficient than others. These factors can be compared according to various hotel characteristics, such as chain segment, the involvement of a third-party professional management company in the operating structure, location (both in terms of the degree of urbanization and climate zone), and whether the hotel offers F 2 ̆ 6 B service. For instance, the above-average costs of providing F 2 ̆ 6 B are clearly depicted in these measurements (as compared with limited-service operations) ...|$|R

50|$|Life {{support systems}} for {{saturation}} {{systems can be}} fairly complex, as the occupants must remain under pressure continuously for several day to weeks. Sanitation systems for washing and waste removal are required. Discharge is simple because of the pressure gradient, but must be controlled to avoid undesired chamber pressure loss or fluctuations. Chamber gas may be simply vented and flushed if it is air, but helium mixtures are expensive and over long periods very large volumes would be needed, so the chamber gas of a saturation system is recycled by passing it through a carbon dioxide scrubber and other filters to remove odours and excess moisture. Oxygen content of the chamber gas is constantly monitored and fresh oxygen added when necessary to maintain the nominal value.

40|$|There are a {{range of}} non-clinical support {{services}} within hospitals, such as catering, linen / <b>laundry</b> and <b>supply</b> logistics, which are widely considered {{to have a significant}} effect on the delivery and quality of patient care. Supply chain activities are regarded as one of the most important owing to the potentially fatal consequences of ‘stock-outs’ (Özkil et al. 2009; Costantino et al. 2010) where key inventory becomes temporarily unavailable. As a result, hospitals typically employ inventory buffers but in spite of such practices, stock-outs still occur due to disparities in inventory requirements between the hospital and suppliers; the presence of unusual demand for specific items (Jarret 2006); and, receipt of goods which are faulty, contaminated or otherwise unfit for purpose. In such events, the supply chain needs to be agile, responding quickly in order to cater for demand. However, due to the structure of the healthcare supply chain which consists of an external chain (delivering goods to the hospital) and internal hospital chain (distributing delivered goods to end users throughout the hospital), the fast flow of goods is often stalled by the interface between the two (Aronsson et al. 2011). This paper critically assesses the current supply chain practices implemented at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) NHS Trust in London in relation to those that could be utilised, whilst presenting a new concept of supply for key lines and items to the trust using unattended electronic locker boxes to create a more individualistic human-centric service for users, with the overall aim of improving the speed of the distribution of goods both internally (between players once inventory has arrived at the hospital) and externally (for inventory being delivered into the hospital from outside) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} a {{randomized}} clinical trial with 133 incontinent elderly in seven nursing homes {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of a behavioral training therapy and its cost implications. The training program lasted three months, and a 22 -week follow-up period examined the durability of the treatment effect. The therapy became effective after six weeks of training. By the final months of training, the treatment participants' wet episodes had been reduced by 0. 6 episode per day, or a 26 percent reduction over baseline, and improvement was maintained during the follow-up period. Trainees with a high frequency of incontinence during baseline, relatively more cognitive residents, and residents with a normal bladder capacity responded better to this behavioral program. The cost of training was the equivalent of about one hour of nursing aide time per patient day. The reduction in incontinence during the follow-up period resulted in some small savings in <b>laundry</b> costs and <b>supplies</b> used, and some quantitatively unmeasurable but detectable improvement in psychosocial well-being among the trainees. Since the central figure in implementing this training protocol is the nursing aide, it is important to find an organizational management scheme that will stimulate nursing aides to reduce incontinence among nursing home residents...|$|R

40|$|In 2004, {{when the}} Department for Correctional Services {{recognized}} the need to expand the Mobilong prison facility, it decided to undertake radical and innovative changes to set a new standard for correctional facilities. The resulting correctional facility development contains 10 duplex housing units that have 5 bedrooms arranged around a common living space that includes a kitchen, bathroom, and securable veranda area. Five inmates live in each duplex to allow for group voting processes. Inmates living in the duplexes assume responsibility for meal preparation, ordering <b>supplies,</b> <b>laundry,</b> and cleaning. The development uses efficient sustainable environmental development solutions and passive environmental principles, such as vertical windows to allow for a connection to the external environment and solar hot water systems. The buildings, which are oriented along the east-west axis for solar radiation, are arranged around a court area that has a garden and public telephones. The facility meets the safe cell design recommendations of the Victorian Building Design Review Project and includes touches such as recessed lighting, sloped knobs and water taps, and rounded edges. Safety features include the use of steel sheeting and steel-reinforced concrete block work and vertical windows with openings of approximately 5 inches to preclude a window escape. The duplex design of the Mobilong Prison represents a new alternative to the traditional cell block facilities and demonstrates the capacity to create humane and secure correctional environments.
