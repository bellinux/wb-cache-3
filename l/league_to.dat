5|$|After the 1907 season, Stricklett {{returned}} to the California <b>League</b> <b>to</b> pitch for the San Jose Prune Prickers and Sacramento Sacts, and refused to report to Brooklyn in 1908 as his wife wanted him to remain closer to their California home. As the California League was not recognized in organized baseball at this time, Stricklett was banned by MLB for four years. Though he applied for reinstatement, his banishment was upheld. Stricklett continued to pitch for San Jose through 1910, pitching to a 23-12 record in 1909 and a 19-14 record in 1910.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Mikan {{returned}} to professional basketball, {{becoming the first}} commissioner of the American Basketball Association, a rival <b>league</b> <b>to</b> the NBA.
