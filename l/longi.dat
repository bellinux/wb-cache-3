5|$|Germanicus' {{divisions}} met {{up to the}} north, and ravaged {{the countryside}} between the Ems and the Lippe, and penetrated to the Teutoburg Forest, a mountain forest in Western Germany situated between these two rivers. There, Germanicus {{and some of his}} men visited the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, and began burying the remains of the Roman soldiers that had been left in the open. After half a day of the work, he called off the burial of bones so that they could continue their war against the Germans. He made his way into the heartland of the Cherusci. At a location Tacitus calls the pontes <b>longi</b> ("long causeways"), in boggy lowlands somewhere near the Ems, Arminius' troops attacked the Romans. Arminius initially caught Germanicus' cavalry in a trap, inflicting minor casualties, but the Roman infantry reinforced the rout and checked them. The fighting lasted for two days, with neither side achieving a decisive victory. Germanicus' forces withdrew and returned to the Rhine.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Of ten {{patients}} with lacerations of the flexor hallucis <b>longus</b> tendon, nine were athletically in-dined. In four, the laceration was not repaired and no disability was evident. A functioning flexor hallucis <b>longus,</b> therefore, {{does not seem}} to be essential for good push-off and balance in running sports. If both the flexor hallucis brevis and the flexor hallucis <b>longus</b> are lacerated and reconstitution of the <b>longus</b> is not possible, the brevis should be repaired, suturing the distal segment of the <b>longus</b> to the brevis to prevent hyperextension deformity of the metatarsophalangeal joint. Hypersensitivity of the scar due to associated nerve injury is a frequent complication associated with laceration of the flexor hallucis <b>longus.</b> Laceration of the flexor hallucis <b>longus</b> tendon is...|$|R

50|$|The palmaris <b>longus</b> {{muscle is}} the most popular for use in tendon grafts for the wrist due to the length and {{diameter}} of the palmaris <b>longus</b> tendon, {{and the fact that it}} can be used without producing any functional deformities. When a tendon becomes ruptured in the wrist, the palmaris <b>longus</b> tendon may be removed from the flexor retinaculum and grafted to take the place of the ruptured tendon. The tendons most commonly replaced or supplemented by the palmaris <b>longus</b> tendon when ruptured are the long flexors of the fingers and the flexor pollicis <b>longus</b> tendon.|$|R
