50|$|CPM {{relies on}} {{activity}} dates {{as the basis}} for float calculations, where total float is determined by the difference between <b>late</b> <b>finish</b> <b>dates</b> and early <b>finish</b> <b>dates.</b> This requires a standby calculation engine to perform a forward pass and a backward pass of the entire network when planning ceases or when an interim calculation is necessary for further planning. The result is that planning and scheduling are separate processes performed in sequential order.|$|R
30|$|Regarding PPS {{and project}} scheduling, {{there is a}} mature body of {{knowledge}} that includes quantitative and qualitative approaches (Carazo et al. 2010; Frey and Buxmann 2012; Perez and Gomez 2014). Quantitative approaches typically propose planning models, whereas qualitative approaches introduce reference processes (Archer and Ghasemzadeh 1999; Jeffery and Leliveld 2004). PPS is the activity “involved in selecting a portfolio, from available project proposals […] that meets the organization’s stated objectives in a desirable manner without exceeding available resources or violating other constraints” (Archer and Ghasemzadeh 1999, p. 208). The PPS process comprises five stages: pre-screening, individual project analysis, screening, optimal portfolio selection, and portfolio adjustment (Archer and Ghasemzadeh 1999). In the pre-screening stage, projects are checked for strategic fit and whether they are mandatory. During individual project analysis, all projects are evaluated individually against pre-defined performance indicators. The screening stage eliminates all projects that violate critical performance thresholds. The optimal portfolio selection stage then establishes the project portfolio that best meets the performance indicators, considering project interactions (e.g., mutual exclusion, predecessor/successor) and further constraints (e.g., <b>latest</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>dates,</b> restricted budgets) (Kundisch and Meier 2011; Liu and Wang 2011). Finally, decision-makers may adjust the project portfolio.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} jobs that any manager can take on in the management of a large scale project that requires coordinating numerous activities throughout the organization. A myriad of details must be considered in planning how to coordinate all these activities, in developing a realistic schedule, and then in monitoring the progress of the project. Fortunately, two closely related operations research techniques, PERT (program evaluation and review techniques) and CPM (critical path method) were developed in the 50 's, within different contexts: the CPM was developed for planning and control of DuPont engineering projects and the PERT was developed for the management of the production cycle of the Polaris missile. They share the same objectives such as defining the project duration and the critical task. The PERT/CPM technique is based on two straight steps; a forward propagation to define the earliest start and <b>finish</b> <b>dates</b> (and subsequently the project duration and the free floats), and a backward promulgation for the <b>latest</b> start and <b>finish</b> <b>dates</b> (and the total floats). Initially, the activity times are static within the CPM technique and probabilistic within the PERT technique. Over the last few decades, both CPM and PERT techniques have been universal to fuzzy and stochastic areas. To treaty with uncertainty in project management. Predominantly, Fuzzy PERT and CPM are to be deliberated to treaty particularly with fuzzy planning. On the antagonistic to PERT/CPM technique that ignores an...|$|R
50|$|The project {{started as}} part of the MTA's Program for Action, a 1968 plan proposing {{numerous}} improvements to subway, railway, and airport service in the New York metropolitan area. The plan included a new LIRR terminal at a proposed Metropolitan Transportation Center at Third Avenue and 48th Street in East Midtown. It also included connections to Grand Central Terminal, with a new northern entrance leading to the center, and the Second Avenue Subway, among other transit services. The new LIRR line was to branch off from existing lines in Sunnyside, Queens and enter Manhattan using a new two-level tunnel under 63rd Street; the upper level was to be used by the New York City Subway's 63rd Street Line and the lower level was for the LIRR. Construction on the tunnel began in November 1969; the MTA's contractor floated pre-manufactured four-chamber tunnel boxes into place in the East River and sank them to create the East River crossings for the subway and the LIRR. Construction costs were expected to be offset by building office space above the transportation center. A mezzanine was planned for above four island platforms and eight tracks, which were split evenly across two levels; this was similar to the structure currently under construction. By <b>late</b> 1974, the <b>finishing</b> <b>date</b> for East Side Access was set to 1993.|$|R
