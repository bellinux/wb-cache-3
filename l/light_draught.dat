5|$|The Eriskay Pony {{developed}} in the Hebrides, a group of western isles in Scotland. The origins of the breed are ancient, with roots in Celtic and Norse breeding. It is physically similar to drawings of ponies on ancient Pictish stones found in north and west Scotland. It is related to other northern breeds, including the Icelandic horse and the Faroe pony. The Eriskay {{takes its name from}} the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides. Originally, the breed had a fairly large population, and until the mid-19th century the Eriskay and similar ponies were found throughout the western islands of Scotland. They were used as crofters' ponies, as pack animals, for <b>light</b> <b>draught</b> and as mounts for children.|$|E
5|$|The Rathores, {{traditional}} {{rulers of}} the Marwar region of western India, {{were the first to}} breed the Marwari. Beginning in the 12th century, they espoused strict breeding that promoted purity and hardiness. Used throughout history as a cavalry horse by the people of the Marwar region, the Marwari was noted for its loyalty and bravery in battle. The breed deteriorated in the 1930s, when poor management practices resulted in a reduction of the breeding stock, but today has regained some of its popularity. The Marwari is used for <b>light</b> <b>draught</b> and agricultural work, as well as riding and packing. In 1995, a breed society was formed for the Marwari in India. The exportation of Marwaris was banned for decades, but between 2000 and 2006, a small number of exports were allowed. Since 2008, visas allowing temporary travel of Marwaris outside India have been available in small numbers.|$|E

They captured 24 officers and 421 other ranks at Quneitra.|$|E
60|$|The {{next three}} days were spent in circumnavigating the sand-banks and in {{sounding}} the various channels, but at last the captain was obliged to admit {{that none of them}} were deep enough for the Furious, although there were fully half a dozen by which vessels of <b>lighter</b> <b>draught</b> might enter.|$|R
25|$|After arrival, {{the vessel}} {{was taken to}} Mort's Dock for {{inspection}} and was docked for overhaul before being placed in commission and into the so-called North Coast Butter Run to the Clarence and Richmond River a similar but of <b>lighter</b> <b>draught</b> vessel was then ordered {{for use in the}} Macleay River trade.|$|R

25|$|The Friesian (also Frizian) is a horse breed {{originating}} in Friesland, in the Netherlands. Although the conformation of the breed {{resembles that of}} a <b>light</b> <b>draught</b> horse, Friesians are graceful and nimble for their size. It is believed that during the Middle Ages, ancestors of Friesian horses were in great demand as war horses throughout continental Europe. Through the Early Middle Ages and High Middle Ages, their size enabled them to carry a knight in armour. In the Late Middle Ages, heavier, draught type animals were needed. Though the breed nearly became extinct {{on more than one}} occasion, the modern day Friesian horse is growing in numbers and popularity, used both in harness and under saddle. Most recently, the breed is being introduced to the field of dressage.|$|E
25|$|EXCURSION TO MIDDLE HARBOUR – About 150 persons {{proceeded}} on an excursion on Saturday afternoon by the Steamer Herald to {{the head}} of Middle Harbour. The magnificent scenery which surround the placid waters of this beautiful lake-like locality is very little known by the general public, many of whom fancy that the Spit {{is the head of the}} navigation, whereas a steamer of a <b>light</b> <b>draught,</b> such as tho Herald, can proceed several miles beyond. The Herald left the Circular Quay at half-past 1 pm on Saturday, and, after calling at Woolloomooloo Bay, reached Bates at half-past 4. Mr. George Hall was on board, and to that gentleman some of the excursionists were indebted for his courtesy in pointing out objects of interest met with on the passage. After a delay of about a quarter of au hour, during which time several of the passengers went on ashore in search of flowers, the steamer's head was turned for Sydney, where the party was landed in good time and thoroughly well pleased with their trip.|$|E
500|$|The Eriskay Pony is a {{breed of}} pony from Scotland. It is {{generally}} grey in colour, {{and has a}} dense, waterproof coat that protects it in harsh weather. The breed developed in ancient times in the Hebrides islands in Scotland, and a small population remained pure and protected from crossbreeding by the remoteness of the islands. It is used for <b>light</b> <b>draught</b> [...] work, as a mount for children, in many equestrian disciplines, and for driving. The breed is rare today, with the Rare Breeds Survival Trust considering their status critical. There are two breed registries for the Eriskay, the first formed in 1971 and the second in 1986.|$|E

60|$|The {{launch in}} which they {{embarked}} bore the Red Cross on its sides, and an American flag floated from the bow and a Red Cross flag from the stern. Its four occupants wore the Red Cross uniforms. Yet three miles out of Dunkirk a shot came singing across their prow and they were obliged to lay to until a British man-of-war could lower a boat to investigate their errand. The coast is very shallow in this section, which permits boats of only the <b>lightest</b> <b>draught</b> to navigate in-shore, but the launch was able to skim over the surface at twelve miles an hour.|$|R
50|$|These {{two ships}} were built {{to the same}} concept as Inflexible - a heavily {{armoured}} citadel carrying four heavy guns mounted 'en echelon' in turrets to achieve all-round fire - but were required to be of <b>lighter</b> <b>draught,</b> and to displace 3,000 tons less. It was therefore necessary to arm them with guns of 12.5 inch calibre, as against 16 inch in Inflexible, and to accept a maximum speed of nearly two knots less. Also, unlike the Inflexible, these ships were dependent upon the integrity of their unarmoured ends to maintain buoyancy; should the ends have been damaged enough to become waterlogged, the ships would have sunk.|$|R
500|$|The Eriskay Pony {{generally}} {{stands between}} [...] It is usually grey in colour, {{although a few}} are bay or black. Dark coloured animals generally have the pangaré characteristics of a light-coloured muzzle and ring around their eye. However, according to breed standards, {{they should not have}} an eel stripe. Chestnut, piebald, skewbald and excess white markings are discouraged by breed registries. The winter coat is dense and waterproof to protect from the harsh climate, with a thick mane and tail. The head is large, with a wide forehead. The neck and shoulders are well muscled, and the chest deep but generally not broad. The rib-cage is long and the loins short, which increases the strength of the back. The croup is slightly sloping. It is quite similar to the Exmoor pony in body type. The Eriskay has an easy-going temperament and is suitable as a mount for children. It is used for <b>light</b> <b>draught</b> work, as well as dressage, show jumping, three-day eventing, western riding and driving. Eriskays have successfully competed in combined driving at highly competitive international level competitions sanctioned by the Fédération Équestre Internationale. They have also been used in therapeutic horse-riding.|$|E
2500|$|The Irish cob can {{be traced}} to the 18th century but also was long {{considered}} a type, not a breed, and varied somewhat in characteristics, though generally was bred for <b>light</b> <b>draught</b> and farm work but was also capable of being ridden.

60|$|She had her choice, and {{she took}} it. The end came when, presuming on her <b>lighter</b> <b>draught,</b> she tried to draw away northward over a {{friendly}} shoal. The shell that arrived {{by way of the}} Chief Engineer's cabin was some five inches in diameter, with a practice, not a bursting, charge. It had been intended to cross her bows, and that was why it knocked the framed portrait of the Chief Engineer's wife - and she was a very pretty girl - on to the floor, splintered his wash-hand stand, crossed the alleyway into the engine-room, and striking on a grating, dropped {{directly in front of the}} forward engine, where it burst, neatly fracturing both the bolts that held the connecting-rod to the forward crank.|$|R

2500|$|The {{first known}} {{importers}} of the Gypsy Horse to North America, Dennis and Cindy Thompson, viewed the breed as unnamed and chose the name [...] "vanner", calling their association the Gypsy Vanner Horse Society. [...] A [...] "vanner" [...] is a <b>light</b> <b>draught</b> horse suitable for pulling a horse-drawn van or omnibus; the term dates {{to at least}} 1888. [...] Before {{the formation of the}} American society in 1996, the word [...] "vanner" [...] appears in two printed sources in association with these horses. In 1979, Harvey described a Roma-owned horse as [...] " [...] fair-sized vanner, about 15.2hh (15 1/2 hands) high, [...] [...] [...] ross-shire, with a touch of Clydesdale? Lineage is often hard to trace." [...] Publishing in 1993 in the first known acknowledgment of the Gypsy Horse as a distinct breed outside Romani culture, Hart employs the term three times in reference to a Gypsy Horse, identifying specific Gypsy Horses as vanners.|$|E

500|$|Stopford was not intimidated and at 10:30 his {{squadron}} {{bore down}} on the French {{in a line of}} battle led by Defiance and followed by Caesar, Donegal and Amelia. At 11:00 Defiance, with the <b>lightest</b> <b>draught</b> of the ships of the line, was able to close to within [...] of the French squadron. The British ship opened fire and took fire in response from the frigates and batteries. At 11:20 Caesar and Donegal joined the attack, followed at 11:30 by Amelia. The concentrated fire of the large British ships was far too heavy for the French and at 11:50 Cybèle and Italienne cut their anchor cables and drifted away from the British and onto the shore. Neither crew was able to continue in the fight as burning wadding had drifted from Defiance and set them on fire. At about this time Caesar withdrew to deeper water to avoid grounding and Defiance veered anchor cable to turn its fire onto Calypso.|$|R
5000|$|The Grand Noir du Berry was in {{the past}} used in {{agricultural}} work, particularly in vineyards, and for <b>light</b> agricultural <b>draught</b> work; from about 1850 it was also used to draw barges on the Canal de Berry and other canals of the region, work that had previously been done by men. Today it may be used as a pack animal for hiking or trekking, or for recreational driving; jacks may be used to sire mules.|$|R
60|$|The gunboat {{was a large}} one, {{and carried}} two midshipmen besides Parkhurst and Balderson, who were, however, their seniors. The mess {{consisted}} of the four lads, a master's mate, the doctor's assistant, and the paymaster's clerk. In the gun room were the three lieutenants, the doctor, the lieutenant of the marines, and the chief engineer. The crew consisted of {{a hundred and fifty}} seamen and forty marines; the Serpent having a somewhat strong complement. She had been sent out specially for service in the rivers, being of <b>lighter</b> <b>draught</b> than usual, with unusually airy and spacious decks, and so was well fitted for the work. The conversation in the junior mess of the Serpent was very lively that evening. The vessel since her arrival on the station had made two runs between Singapore and Penang, but those on board had seen but little of the country, and were delighted at the thought of a possibility of active service, and the talk was all of boat expeditions, attacks from piratical prahus, of the merits of the bayonet and rifle opposed to kris and spear, and of sporting expeditions in which elephants, tigers, and other wild beasts were to fall victims of their prowess.|$|R

60|$|But Spike soon {{determined}} not to leave a point so delicate as that {{of his own and}} his vessel's security to be decided by a mere superiority in the way of heels. The Florida Reef, with all its dangers, windings, and rocks, was as well known to him as the entrances to the port of New York. In addition to its larger channels, of which there are three or four, through which ships of size can pass, it had many others that would admit only vessels of a <b>lighter</b> <b>draught</b> of water. The brig was not flying light, it is true, but she was merely in good ballast trim, and passages would be available to her, into which the Poughkeepsie would not dare to venture. One of these lesser channels was favourably placed to further the escape of Spike, and he shoved the brig into it after the struggle had lasted less than an hour. This passage offered a shorter cut to {{the south side of the}} reef than the main channel, and the sloop-of-war, doubtless perceiving the uselessness of pursuit, under such circumstances, wore round on her heel, and came down through the main channel again, just entering the open water, near the spot where the schooner had sunk, as the sun was setting.|$|R

50|$|Captain Browne {{worked with}} Alexander Watson {{throughout}} {{the design and}} construction phases of the BX. Watson purchased the BX's boiler, engines and other equipment from the Chicago Marine Ironworks Company, who were informed that the BX's construction site at Soda Creek was 167 mi away from the railway at Ashcroft and therefore the equipment {{would have to be}} hauled by horse drawn freighters for that distance. Chicago Marine decided to build the boiler in sections, the heaviest piece was less than 10000 lb, so it was easily transported to the construction site. They also supplied two compound condensing engines for the BX which would use half the fuel of a single engine of similar power. These engines gave the BX an enormous advantage over the other sternwheelers that were on the river at this time, as it cut down on both the labor needed to load the wood and the cargo space required to carry it.It was later estimated that these engines saved the BX a sum equal to the amount of her construction, $54,531.33.For the hull, Watson turned to local man, William Lyne, who was a portable sawmill operator.Lyne was instructed to find a good stand of fir and cut the necessary timbers and planks. Intending to build a steamer with the <b>lightest</b> <b>draught</b> possible, Watson built the rest of the BX out of first grade cedar, shipped up from Victoria. Construction began in February when Watson arrived with a crew of fifty carpenters, joiners and labourers and work was begun on the hull.|$|R
60|$|The door of {{the cottage}} had been {{carelessly}} closed the previous night when the family retired to rest, and a chink of it was open, through which a <b>light</b> <b>draught</b> of summer air came in.

60|$|He {{strode to}} the end of the bridge and glanced down at the lift of rusty side. There was a good deal of it above the water, for the Cumbria was loaded easily, and she was also, he was very glad to remember, <b>light</b> of <b>draught.</b> He could not check her with an anchor under foot. She would only swing to it, and that would land her among the {{mangroves}} broadside on. If he backed his propeller he would as surely go ashore, and his face grew very grim as he made the helmsman a little sign. Since he must strike the forest, he would strike it fair, as hard as the engines could drive her, bows on; and he thrust down the telegraph once more for the last pound of steam.|$|R
50|$|The CB90 is an {{exceptionally}} fast and agile boat that can execute extremely sharp turns at high speed, decelerate from top speed {{to a full}} stop in 2.5 boat lengths, and adjust both its pitch and roll angle while under way. Its <b>light</b> weight, shallow <b>draught,</b> and twin water jets allow it to operate at speeds of up to 40 kn in shallow coastal waters. The water jets are partially ducted, which, along with underwater control surfaces similar to a submarine's diving planes, gives the CB90 its manoeuvrability.|$|R
