50|$|When {{commissioned}} in 1943, Howrah was the 3rd-longest {{cantilever bridge}} in the world, behind Pont de Québec (549 m) in Canada and Forth Bridge (521 m) in Scotland. It has since been surpassed by three bridges, making it the sixth-longest cantilever {{bridge in the}} world in 2013. It is a suspension type balanced cantilever bridge, with a central span 1,500 ft between centers of main towers and a suspended span of 564 ft. The main towers are 280 ft high above the monoliths and 76 ft apart at the top. The anchor arms are 325 ft each, while the cantilever arms are 468 ft each. The bridge deck hangs from panel points in the lower chord of the main trusses with 39 pairs of hangers. The roadways beyond the towers are supported from ground, leaving the anchor arms free from deck load. The deck system includes cross girders suspended between the pairs of hangers by a pinned connection. Six rows of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stringer</b> girders are arranged between cross girders. Floor beams are supported transversally on top of the stringers, while themselves supporting a continuous pressed steel troughing system surfaced with concrete.|$|E

Ply thicknesses, ply orientations, and stiffener heights can be used as design variables. Buckling, displacement, and material failure constraints can be imposed on the design. The system is used to conduct a preliminary design study of geodesically stiffened shells. For comparison purposes, optimal designs of unstiffened shells, and ring and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stringer</b> stiffened shells are also studied. Trends in the design of geodesically stiffened shells are identified. Features that enhance the capabilities and efficiency of the design system are described...|$|E

40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{detecting}} {{the location of}} structural damage in an aircraft fuselage using modal test data are presented. Both methods use the dynamically measured static flexibility matrix, which is assembled {{from a combination of}} measured modal vectors, frequencies, and driving point residual flexibilities. As a consequence, neither method requires a mode-to-mode correlation, and both avoid tedious modal discrimination and selection. The first method detects damage as a softening in the point flexibility components, which are the diagonal entries in the flexibility matrix. The second method detects damage from the disassembled elemental stiffnesses as determined using a presumed connectivity. Vibration data from a laser vibrometer is used to measure the modal mechanics of a DC 9 aircraft fuselage before and after induced weakening in a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stringer.</b> Both methods are shown to detect the location of the damage, primarily because the normal stiffness of the reinforced shell of the fuselage is localized to a few square centimeters...|$|E

40|$|Orthotropic steel highway bridges {{are subject}} to {{variable}} traffic loads, which differ in type and magnitude. Most of these bridges were built in 1960 ’s under design traffic load, which reflects the traffic conditions of those times. However, the number and weight of vehicles in traffic have increased since then too much in comparison to today. As a result these bridges are loaded more than their designed traffic loads and hence bridges ' fatigue lives are shorten.

In {{the scope of this}} study the traditional steel orthotropic highway bridge is analyzed using a FE- model, which encompasses bridge ' s entire geometry. The traffic load is selected so conservatively, that it is composed of static wheel loads and wheel load area, which comply with the wheels of vehicles used today in traffic. Subsequently, fatigue lives of four fatigue sensitive structural parts of bridge are calculated.

Numerically predicted modal frequencies for the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stringer,</b> ring frame and dome component models, and six assembled ATC configurations were compared with experimental modal survey data.

The predictions for the modal frequencies of the assembled component Configurations I through V were within an average 2. 9 % and 9. 1 %. Finite element modal analyses were performed for comparison with 3 psi and 6 psi internal pressurization conditions in Configuration VI. The modal frequencies were predicted by applying differential stiffness to the elements with pressure loading and creating reduced matrices for beam elements with offsets inside external superelements. The average disagreement between the measured and predicted differences for the 0 psi and 6 psi internal pressure conditions was less than 0. 5 %.

25|$|In {{a typical}} wooden sailboat, the hull is {{constructed}} of wooden planking, supported by transverse frames (often {{referred to as}} ribs) and bulkheads, which are further tied together by <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stringers</b> or ceiling. Often but not always there is a centerline longitudinal member called a keel. In fiberglass or composite hulls, the structure may resemble wooden or steel vessels to some extent, or be of a monocoque arrangement. In many cases, composite hulls are built by sandwiching thin fiber-reinforced skins over a lightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam, balsa wood, impregnated paper honeycomb or other material.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, a {{new steel}} bridge was built about 0.35 mi downstream. In 1965, the Dinkey Creek Bridge closed to {{automobile}} traffic because of wood rot; it {{has served as}} a pedestrian bridge since then.

This was then enclosed within circular wooden formers bearing <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stringers</b> and covered with fabric. The tail surfaces were all-moving, without a fixed fin or horizontal stabiliser. The aircraft was powered by a 75 kW (100 hp) Oberursel U.I rotary engine. In {{the case of the}} V.1 the V did not stand for Versuchs (experimental), but for Verspannungslos (literally [...] "without struts"), or cantilever.

40|$|A {{monocoque}} {{box beam}} {{consisting of a}} 24 S-T aluminum-alloy sheet reinforced by four bulkheads and by <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stringers</b> and corner posts was subjected to bending loads as follows: pure bending about the lift axis, cantilever bending about the lift axis, and pure bending about both lift and drag axis. Longitudinal strains were measured for loads up to a load at which permanent set became measurable. The loads were sufficient to produce buckling of the sheet between stringers on the compression side of the box. The only noticeable effect of this buckling was a small increase in extreme-fiber strain on the compression side. The measured strains and measured deflections differed less than 10 percent from those computed from the simple beam theory after taking account of the effective width of the buckled sheet.

Specifically, the inner section was built around two spars equipped with steel booms which had enough room between them to accommodate a 200 kg-class bomb and large self-sealing fuel tanks; the spars did not continue to the wing-tip but made way for a box-type structure. The wings were furnished with large split-type slotted flaps, which were electronically controlled and high aspect-ratio slotted ailerons, the latter of which being depressed during takeoff.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{aircraft}} fuselage {{shell is}} composed of stressed skin, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stringers,</b> and circumferential frames.

Due to presence of large number of rivet holes, the fuselage skin has a large number of high stress locations and these are locations of potential crack initiation. When the fuselage is pressurized and depressurized during each take-off and landing cycle of aircraft, the metal skin of fuselage expands and contracts resulting in fatigue crack initiation. In the present work, aircraft fuselage was selected as stiffened structure, Airbus A 340 and Airbus A 380 was selected for the process and modeling was done accordingly. The response of structure for the hoop stress and longitudinal stress developed in the fuselage due to cabin pressurization is studied by using finite element analysis technique. In addition, the tear strap can be used as bending material to increase the frame stiffness and static strength. The midway tear strap is installed by riveting. The possibility of starting a crack at a midway tear strap would be reduced if the strap were bonded to the skin without additional rivets. The tear strap will reduce the deformation and stress in the fuselage skin and the results are compared...|$|R

40|$|Transport {{aircraft}} is {{a highly}} complex structure. The aircraft fuselage shell is composed of stressed skin, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stringers,</b> and circumferential frames. The skin {{is connected to the}} stringers and frames mostly by rivets. Fuselage has a number of riveted joints and is subjected to a major loading of differential internal pressurization. When the fuselage is pressurized and depressurized during each take-off and landing cycle of aircraft, the metal skin of fuselage expands and contracts resulting in metal fatigue. Due to presence of large number of rivet holes, the fuselage skin has a large number of high stress locations and these are locations of potential crack initiation. The wide bodied transport aircraft are designed to tolerate large fatigue cracks. This paper focuses attention on damage tolerance design of a fuselage structure of transport aircraft. In this paper, the stress intensity factor, quantifying the intensity of the stress field around a crack tip for a longitudinal crack under the pressurization load is studied.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the natural frequencies and normal modes of vibration for con-tinuous panels, representing more or less typical fuselage skin-panel construction for modern airplanes, is discussed in this paper. The time-dependent boundary conditions at the supporting stringers are considered. A numerical example is presented, and analytical results for a particular structural configuration agree favorably with available experimental measurements. KNOWLEDGE is often required of the natural frequen-cies and normal modes of vibration for typical skin-stringer fu-selage panels of flight vehicles for studies in sonic fatigue, sound transmission, and panel flutter. It appears that analyses in the literature for panel vibration characteristics are based on over-simplified boundary conditions, corresponding either to knife-edge or clamped types of supports without consideration of the dynamic behavior of the structural members supporting the skin. This assumption is not justifiable at the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stringers,</b> since they are generally fairly flexible both in bending and in torsion, and absorb {{a significant amount of}} energy in the over-all system. On the other hand, the exact nature of the boundary conditions at the circumferential frames are not normally critical in the study of panel vibrations, because the frames are generally spaced farther apart than are the stringers and are much more rigid in radial deformation. By assuming the boundary condi-tions at the frames as simple supports, only small errors will be introduced. The objective is to develop a vibration theory for typical air-plane skin-stringer panels considering the time-dependent na-ture of the restraints due to the stringers. The mathematical model of the structure is chosen as a row of panels between two frames. The skin is assumed to be continuous over the inter...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSince December 2015, a {{new steel}} bridge spans the Danube River in Bratislava {{in place of}} the Old Bridge which was {{disassembled}} in 2014. A detail design and construction of the bridge is described in the article. The bridge carries trams, pedestrians and cyclists. The bridge has also been designed for future use of tram-trains. It crosses the Danube River with a navigation clearance of 100 m by 10 m and both embankments. The bridge has spans 32. 56 + 106. 68 + 137. 16 + 75. 6 + 75. 92 + 32. 56 m. The superstructure is formed by two steel lattice girders of the total height of 11. 285 m in the distance of 11 m. The rails rests on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stringers</b> supported by truss cross girders which are overhanging outside the main girders in order to support pedestrians and cycle path as well. The standard deck width of 22. 25 m is enlarged above river piers by observatory platforms to the total width of 33. 25 m. Old piers 2, 5, 6, 7 dated from 1890 have been reconstructed. They are formed by original stone masonry walls with concrete core. Piers 3 and 4 were completely demolished and have been replaced by a new pier 34. The superstructure was incrementally launched into its final position supported by piers and a temporary floating support which was used for the main spans of 106. 68 and 137. 16 m in the Danube River. The movement of the floating support was provided by the launched bridge. An interaction between the bridge and the floating support was taken into account in the analysis and is described in the article. During the launching, both the bridge and the floating support were carefully monitored. A comparison of theoretical assumptions and measured values are presented in the paper...|$|R

The latter carries trim tabs. [...] The Sky first flew in September 1950. Trials led to readjustment of the centre of gravity and the replacement of the Gull IV rudder with an aerodynamically balanced one of greater chord.

5000|$|Saunders were keen to {{make the}} hull simple to construct, partly {{to keep costs down}} and partly because the company's {{craftsman}} were predominantly skilled in wood, rather than metal, work. The A.14 designer, Henry Knowler introduced two innovations, one structural and one hydrodynamic. Other manufacturers had stiffened their hulls with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stringers,</b> riveted {{to the inside of the}} hull. These required a lot of riveting and also some complicated mechanical detail where they met the transverse frames. Knowler's design replaced the internal stringers with external corrugations in the hull plating which needed no riveting and avoided the stringer-frame intersection. They were spaced a few inches apart, so (on each side) there were five above the chine and four on the two step planing bottom. The hydrodynamic novelty was less subtle: most flying boats had used hulls which in cross section curved outwards from the keel rather than take a simple V-form, chiefly to reduce [...] "dirty" [...] upward spray. Such hull forms required beaten metal panels of double curvature, rather than just bent. To avoid this complication Knowler used a single curvature V-form hull which was narrower than the upper hull at the chines, filling the gap with horizontal sheeting. The hull was built of duralumin with Alclad plating. Internally the new hull was roomier than that of the metal hulled Southampton Mk II, being wider in the beam. The Saunders fuselage was a little shorter than Supermarine's, by about a foot (300 mm) and also lighter judging by the overall empty weights for the two aircraft (8,870 lb or 4,023 kg for the A.14, 9,697 lb or 4,398 kg for the Southampton). Certainly the Southampton had the more graceful lines, the rounded fuselage rising smoothly to the tail in contrast with the A.4's slab sided, linearly graded form. The two aircraft had almost identical maximum speeds, confirming Knowler's estimate that the inevitable extra drag of the external corrugations would be insignificant at the low speeds of these biplane flying boats.|$|R
