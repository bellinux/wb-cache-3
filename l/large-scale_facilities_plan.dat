40|$|Universities {{are under}} {{increasing}} pressure {{to demonstrate that}} continuous performance improvement is being delivered for user satisfaction, but the importance of <b>facilities</b> <b>planning</b> as a student-staff focused tool needs to be emphasised. This research sought answers to questions relating to the underlying structure of sustainable <b>facilities</b> <b>planning</b> and user satisfaction, {{and the number of}} factors that make up the <b>facilities</b> <b>planning</b> scale. Three universities from the south-western part of Nigeria were selected randomly using ownership structure to define the cases: University of Lagos, Akoka, Lagos, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso and Joseph Ayo Babalola University, Ikeji Arakeji, each representing the Federal, State, and Private ownership. A questionnaire survey was used on a random sample of 651 staff and students from the three universities. Six hundred questionnaires were retrieved (response rate of 92. 2 %). An exploratory factor analysis was used to understand the responses and the interrelationships. The results showed a two-factor solution of ‘locational advantages and user needs’ and ‘adequacy of facilities/functional connection and four core determinants for acceptance. It is concluded that universities should factor student-staff focus points into their <b>facilities</b> <b>planning</b> schemes to optimise their service deliveries. The study contributes to the discussion on factor structure of sustainable <b>facilities</b> <b>planning</b> scale with a focus on students and staff of universities.   Keywords: <b>Facilities</b> <b>planning,</b> universities, data structure, factors, Nigeria. </p...|$|R

It must be recognized, however, that the practical impact of the efforts made up to now is rather weak. This paper presents an interactive, user-friendly decision-support tool for public <b>facility</b> <b>planning</b> where the capabilities of geographic iformation systems and advanced optimization methods are put together. We hope that it will contribute to bridge the gap between research and practice that characterizes the way public <b>facility</b> <b>planning</b> is made at present. The application of the decision-support tool is illustrated for a real-world setting. ...|$|R
