50|$|Chard {{was first}} {{described}} in 1753 by Carl von Linné as Beta vulgaris var. cicla. Its taxonomic rank has changed many times, {{so it was}} treated as a subspecies, convariety or variety of Beta vulgaris. (Some of the numerous synonyms are Beta vulgaris subsp. cicla (L.) W.D.J. Koch (Cicla Group), B. vulgaris subsp. cicla (L.) W.D.J. Koch var. cicla L., B. vulgaris var. cycla (L.) Ulrich, B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris (<b>Leaf</b> <b>Beet</b> Group), B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris (Spinach Beet Group), B. vulgaris subsp. cicla (L.) W.D.J.

DC., B. vulgaris L. subsp. vulgaris (<b>Leaf</b> <b>Beet</b> Group), B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris (Swiss Chard Group)). The accepted name for all beet cultivars, like chard, sugar beet and beetroot, is Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris. They are cultivated descendants of the sea beet, Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima. Chard belongs to the chenopods, which are now mostly included in the family Amaranthaceae (sensu lato).|$|E

5000|$|The quarry was {{administered}} by the Roman army. The quarry men of Mons Claudianus were a skilled and well-paid civilian workforce, and their lifestyle at the quarry could even be described as luxurious. The Ostraca refer to four groups of people: soldiers and officials; skilled, civilian workers; unskilled workers; and women and children. According to the Ostraca ( [...] earthen pots with inscriptions on them) many of the workers at Mons Claudianus earned around 47 drachmas a month -which was about {{twice as much as}} their counterparts in the Nile Valley as well as one 'artab' which was approximately 47 pints of wheat. Evidence has been found of 55 different food plants and 20 sources of animal proteins. Fish from the red sea, luxuries like artichoke and citron as well as pepper from India and Game animals, snails and oysters were some of the foods available. Findings of seeds of cabbage, <b>leaf</b> <b>beet,</b> lettuce, mint, basil and a few others, which would not have been present if the vegetables were delivered to eat, suggest that, food was both delivered and grown at Mons Claudianus, to maintain the health of the workers with proper iron and vitamin C intake. Germinated, carbonised barley grains have also been found, suggesting that the inhabitants brewed beer. Imported chaff, straw, barley grain, charcoal and midden material were used for animal fodder, as temper for the making of wall plaster and mud-brick, and for fuel for the ovens and fires. At the Quarries, several columns, some basins and a bath can still be found lying broken; the largest column is 60 ft high and weighs some 200 tonnes. Many buildings still survive intact to roof height. The settlement resembled a fort with walls and projecting towers, and housed an estimated 1000 people, both quarrymen and guards. The stones from the quarries were shaped in the desert, possibly to reduce their weight, then taken to the Nile Valley to be shipped to Rome.|$|E
40|$|Four {{mitochondrial}} minisatellites {{were used}} to study cytoplasmic diversity in leaf and garden beet germplasm resources. Eleven multi-locus haplotypes were identified, of which one (named mitochondrial minisatellite haplotype 4, hereafter min 04) was associated with male-sterile Owen cytoplasm and two others (min 09 and min 18), with a normal fertile cytoplasm. European <b>leaf</b> <b>beet</b> germplasm exhibited the greatest haplotype diversity, with min 09 and min 18 predominating. In North African <b>leaf</b> <b>beet</b> accessions, only these two haplotypes were observed, making it likely that North African accessions were descended from European genotypes. The prevalence of min 18 was also noted in <b>leaf</b> <b>beet</b> from the Middle East and western Asia.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to set up and improve innovative strategies and machines for physical weed control in organic or “integrated” vegetable crops cultivated in five important areas of Central and Southern Italy. Experimental on-farm trials were carried out on fresh marketable spinach, processing and fresh market tomato, cauliflower, savoy cabbage, potato, greenhouse cultivated <b>leaf</b> <b>beet,</b> garlic, chicory, fennel and carrot. The traditional farm weed management system was always compared to an innovative system. The innovative strategy was the combination among preventive methods (false or stale seed-bed technique), cultural methods (crop spatial arrangement adjusted in order to improve machinery effectiveness) and direct control methods (flaming, hoeing, etc.). Different kinds of flex tine and rolling harrows (patented by the University of Pisa) and flamers were used for false or stale seed-bed technique. Precision hoes and hoe-conformed rolling harrows, equipped with elastic tines for selective in-row weed control, were used for post emergence interventions. The innovative weed management systems always resulted in significant weed abundance reductions (from 70 to 100 %), relevant yield increases (from 10 to 100 %) and high contractions of manpower requirement (from 20 to 80 %) compared to the standard systems. The results of these on-farm experimental trials emphasise that physical weed control can be effectively performed using the innovative machines built at the University of Pisa.

Methods: Vegetables studied included parsley, leek, <b>leaf</b> <b>beet,</b> fenugreek, cress, basil, radish and the coriander. The sampling was performed during 3 months, from September to October, 2008. The collected 180 samples of vegetables, water, soil, after preparation by atomic absorption Spectrophotometers, were analyzed according to standard methods. Results: Mean concentration values of lead, cadmium, chromium, arsenic and zinc in vegetable samples were, respectively 23. 99, 2. 09, 5. 4, 5. 26, 168. 4 micrograms per gram of plant tissue. Mean concentrations of heavy metals in water were, respectively, 7. 55, 4. 85, 0. 78, 12. 83 and 347. 99 mg per liter in water samples. Mean concentrations of heavy metals in soil were, respectively, 81. 12, 14. 43, 134. 32, 19. 08 and 435 micrograms, per gram of soil sample. Comparing the mean concentration values for heavy metals available in vegetables, water and soil with standard values, significant differences are observed except for Zn.

Two experiments, with a 30 -day interval between sowings were carried out in EPAGRI, Experimental Station of Ituporanga. The experimental design was of randomized complete blocks with four replications and 2, 25 m&# 178; plots. Disease severity was assessed weekly, using a diagrammatic rating scale, in ten plants taken at random and previously labelled. Disease severity data were used to calculate the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) for each cultivar. Same plants were used to estimate yield. AUDPC and yield data were submitted to analysis of variance (F-test, 5 % probability), and means were studied by the Scott-Knott test (5 % probability). There were no significant differences between cultivars, nor for reaction to the disease, neither for yield, in any of the two sowing dates.

In RBL mice, lipid peroxidation determined as 2 -thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS value) was significantly reduced in the plasma and selected organs (liver, heart, and kidney). Levels of antioxidants (glutathione and β-carotene) and the activities of antioxidant enzyme (glutathione peroxidase) in plasma and liver were considerably increased, suggesting that antioxidant defenses were improved by RBL diet. Comet parameters such as tail DNA (%), tail extent moment, olive tail moment and tail length were significantly reduced by 25. 1 %, 49. 4 %, 35. 4 %, and 23. 7 %, respectively, in plasma lymphocyte DNA of RBL mice compared with control mice, and indicated the increased resistance of lymphocyte DNA to oxidative damage. In addition, the RBL diet controlled body weight together with a significant reduction of fat pad (retroperitoneal, epididymal, inguinal fat, and total fat).

To investigate the gene functions further, it was introduced into red <b>leaf</b> <b>beet</b> by the floral dip method mediated via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The transformants demonstrated typical phenotypes as with other PttKN 1 transformants. These alterations were very different from the morphology of the wild type. Among them, morphological modification of changed color throughout the entire plant from claret of wild type to yellowish green was the highlight in those transgenic PttKN 1 -beet plants. The result of spraying selection showed that the PttKN 1 -beet plants had kanamycin resistance. PCR assay of the 35 S-Promoter, NPTII and PttKN 1 gene, PCR-Southern analysis of the NPTII and PttKN 1 gene showed that the foreign PttKN 1 gene had successfully integrated into the genome of beet plant. Furthermore, the results of RT-PCR analysis showed that the gene was ectopic expressed in transgenic plants. These data suggested that there is a correlation between the ectopic expression of PttKN 1 gene and morphological alterations of beet plants. Pigment content assay showed that betaxanthins concentrations shared little difference between wild type and transgenic lines, while betacyanins content in transgenic plants was sharply decreased, indicating that the altered plant coloration of the transgenic beet plants may be caused by the changed betacyanins content.

40|$|The {{double-stranded}} RNA genome of beet cryptic virus 1 (BCV 1) {{has been}} translated, after denaturation, in a wheat germ cell-flee system. Two major polypeptides, of approximate M r 52000 and 67000, were produced. The smaller polypeptide, encoded by RNA 2 (Mr 1. 15 × 106), was immunoprecipitated by an antiserum against virus particles, {{and is therefore}} {{likely to be the}} coat protein; the larger polypeptide, ncoded by RNA 1 (Mr 1. 36 × 106), is a likely candidate for the viral transcriptase. These two proteins represent most of the coding capacity of the BCV l genome (88 % for RNA 1 and 82 % for RNA 2), thus BCV l RNAs seem to act as monocistronic genes. Cryptic viruses have small isometric particles that contain dsRNA. They are present in low concentration i their host plants, are transmitted only through seed and pollen, and appear to induce no symptoms or cytopathological modifications in their hosts (Boccardo et al., 1987). Virus particles with these features were first described by Kassanis et al. (1977) (see also Kassanis, 1984) in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L., subsp, vulgaris), cv Sharpes Klein E, and named beet cryptic virus (BCV). Later Natsuaki et al.

40|$|Exogenously {{supplied}} indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) stimulated ethylene {{production in}} tobacco (Nicotiana glauca) leaf discs {{but not in}} those of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). The stimulatory effect of IAA in tobacco was relatively small during the first 24 hours of incubation but became greater during the next 24 hours. It was found that leaf discs of these two species metabolized [1 - 14 C]IAA quite differently. The rate of decarboxylation in sugar beet discs was much higher than in tobacco. The latter contained much less free IAA but a markedly higher level of IAA conjugates. The major conjugate in the sugar beet extracts was indole- 3 -acetylaspartic acid, whereas tobacco extracts contained mainly three polar IAA conjugates which were {{not found in the}} sugar beet extracts. The accumulation of the unidentified conjugates corresponded with the rise of ethylene production in the tobacco leaf discs. Reapplication of all the extracted IAA conjugates resulted in a great stimulation of ethylene production by tobacco leaf discs which was accompanied by decarboxylation of the IAA conjugates. The results suggest that in tobacco IAA-treated leaf discs the IAA conjugates could stimulate ethylene production by a slow release of free IAA. The inability of the exogenously supplied IAA to stimulate ethylene production in the sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaf</b> discs was not due to a deficiency of free IAA within the tissue but rather to the lack of responsiveness of this tissue to IAA, probably because of an autoinhibitory mechanism existing in the sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaf</b> discs...|$|R

40|$|Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is {{the most}} {{important}} pulse crop and is an important source of dietary protein. It is mainly grown in Indian subcontinent, Ethiopia, Turkey, Mexico, and some regions around the Mediterranean and in the Middle East. Recently the crop is gaining prominence in Canada and Australia. Two types of chickpea are grown commonly, the ‘desi’type in Indian subcontinent and ‘kabuli’ type in West Asia and Mediterranean region, and this type is gaining popularity. Several viruses have been reported to infect chickpea. The most important of them worldwide are Alfalfa mosaic virus, Bean <b>leaf</b> roll virus, <b>Beet</b> western yellows virus, Chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus, Cucumber mosaic virus, Chickpea stunt disease-associated virus and Faba bean necrotic yellows virus. A brief account on virus properties, diagnosis and management of these viruses are presented. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Anatomical and ultrastructural {{details of}} a translocating 10 -cm <b>leaf</b> of sugar <b>beet</b> (Beta vulgaris L. var. Klein Wanzleben) were {{correlated}} with translocation rate data. The minor veins {{were found to be}} 13 times as extensive as the major veins and measure 70 cm/cm 2 leaf lamina. Measurements disclosed that a 33 -μ length of minor vein services 29 mesophyll cells with the result that translocate moves an average of 73 μ or 2. 2 cell diameters during transport from mesophyll cells to a minor vein. High-resolution, freeze-dry autoradiography revealed that assimilates accumulate in organelle-rich cells of the minor vein phloem. Correlation of phloem volume and loading rate for minor veins yielded an uptake rate of 735 μmoles of sucrose per g fresh weight of phloem. The arrangement and structural features of minor veins appeared to be consistent with the concept that vein loading precedes translocation...|$|R
40|$|A proton–sucrose symporter mediates the key step {{in carbon}} export from leaves of most plants. Sucrose {{transport}} activity and steady-state mRNA levels of BvSUT 1, a sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaf</b> sucrose symporter, are negatively regulated specifically by sucrose. Results reported here show that BvSUT 1 mRNA was localized to companion {{cells of the}} leaf's vascular system, which supports {{its role in the}} systemic distribution of photoassimilate. Immunoblot analysis showed that decreased transport activity was caused by a reduction in the abundance of symporter protein. RNA gel blot analysis of the leaf symporter revealed that message levels also declined, and nuclear run-on experiments demonstrated that this was the result of decreased transcription. Further analysis showed that symporter protein and message are both degraded rapidly. Taken together, these data show that phloem loading is regulated by means of sucrose-mediated changes in transcription of a phloem-specific sucrose symporter gene in a regulatory system that may play a pivotal role in balancing photosynthetic activity with resource utilization...|$|R
40|$|The hemibiotrophic fungus Cercospora beticola causes {{leaf spot}} of sugar <b>beet.</b> <b>Leaf</b> spot control {{measures}} include {{the application of}} sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides. However, reduced sensitivity to DMIs has been reported recently in the Red River Valley sugar beet-growing region of North Dakota and Minnesota. Here, we report the cloning and molecular characterization of CbCyp 51, which encodes the DMI target enzyme sterol P 450 14 α-demethylase in C. beticola. CbCyp 51 is a 1, 632 -bp intron-free gene with obvious homology to other fungal Cyp 51 genes and is present as a single copy in the C. beticola genome. Five nucleotide haplotypes were identified which encoded three amino acid sequences. Protein variant 1 composed 79 % of the sequenced isolates, followed by protein variant 2 that composed 18 % of the sequences and a single isolate representative of protein variant 3. Because resistance to DMIs {{can be related to}} polymorphism in promoter or codin...|$|R
