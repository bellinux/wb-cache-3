60|$|I gave a {{start of}} surprise. Minnie <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> half maliciously.|$|E
60|$|The matrimonial mishap <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with almost}} canine {{intelligence}} in his face.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like {{a father}} gazing tenderly at the wayward child.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly I looked up. Nettie {{had come}} back and stood <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped in}} front of my chair, and stood <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with an {{expression}} in which I read a contemptuous amazement.|$|R
6000|$|At this Mrs. Pallant got up; {{she stood}} there <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "You make my reparation--my expiation--difficult!" [...] And leaving me still more {{astonished}} she moved along the terrace.|$|R
60|$|The priest <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{a puzzled}} {{expression}} in his brown eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Bowater <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{listening}} to this high-piped recitative with an unusual inquisitiveness.|$|E
60|$|She {{paused in}} her polishing, a shining dish in her hand, and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{something}} between a laugh and a frown.|$|E
60|$|I {{was awakened}} {{by the light of}} a hand-lantern shining in my face. A small man of about thirty, with green eyes and a tangle of fair hair, stood <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you {{remember}} THAT, any way," [...] she said, in a teasing little way, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and laughing. [...] "I thought you'd remember that. I must say you enjoyed yourself wonderfully at Berry Pomeroy!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{can still}} see Harry {{standing}} wrapped in his long fur coat <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with kindly eyes. In due time I learned that he gave me very good counsel, though it was much against my wishes that I followed it.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{from under}} his {{beautiful}} eyelashes (have I mentioned that I am a little woman?), and he asked in his persuasive tones: [...] "Must we say good-by?" ...|$|E
60|$|A deep, hollow peal {{followed}} my nerveless little pull at the chain bell-rope, {{and almost immediately}} the door opened. A grey-haired manservant, in black livery, <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in surprise.|$|E
6000|$|And {{the pool}} answered, 'But I loved Narcissus because, {{as he lay}} on my banks and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> in the mirror of his eyes I saw ever my own beauty mirrored.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{remained}} {{for a time}} <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and, I could feel, perplexed by me, but I {{wanted to go on}} with my thinking, and so I did not look up, and presently she stooped to my forehead and kissed me and went rustling softly to her room.|$|R
6000|$|... "He made {{a gesture}} as if to put aside an importunate ghost. And now they were both <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I {{wondered}} whether anything was expected from me. To my round, questioning eyes my uncle remarked: 'He's completely deaf.' And the unrelated, inexpressive voice said: 'Give me your hand.' ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{found that}} I was under discussion, I opened my eyes. Master was {{standing}} there, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and by his}} side {{the man who had}} just said I was ugly enough. The man was a thin man, about the age of a barman and smaller than a policeman. He had patched brown shoes and black trousers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{imagined}} so," [...] I answered. [...] "Perhaps {{you will}} admit that you owe me some explanation." [...] He laughed, a deep bass laugh, and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a gleam of humour in his black eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Here {{he stepped}} forward a pace and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> then added with a laugh, [...] "Allemachte! I fear that won't be just at present. Why, the lad looks as though one might blow him away like a feather." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what {{is there}} to look at?" [...] My friend was a young farmer, stoutly built, brown eyed, with a {{naturally}} fair skin burned dark and freckled in patches. He laughed, seeing me start, and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with lazy curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, if I only could!" [...] she said. [...] "I {{could have}} once. But now I'm afraid--afraid of getting lost." [...] Slowly she {{straightened}} up, her hands falling into her lap. I seized them again, I {{was on my}} knees in front of her, before the fire, and she, intent, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> into me, through me it seemed--at something beyond which yet was me.|$|R
50|$|As always, {{the miners}} were <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from their barracks, chin on hand. Their faces, which before had {{filled me with}} such loathing, now seemed like clay dolls' heads. They were not ugly, not frightening, not hateful. They were just faces, as {{the face of the}} most {{beautiful}} woman in Japan is just a face. And I was exactly like these men, a human being of flesh and bone, entirely ordinary and entirely meaningless.|$|R
60|$|At last I heard father come in. He questioned, mother's voice replied. He {{remained}} ominously silent. She went on quietly {{but with}} an eloquence unusual in her. What {{she said to him}} I never knew, but when he came up the stairs and stood <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> his anger had cooled. He merely asked me how I felt, uncovered my burned feet, examined them, put the sheet back, and went away, without a word either of reproof or consolation.|$|R
60|$|Presently, {{when she}} <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> I {{received}} that subtle impression of change, {{and read it}} as her soft mood of dangerous sweetness that came so seldom, mingled with something deeper, more of character and womanliness than I had ever sensed in her.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> choking {{back his}} tears and {{brightening}} up, {{but just then}} the balloon ran into a cross-current, turned half around and lay over. This set him swinging back and forth, and he fetched the canvas another bump. Then he began to cry again.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was silence}} between {{us for a}} while, then, quietly raising herself, she <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> on the pillow, and, finding me to be still awake, a long smile spread over her face: [...] "Why, we don't seem neither of us to be much good at daytime sleeping." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jolly old house, isn't it?" [...] he observed, {{as though}} I had casually dropped {{in on him}} for a chat; and he stood, with his hands behind him {{stretched}} to the blaze, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "It was built by a certain Colonel Draper, who fought at Louisburg, and afterwards fled to England {{at the time of}} the Revolution. He couldn't stand the patriots, I'm not so sure that I blame him, either. Are you interested in colonial things, Mr. Paret?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alan Fraser?" [...] I repeated, with a strange, horrible {{feeling of}} coldness and chill coming over {{me like a}} shadow on a bright day. Alan Fraser, the son of old Malcolm Fraser of Glenellyn! The son of our enemy! He had been living since {{childhood}} with his dead mother's people, so much I knew. And this was he! Something stung and smarted in my eyes. I think the sting and smart might have turned to tears if Father had not been <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|Thumbelina dashes at the window-doors {{and shuts}} them {{and shuts the}} casement. Then she dashes to my bedhead and turns on the light, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as if I were a rabbit in the grass. Then she flings a can of water against the wash-bowls--cold water, icy, alas. After which, small and explosive, she explodes {{her way out of}} the room again, and leaves us in the glaring light, having replied that it is now a little after six o'clock, and dinner is half past seven.|$|R
6000|$|I {{never saw}} Grace either {{confused}} or taken by surprise, {{and when she}} explained quietly her father <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from the top step as he said, [...] "I thank you, sir, but I did not catch the name. May I ask who it is to whom we are so much indebted? Neither do I quite understand yet how we got here before you." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{suggested}} {{other possible}} authors and admirers. She rejected them all. We reached her gate, and I lingered. As she <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{from the stone}} steps her eyes shone with a soft light that filled me with radiance, and into her voice had come a questioning, shy note that thrilled the more because it revealed a new Nancy of whom I had not dreamed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was very}} much astonished, but my uncle {{received}} it {{as a matter of}} course. He wrote something at which the other glanced and nodded slightly. A thin wrinkled hand--the hand was older than the face--patted my cheek and then rested on my head lightly. An un-ringing voice, a voice as colourless as the face itself, issued from his sunken lips, while the eyes, dark and still, <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> kindly.|$|E
6000|$|I {{laid down}} the letter for a moment. If I had not already reproached myself for having misjudged Cristel--and if I had not, in that way, done her some little justice in my own better thoughts--I should never have {{recovered}} my self-respect after reading the deaf man's letter. The good girl! The dear good girl! Yes: that was how I thought of her, under the windows of my stepmother's boudoir--while Mrs. Roylake, for all I knew to the contrary, might be <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and when Lady Lena, the noble and beautiful, was coming to dinner! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} {{as we were}} going down a steep slope, one of the pack horses bolted and ran round Ladrone {{entangling}} me in the lead rope. When I came to myself I was under my horse, saddle and all, and Ladrone was <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in wonder. The tremendous strain on the rope had pulled me saddle and all under his belly, and had he been the ordinary cayuse he would have kicked me to shreds. To my astonishment and deep gratitude he remained perfectly quiet while I scrambled {{out from under his}} feet and put the saddle in place.|$|R
60|$|I headed my {{train on}} Ladrone, {{who led the}} way with a fine stately tread, his deep brown eyes alight with intelligence, his {{sensitive}} ears attentive to every word. He had impressed me already by his learning and gentleness, but when one of my packhorses ran around him, entangling me in the lead rope, pulling me to the ground, the final test of his quality came. I expected to be kicked into shreds. But Ladrone stopped instantly, and <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> inquiringly, {{waited for me to}} scramble out from beneath his feet and drag the saddle up to its place.|$|R
