5|$|Though widely {{respected}} in her later years, Roosevelt was a controversial First <b>Lady</b> <b>at</b> {{the time for}} her outspokenness, particularly her stance on racial issues. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies. She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, {{for the families of}} unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the civil rights of African Americans and Asian Americans, and the rights of World War II refugees.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated at {{not being}} {{accepted}} as a serious actor, Leno became obsessed {{with the idea of}} playing Richard III and other great Shakespearean roles, inundating the actor–manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree with his proposals. After his final run of Mother Goose at the Drury Lane Theatre in early 1903, Leno's delusions overwhelmed him. On the closing evening, and again soon afterwards, he travelled to the home of Constance Collier, who was Beerbohm Tree's leading <b>lady</b> <b>at</b> His Majesty's Theatre, and also followed her to rehearsal there. He attempted to persuade her to act alongside him in a Shakespearean season that Leno was willing to fund. On the second visit to her home, Leno brought Collier a jewellery box holding a diamond-encrusted plaque. Recognising that Leno was having a mental breakdown, she sadly and gently refused his offer, and Leno left distraught.|$|E
5|$|Under Edward VI John Dudley, Viscount Lisle {{was raised}} to the title of Earl of Warwick, while Edward Seymour, Earl of Hereford became Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector. In October 1549 the Protector lost his power in a trial of {{strength}} with the Privy Council, from which John Dudley, Earl of Warwick emerged as Lord President of the Council {{and leader of the}} government. Somerset, who had been imprisoned in the Tower of London, was soon allowed to rejoin the Council. Before his release, the Duchess of Somerset and the Countess of Warwick had arranged daily banquets to reconcile their husbands. A marriage between their respective eldest son and daughter, Anne Seymour and John Dudley, was equally promoted by the two ladies. In June 1550 a grand wedding was staged at the palace of Sheen, attended by the twelve-year-old King Edward. Jane Dudley continued as a great <b>lady</b> <b>at</b> court during the ascendancy of her husband, who became Duke of Northumberland in October 1551. She was influential with him; the financier Thomas Gresham and the diplomat Richard Morrison sought her patronage, and she also interceded for Mary Tudor, who had stood godmother to one of her daughters in 1545.|$|E

25|$|Once in the United States, Vishniac tried {{desperately to}} earn sympathy for impoverished Jews in Eastern Europe. When his work was {{exhibited}} at Teachers College, Columbia University in 1943, he wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt (First <b>Lady</b> <b>at</b> the time), asking her to visit the exhibit, but she did not. He also sent some of his photographs to the President, {{for which he was}} politely thanked.|$|E
25|$|This theory remains disputed. There is no {{historical}} evidence regarding Vermeer's interest in optics, {{aside from the}} accurately observed mirror reflection above the <b>lady</b> <b>at</b> the virginals. The detailed inventory of the artist's belongings drawn up after his death does not include a camera obscura or any similar device. However, Vermeer was in close connection with pioneer lens maker Antonie van Leeuwenhoek and Leeuwenhoek was his executor after death.|$|E

25|$|Other sources {{claim that}} the White Lady is Perchta von Rosenberg, {{daughter}} of Ulrich II von Rosenberg, a German noble woman from the 15th century, who unhappily married against her will to Jan of Liechtenstein.

25|$|The first {{recorded}} reference to Bredemers is in a 1488 document which lists {{him as one}} of the singers of Cathedral of Our Lady (Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekathedraal), Antwerp.

Bredemers must have attained a considerable reputation in the following years: by 1501 he was distinguished enough to enter the chapel of Philip the Handsome as organist.|$|E

He worked with various {{repertory}} companies {{around the country and}} became known for his character roles, which included parts in the West End musicals Call Me Madam, Pal Joey and The Pajama Game. An early brief film role was as a reporter for Tit-Bits magazine, near the end of Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949). Lowe married Joan Cooper (1922–1989) on 10 January 1948. They had met in 1945 when she was his leading <b>lady</b> <b>at</b> the Manchester Repertory Theatre and they remained together until his death. Their son, Stephen Lowe, was born on 23 January 1953.|$|E

Also, later in the 90s, Majida welcomed Shirley Bassey in the presidential palace in Lebanon for a private concert, she opened in one song before giving Shirley the stage whose orchestra members stood up, astonished by Majida's spectacular soprano performance.|$|E
25|$|Femme au miroir (en. Woman with a Mirror), Femme à sa toilette or <b>Lady</b> <b>at</b> her Dressing Table, is a {{painting}} by the French artist Jean Metzinger. This distilled synthetic form of Cubism exemplifies Metzinger's continued interest, in 1916, towards less surface activity, with {{a strong emphasis on}} larger, flatter, overlapping abstract planes. The manifest primacy of the underlying geometric configuration, rooted in the abstract, controls nearly every element of the composition. The role of color remains primordial, but is now restrained within sharp delineated boundaries in comparison with several earlier works. The work of Juan Gris from the summer of 1916 to late 1918 bares much in common with that of Metzinger's late 1915, early 1916 paintings.|$|E

25|$|Baring {{bought a}} house across New College Lane from the College to serve as fellows' lodgings (at some point this house was named Clarendon House), {{which was the first}} move of the College onto the {{northern}} side of New College Lane. This was soon followed by the purchase of other houses {{on that side of the}} road, which were collectively known as Ædes, and the old Chapel of Our <b>Lady</b> <b>at</b> Smithgate (which is now the Octagon, housing the Middle Common Room). Also during this period, a gatehouse was built on the Catte Street frontage and the old doors were reinstalled there. A new dining hall was built above the gatehouse, and much of the northern side of the Old Quadrangle, apart from Old Hall, was rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|Cruvelli {{had a short}} spell in Bellini's Norma at the Royal Opera House in Berlin, {{and then}} sang from November 1848 until March 1849 at the Teatro Grande in Trieste, mainly in Verdi's Attila, Ernani and Macbeth, and in Don Pasquale. At the end of 1849 she sang Odabella in Verdi's Attila as the leading <b>lady</b> <b>at</b> the opening night of La Scala in Milan, and through the ensuing season (1850) made no fewer than sixty {{appearances}} there in Attila, Nabucco, Ernani, Il barbiere di Siviglia, Norma and Vincenzo Capecelatro's David Riccio. In the same year she appeared at the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa in Verdi's new opera Luisa Miller, and repeated her Ernani, Nabucco, Attila, and Norma. In Milan and Genoa she made a great sensation.|$|E
25|$|The {{sculptures of}} Lipchitz, Laurens and Csaky, and the {{paintings}} of Gris, Severini and Gleizes represented Cubism in its most distilled form between 1916 and 1920. However, {{by the time of}} his exhibition at the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne at the outset of 1919—just as before the war—Metzinger was considered a leader of the movement. His paintings at this exhibition were perceived as highly significant. The fact that Metzinger's <b>Lady</b> <b>at</b> her Dressing Table was chosen to be reproduced in The Sun (New York) amongst over 100 artworks in the Rosenberg sale suggests that Metzinger was perceived as a leader of the Cubist movement abroad as well. For the general public, the idea of Cubism was for many years associated more with Metzinger than Braque or Picasso, {{due to the fact that}} these artists did not exhibit in the salons, but rather in a private gallery; essentially removing themselves from the public.|$|E
