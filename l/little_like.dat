The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it was not really rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under the notion that he is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, {{ordering}} the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only looks a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> him.|$|E
25|$|One {{suggestion}} is that the unicorn {{is based on the}} extinct rhinocerus species Elasmotherium, a huge Eurasian mammal native to the steppes, south of the range of the woolly rhinoceros of Ice Age Europe. Elasmotherium looked <b>little</b> <b>like</b> a horse, but it had a large single horn in its forehead. It became extinct {{about the same time as}} the rest of the glacial age megafauna.|$|E

Marie-Josée Croze was the obvious choice for Mademoiselle Lise Lundi. Gatlif had envisioned Lundi as being like a [...] "Hitchcock character: fragile, mysterious and strong".|$|E

500|$|To be honest, {{one of the}} hesitations I had {{in taking}} on the movie {{is that it was}} a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> writing about the Beatles—that {{there are so many people}} out there who know so much about him and who revere him that I just saw a {{minefield}} of disappointment.

500|$|However, Roger Ebert {{argued the}} film was a [...] "glum, lackluster movie in which even the big effects {{sequences}} seem dutiful instead of exhilarating." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brandon Routh lacks charisma as Superman", surmising that he [...] "may have been cast because he looks a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> Reeve". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that Warner Bros. should have rebooted the series {{along the lines of}} Batman Begins. He also felt Bosworth, at 22 years old, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154-minute-long film".|$|E
500|$|Wheeler began {{studying}} for a Master of Arts degree in classical studies, which he attained in 1912. During this period, he also gained employment as the personal {{secretary of the}} UCL Provost Gregory Foster, although he later criticised Foster for transforming the university from [...] "a college in the truly academic sense [...] a hypertrophied monstrosity as <b>little</b> <b>like</b> a college as a plesiosaurus is like a man". It was also {{at this time of}} life that he met and began a relationship with Tessa Verney, a student then studying history at UCL, when they were both serving on the committee of the University College Literary Society.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{has also}} {{announced}} ongoing {{work on the}} Daddies' next album of originals. In a 2014 interview with The Huffington Post, he described his intent with the next album was to do a [...] "psychobilly/Zappa/American Idiot/R. Crumb type record that paints {{a picture of the}} American socio political scene", and has since described it as [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> Ferociously Stoned 2", featuring a primary emphasis on rock and funk. Few updates were given about the status of the album until a 2017 interview with The Register-Guard which confirmed that studio work had begun for a tentative release date {{at the end of the}} year. In said interview, Perry gave a possible album title, Big Mouth Royalty, and a description of its content as [...] "swing-ska-rockabilly-psychobilly".|$|E

[...] AllMusic compared the songs to ambient music by the Aphex Twin, while Exclaim! noted that [...] "Quique follows a similar path as Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient work but with structures that a more rock-based band like Chapterhouse dreamed of matching." [...] The members of Seefeel were fans of Aphex Twin and said after playing shows with him and Autechre that they felt [...] "more affinity with them {{than many of the}} bands we'd met – Robin Guthrie and the Cocteau Twins excepted!" ...|$|E
500|$|The theme song, [...] "Rain", {{was written}} and {{composed}} by Senri Oe, and was originally a popular Japanese song in 1988. Shinkai enjoyed listening to Oe's song regularly while attending university, and since {{one of the}} film's themes was rain, {{it was the first}} song that came to mind while he worked on the production. He particularly liked the song because its lyrics reflected daily life, much like the film. The song was remade for the film in 2013, and sung by Motohiro Hata. Shinkai met Hata on several occasions and noted a similarity between Hata's passion as an artisan and that of the character Takao. Shinkai also felt that Hata's voice was perfect because to him it carried an [...] "underlying loneliness" [...] and [...] "sounded a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> an anxious young man".|$|E
500|$|The band {{spent the}} {{remainder}} {{of the year in the}} studio, recording what would become Seventh Star. Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath. Pressured by the band's manager, Don Arden, the two compromised and released the album as [...] "Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi" [...] in January 1986. [...] "It opened up a whole can of worms really", Iommi explained, [...] "because I think if we could have done it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more." [...] Seventh Star, which sounded <b>little</b> <b>like</b> a Black Sabbath album, incorporated more hard rock elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene, and was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as Allmusic gave the album favourable reviews, calling the album [...] "often misunderstood and underrated".|$|E
60|$|The only {{pain was}} in leaving her father, who would {{certainly}} miss her, and who, {{when it came}} to the point, so <b>little</b> <b>liked</b> her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.|$|R

500|$|... "Spoken For", {{the title}} track, [...] "offers {{a look at}} Jesus {{recognizing}} His children at heaven’s gate" [...] and {{has been referred to}} as 'worshipful'. [...] Among the individual tracks on the album, [...] "The Change Inside of Me" [...] has been described as [...] "firmly on the pop side of adult contemporary music", as well as [...] "upbeat pop/rock". [...] "All The Above" [...] has also been described as 'pop'; lyrically, it describes [...] "the elation that rang through the heavens when we became children of God". [...] "Your Glory Goes On" [...] is also an upbeat pop/rock song. [...] "Crazy" [...] is described as a driving ballad [...] "which explores the merits of heaven over earth", with its opening bars sounding [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> a slower version of The Police's [...] "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic". [...] "Come One, Come All" [...] sounds like a cross between the sounds of Sonicflood and John Mellencamp.|$|E
500|$|His {{redesign}} in Mortal Kombat: Deception {{was praised}} by GameSpot for {{being one of}} the best ones from the title, and was featured in GamesRadar's list of the [...] "greatest zombie triumphs" [...] in 2009, but was also ranked as the ninth-worst Mortal Kombat character by ScrewAttack in 2011. Additionally, GamesRadar used Liu Kang {{as an example of a}} stereotype of gaming heroes who reveal an evil alter ego that ruins the character's appealing traits, and considered him to be [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> the Shaolin version of Goku, in that he's saved his world countless times and come back from the dead even more frequently." [...] GamesRadar featured him the article about [...] "kickass Bruce Lee clones" [...] citing his similarities with Bruce Lee and with one of his shouts featured in famous quotes. Liu Kang's darker characterization starting with Deception and in the reboot were received with good critical response as Den of Geek listed him as the 22nd best Mortal Kombat character due to this aspect.|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B, praising the cinematic {{quality of the}} first two segments while concluding that the third was the poorest. He was impressed by how the Kubrick references in the second segment used originality rather than being a [...] "perfunctory checklist", and how the director's [...] "ow" [...] at the end had [...] "comic aplomb". Writing for the New York Daily News, Don Kaplan gave the episode four stars out of five, singling the third segment out as the best, and deeming the Kubrick homage [...] "smart and silly". A more mixed review came from Alex Strachan on Postmedia News' Canada.com, who found the second segment to be the best and the other two to be average, although he admitted that the Kubrick references were [...] "occasionally a little too inside or self-indulgent for their own good". He concluded that [...] "there’s something in Treehouse of Horror XXV for everyone. A <b>little</b> <b>like</b> a Halloween bag of candy".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV News at Dylan's Candy Bar, Minaj revealed that she had kept the collaboration a secret from everyone she knew because she was [...] "so surprised" [...] at being asked to work with Carey and {{did not believe that}} the collaboration would actually come to fruition. [...] "That one, I didn’t believe until I was physically in the studio that I was doing with something with Mariah," [...] Minaj said. [...] "She’s an icon, I’ve loved her since I was <b>little,</b> <b>like</b> ’Vision of Love,’ ’Someday.’ I was one of those little girls in the mirror singing her songs with my mother.” A release date of February 23, 2010, for the album was slated, and then pushed back to March 9. It was then further pushed back to March 30. However, it was confirmed in March 2010 that production of Angels Advocate had halted and the project was shelved indefinitely. Island Def Jam stated that the singer was instead working on a new project and [...] "new surprises". Metro revealed that Carey was possibly recording a Christmas album.|$|E
500|$|... "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] {{was written}} by Alejandro Sanz for his album El Tren de los Momentos (2006). He also handled the song's {{production}} together with Lulo Pérez. Shakira, {{a close friend of}} Sanz, was the one who approached him in order to sing on his album, asking of him to make sure that she sounds [...] "nothing like she does on her own". [...] "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] marks the second time Sanz and Shakira collaborated after [...] "La Tortura", included on the latter's Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (2005). Sanz stated, [...] "I hadn't dared ask her if she wanted to do something with me, because it was a <b>little</b> <b>like,</b> 'I sing with you, now sing with me'. Plus, we didn't want it to be 'La Tortura 2' because we're very considerate of each other. She's the one who came and said, 'Hey, I want to sing'." [...] He concluded the interview by saying that with the collaborations, he managed to expand his artistry by experimenting with new styles.|$|E
