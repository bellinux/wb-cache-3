40|$|This study {{investigates the}} solid phase {{characteristics}} and release of heavy metals (i. e., Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Mo, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and arsenic (As) from sludge samples derived from industrial wastewater treatment plants. The emphasis is determining {{the influence of}} acidification on element mobilization based on a multidisciplinary approach that combines cascade and pHstat leaching tests with solid phase characterization through X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission gun electron probe micro analysis (FEG-EPMA), and thermodynamic modeling (Visual MinteQ 3. 0). Solid phase characterization and thermodynamic modeling results allow prediction of Ni and Zn <b>leachabilities.</b> FEG-EPMA is useful for direct solid phase characterization because it provides information on additional phases including specific element associations that cannot be detected by XRD analysis. Cascade and pHstat leaching test results indicate that disposal of improperly treated sludges at landfills may lead to extreme environmental risks due to high leachable concentrations of Zn, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Pb. However, high <b>leachabilities</b> under acid conditions of Ni and Zn as observed from pHstat leaching test results may provide a potential opportunity for acid extraction recovery of Ni and Zn from such sludges. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} is to investigate the stabilization of heavy metals in lightweight aggregate (LWA) made from sewage sludge and river sediment. The effects of the sintering temperature, the (Fe 2 O 3 +CaO+MgO) /(SiO 2 +Al 2 O 3) ratio (K ratio), SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 /CaO/MgO (at fixed K ratio), pH, and oxidative conditions on the stabilization of heavy metals were studied. Sintering at temperatures above 1100 °C effectively binds Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb in the LWA, because the stable forms of the heavy metals are strongly bound to the aluminosilicate or silicate frameworks. Minimum <b>leachabilities</b> of Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb were obtained at K ratios between 0. 175 and 0. 2. When the LWA was subjected to rigorous leaching conditions, the heavy metals remained in the solid even when the LWA bulk structure was broken.

The extracted concentrations of nickel (Ni) (II) and zinc (Zn) (II) in the carbonic acid leaching tests were reduced by 83 – 98 % over three years. The extracted Ni (II) and Zn (II) concentrations {{three years after the}} treatment were comparable to a cement-based treatment study carried out in a parallel manner on the same site. The sequential extraction results indicated that biochar addition (0. 5 – 2 %) increased the residue fractions of Ni (II) (from 51 % to 61 – 66 %) and Zn (II) (from 7 % to 27 – 35 %) in the soils through competitive sorption, which may have resulted in the reduction of <b>leachabilities</b> of Ni (II) (from 0. 35 % to 0. 12 – 0. 15 %) and Zn (II) (from 0. 12 % to 0. 01 %) in the plots with biochar compared with that without biochar three years after the treatment. The germination of grass in the plots on site failed. Further laboratory pot study suggested that larger amounts of biochar (5 % or more) and compost (5 % or more) were needed for the success of revegetation on this site.

5000|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has {{published}} a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of {{the environmental impacts of}} lead-free and tin-lead solder, as used in electronic products. [...] For bar solders, when only lead-free solders were considered, the tin/copper alternative had the lowest (best) scores. For paste solders, bismuth/tin/silver had the lowest impact scores among the lead-free alternatives in every category except non-renewable resource consumption. For both paste and bar solders, all of the lead-free solder alternatives had a lower (better) LCA score in toxicity categories than tin/lead solder. This is primarily due to the toxicity of lead, and the amount of lead that leaches from printed wiring board assemblies, as determined by the <b>leachability</b> study conducted by the partnership. The study results are providing the industry with an objective analysis of the life-cycle environmental effects of leading candidate alternative lead-free solders, allowing industry to consider environmental concerns along with the traditionally evaluated parameters of cost and performance.

40|$|Bituminous fly ash, {{which is}} an {{industrial}} waste, {{was used as an}} adsorbent to remove dyestuff from the textile-dye wastewater. The batch kinetic and isotherm experiments of the synthetic wastewater were firstly conducted to determine the adsorption behavior and optimal conditions for adsorption. The optimal conditions were then applied to the actual textile-dye wastewater. Under the original conditions of fly ash and wastewater, the results indicated that the color could be removed up to 86. 65 % by 12 g of the fly ash /L of the wastewater within 30 min. Its adsorption was described by the Freundlich isotherm. The dye-adsorbed fly ash was further studied on its pozzolanic property in terms of compressive strength by using it as a partial substitute to Portland cement type I to produce mortar. The result revealed that the highest compressive strength was of the sample containing 10 % by weight of the dye-adsorbed fly ash in replacement of cement.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} and {{mechanism of}} incorporating simulated lead-laden sludge into low-cost ceramic products was investigated by observing {{the reaction of}} lead with two kaolinite-based precursors under sintering conditions. To investigate the phase transformation process of lead, lead oxide (PbO) mixed with a kaolinite or mullite precursor were fired at 500 - 950 °C for 3 h. Detailed X-ray diffraction analysis of sintered products revealed that both precursors had crystallochemically incorporated lead into the lead feldspar (PbAl 2 Si 2 O 8) crystalline structure. By mixing lead oxide with kaolinite, lead feldspar begins to crystallize at 700 °C; maximum incorporation of lead into this structure occurred at 950 °C. However, two intermediate phases, Pb 4 Al 4 Si 3 O 16 and a polymorph of lead feldspar, were detected at temperatures between 700 and 900 °C. By sintering lead oxide with the mullite precursor, lead feldspar was detected at temperatures above 750 °C, and an intermediate phase of Pb 4 Al 4 Si 3 O 16 was observed in the temperature range of 750 - 900 °C. This study compared the lead <b>leachabilities</b> of PbO and lead feldspar using a prolonged leaching test (at pH 2. 9 for 23 d) modified from the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure.

40|$|A hydroceramic waste form is {{designed}} specifically to solidify and isolate sodium bearing waste (SBW) in storage at various U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) sites. The acidic waste produced during reprocessing of fuel rods was over-neutralized with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and stored in underground tanks at DOEs Hanford and Savannah River sites. Concentrations of NaOH in the SBW can range from 4 to 12 M. Additionally,some of the SBW is nearly pure NaOH whereas others can contain large amounts of sodium salts. A hydroceramic is a monolithic solid consisting of tectosilicates (zeolites, feldspathoids) {{that can be made}} from metakaolin and concentrated NaOH. The starting materials are mixed together forming a thick paste, precured at room temperature, and then cured at 90 °- 190 °C under saturated steam pressure for a day or so. As a rule of thumb: if the SBW has a molar NO 3 +NO 2 /Na ratio ≤ 0. 25, it can be mixed with metakaolin and solidified directly. If the ratio is greater than 0. 25 the SBW must be pretreated to reduce the ratio so that, in effect, direct solidification can be carried out. Waste can be pretreated by thermal means (calcination, steam reforming) or by chemical means using metals such as Al and Si to reduce the NOx. Procedures and properties of three hydroceramic waste forms are described: one made by direct solidification of a low NOx SBW, one made from a calcined SBW, and one made from a chemically pretreated SBW.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{evaluate}} the final forms that have been proposed for radioactive-containing solid wastes and to determine their application to the solid wastes that will result from the treatment of newly generated liquid low-level waste (NGLLLW) and Melton Valley Storage Tank (MVST) supernate at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Since cesium and strontium are the predominant radionuclides in NGLLLW and MVST supernate, this review {{is focused on the}} stabilization and solidification of solid wastes containing these radionuclides in cement, glass, and polymeric materials-the principal waste forms that have been tested with these types of wastes. Several studies have shown that both cesium and strontium are leached by distilled water from solidified cement, although the <b>leachabilities</b> of cesium are generally higher than those of strontium under similar conditions. The situation is exacerbated by the presence of sulfates in the solution, as manifested by cracking of the grout. Additives such as bentonite, blast-furnace slag, fly ash, montmorillonite, pottery clay, silica, and zeolites generally decrease the cesium and strontium release rates. Longer cement curing times (> 28 d) and high ionic strengths of the leachates, such as those that occur in seawater, also decrease the leach rates of these radionuclides. Lower cesium leach rates are observed from vitrified wastes than from grout waste forms. However, significant quantities of cesium are volatilized due to the elevated temperatures required to vitrify the waste. Hence, vitrification will generally require the use of cleanup systems for the off-gases to prevent their release into the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of normal operation, a {{particle}} accelerator can produce radionuclides in the adjacent soil and in the beam line elements through the interactions of accelerated particles and/or secondary particles produced in the beam absorbers, targets, and sometimes elsewhere through routine beam losses. The production and concentration of these radionuclides depends on the beam parameters such as energy, intensity, particle type, and target configuration. The radionuclides produced in the soil can potentially migrate to the ground water. Soil activation and migration to the ground water depends {{on the details of}} the local hydrogeology. Generally, very few places such as the beam stops, target stations, injection and extraction sectors can have high enough radiation fields to produce radionuclides in the soil outside the enclosures. During the design, construction, or an upgrade in the intensity of existing beams, measures are taken to minimize the production of activated soil. The only leachable radionuclides known to be produced in the Fermilab soil are {sup 3 }H, {sup 7 }Be, {sup 22 }Na, {sup 45 }Ca and {sup 54 }Mn and it has been determined that only {sup 3 }H, and {sup 22 }Na, because of their longer half lives and greater <b>leachabilities,</b> may significantly impact ground water resources. In the past, Fermilab has developed and used the Single Resident Well Model (SRWM) to estimate the ground water activation. Recently, the Concentration Model (CM), a more realistic method which depends on the site hydrogeology has been developed to decide the shielding requirements of the high radiation sites, and to calculate the ground water activation and its subsequent migration to the aquifer. In this report, the concentration of radionuclide released to the surface waters and the aquifer around the MI 40 beam absorber are calculated.

40|$|Incubation {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to study the leaching behavior of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) from {{municipal solid waste incineration}} (MSWI) bottom ash, as well as the effects of dissolved organic matter and pH on their leaching behavior. In order to enhance the effect of the organic matter, a mixture of MSWI bottom ash with crushed incombustibles rich in organic matter was also investigated. Two series of incubation {{experiments were}} performed under an aerobic condition for 1 year, and the temperatures were set at 37 °C and 50 °C, respectively. Leaching concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), selected heavy metals and major ions (Na, K, Ca, SO 4 and Cl) from MSWI bottom ash were investigated using Japanese Leaching Test No. 46 (JLT 46). The experiment results showed that dissolved organic matter from MSWI bottom ash was mainly composed of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and humic substances (HSs). The concentration of acetic acid was relatively steady in the early incubation stage, which contributed about 70 % of the total VFA, and was reduced suddenly when pH approached 9. Variation of HSs concentration in the leachate followed the same pattern with DOC, which at first showed an increasing tendency, subsequently decreased after reaching a maximum at the end of 24 weeks incubation period. The pH values of MSWI bottom ash decreased from its original value 12. 2 to approximately pH 7 - 8 after a 1 year incubation process. Leaching concentrations of Pb and Cu from MSWI bottom ash decreased with the incubation time, especially in the first 4 weeks of the incubation period. However, the early incubation process promoted the <b>leachabilities</b> of Cr and Zn. At the end of the incubation process, the leaching concentrations of Cr, Zn and Cu decreased below 0. 01 mg/L, while Pb still exceeded the legal limit of Japanese soil pollution. According to the analysis, leaching behavior of Cr, Cu, Zn and Pb had a strong correlation to pH value. And DOC partially contributed to the leaching of Cr and Cu.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to enhance the soil {{remediation}} of timber treatment sites; the potential application of biodegradable chelating agents and humic substances as enhancing agents was assessed in terms of the residual <b>leachability</b> of chromium, copper and arsenic (CCA). Materials and methods: This study applied four <b>leachability</b> tests on a field-contaminated soil after 48 -h washing with ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid (EDDS), glutamic-N,N-diacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and humic substances derived from lignite and two other sources. Results and discussion: It was noteworthy that the reduction in the total metal concentrations after soil washing was not predictive of the leaching behaviour. When assessed by toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and waste extraction test (WET), Cu and As <b>leachability</b> was decreased as a result of their extraction by soil washing. By contrast, when assessed by synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) and European Council Waste Acceptance Criteria (ECWAC) tests, Cu and As <b>leachability</b> was found to increase, probably because the effect of destabilization of residual metals during soil washing was more observable in unbuffered leaching solutions. On the other hand, Cr <b>leachability</b> was acceptably low in TCLP and WET but still exceeded drinking water standard in SPLP and ECWAC tests. Conclusions: The three chelating agents were able to meet the criteria for Cu in all <b>leachability</b> tests, while the limits of As concentrations could only be met by EDDS in TCLP test.

40|$|In this project, three estuarine and river-mouth areas, namely Cua Ong Estuary, Cua Luc Estuary and Cam River-mouth {{that belong}} to the Quang Ninh- Hai Phong coastal region (Vietnam) were {{investigated}} for the status as well as history and origin of the heavy metal and arsenic contamination of sediments. In addition, the speciation and mobility of heavy metals and arsenic under changing environmental conditions (Eh and pH) in vertical profiles or upon simulated on-land disposal of dredged sediments in the Cam River-mouth area (Hai Phong Province) were also investigated. The project included many different works including the collection of surficial bed-sediment and core-sediment samples, the performance of ripening experiments, porewater collection, single (ammonium-EDTA) and sequential (BCR 3 -step) extractions, and pHstat-leaching tests as well as analyses of chemical composition of major and trace elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, S, P, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn), anions (F-, Cl-, Br-, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, SO 42 - and PO 43 -, etc.), grain-size, mineralogy, organic matter content (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and 137 Cs isotope dating. In Cua Ong and Cua Luc estuaries, heavy metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) and As mainly display a natural origin (from the weathering and erosion processes of rocks). In contrast, in the Cam River-mouth, heavy metals and arsenic {{are considered to be}} minorly to moderately enriched as a result of anthropogenic activities in Hai Phong City and Northern Vietnam. Especially, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn in sediments increased rapidly by a factor of approximately 2 from 1954 to 1975 and then remained nearly unchanged from 1975 to 2008. In the Cam River-mouth, heavy metals (Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn) and As show overall decreasing trends of concentrations in porewater or sediment from top to bottom of a sediment core. Moreover, non-silicate fractions of these elements (exchangeable and carbonate-bound, Fe and Mn hydr/oxide-bound, and organic matter and sulphide-bound) also decrease from top to bottom {{as a result of their}} anthropogenic origin in surficial sediment layers and decreasing Eh and increasing pH values with depth. The pHstat-leaching tests on the original suboxic and oxidized sediments indicate that the pH-dependent leaching behavior of Cu, Mn, Pb, Zn and As reflects a V-shaped pattern in which they are strongly leached at highly-acid pH (2) or highly-alkaline pH (11), and minimum <b>leachabilities</b> are obtained in the slightly acid to slightly alkaline pH-range (6  8). Under the effect of oxidation, for Mn, Pb and Zn a transfer from the exchangeable and carbonate-bound fraction to the Fe and Mn hydr/oxide-bound fraction, and for Cu a transfer from the organic matter and sulphide-bound fraction to the Fe and Mn hydr/oxide-bound fraction occurred. In accordance with these results, Mn, Pb, Zn and As are characterized by a slower and lower release in the pH range 2  11 while for Cu, the pattern is opposite at pHs 2  8. A ripening experiment that simulates the on-land disposal of dredged sediments suggests that the porewater concentrations of heavy metals and arsenic increase immediately after exposure to the atmosphere, but then decrease to levels below their initial concentrations in the porewater. This implies a short-term risk for groundwater pollution by leaching of heavy metals and arsenic in the beginning of the on-land disposal, however, the risk will be mitigated with time when the oxidation further proceeds.

Results and discussion: In chemical-enhanced soil washing, chelating agents only minimised the Cu <b>leachability.</b> Humic substances were ineffective while inorganic acids reduced the As <b>leachability</b> {{to the detriment of}} the soil quality. For the waste-stabilised soil, the short-term leaching potential (72  h) and long-term TCLP <b>leachability</b> (9  months) revealed that Fe-/Al-/Ca-rich AMD sludge and coal fly ash sequestered As through adsorption and (co-) precipitation, while carbonaceous lignite stabilised Cu with oxygen-containing functional groups. The short-term and long-term leaching of Cu and As into the soil solution was negligible in the presence of the waste materials. However, the waste-stabilised soil did not maintain sufficient Cu stability in the TCLP tests, in which acetate buffer induced significant mineral dissolution of the waste materials. Conclusions: These results suggest that chelant-enhanced washing (significant reduction of Cu <b>leachability)</b> may be augmented with subsequent stabilisation with inorganic waste materials (effective control of As <b>leachability),</b> thus minimising the environmental risks of both Cu (heavy metal) and As (metalloid) while preserving the reuse value of the soil. Additional tests under field-relevant conditions are required to provide a holistic performance evaluation. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{preservation}} {{effectiveness of}} boron compounds against biological damagers and fire is well known. But these compounds are not {{widely used in}} preservation of wood because of their <b>leachability</b> from wood by rain water and making wood more hyroscopic than untreated wood in damp environments. Main {{aim of this study}} is; therefore, to improve the undesired <b>leachability</b> properties of some boron compounds by various water repellents (WRs). Aqueous solutions with polyethyleneglycole (PEG) - 400 of boric acid and sodium perborate were chosen as boron compounds. WRs were used as secondary treatment chemicals which were considered as dimensional stabilizer of wood and phsical bariers of boron retained at innerparts of treated wood. Results indicated that WRs were reduced <b>leachability</b> of boron from wood significantly (P< 0. 05). Boron salts applied with. PEG were more leachable than were of equeous solutions. WRs were not found effective on reducing the <b>leachability</b> of boron solved in PEG. Longer leaching time caused more leachant and reduction the phsical alleviation of WRs on boron leaching...|$|E

For the <b>leachability</b> of unstabi-lized MSWI fly ash {{it was found that}} the concentrations of Pb and Cr exceeded the leaching toxicity standard. Cemen-titious solidification of the MSWI fly ash by Na 2 SiO 3 -activated ground granulated blast-furnace slag (NS) was investigated. Results show that all solidified MSWI fly ash can meet the landfill standards after 28 days of curing. The heavy metals were immobilized within the hydration prod-ucts such as C–S–H gel and ettringite through physical encap-sulation, substitution, precipitation or adsorption mecha-nisms...|$|E

40|$|The <b>leachability</b> {{of heavy}} metals (Cu, Pb and Zn) from the {{coal fly ash}} samples was studied. The {{investigations}} executed using three <b>leachability</b> tests (USEPA, TCLP, ASTM). The effect of different parameters was determined (the diameter of ash grains, the kind of leaching solutions, pH of leaching solutions, the volume ratio of leaching solutions to the mass of ash samples, and the leaching time) on the <b>leachability</b> of the heavy metals from fly ash samples. Moreover, the influence of pH {{and changes in the}} redox potential of the leaching solutions as well as the presence of organic compounds that could potentially form complexes with metals and solubility changes of metals. The concentration of the metals studied (Cu, Pb and Zn) in all obtained solutions was determined by FAAS method. On the basis of the research investigations, optimal <b>leachability</b> conditions for Cu, Pb and Zn from fly ash in this study have been determined. We have also found that pH of the leaching solution, and the presence of organic compounds which have a potential capacity of complexion the metals are the important factors in determining the solubility of Cu, Pb and Zn...|$|E
40|$|Since {{contaminated}} river-bed sediments in Haiphong Harbor (Vietnam) {{are regularly}} dredged and disposed on land, an {{understanding about the}} influences of key parameters such as pH and oxidation on the <b>leachability</b> of As, Cu, Pb and Zn is necessary for management and treatment of these dredged wastes. A 96 h pHstat-leaching test examining the leaching behaviors of elements at pre-set pH values (2, 4, 6, 8 (natural), 9 and 11), is performed on a freshly-collected wet sediment and a 2 month-ripened dry sediment. Additionally, a BCR 3 - step extraction {{is also used to}} clarify the differences in <b>leachability</b> between 2 types of sediment. The results indicate that the pH-dependent leaching behavior reflects a concave curve with the lowest value at pHs 6 or 8 and the highest value at pH 2 in case of Cu, Pb and Zn, or at pH 11 in case of As. Generally, due to oxidation, the <b>leachability</b> of As and Zn has decreased considerably at highly-acid and highly-alkaline pHs (2 – 4 and 9 – 11) while, for Cu and Pb, it has increased at acid pHs (2 – 6), but decreased at highly-alkaline pHs (9 – 11). As shown by results of BCR 3 -step extraction, for As and Zn,there is a transfer from easily-soluble exchangeable & carbonate fraction to hardly-soluble reducible fraction through oxidation. As a consequence, the smaller exchangeable & carbonate fraction in the oxidized sediment is the cause for the lower <b>leachability</b> of As and Zn at almost all pH values. In contrast, for Cu and Pb, there is a transfer from the oxidizable fraction to the reducible fraction. Therefore, the more important reducible fraction in the oxidized sediment contributes to the higher <b>leachability</b> of Cu and Pb at acid pHs (2 – 4) while the smaller oxidizable fraction contributes to their lower <b>leachability</b> at alkaline pHs (9 – 11) if compared with the fresh sediment. status: publishe...|$|E
