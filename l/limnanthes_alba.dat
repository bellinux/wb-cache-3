40|$|June 2012 Abstract The oilseed crop <b>Limnanthes</b> <b>alba</b> (white meadowfoam) {{is grown}} in Oregon. Methods were {{developed}} {{for the production of}} a liquid-based bioherbicide from meadowfoam seed meal (MSM). It was determined that glucosinolate-containing extracts of MSM can be combined with active-enzyme-containing liquid extracts of meadowfoam seed to form a fermented product rich in bio-active glucosinolate breakdown products (GBPs). It was discovered that the relative amounts of glucosinolate breakdown products formed were dependent upon the extraction solvent for MSM, the extraction solvent for seed, and the fermentation matrix. Aqueous extraction and fermentation led to formation of products rich in the isothiocyanate (ITC) product, while addition of the organic solvent ethanol to these matrices caused a relative increase in the breakdown of glucosinolate to the nitrile product.

40|$|Of {{the three}} acyl {{coenzyme}} A acyltransferases (AT) {{directly involved in}} the assembly of fatty acids into triacylglycerols (TAG) in maturing seed, lysophosphatidate (LPA) AT has the highest substrate stringence and dictates which fatty acids can be used. We studied LPA-AT in the microsomes from various organs of palm (Syragrus cocoides) and found that only the microsomes from maturing seed could act on 1 -lauroyl-LPA and lauroyl-coenzyme A to produce dilauroyl-phosphatidate. Similarly, of the microsomes from various organs of meadowfoam (<b>Limnanthes</b> <b>alba),</b> only those from maturing seed were active with 1 -erucoyl-LPA and erucoyl-coenzyme A to generate dierucoyl-phosphatidate.

The natural habitat of meadowfoam is 35 ° to 45 ° N latitude. Meadowfoam seed oil contains long-chain fatty acids (20 - and 22 -carbon). These fatty acids are unique due to {{very high levels}} of monounsaturation and very low levels of poly-unsaturation. These characteristics make meadowfoam oil very stable, even when heated or exposed to air. Meadowfoam oil is useful in manufacture of high quality waxes, lubricants, detergents, and plasticizers.

40|$|Meadowfoam (<b>Limnanthes</b> <b>alba</b> L., Limnanthaceae) is an {{herbaceous}} winter-spring annual, {{grown as}} an oilseed crop in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, US and in New Zealand. The exceptionally high quality seed oil, consisting {{almost entirely of}} long-chain fatty acids, is used in cosmetics and lubricants. The seed meal (MSM) remaining after extraction of the oils with hexane solvent under elevated temperature is a granular by-product with little apparent commercial value, at present, except as an organic fertilizer or as an additive to livestock feed. However, MSM has some characteristics that suggest its potential utility in agriculture as a soil amendment to enhance plant growth and possibly suppress soil pests. For example, MSM contains the glucosinolate glucolimnanthin (Bartlett and Mikolajczak 1989; Vaughn et al. 1996) that, when hydrolyzed {{in the presence of}} the enzyme thioglucosidase glucohydrolase (myrosinase), can produce allelochemic compounds (aglycones), including isothiocyanates, thiocyanates, nitriles, and ionic thiocyanate (Van Etten and Tookey 1983), which have been shown to be potent biocides in soil (Bartlett and Mikolajczak 1989; Brown and Morra 1997; Deuel and Svensen 1999).

Excessive lodging and incidence of fungal infection were associated with N fertilization in some studies. This study evaluated the effects of twelve combinations of N rate and timing on meadowfoam oil yields and on plant growth and development. Meadowfoam selection 703 -A received 50, 100, and 200 kg N ha - 1 applied in fall, winter, spring, and fall/spring application schedules (regimes). Each N treatment and the control were replicated four times in randomized complete blocks on the Hyslop Research Station of Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. All N treatment means for seed and oil yield were greater than the control mean. Winter applications of N fertilizer increased the efficiency of fertilizer use, increased floral density, produced relatively early dry weight gains and flowering, and increased seed-oil content. Fall-applied fertilizer N responses were reduced by leaching losses, but it appeared that some quantity of N fertilizer should be applied in the fall and another application made in late winter (before March) for optimal seed-oil yields.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Meadowfoam (<b>Limnanthes</b> <b>alba</b> L.) is a {{herbaceous}} winter−spring annual {{grown as}} a commercial oilseed crop. The meal remaining after oil extraction from the seed contains up to 4 % of the glucosinolate glucolimnanthin. Degradation of glucolimnanthin yields toxic breakdown products, and therefore the meal may have potential {{in the management of}} soilborne pathogens. To maximize the pest-suppressive potential of meadowfoam seed meal, it would be beneficial to know the toxicity of individual glucolimnanthin degradation products against specific soilborne pathogens. Meloidogyne hapla second-stage juveniles (J 2) and Pythium irregulare and Verticillium dahliae mycelial cultures were exposed to glucolimnanthin as well as its degradation products. Glucolimnanthin and its degradation product, 2 -(3 -methoxyphenyl) acetamide, were not toxic to any of the soilborne pathogens at concentrations up to 1. 0 mg/mL. Two other degradation products, 2 -(3 -methoxymethyl) ethanethioamide and 3 -methoxyphenylacetonitrile, were toxic to M. hapla and P. irregulare but not V. dahliae. The predominant enzyme degradation product, 3 -methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate, was the most toxic compound against all of the soilborne pathogens, with M. hapla being the most sensitive with EC 50 values (0. 0025 ± 0. 0001 to 0. 0027 ± 0. 0001 mg/mL) 20 − 40 times lower than estimated EC 50 mortality values generated for P. irregulare and V. dahliae (0. 05 and 0. 1 mg/mL, respectively). The potential exists to manipulate meadowfoam seed meal to promote the production of specific degradation products. The conversion of glucolimnanthin into its corresponding isothiocyanate should optimize the biopesticidal properties of meadowfoam seed meal against M. hapla, P. irregulare, and V. dahliae...|$|E

All the enzymes could use {{either of the}} two acyl acceptors and oleoyl CoA, but only the meadowfoam enzyme could use erucoyl CoA as the acyl donor to produce dierucoyl phosphatidic acid (PA). The meadowfoam enzyme was studied further. It had an optimal activity at pH 7 to 8, and its activity was inhibited by 1 millimolar MnCl 2, ZnCl 2, or p-chloromercuribenzoate. In a test of substrate specificity using increasing concentrations of either 1 -oleoyl-LPA or 1 -erucoyl-LPA, and either oleoyl CoA or erucoyl CoA, the enzyme activity in producing PA was highest for dioleoyl-PA, followed successively by 1 -oleoyl- 2 -erucoyl-PA, dierucoyl-PA, and 1 -erucoyl- 2 -oleoyl-PA. In a test of substrate selectivity using a fixed combined concentration, but varying proportions, of 1 -oleoyl-LPA and 1 -erucoyl-LPA, and of oleoyl CoA and erucoyl CoA, the enzyme showed a pattern of acyl preference similar to that observed in the test of substrate specificity, but the preference toward oleoyl moiety in the substrates was slightly stronger. The meadowfoam microsomes could convert [14 C]glycerol- 3 -phosphate to diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols in the presence of erucoyl CoA.

40|$|Meadowfoam, an oilseed crop {{grown in}} the Willamette Valley of Oregon, was {{developed}} from <b>Limnanthes</b> <b>alba</b> (Benth.), an herbaceous winter annual native {{to the west coast}} of North America. Meadowfoam oil is valued for unique properties attributed to the predominance of very long-chain fatty acids and desaturation at the Δ 5 position. Seed meal remaining after commercial oil extraction contains intact glucosinolates and has potential pesticidal properties owing to isothiocyanate and nitrile glucosinolate derivatives. We identified and quantitated seed glucosinolates in four species of Section Inflexae of Limnanthes to assess variation for this trait in primary and secondary gene pools of cultivated meadowfoam. Glucosinolate content in seeds ranged from 30 to 204 μmol/g dry weight. Only glucolimnanthin (3 -methoxybenzyl glucosinolate) was detected in L. alba, L. montana and L. gracilis, but L. floccosa contained glucolepigramin (3 -hydroxybenzyl glucosinolate) as well as glucolimnanthin.

The objective of this experiment {{was to determine the}} effect of three day/night temperature regimes (16 / 10, 24 / 10, 32 / 100 °C), imposed for seven days during bud, early flowering or peak bloom stages on seed yield, seed number per flower, and seed weight of meadowfoam when grown under a controlled environment. In separate experiments, studies were performed to verify the effectiveness of a hand pollination technique in field-grown meadowfoam; and influences of flower location and stamen quality on seed set in hand-pollinated growth chamber-grown meadowfoam were examined. No significant differences in seed set were found among flowers at different locations on the plants, nor in flowers having normal or abnormal anthers. Supplementally hand-pollinated flowers of field-grown meadowfoam set more seed than bee-pollinated flowers on the same plants. Temperature and floral stage treatments did not result in significant seed number or seed size (1000 -seed weight) differences, but high temperature (32 °C) imposed at the bud stage did increase seed yield (total weight of all seeds produced per plant). High temperature did not increase seed yield when imposed at early flowering or peak bloom.

40|$|Abstract approved: iff Meadowfoam (<b>Limnanthes</b> <b>alba</b> Benth.) seed is a {{potential}} annually renewable source of oil for use in industrial products and processes. The plant grows well in Western Oregon but seed yields have been variable. Consistently high seed yields of meadowfoam are needed to help accelerate commercialization. Water stress variables applied during flowering and seed develop-ment had no significant effect on seed yield in 1981 (probably because of unusually high rainfall during May and June); in 1982 the yield of irrigated treatments averaged 33 % higher than the control. In both years, seeds per flower and 1000 -seed weights were higher with irrigation. In 1982 irrigation caused taller plants, more dry matter, a lower canopy light transmittance, and a higher oil yield. Meadowfoam had low tolerance to plant water deficits and required a higher plant water potential for growth and development (>- 0. 8 MPa) than reported for most field crops. The stomata of meadowfoam closed at relatively high plant water potentials (- 0. 5 to- 0. 7 MPa). Seed yields from spring fertilization of meadowfoam with ammonium sulfate (0, 50, 100 kg N ha- 1) were not increased in 1981, possibly because of plant lodging and Botrytis fungus associated with high May and June precipitation. The spring of 1982 was drier than 1981 and seed yields in N fertilized treatments in 1982 averaged 113 % higher than the control. Plant height and dry matter were higher while canopy light transmittance was lower with N application. The results of this experiment showed that plant water deficits sufficient to lower seed yields of meadowfoam in the Willamette Valley of Oregon will probably not be common, and that nitrogen fertilization can dramatically improve seed yields...|$|E

Populations of flies and larvae were monitored weekly over three consecutive crop-years beginning in 1996. Yellow sticky traps gave relative population estimates of adults. Absolute estimates of larval populations were derived using Berlese funnels to extract immatures from whole plant samples. Weather and crop phenology are key factors in population regulation. Meadowfoams, Limnanthes species, were the only observed hosts for S. apicalis in this study. This has four to five overlapping generations per year. Adults of a small founder population colonize commercial fields coincident with fall rains and seedling emergence. Females deposit eggs in or on plant tissue. Larvae mine leaves and stems. They also bore into crown tissue and flower buds later in the season. Second generation flies arising from the larvae of the founder population first appear in late winter. Successive generations peak during the rapid vegetative growth stage of meadowfoam (mid-April). A steady decline in adult and larval numbers occurs as daily temperatures rise and plants develop flower buds. Last flies are detected in early July when meadowfoam is harvested. Temperatures below 0 ° Celsius during December were a key mortality factor for S. apicalis in 1998. Three often major weather components analyzed, accounted for up to 60 percent of the trap count variability. These components were temperature, solar radiation and relative humidity. S. apicalis larvae fed only on plants within the Limnanthes in feeding studies. They accepted nine native meadowfoams but with varying survival rates.

Meadowfoam (<b>Limnanthes</b> <b>alba</b> L.) is a herbaceous winter spring annual grown as a commercial oilseed crop. The meal remaining after oil extraction from the seed contains up to 4 % of the glucosinolate glucolimnanthin. Degradation of glucolimnanthin yields toxic breakdown products, and therefore the meal may have potential in the management of soilborne pathogens. To maximize the pest-suppressive potential of meadowfoam seed meal, it would be beneficial to know the toxicity of individual glucolimnanthin degradation products against specific soilborne pathogens. Meloidogyne hapla second-stage juveniles (J 2) and Pythium irregulare and Verticillium dahliae mycelia] cultures were exposed to glucolimnanthin as well as its degradation products. Glucolimnanthin and its degradation product, 2 -(3 -methoxyphenyl) acetamide, were not toxic to any of the soilborne pathogens at concentrations up to 1. 0 mg/mL. Two other degradation products, 2 -(3 -methoxymethyl) ethanethioamide and 3 -methoxyphenylacetonitrile, were toxic to M. hapla and P. irregulare but not V. dahliae. The predominant enzyme degradation product, 3 -methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate, was the most toxic compound against all of the soilborne pathogens, with M. hapla being the most sensitive with EC(50) values (0. 0025 +/- 0. 0001 to 0. 0027 +/- 0. 0001 mg/mL) 20 - 40 times lower than estimated EC(50) mortality values generated for P. irregulare and V. dahliae (0. 05 and 0. 1 mg/mL, respectively). The potential exists to manipulate meadowfoam seed meal to promote the production of specific degradation products. The conversion of glucolimnanthin into its corresponding isothiocyanate should optimize the biopesticidal properties of meadowfoam seed meal against M. hapla, P. irregulare, and V. dahliae...|$|E
40|$|The search {{continues}} for crops of economic value to Central Oregon agriculture. Experimental plantings of an edible pod pea (Pisum sativum L. cv MHP 303 or Japanese Snow Pea), meadowfoam (<b>Limnanthes</b> <b>alba</b> Benth. cv 703 -A) and broccoli (Brassica oleracea Exp. 83 - 1002 - 2) {{were made at}} the Madras site in 1984. The primary objective for each crop was to determine adaptation for seed production. The edible pod pea produced 2, 114 pounds of seed per acre. If growers can obtain a contract this pea is a suitable candidate for production. On meadowfoam, {{a large percentage of}} the seed-bearing stems did not elongate which would preclude machine harvest with equipment available by the area farmers. Therefore, spring planted meadowfoam does not appear to be adapted for seed production at Madras. Broccoli has potential as a seed crop but additional research is needed to define conditions necessary for high yields. I. PEAS A seedbed in two small fields was prepared in the spring with a disk, harrow and roller. On April 6, 195 pounds of 16 - 20 - 0 per acre was incorporated. Treflan at 1. 5 pts/A was pre-plant soil incorporated on April 13. Field two of 2. 27 acres and the north end of Field eight,. 9 acres, were planted at 100 and 40 pounds seed per acre, respectively, on April 13. Fields were sprinkle irrigated as needed. On August 3, 14 plants were selected randomly throughout each of the two fields from which information in Table 1 was ob-tained. Both fields were swathed on August 10 and harvested with a John Deere 45 combine on August 21 with a cylinder speed of 350 rpm- the lowest setting. Excessive seed splitting amounting to 16 percent clean-out, occurred at this speed. The total clean seed from the fields was 6, 700 pounds (2, 114 lbs/A).

40|$|The {{seed oil}} of meadowfoam (<b>Limnanthes</b> <b>alba)</b> and other Limnanthes spp. is enriched in the unusual fatty acid Δ 5 -eicosenoic acid (20 : 1 Δ 5). This fatty acid has {{physical}} and chemical properties that make the seed oil of these plants useful for a number of industrial applications. An expressed sequence tag approach was used to identify cDNAs for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 20 : 1 Δ 5). By random sequencing of a library prepared from developing Limnanthes douglasii seeds, a class of cDNAs was identified that encode a homolog of acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturases found in animals, fungi, and cyanobacteria. Expression of a cDNA for the L. douglasii acyl-CoA desaturase homolog in somatic soybean (Glycine max) embryos behind a strong seed-specific promoter resulted in the accumulation of Δ 5 -hexadecenoic acid to amounts of 2 % to 3 % (w/w) of the total fatty acids of single embryos. Δ 5 -Octadecenoic acid and 20 : 1 Δ 5 also composed < 1 % (w/w) each of the total fatty acids of these embryos. In addition, cDNAs were identified from the L. douglasii expressed sequence tags that encode a homolog of fatty acid elongase 1 (FAE 1), a β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase that catalyzes the initial step of very long-chain fatty acid synthesis. Expression of the L. douglassi FAE 1 homolog in somatic soybean embryos was accompanied by the accumulation of C 20 and C 22 fatty acids, principally as eicosanoic acid, to amounts of 18 % (w/w) of the total fatty acids of single embryos. To partially reconstruct the biosynthetic pathway of 20 : 1 Δ 5 in transgenic plant tissues, cDNAs for the L. douglasii acyl-CoA desaturase and FAE 1 were co-expressed in somatic soybean embryos. In the resulting transgenic embryos, 20 : 1 Δ 5 and Δ 5 -docosenoic acid composed up to 12 % of the total fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|Allelopathy, {{the ability}} of plants to inhibit {{germination}} of other plants, is an untapped resource for weed control in crops that could revolutionize organic crop production. The main objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate allelopathic potential of various plant species on downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.), a major pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). To screen for potential allelopathy, plants were grown to flowering stage in a greenhouse, separated into shoots and roots, dried, and ground. Five percent aqueous extracts (w/v) were prepared by extracting 5 g of dried, ground plant samples with 100 mL of deionized water. Downy brome seeds were germinated on extract-amended sand. Extracts from most plant species tested inhibited downy brome and wheat seed germination. Extracts from broadleaf plants were more inhibitory than extracts from cereal plants. In most plant species, shoot extracts were more inhibitory to growth of the root and shoot of downy brome than root extracts. Meadowfoam seed meal (<b>Limnanthes</b> <b>alba</b> Hartw.), yard-long bean [Vigna sesquipedalis (L.) Fruw. ], blue spruce (Picea pungens pungens Engelm), and pine (Pinus spp.) extracts, which completely inhibited the germination of downy brome seed, have the potential for use in the control of downy brome in wheat-based cropping systems. Meadowfoam seed meal extract inhibited wheat germination by 77 % and root and shoot growth by 97 and 96 %, respectively. Radishes reduced wheat germination by 75 to 100 %, root growth by 54 to 80 % and shoot growth by 45 to 81 %. Plants evaluated in this study have the potential to be used for bio-logically based weed control methods in organic cropping systems. ALLELOPATHY, {{the ability of}} plants to inhibit germi-nation of other plants, is so far, an untapped resource for weed control in crops. Yet, it shows con-siderable promise in both conventional and organic agriculture. The U. S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) agricul-ture has traditionally focused on conventional farming systems using synthesized pesticides. In conventional agriculture, weeds can and do develop resistance to pesticides being used to control them, making pesticides less and less effective (Putwain, 1982; Alizadeh et al. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Oct. 14, 2013 - Apr. 14, 2014 Meadowfoam (<b>Limnanthes</b> <b>alba</b> Hartw. ex Benth) seed meal (MSM), a by-product of meadowfoam oil extraction, has a plant defensive compound known as glucosinolate glucolimnanthin (GLN). Myrosinase enzymes present in soil microbes and meadowfoam seeds can convert GLN to glucosinolate breakdown products (GBPs), which demonstrate herbicidal activity and {{have the potential to}} be used as bioherbicides. The goals of this research were {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} MSM on weed control and to explore the optimal timing, rate, and application method for further use of MSM as a bioherbicide. Adding active myrosinase from freshly ground meadowfoam seeds to MSM increased its phytotoxicity. In a greenhouse study, no lettuce emergence was observed for six days in soil amended with 3 % by weight activated MSM. In a field application, MSM provided a nitrogen source and promoted lettuce growth when lettuce seedlings were transplanted seven days after MSM incorporation. Co-occurrence of herbicide and fertilizer effects was observed with all MSM concentrations. MSM concentrations of 5 % and 7 % provided greater weed emergence suppression than the 3 % concentration but no difference in weed biomass was observed between MSM concentrations. A split MSM application resulted in a significant benefit for weed control, similar to a single MSM application; however for the split application, the concentration and time should be adjusted to prevent residual crop injury. Activated MSM inhibited spiny sowthistle (Sonchus asper (L.) Hill) greater than 95 % for emergence and 80 % for biomass compared to the untreated control. Soil microbes reallocated carbon input from MSM application to biomass and enzyme production. The reallocation occurred quickly, within 7 to 14 days, after MSM application. Microbial biomass increased by at least 85 % for carbon and 95 % for nitrogen with MSM application compared to the untreated control. β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity was highly correlated with microbial biomass nitrogen and was involved in the acquisition of nitrogen from organic sources. Isothiocyanate showed potent herbicidal activity and was detected only in activated MSM. 3 -Methoxyphenylacetic acid (MPAA), a previously unidentified GBP with herbicidal activity, was discovered in soil amended with non-activated and activated MSM. A single MSM application at 2. 86 kg m⁻² as a pre-emergent soil amendment benefited crop yield, weed suppression, and soil carbon and nitrogen inputs...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{effect of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) application on seed yield of <b>Limnanthes</b> <b>alba</b> was studied {{for two years}} at two locations. Seeding following alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) was compared to establishment after wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Treatments used were a control (no N applied), and two rates of N (50 and 100 kg/ha) applied at two dates (March and May). Comparisons were also made of ammonium sulfate (AS) and ammonium nitrate (AN) forms of N applied in March the second year. Seed samples were taken for analysis of protein, oil content, and fatty acid composition of oil. From the second year studies, seed weight, germination, and seedling growth determinations were made. Relationships of relevant parameters were also studied. Most all applications of N resulted in greater protein content, with 100 kg N as AS applied in March producing the greatest increase. Oil content was reduced by almost every rate of N at either date and in either form. Seed yields were affected by N application {{in the first year}} of study, but not in the second. March application of N increased seed yields whereas the May application decreased yields when L. alba followed wheat. When following alfalfa, seed yields were decreased with the high rates of N at both dates of application. Protein yield was increased by 100 kg N in March when L. alba followed wheat. After alfalfa, protein yields were decreased when high rates of N were applied. Oil yields were reduced in all three studies from N application. The fatty acid composition of seed oil was influenced by N application. C 20 monoene content was reduced from N treatments, while C 22 monoene content increased the first year but not in the second. The C 22 diene content was decreased by N application in the first year, but increased in the second. Percent of oil other than C 20 and C 22 fatty acids was affected by N application, but no obvious trends were observed in these results. Seed weight was not influenced by either N form or rate of application, but a trend towards a reduction was recorded. Seed weight was positively correlated to oil content and negatively correlated to protein content. Germination percent was increased from plots receiving the 100 kg N as AS treatment. Protein was positively and oil negatively correlated to germination percent. Seedling root and shoot growth from the seed from treated plots was increased by both rates of AN. Applications of AS either had no effect, or a negative effect (100 kg N as AS) on seedling growth. No relationships of seedling growth to oil or protein content were recorded...|$|E
