40|$|No-tillage {{planting}} in mechanically-chopped secondary-forest {{seeks to}} replace slash-and-burning agriculture. We evaluated {{the effect of}} horizontal (HC) and vertical (VC) chopping-and-mulching mechanisms on vegetation fragmentation and decomposition rate and nutrient release from chopped residue, and on cassava production in eastern Amazon. Chopped-and-mulched residue was classified into four residue-size (Fs 1 = 1 ? 7, Fs 2 = 7 ? 25, Fs 3 = 25 ? 35, and Fs 4 = > 35 mm) and six residue-type (with husk/bark ? WB, partially chopped ? PC, compact ? C, partially shredded into fibers ? PS, completely shredded into fibers ? CS, and formless residue ? F) classes. In litter-bags, residual dry matter (DM) was determined at five different days after chopping-and-mulching and residue distribution on soil surface (DAD), whereas release of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg was evaluated at four days. Residues-size and -type classes showed similar decomposition behavior, with a reduction of approximately 60 % of initial DM at 90 DAD. Nevertheless, reduction in DM was slow, where 52 days are necessary for half of <b>labile</b> <b>residue</b> to be decomposed, with part of labile and recalcitrant residue remaining on soil surface. DM and nutrients in residue reduced over time. DM was 25 % for residues-size classes for HC, 20 % for VC, and 26 % for residue-type classes, on average, at 300 DAD. Nutrients remaining in residues at 300 DAD were 26 % and 27 % of N, 26 % and 22 % of P, 29 % and 22 % of K, 16 % and 15 % of Ca, and 17 % and 23 % of Mg, respectively for HC and VC. Release of nutrients was, generally, greater for smaller residue-size classes, similar between chopping-and-mulching mechanisms, and did not affect cassava yield. 201...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{efforts have}} {{attempted}} to quantify management practices that enhance soil carbon (C) sequestration in turfgrass systems. However, the effect of turfgrass species has remained mostly unstudied, despite turfgrass species differing in their photosynthetic pathway and adaptability. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to: 1) quantify carbon dioxide (CO 2), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions for Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh], bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. ] and zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) across growing seasons; 2) evaluate the effect of three turfgrass species (Kentucky bluegrass, tall fescue, and zoysiagrass), sward age, and soil sampling depth on soil C, N, soil organic matter (SOM) and permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) concentrations from swards of varying age located throughout Indiana; and 3) quantify the effect of bermudagrass, creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.), Kentucky bluegrass, tall fescue, and zoysiagrass residue additions on microbial activity and soil aggregate stability in a microcosm study. Greenhouse gas emissions were strongly influenced by photosynthetic pathway, with the cool-season (C 3) species of Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, and tall fescue among the species with the highest CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes, while the warm-season (C 4) species of bermudagrass and zoysiagrass were among the species with the lowest CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes across the 14 sampling dates. Turfgrass species significantly affected soil total C and POXC concentrations, but {{had no effect on}} soil total N or SOM. The species with the highest total soil C was Kentucky bluegrass, followed by zoysiagrass and tall fescue. Conversely, POXC concentration was lower for Kentucky bluegrass than zoysiagrass. Surprisingly, we saw few differences between the C pools of soils under younger turf swards (0 - 10 years in age) compared to older swards (11 - 25 years in age). It was evident that as turf swards age, total soil C, total soil N, and SOM increase most near the soil surface (0 to 7. 5 cm depth) and little beyond 7. 5 cm in depth. Residues from different species affected soil microbial activity, soil aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD), total soil C and N, soil C:N ratio, and total phenolic acid content in the microcosm experiments. Although turfgrass species residue treatments initially (3 ̆e 14 d after initiation) differed in their effect on soil microbial activity, these differences were negligible after 80 d. Despite all turfgrass residues resulting in higher MWD than the non-treated control, MWD never differed among turfgrass species throughout the duration of the microcosm experiment. This research demonstrated that turfgrass species vary in their influence on soil C and N cycling. Species exerted a strong influence on GHG emissions and soil C dynamics, but residue quality analysis indicated small differences between species and few effects on soil microbial activity and soil aggregation. Therefore other factors not examined in this research such as residue biomass, <b>labile</b> <b>residue</b> quality, or microbial community dynamics may be contributing to the differences in GHG emissions and soil C between turfgrass species measured in this research. ...|$|E

Much attention {{has been focused on}} the enhancement and numerous successes have been achieved through protein engineering methods. Despite fruitful results based on random muta genesis, it was still necessary to develop a novel strategy that can reduce the time and effort involved in this process. In this study, a rapid and effective strategy is described for increasing the thermal stability of a protein. Instead of random mutagenesis, a rational strategy was adopted to theoretically stabilize the thermo <b>labile</b> <b>residues</b> of a protein using computational methods. Protein residues with high flexibility can be thermo labile due to their large range of movement. Here, residue B factor values were used to identify putatively thermo <b>labile</b> <b>residues</b> and the RosettaDesign program was applied to search for stable sequences. Coprinus cinereus (CiP) heme peroxidase was selected as a model protein for its importance in commercial applications, such as the polymerization of phenolic compounds. Eleven CiP residues with the highest B factor values were chosen as target mutation sites for thermostabilization, and then redesigned using RosettaDesign to identify sequences. Eight mutants based on the redesigns, were produced as functional enzymes and two of these (S 323 Y and E 328 D) showed increased thermal stability over the wild-type in addition to conserved catalytic activity. Thus, this strategy can he used as a rapid and effective in silico design tool for obtaining thermostable proteins. clos...|$|R

40|$|The NAD+-dependent non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (GAPN) {{from the}} hyperthermophilic archaeum Thermoproteus tenax represents an archaeal {{member of the}} diverse superfamily of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). GAPN catalyzes the irreversible oxidation of D-glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate to 3 -phosphoglycerate. In this study, we present the crystal structure of GAPN in complex with its natural inhibitor NADP+ determined by multiple anomalous diffraction methods. The structure was refined to a resolution of 2. 4 Å with an R-factor of 0. 21. The overall fold of GAPN {{is similar to the}} structures of ALDHs described previously, consisting of three domains: a nucleotide-binding domain, a catalytic domain, and an oligomerization domain. Local differences in the active site are responsible for substrate specificity. The inhibitor NADP+ binds at an equivalent site to the cosubstrate-binding site of other ALDHs and blocks the enzyme in its inactive state, possibly preventing the transition to the active conformation. Structural comparison between GAPN from the hyperthermophilic T. tenax and homologs of mesophilic organisms establishes several characteristics of thermostabilization. These include protection against heat-induced covalent modifications by reducing and stabilizing <b>labile</b> <b>residues,</b> a decrease in number and volume of empty cavities, an increase in -strand content, and a strengthening of subunit contacts by ionic and hydrophobic interactions...|$|R

The present work aims to visualize in situ the presence of sialoderivatives in the horse respiratory tract in order to localize sialoderivatives acting as influenza virus receptors. To this purpose, nasal mucosae, trachea, bronchus and lung parenchyma were removed from 8 mature horses of both sexes. We performed sialic acid characterization by means of mild and strong periodate oxidation and saponification, combined with lectin histochemistry and sialidase digestion, in addition to the direct evidentiation of sialic acid residues. No differences were shown between sexes. Sialic acid residues are present in the nasal mucous cell secretion, where they are linked to galactose by means of a 2 - 3) linkage and are mainly C 9 acetylated, and in the nasal and tracheal epithelial lining, where they are represented by periodate <b>labile</b> <b>residues</b> (a 2 - 3) - and/or (a 2 - 6) linked to galactose. Specific receptors for equine influenza viruses are present at the nasal and tracheal epithelial lining cell coat levels, and in some trachea epithelial cells, but the horse possesses a preventive defence, which consists of the secretion of a mucous layer at nasal level, which could specifically inactivate the hemagglutinins of equine influenza virus; in addition, it expresses other sialoreceptors which can mask the influenza specific ones...|$|R

The process was optimised and characterised at the bench scale (200 mL); both semiconductors exhibited a high degradation capacity at reaction times of 1 min (degradation greater than 95 %). The transient species that were observed {{indicate that the}} degradation occurs via the multiple hydroxylation and elimination of the <b>labile</b> peptide <b>residues</b> of the molecule. When photocatalysis was applied in a continuous treatment system (20 – 50 L), the photocatalytic process exhibited a high degradation efficiency, which resulted in residual microcystin-LR concentrations that were less than 1 μgL− 1 (C 0 = 5 μgL− 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The alkaliphilic bacterium, Bacillus halodurans S 7, {{produces}} an alkaline active xylanase (EC 3. 2. 1. 8), which differs from many other xylanases in being operationally stable under alkaline conditions {{as well as}} at elevated temperature. Compared to non-alkaline active xylanases, this enzyme has a high percent composition of acidic amino acids which results in high ratio of negatively to positively charged residues. A positive correlation was observed between the charge ratio and the pH optima of xylanases. The recombinant xylanase was crystallized using a hanging drop diffusion method. The crystals belong to the space group P 2 (1) 2 (1) 2 (1) and the structure was determined at a resolution of 2. 1 A. The enzyme has the common eight-fold TIM-barrel structure of family 10 xylanases; however, unlike non-alkaline active xylanases, it has a highly negatively charged surface and a deeper active site cleft. Mutational analysis of non-conserved amino acids which are close to the acid/base residue has shown that Val 169, Ile 170 and Asp 171 are important to hydrolyze xylan at high pH. Unlike the wild type xylanase which has optimum pH at 9 - 9. 5, the triple mutant xylanase (V 169 A, I 170 F and D 171 N), which was constructed using sequence information of alkaline sensitive xylanses was optimally active around pH 7. Compared to non-alkaline active xylanases, the alkaline active xylanases have highly acidic surfaces and fewer solvent exposed alkali <b>labile</b> <b>residues.</b> Based on these results obtained from sequence, structural and mutational analysis, the possible mechanisms of high pH stability and catalysis are discussed. This will provide useful information to understand the mechanism of high pH adaptation and engineering of enzymes that can be operationally stable at high pH...|$|R

A statistical experimental design approach was used to study the effects of extraction conditions pH, time and temperature on pectins extracted from Cucumis melo Inodorus. The results show that the chemical composition is very sensitive to these conditions and that this has a great influence on for example the degree of branching. Higher temperatures, lower pHs and longer extraction times lead to a loss of the more acid <b>labile</b> arabinofuranose <b>residues</b> present on the pectin side chain. The fitting of regression equations relating yield and composition to extraction conditions can therefore lead to tailor-made pectins for specific properties and/ or applications...|$|R
30|$|Physical {{fractionation}} of soil {{according to}} particle size followed by chemical, biological, and physical analyses of fractions {{is a powerful}} tool in process-oriented SOM research (Mao et al. 2007). Particle-size fractioning allows for separating SOM pools of varying degrees of microbial alteration and mineral association (Joliveta et al. 2006). The SOM in the coarse fraction primarily consisted of <b>labile</b> plant <b>residues,</b> whereas microbial biomass {{is supposed to be}} concentrated in the very fine fraction (Zech et al. 1996; Kimetu et al. 2008). Thus, SOM associated with very fine fractions tends to be more aliphatic than does whole SOM (Mao et al. 2007; Jiménez et al. 2008; Muñoz et al. 2009). We found low C/N ratio (Table  2) and high alkyl-C content (Table  5) in very fine particle-size fractions, which suggests the loss of easily decomposable carbohydrates and selective preservation of inherently recalcitrant materials during the plant residue decomposition (Mathers et al. 2000; Wagai et al. 2008; Rovira et al. 2009).|$|R

40|$|Spontaneous protein {{deamidation}} of <b>labile</b> Asn <b>residues,</b> generating L-isoaspartates and D-aspartates, {{is associated}} with cell aging and is enhanced by an oxidative microenvironment; to minimize the damage, the isoaspartate residues can be 'repaired' by a specific L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) protein O-methyltransferase (PIMT). As both premature aging and chronic oxidative stress are typical features of Down's syndrome (DS), we tested the hypothesis that deamidated proteins may build up in trisomic patients. Blood samples were obtained from children with karyotypically confirmed full trisomy 21 and from age-matched healthy controls. Using recombinant PIMT as a probe, we demonstrated a dramatic rise of L-isoaspartates in erythrocyte membrane proteins from DS patients. The content of D-aspartate was also significantly increased. The integrity of the repair system was checked by evaluating methionine transport, PIMT specific activity, and intracellular concentrations of adenosylmethionine and adenosylhomocysteine. The overall methylation pathway was directly monitored by incubating fresh red blood cells with methyl-labeled methionine; a three-fold increase of protein methyl esters was detected in trisomic children. Deamidated species include ankyrin, band 4. 1, band 4. 2 and the integral membrane protein band 3; ankyrin and band 4. 1 were significantly hypermethylated in DS. When DS red blood cells were subjected to oxidative treatment in vitro, the increase of protein deamidation paralleled lipid peroxidation and free radical generation. We observed a similar pattern in Epstein-Barr virus B-lymphocytes from trisomic patients. In conclusion, our findings {{support the hypothesis that}} protein instability at asparagine sites is a biochemical feature of DS, presumably depending upon the oxidative microenvironment. The possible pathophysiological implications are discussed...|$|R

In these systems, mineral N is retained in the standing plant biomass, and /or immobilized in the soil organic matter. Leucaena leucocephala spp. glabrata is a leguminous shrub which is incorporated into grazing systems to provide a high protein fodder for beef cattle production. Leucaena can also enhance the soil N status through biological N fixation and easily mineralisation of <b>labile</b> leucaena <b>residues.</b> However, there is limited information on the soil N dynamics of leucaena-grass system especially in the subsoil layers of the soil profile, including the primary N source for leucaena, {{and the effect of}} leucaena residue on accompanying green panic (Panicum maximum var. trichoglume). We quantified the effect of pasture-type, soil-type and leucaena stand age on soil N stocks and δN values at different depths. A chronosequence of leucaena stands (0 – 40 years) and paired grass sites were sampled to 1. 0 m depth. Using the δN natural abundance technique, it was estimated that 73 % of leucaena N originated from atmospheric N-fixation. Total soil N stocks were 45 % higher beneath leucaena rows compared to the paired grass sites at 0 – 0. 1 m depth. In addition, total soil N stocks increased by 32 % in the surface at 0 – 0. 3 m depth, attaining a maximum in the 40 -year old stand. The N dynamics beneath the leucaena rows and mid-rows suggest a tight cycling of available N within the system. This study further highlights the importance of incorporating legumes into grazing systems to increase plant available N and mitigate pasture rundown...|$|R
40|$|Proliferating cells {{derived from}} {{hominoid}} species contain electrophoretically separable forms of triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), including a constitutive isozyme and {{major and minor}} cell proliferation specific isozymes. Genetic {{studies have shown that}} the constitutive and inducible isozymes are products of the same structural gene. A procedure has been developed for the rapid isolation of the constitutive and major proliferation specific TPI isozymes from human lymphoblastoid B cells. [35 S]methionine labeled isozymes were purified through several steps of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sufficient quantities for turnover studies and preliminary structural analysis. The intact isozymes were subjected to 23 steps of automated Edman degradation; both preparations yield a [35 S] PTH-methionine only at cycle 14, as expected if the protein is TPI. Neither isozyme contains an blocked NH 2 -terminus and length heterogenity at the amino terminal does not exist. A comparison of the two purified isozymes on 2 -D PAGE confirms that the constitutive isozyme consists of only type 1 subunits while the major proliferation specific isozyme is composed of a type 1 subunit and a unique type 2 subunit. The type 1 and type 2 subunits differ by at least four charge units under native, nondenaturing conditions of electrophoresis but do not differ in molecular mass. The difference between the type 1 and type 2 subunits is covalent, as the difference in isoelectric point between the two subunits is stable to both 2 % SDS and 8 M urea. The expression of TPI- 2 does not correlate with the existence of the <b>labile</b> asparagine <b>residues.</b> Turnover studies indicate that the level of each subunit is regulated by differences in rates of synthesis rather than degradation but a precursor-product relationship between the subunits was not observed.

CTH was more effective than an equivalent concentration of beta-Lg in retarding lipid oxidation reactions when dispersed in the continuous phase of Brij-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions (pH 7). Furthermore, it was observed that CTH had higher peroxyl radical scavenging and iron-binding values than beta-Lg. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to measure the rate of oxidation of three oxidatively <b>labile</b> amino acid <b>residues</b> (Tyr, Met, and Phe) in certain CTH peptide fragments. Significant oxidation of specific Tyr and Met residues present in two separate 12 amino acid peptide fragments was observed in the days preceding lipid oxidation (39 and 55 % of Tyr and Met were oxidized, respectively, by day 4 of the study); however, no significant oxidation of the Phe residue present in a specific 14 amino acid peptide fragment could be observed during the same time period. These data could suggest that Met and Tyr residues are capable of scavenging radical species and have the potential to improve the oxidative stability dispersed food lipids...|$|R
40|$|Though {{not as well}} {{studied as}} phosphopeptides, sulfopeptides are {{important}} for many biological processes, including proper endocrine function and extracellular signaling. The discovery of sulfopeptides {{dates back to the}} 1920 s; however, their enrichment and characterization have only recently become of broader interest. With a limited toolbox for analyzing sulfopeptides, we employ several chemistries to develop robust enrichment and characterization methods. At the heart of each method lies Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, a gas-phase detection method with the power to differentiate even the slightest mass differences, such as phosphate vs. sulfonate. First, Lewis acid-base characteristics inherent to transition metal oxides are examined for the selective interaction and enrichment of sulfopeptides in the presence of mixtures of competing poly-oxyanions. Careful control of the binding and elution pH with an optimized amount of sulfopeptide loaded onto the metal oxide surface can enhance enrichment selectivity of sulfopeptides up to 97 % relative abundance compared to as low as 4 % prior to enrichment. Second, the utility of gas-phase activation methods for structural characterization of sulfopeptides is investigated. The sulfonate post-translational modification (PTM) is extremely labile at low pH, high temperature, and during gaseous collisional activation. This fragility has challenged researchers to discover new techniques for analysis of intact sulfonated biomolecules. As recently as 2011, authors have accepted that the sulfonate modification is lost during mass spectrometric analysis. We have found that a combination of different activation techniques can elucidate sulfopeptide sequence while keeping the <b>labile</b> sulfonate <b>residue</b> intact, allowing for unambiguous localization of this PTM. In particular, negative ion electron capture dissociation was found to yield > 50 % fragmentation efficiency with complete sulfonate retention. Finally, ideas are explored for improving fragmentation efficiency in electron detachment dissociation, which commonly leads to extensive neutral loss from carboxylic acids, precluding efficient backbone fragmentation and subsequent structural elucidation. To block carbon dioxide loss, chemical derivatization and anion adduction were employed. We found that chloride adduction to acidic peptides improves the fragmentation efficiency and provides nearly complete sequence coverage for several peptides. In addition, N-acetylation was shown to alter observed fragmentation pathways, presumably through changes in peptide gas-phase structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{depolymerization}} of polysaccharides, {{particularly those}} containing acid-sensitive components, into intact constituent repeating units {{can be very}} difficult. We describe a method using ozonolysis for depolymerizing polysaccharides containing β-d-aldosidic linkages into short-chain polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. This method is carried out on polysaccharides that have been fully acetylated whereby β-d-aldosidic linkages are selectively oxidized by ozone to form esters, from which the polysaccharides are subsequently cleaved with a nucleophile. Ozone oxidation of aldosidic linkages proceeds under strong stereoelectronic control, and reaction rates depend on the conformations of glycosidic linkages. Thus, β-d-aldosidic linkages with different conformations can have very different reaction rates {{even in the absence}} of substantial chemical differences. These rate differences allowed for very high selectivity in cleaving β-d-linkages of polysaccharides. Several polysaccharides from group B Streptococcus and other bacterial species were selectively depolymerized with this method. The repeating units of the group B Streptococcus polysaccharides all contain an acid-sensitive sialic acid residue in a terminal position on a side chain and several β-d-residues including galactose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine; however, with each polysaccharide, one type of linkage was more reactive than others. Selective cleavage of the most sensitive linkage occurs randomly throughout the polymer chain, yielding fragments of controllable and narrowly distributed sizes and the same repeating-unit structure. The average size of the molecules decreases exponentially, and desired sizes can be obtained by stopping the reaction at appropriate time points. With this method the <b>labile</b> sialic acid <b>residue</b> was not affected...|$|R

In this study we compared the addition of corn stalks to soil, with equivalent additions of charred (300 °C and 500 °C) corn residues. Two experiments were conducted: a long term laboratory mineralization, and a growth chamber trial with proso millet plants. In the laboratory, we measured soil mineral N dynamics, C use efficiency, and soil organic matter (SOM) chemical changes via infrared spectroscopy. The 300 °C biochar decreased plant biomass relative to a nothing added control. The 500 °C biochar had little to no effect on plant biomass. With incubation we measured lower soil NO 3 content in the corn stalk treatment than in the biochar-amended soils, suggesting that the millet growth reduction in the stalk treatment was mainly driven by N limitation, whereas other factors contributed to the biomass yield reductions in the biochar treatments. Corn stalks had a C sequestration use efficiency of up to 0. 26, but charring enhanced C sequestration to values that ranged from 0. 64 to 1. 0. Infrared spectroscopy of the soils as they mineralized showed that absorbance at 3400, 2925 - 2850, 1737 cm- 1, and 1656 cm- 1 decreased during the incubation and can be regarded as <b>labile</b> SOM, corn <b>residue,</b> or biochar bands. Absorbances near 1600, 1500 - 1420, and 1345 cm- 1 represented the more refractory SOM moieties. Our results show that adding crop residue biochar to soil is a sound C sequestration technology compared to letting the crop residues decompose in the field.
