5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be raised over fresh plots to liberate Edward, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as breaking into the prison within the castle. As {{a result of these}} threats, Edward was moved around to other locations in secret for a period, before returning to permanent custody at the castle in the late summer of 1327. The political situation remained unstable, and new plots appear to have been formed to free him.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, other {{similarly}} green-capped species {{collected by}} mushroom hunters include various green-hued brittlegills {{of the genus}} Russula and the formerly popular Tricholoma equestre, now regarded as hazardous owing {{to a series of}} restaurant poisonings in France. Brittlegills, such as Russula heterophylla, R.aeruginea, and R.virescens, can be distinguished by their brittle flesh and the lack of both volva and ring. Other similar species include A.subjunquillea in eastern Asia and A.arocheae, which ranges from Andean Colombia north at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as central Mexico, both of which are also poisonous.|$|E

5|$|Soybean {{cultivation}}: The {{cultivation of}} soybeans {{began in the}} eastern half of northern China by 2000 BC, but is almost certainly much older. Liu et al. (1997) stated that soybean originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BC. By the 5th century, soybeans were being cultivated in much of eastern Asia, but the crop did not move beyond this region until well into the 20th century. Written records of the cultivation and use of the soybean in China date back at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as the Western Zhou Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The name Shepton {{derives from}} the Old English scoep and tun, meaning 'sheep farm'; the Domesday Book of 1086 records a {{settlement}} known as Sceaptun. The current spelling is recorded at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> back as 1496, in a letter from Henry VII. The {{second part of the}} name derives from that of the Norman Malet family who took a lease from Glastonbury Abbey around 1100. The second 'L' appears to have been added in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Aldermaston {{may have}} been {{inhabited}} as early as 1690 BCE; a number of postholes and remains of cereal grains {{have been found in}} the area. Written history of the village is traced back at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as the 9th century CE. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles show that the Ealdorman of Berkshire had his country estate in the village. The manor of Aldermaston was established by the early 11th century, when the village was given to the Achard family by Henry I; the manor is documented in the Domesday survey. The village church was established in the 13th century, and some of the original Norman architecture remains in the building's structure.|$|E

5|$|Although Carabane {{was once}} a {{regional}} capital, the village has since become so politically isolated {{from the rest of}} the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E
5|$|At <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> {{back as the}} mid-1600s, the Sihanaka were {{established}} as a technologically sophisticated and prosperous people who provided slaves to slave traders supplying the plantations of the Mascarene Islands. To protect themselves and their wealth, Sihanaka villages were often fortified by earthen walls (tamboho) of the type also prevalent in the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina. Around 1700, the Sihanaka were a major trading partner of the Betsimisaraka, to whom they traded rice and zebu. The Betsimisaraka, desirous of greater access to Sihanaka wealth, successfully negotiated for French assistance to bring the Sihanaka under their control. French militiamen launched several attacks against Sihanaka communities. This incursion was foiled {{through a combination of}} firepower - the Sihanaka having obtained numerous firearms through trade with the Sakalava to the west - and the prevalence of malaria and other tropical diseases that decimated the French soldiers.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} downstream to the downstream-most {{crossing of}} the Scranton/Moosic line, the drainage basin of Stafford Meadow Brook is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. From that point downstream to its mouth, the stream is classified as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. A large section of the stream from its headwaters to the lower Pennsylvania Route 307 bridge meets the criteria for an Exceptional Value designation. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> upstream as river mile 6.82 and as far downstream as its mouth. The stream was stocked with 500 adult and fingerling rainbow trout in 1894–1895. In 1984, the Pennsylvania Fish Commission speculated that there were native brook trout in part of the stream.|$|E

5|$|Gaveston's lieutenancy was {{primarily}} {{of a military}} nature; by the early 14th century, Ireland had become a rebellious and unruly dominion for the English crown. In this capacity Gaveston had considerable success, killing or defeating several major insurgents. He fortified the town of Newcastle McKynegan and Castle Kevin, and rebuilt the road from Castle Kevin to Glendalough. This helped pacify the county at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as the Wicklow Mountains, west of Dublin. In the field of administration he made less of a mark. The most notable issue with which he was involved concerned a dispute over murage – a toll on the town walls – between the citizens of Dublin. As during the regency, though, {{there is no evidence}} that Gaveston exploited his position for his own advantage and he did nothing to alienate the local elite.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers began finding {{other objects}} at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> away as Pluto, {{now known as}} Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs. Many of these shared some of Pluto's key orbital {{characteristics}} and are now called plutinos. Pluto {{came to be seen}} as the largest member of a new class of objects, and some astronomers stopped referring to Pluto as a planet. Pluto's eccentric and inclined orbit, while very unusual for a planet in the Solar System, fits in well with the other KBOs. New York City's newly renovated Hayden Planetarium did not include Pluto in its exhibit of the planets when it reopened as the Rose Center for Earth and Space in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Pallittorre's {{numbers have}} been {{estimated}} from as low as 50–60 to as high as 600. They maintained cleared grassy plains by regular careful burning, and used this method also to control undergrowth in the forests. This land management technique enabled easier hunting and food gathering. European colonists noted, after the Pallittorre had been eliminated from the area, how the forests rapidly reclaimed the formerly cleared land. They ranged across the land on a seasonal basis, at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Mole Creek, and lived in villages of bark huts at times. They mined ochre in the Gog Range, trading this with other aborigines, across Tasmania. The Pallitorre congregated in areas in the Meander area, such as Jackeys Marsh - the name 'jackey' being a colloquial term for aboriginal people.|$|E
50|$|Penair House in {{the parish}} of St Clement, Cornwall was built by Rear-Admiral Robert Carthew Reynolds (d. 1811) and was the {{residence}} of his son Barrington Reynolds. This house replaced an older one at <b>least</b> going back <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> the 17th century.|$|R

50|$|Located in {{the grounds}} of the House, is a large mound or hill, once the moat, of Chesterfield Castle or Tapton Castle as it was {{sometimes}} also known. The castle at <b>least</b> dates <b>as</b> <b>far</b> back <b>as</b> the Norman Conquest and later fell {{into the hands of the}} Crown, becoming a Crown Fortress. During the English Civil War, the castle was raised to the ground, by Parliamentarian forces.|$|R
5|$|The lack of old native {{names for}} {{it has been}} used to {{demonstrate}} its absence in Britain before introduction in around 1487, but this is challenged by the presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree, fior chrann which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> back as the Gaelic settlement at Dál Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries. This would make it either an archaeophyte (a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500) or perhaps native if it can be seen to have reached Scotland without human intervention. At the moment it is usually classified as a neophyte, a plant that is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500. Today, the sycamore is present in 3,461 (89.7%) of hectads in Britain, more than any native tree species.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} the Hyksos, Ahmose began campaigning in Syria and Nubia. A campaign during his 22nd year reached Djahy in the Levant and perhaps {{as far as}} the Euphrates, although the later Pharaoh Thutmose I is usually credited with being the first to campaign that far. Ahmose did, however, reach at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Kedem (thought to be near Byblos), according to an ostracon in the tomb of his wife, Ahmose-Nefertari. Details on this particular campaign are scarce, as the source of most of the information, Ahmose, son of Ebana, served in the Egyptian navy and did not take part in this land expedition. However, it can be inferred from archaeological surveys of southern Canaan that during the late 16th century BC Ahmose and his immediate successors intended only to break the power of the Hyksos by destroying their cities and not to conquer Canaan. Many sites there were completely laid waste and not rebuilt during this period—something a Pharaoh bent on conquest and tribute would not be likely to do.|$|E
5|$|By 1946, MD150 {{had been}} {{extended}} west {{into the city}} of Baltimore over Eastern Avenue at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Highlandtown. Around 1950, the state highway followed Highland Avenue south from US40 to Eastern Avenue. MD150 was moved to Kresson Street, Lombard Street, and Ponca Street, which met Eastern Avenue just west of its present junction, in 1960. Around 1963, Haven Street and Kresson Street were converted to a one-way pair, with Haven Street carrying eastbound traffic south and Kresson Street handling westbound traffic toward US40. The portion of Lombard Street between Haven and Kresson was added to MD150; the state highway was also extended north on Haven and Kresson to Monument Street, then east along Monument Street to MD150's new western terminus at US40 at the U.S. Highway's underpass of CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. This convoluted path was ameliorated around 2002 when the highway was shortened to its present course in East Baltimore.|$|E
60|$|It {{was three}} weeks after they had left Kirensk before they struck the Angara, near Karanchinskoe. They had traversed a distance, as the crow flies, of some eight hundred miles since leaving Kara, but by the route they had {{travelled}} it was at <b>least</b> half <b>as</b> <b>far</b> again, {{and they had been}} little over ten weeks on the journey. Luka had assured Godfrey that they would have no difficulty in obtaining a boat.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to rule out many explanations of the observed divergences in the masses of the world's prototypes proposed by scientists and the general public. The BIPM's FAQ explains, for example, that the divergence {{is dependent on the}} amount of time elapsed between measurements and not dependent on the number of times the artifacts have been cleaned or possible changes in gravity or environment. Reports published in 2013 by Peter Cumpson of Newcastle University based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of samples that were stored alongside various prototype kilograms suggested that one source of the divergence between the various prototypes could be traced to mercury that had been absorbed by the prototypes being in the proximity of mercury-based instruments. The IPK has been stored within centimetres of a mercury thermometer since at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> back as the late 1980s. In this Newcastle University work six platinum weights made in the nineteenth century were all found to have mercury at the surface, the most contaminated of which had the equivalent of 250µg of mercury when scaled to the surface area of a kilogram prototype.|$|E
5|$|The {{site had}} a long and {{continuous}} settlement history, with the period of principal occupation stretching from the Middle Preclassic down to the Postclassic. The earliest known occupation at Takalik Abaj dates {{towards the end of}} the Early Preclassic, ca. 1000 BC. However, it was not until the Middle to Late Preclassic that its first real florescence began with a noted surge in architectural constructions. From this period onwards a continuity of culture and population settlement is in evidence, as represented by the persistence of a local ceramic style (called Ocosito) that remained in use until the Late Classic. The Ocosito style was typically made with red paste and pumice and extended westwards at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Coatepeque, southwards to the Ocosito River and eastwards to the Samalá River. By the Terminal Classic, pottery associated with a highland K'iche' ceramic style had begun to appear intermixed with Ocosito ceramic complex deposits. Ocosito ceramics were replaced entirely by the K'iche' ceramic tradition by the Early Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Cowell's student Lou Harrison {{utilized}} keyboard clusters {{in several}} {{works such as}} his Prelude for Grandpiano (1937). At <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> back as 1942, John Cage, who also studied under Cowell, began writing piano pieces with cluster chords; In the Name of the Holocaust, from December of that year, includes chromatic, diatonic, and pentatonic clusters. Olivier Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'enfant Jésus (1944), often described {{as the most important}} solo piano piece {{of the first half of}} the twentieth century, employs clusters throughout. They would feature in numerous subsequent piano works, by a range of composers. Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierstück X (1961) makes bold, rhetorical use of chromatic clusters, scaled in seven degrees of width, from three to thirty-six semitones, as well as ascending and descending cluster arpeggios and cluster glissandi. Written two decades later, his Klavierstück XIII employs many of the same techniques, along with clusters that call for the pianist to sit down on the keyboard. George Crumb's Apparitions, Elegiac Songs, and Vocalises for Soprano and Amplified Piano (1979), a setting of verse by Walt Whitman, is filled with clusters, including an enormous one that introduces three of its sections. The piano part of the second movement of Joseph Schwantner's song cycle Magabunda (1983) has perhaps the single largest chord ever written for an individual instrument: all 88 notes on the keyboard.|$|E
