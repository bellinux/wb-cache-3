But I was carried off to prison, where your husband was so kind to me—urging all his friends to obtain my release, and using all his credit in my favour—that I relented towards him, {{especially}} as my director counselled me to be silent; and that it was {{for the good of the}} king’s service that the title of our family should continue with your husband the late viscount, whereby his fidelity would be always secured to the king. And a proof of this is, that a year before your husband’s death, when he thought of taking a place under the Prince of Orange, Mr. Holt went to him, and told him what the state of the matter was, and obliged him to raise a large sum for his Majesty: and engaged him in the true cause so heartily, that we were sure of his support on any day when it should be considered advisable to attack the usurper. Then his sudden death came; and there was a thought of declaring the truth. But ’twas determined to be best for the king’s service to let the title still go with the younger branch; and there’s no sacrifice a Castlewood wouldn’t make for that cause, my dear.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} cogent {{arguments}} used in favour of an inherited constitutional factor in the causation of idiopathic epilepsy is the finding that, if one {{of a pair of}} identical twins has fits, it is usual for the other to have frank epilepsy or at least an abnormal electroencephalogram (Lennox, 1947; <b>Little</b> and <b>Weaver,</b> 1950). Cerebral disease or injury, includ-ing birth trauma, may lead to epilepsy either by damaging a hitherto normal brain or, perhaps by a less severe lesion, by reducing the convulsive threshold in a predisposed individual. According to Nielsen and Courville (1951) the latter situation is much the commoner, and in Lennox's series of identical twin pairs in which one twin suffered from epilepsy following brain injury no less than half th...|$|R

Pippa Passes, aside from its rare poetical qualities, {{is a study}} of {{unconscious}} influence. The idea of the poem was suggested to Browning while listening to a gypsy girl singing in the woods near his home; but he transfers {{the scene of the}} action to the little mountain town of Asolo, in Italy. Pippa is a <b>little</b> silk <b>weaver,</b> who goes out in the morning to enjoy her one holiday of the whole year. As she thinks of her own happiness she is vaguely wishing that she might share it, and do some good. Then, with her childish imagination, she begins to weave a little romance in which she shares in the happiness of the four greatest and happiest people in Asolo. It never occurs to her that perhaps there is more of misery than of happiness in the four great ones of whom she dreams; and so she goes on her way singing, ...|$|R
500|$|A {{convention}} of the Prohibition Party also met that month in Cleveland, Ohio. The Prohibitionists, more of a movement than a party, focused their efforts on banning alcohol. Most party members came from pietist churches, and most were former Republicans. Only twelve states sent delegates to the convention, and the platform they agreed on was silent on most issues of the day, focusing instead on the evils of alcohol. For president, the Prohibitionists nominated Neal Dow, a Civil War general from Maine. As mayor of Portland, Dow helped to pass the [...] "Maine law", which banned the sale of alcohol in the city; it became the model for temperance laws around the country. Finally, a revived Anti-Masonic Party nominated John W. Phelps, another Civil War general, {{on a platform of}} opposition to Freemasonry. Political prognosticators gave <b>Weaver</b> <b>little</b> chance of victory, and Dow and Phelps none at all.|$|R
40|$|Urbanisation {{often has}} {{profound}} impacts on ecological processes. Management of these impacts {{is central to}} urban conservation efforts. We used data from 6591 individually ringed weaver birds from 42 ringing locations to investigate the influence that the urban matrix, as well as patch isolation, size and quality, had on weaver bird movement between ringing locations in Cape Town, a growing city within a global biodiversity hotspot. Distance-based linear models revealed that proximity to other sites was the dominant predictor of weaver movement while the site variables (wetland size and bird abundance) had a limited and inconclusive influence. Once the variation explained by the proximity and site variables had been accounted for, {{the composition of the}} surrounding urban matrix, the length of the least cost path between wetlands, and the presence of rivers as potential movement corridors (measured at three spatial scales) all had <b>little</b> influence on <b>weaver</b> movement. Analysis of the weaver bird movement-wetland network using social network analysis showed that the network is simple, clustered, and non-random, with relatively high vulnerability to node loss and some indication of preferential attachment (i. e., increased use of more used sites). Since proximity (site isolation) is the dominant influence on weaver movements, and the network is already sparse, further wetland loss is likely to reduce population viability. Our results match the predictions of classical theory and suggest that patch management will matter more for wetland passerines than matrix management...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Urbanization, a {{fast growing}} and {{destructive}} human land use, causes local extinctions, biotic homogenization and fragmentation of natural habitats. Understanding how {{the nature of}} the urban matrix affects the species residing within a city’s fragmented habitats is an important founding component of urban conservation. This study investigated the influence that the urban matrix, as well as patch isolation, size and quality, had on weaver bird movement into and out of wetland sites in Cape Town, a growing city within a global biodiversity hotspot. Weaver bird movement data from 42 wetland sites were obtained through a long term mark - release - recapture project. Distance - based linear models revealed that site proximity was important as a predictor of weaver movement into and out of sites, while the site variables (wetland size, bird abundance and weaver colony size) had limited and inconclusive influence. Once the variation explained by the proximity and site variables had been accounted for, the composition of the urban matrix and the presence of rivers as potential movement corridors (measured at three spatial scales) had <b>little</b> influence on <b>weaver</b> movement. The finding that proximity (or site isolation) influences weaver movement has important implications for maintaining current landscape connectivity. Habitat isolation, resulting from further habitat removal or destruction, could be expected to reduce movements of weavers, and potentially other species, among patches of favourable habitat. Weavers are robust, vagile birds that do well in the presence of humans and may not be highly sensitive to {{the nature of the}} urban matrix. Research into how other, less resilient and vagile species respond to the degree of urbanization in the matrix between wetlands would contribute further to our knowledge of urban biodiversity in this global biodiversity hotspot...|$|R
40|$|Although {{national}} {{losses are}} unknown, bird damage is a chronic problem for many Filipino rice farmers and {{is sometimes a}} severe problem within localized areas. Three species of Philippine weavers (Lonchura malacca, L. leucogaster, and L. punctulata) are common pests; and other birds such as sparrows, parrots, and even ducks contribute to crop losses. Post seedling damage by Philippine weavers, {{the focus of this}} study, usually occurs from the milky to the early maturing stages of rice growth. At this time, the birds arrive in flocks, alight within the fields, and squeeze 2 ̆ 2 milk 2 ̆ 2 from the developing seeds or hull the doughy grains directly from panicles (Benigno et al., 1975). Although some studies (Manuel, 1930, 1934; Alviola et al. 1973; Benigno et al., 1975) have been conducted on the biology, feeding habits, and damage of Philippine <b>weavers,</b> <b>little</b> attention has been given to methods for reducing crop losses. Farmers in most countries employ combinations of favorite devices and methods in attempts to frighten birds from their fields and to reduce crop losses. In the Philippines, such combinations usually include; (1) 2 ̆ 2 bird boys 2 ̆ 2 who make noises to frighten the birds; (2) networks of strings, tin cans, and stones that are stretched over the fields and that rattle with the wind or when a cord is pulled; (3) 2 ̆ 2 scarecrows 2 ̆ 2; (4) white flags flown several meters above the fields; and (5) wooden or bamboo, wind-driven propellers. In countries where farming practices are more mechanized, such devices are supplemented or replaced by firecrackers, exploders, or other noisemaking devices; nets to protect crops of high value; and chemical repellents. Two repellents, methiocarb (which causes conditioned food aversion; Rogers, 1974) and 4 -aminopyridine (a frightening agent; De Grazio et al., 1972), have received limited study in the Philippines but appear too costly for practical use in maturing rice at this time. In the present study, we considered the possibility of using perches coated with glue to frighten birds from a farmer 2 ̆ 7 s field. This method would take advantage of the Philippine weaver 2 ̆ 7 s habit of alighting on tall weeds (e. g., Echinocloa sp.) or other vegetation within the field to feed on rice. If a few of the birds adhered to the perches, we hypothesized that the 2 ̆ 2 glued 2 ̆ 2 birds would emit distress calls and that the remaining birds would learn to avoid the treated fields. Such a treatment would be somewhat analogous to the repellent effect of 4 -aminopyridine but could be contrived by Filipino farmers using inexpensive, local materials...|$|R
