5|$|In {{physics and}} fluid mechanics, a Blasius {{boundary}} layer (named after Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius) describes the steady two-dimensional <b>laminar</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> that forms on a semi-infinite plate which is held parallel to a constant unidirectional flow. Falkner and Skan later generalized Blasius' solution to wedge flow (Falkner–Skan boundary layer), i.e. flows {{in which the}} plate is not parallel to the flow.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the <b>laminar</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> equations, the {{presence}} of two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. {{the inner and outer}} scaling) has made finding a universal similarity solution for the turbulent boundary layer difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans both regions of the flow, it is necessary to asymptotically match the solutions from both regions of the flow. Such analysis will yield either the so-called log-law or power-law.|$|E
5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the <b>laminar</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a <b>laminar</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E

5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a <b>laminar</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer.</b> This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E

2500|$|In {{boundary}} layer flow over a flat plate, experiments confirm that, {{after a certain}} length of flow, a <b>laminar</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> will become unstable and turbulent.

50|$|Turbulent {{boundary}} layers {{tend to be}} able {{to sustain}} an adverse pressure gradient better than an equivalent <b>laminar</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer.</b> The more efficient mixing which occurs in a turbulent boundary layer transports kinetic energy {{from the edge of the}} boundary layer to the low momentum flow at the solid surface, often preventing the separation which would occur for a <b>laminar</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> under the same conditions. This physical fact has led to a variety of schemes to actually produce turbulent boundary layers when boundary layer separation is dominant at high Reynolds numbers.

Aeroplane wings are often engineered with vortex generators on the upper surface to produce a turbulent boundary layer.|$|E
