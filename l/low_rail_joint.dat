3000|$|Enormous {{work has}} been done to explore the {{influence}} of magnetic field inhomogeneity due to joint gaps. Okano [...] et al. (2004) and Lin et al. (2011) calculated the magnetic field inhomogeneity between two segments of the conventional unimodal magnetic rail and put forward some improvement countermeasures. The cost of the Halbach-type magnetic rail is just about 38  % of that of conventional unimodal magnetic rail per kilometer (Wang et al. 2002 and Del-Valle et al. 2011), while the levitation efficiency (N/cm 3) is about 2.85 times larger (Deng et al. 2008), and thus has been widely used or reformed for the maglev applications (Guo et al. 2010; Deng et al. 2013; Boughrara et al. 2013). But until recently, the method to improve magnetic field homogeneity of the Halbach-type magnetic <b>rail</b> with <b>joint</b> gaps is so limited {{that it is necessary to}} optimize the Halbach-type magnetic <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> to guarantee the riding comfort of the HTS maglev vehicle. In this paper, the magnetic field inhomogeneity over normal <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> which was employed in the present Maglev system was evaluated. Two <b>rail</b> <b>joints,</b> the mitered <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> and the overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint,</b> have been proposed aiming at improving the longitudinal homogeneity of the applied magnetic fields.

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>joints</b> are a weak {{component}} in railway tracks {{because of the}} large impact and wheel-rail contact forces. Every train passage contributes to the deterioration of <b>rail</b> <b>joints,</b> causing visible (e. g. battered rails) and invisible (e. g. loose bolts) damages. The invisible damage cannot be detected by the commonly performed visual inspection, which is labor intensive, unreliable, intrusive and unsafe. In this paper, a vehicle-borne monitoring system is used to automatically detect and assess the tightness condition of bolts at <b>rail</b> <b>joints.</b> The monitoring method is developed based on field Axle Box Acceleration (ABA) measurements using different bolt tightness conditions. The suitability of the method is assessed by bolt tightness prediction and verification of a set of <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> in the tram network of Sheffield, United Kingdom.

30|$|An ideal {{magnetic}} rail {{should provide}} a homogeneous magnetic field along the longitudinal direction to guarantee the reliable friction-free operation of high temperature superconducting (HTS) maglev vehicles. But in reality, magnetic field inhomogeneity may occur due to lots of reasons; the joint gap is the most direct one. Joint gaps inevitably exist between adjacent segments and influence the longitudinal magnetic field homogeneity above the rail since any magnetic rails are consisting of many permanent magnet segments. To improve the running performance of maglev systems, two new <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> are proposed based on the normal <b>rail</b> <b>joint,</b> which are named as mitered <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> and overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint.</b> It is found that the overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> has a better effect to provide a competitive homogeneous magnetic field. And the further structure optimization {{has been done to}} ensure maglev vehicle operation as stable as possible when passing through those joint gaps. The results show that the overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> with optimal parameters can significantly reduce the magnetic field inhomogeneity comparing with the other two <b>rail</b> <b>joints.</b> In addition, an appropriate gap was suggested when balancing the thermal expansion of magnets and homogenous magnetic field, which is considered valuable references for the future design of the magnetic rails.|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} analysis, it {{points out that}} the {{magnetic}} field above the normal <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> is not homogeneous, and this magnetic field inhomogeneity will affect running performance of the levitated vehicle. Therefore, the mitered <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> and the overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> are put forward to improve the magnetic field to ensure the vehicle operate stable in a comparatively homogeneous magnetic field, as shown in Fig.  3 b, c, respectively.|$|R

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>joints</b> have {{a shorter}} service life {{than most other}} railway track components. The {{discontinuity}} between rail ends turns the <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> into a weak spot, and consequently, into a track component demanding more frequent maintenance measures, which result in high maintenance costs. Moreover, difficulties are often found when assessing the damage condition of <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> since damage conditions like cracks in the rail web or loose bolts cannot be detected by visual inspection. A {{better understanding of the}} damage mechanisms and degradation process of <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> may help to develop adapted maintenance measures and to improve <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> design. In this paper, a 3 D Finite Element model is presented as base for <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> study.

The model is validated between 150 and 800 Hz with measured axle box accelerations of resilient wheels. Higher frequencies may be reached with an improved model of the rubber. In the paper, the influence of the bolt tightness is studied. The results showed that contact force, specially its variation, is strongly affected by the bolt tightness; loose bolts cause higher contact forces. The effect of vehicle speed on wheel/rail contact is also significant mainly due to the interaction between rail and sleepers {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>rail</b> <b>joint.</b> Apart from bolt tightness conditions and vehicle speed, the validated model has the potential to study the influence of other track parameters and damage condition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Adhesively bonded {{insulated}} <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> {{are used}} to electrically isolate sections of track into discrete blocks to detect the positions of trains, and are sometimes useful in detecting rail breaks. Recent advances in high-strength rails allow {{for the use of}} higher-weight cars. With this increased axle loading of the freight lines, bonded <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> are encountering early breakdown through either electrical or mechanical failure. Service lives as short as 12 – 18 months have been reported on some rail lines, significantly lower than the lifetime of other railway components. The cost of replacing the joints has significantly increased the desire for a joint with improved durability. Commercially available bonded <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> are typically double butt-strap joints consisting of two steel reinforcing joint bars, bonded to the rails with an epoxy adhesive that may contain a fibreglass or aramid cloth layer. This paper investigates a tapered bonded joint that was proposed to reduce the high stresses that can result in the more typical butt-strap joint configuration. The first type of analysis models the <b>rails</b> and <b>joint</b> bars as beams, and the adhesive and ground as distributed elastic springs. Approximate solutions are obtained {{with the use of the}} Rayleigh–Ritz method. The finite-element method is used in the second type of analysis.

Basedon theseanalyses, tapered insulated joints shouldpro-vide some advantages over conventional insulated <b>rail</b> <b>joints,</b> such as lower deflections, bending moments, and shear stresses in the adhesive...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{extensive}} usage of continuous welded rails, a number of <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> still exist in the track. Although {{a number of them}} exist as part of turnouts in the yards where the speed is not of concern, the Insulated <b>Rail</b> <b>Joints</b> (IRJs) that exist in ballasted tracks remain a source of significant impact loading. A portion of the dynamic load generated at the <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> due to wheel passage is transmitted to the support system which leads to permanent settlements of the ballast layer with subsequent vertical misalignment of the sleepers around the <b>rail</b> <b>joints.</b> This vertical misalignment of the adjacent sleepers forms a source of high frequency dynamic load raisers causing significant maintenance work including localised grinding of railhead around the joint, re-alignment of the sleepers and/or ballast tamping or track component renewals/repairs. These localised maintenance activities often require manual inspections and disruptions to the train traffic leading to significant costs to the rail industry. Whilst {{a number of studies have}} modelled the effect of joints as dips, none have specifically attended to the effect of vertical misalignment of the sleepers on the dynamic response of <b>rail</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper presents a coupled finite element track model and a rigid body track vehicle interaction model through which the effects of vertical misalignment of sleepers on the increase in dynamic loads around the IRJ are studied.
