50|$|This shaft driven {{autofocus}} {{design has}} several {{benefits such as}} allowing for smaller and lighter lenses and also keeps the cost of lenses down {{because there are no}} internal focusing motors or digital interfaces built into the lens. Keeping the autofocus motors inside the camera body and as far away from the <b>lens</b> <b>glass</b> as possible, reduces vibration, an additional benefit. This highly reliable shaft-driven autofocus system was extremely successful but is not seen in modern lenses.|$|E
50|$|The Fresnel lens was {{introduced}} {{for use in}} lighthouses around 1823. Generally, keeping the lens historically preserved, rather than restoration to period, will reduce stress on the lens and keep some of the lens's story intact (e.g. chips of the glass that are documented in historical light keeper's notes). It is important to consult a conservator before attempting any conservation on a lens.

50|$|Most {{film has}} {{relatively}} low sensitivity to colors outside the visible range, so light {{spread in the}} near ultraviolet (UV) or near infrared (IR) rarely has {{a significant impact on}} the image recorded. However, sensors used in digital cameras commonly are sensitive to a wider range of wavelengths. Although the <b>lens</b> <b>glass</b> itself filters out much of the UV light, and all digital cameras designed for color photography incorporate filters to reduce red and IR sensitivity, the chromatic aberration can be sufficient for bright out-of-focus violet light to tint nearby dark regions of the image. Bright cloudy or hazy skies are strong sources of scattered violet and UV light, so tend to provoke the problem.|$|E
50|$|Photographic {{lenses and}} {{equipment}} are designed around {{the film to}} be used. Although the earliest photographic materials were sensitive only to the blue-violet end of the spectrum, partially color-corrected achromatic lenses were normally used, {{so that when the}} photographer brought the visually brightest yellow rays to a sharp focus, the visually dimmest but photographically most active violet rays would be correctly focused, too. The introduction of orthochromatic emulsions required the whole range of colors from yellow to blue to be brought to an adequate focus. Most plates and films described as orthochromatic or isochromatic were practically insensitive to red, so the correct focus of red light was unimportant; a red window could be used to view the frame numbers on the paper backing of roll film, as any red light which leaked around the backing would not fog the film; and red lighting could be used in darkrooms. With the introduction of panchromatic film the whole visible spectrum needed to be brought to an acceptably sharp focus. In all cases a color cast in the <b>lens</b> <b>glass</b> or faint colored reflections in the image were of no consequence as they would merely change the contrast a little. This was no longer acceptable when using color film. More highly corrected lenses for newer emulsions could be used with older emulsion types, but the converse was not true.|$|E
40|$|Absract- There is {{no point}} {{harnessing}} an energy resource that has no economic value. Solar energy poses a strong threat {{to other forms of}} energy due to its purity and availability. The problem associated with harnessing solar power mainly comes from the cost and efficiency of the photovoltaic (P-V) panels. This work proffers a solution to this problem by combining the effect of colours and lenses based on the principle of white light spectrum and its behavior with lenses. A 0. 9 m by 0. 3 m mono-crystalline solar panel with a manufacturer specification of 18 % efficiency, 50 W maximum output power, 18 V maximum voltage output & 2. 77 A maximum current output was used for experiments in combination with a sheet of convex <b>lens,</b> <b>glass</b> panes dyed with various colours of the light spectrum, a battery operated portable multimeter, a meter rule, and a mount frame. Experiments were conducted for different time schedules for three days of assumed equal intensity. The results of the experiments are presented in stages and it was discovered that at stage 3, the system which is a combination of solar panel, violet colour filter and convex lens yielded a productivity of over 96 % with power output of 47. 67 W.

40|$|Abstract: The lens molding {{technology}} {{has become a}} promising fabrication method for <b>glass</b> <b>lens,</b> especially for aspheric <b>glass</b> <b>lens</b> in batch. Because during the real compression molding, the error compensation for mold shape turns very difficult, the mold needs to be repaired repeatedly {{to meet the requirements}} of lens molding. To solve this problem, a cooperative design scheme is proposed. However, the scheme is not limited to solving the mold repairing; it also aims to providing the integrated and optimal design for aspheric glass-lens mold. In fact, the cooperative scheme is a collaborative software platform, which integrates with data processing, optical design, finite element analysis, error compensation and mechanical design for lens molding. On this platform, users only need to submit the (camera) lens parameters or measured data of aspheric lens, and then the platform can provide the final mold drawings, which will be input in the CNC software of ultra-precision machine and guide the mold fabrication. Meanwhile, the cooperative platform is Network-based PDM system, so designers could remotely communicate with it and help to finish the mold design jointly. In this case, the cooperative design could tremendously improve the efficiency and accuracy of <b>lens</b> molding. Introductions <b>Glass</b> <b>lens,</b> especially aspheric <b>glass</b> <b>lens,</b> is extensively used in various high-quality (video) cameras.
