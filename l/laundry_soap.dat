60|$|It was quick, rough bathing. Reaching out for {{the dogs}} nearest him, he flung them in turn into the tub from which they had drunk.

Several minutes sufficed for a dog.|$|E

His discerning eye, made keen by twenty years' {{experience in the}} manufacture of <b>laundry</b> <b>soap</b> (save the wrappers!) recognized instantly the poor and discerning scholar, a worthy object of his caliphanous mood. He descended the two shallow stone steps that led from the sidewalk, and addressed without hesitation the object of his designed munificence. His first words were no worse than salutatory and tentative.|$|E
50|$|Soap: 80% of India's {{supply of}} neem oil now {{is used by}} neem oil soap manufacturers.

40|$|A spectrofluorometric {{method was}} {{established}} {{and used to}} detect and quantify optical brighteners (OB) in ambient water samples. Optical brighteners are added to products such as <b>laundry</b> <b>soaps,</b> detergents, and cleaning agents {{for the purpose of}} making the fabric appear brighter after washing. Because a large fraction of OBs are discharged into wastewater, they are ideal for use as indicators of failing septic systems, sewage leaks, or lack of wastewater treatment. The method described here uses moderately priced equipment to provide rapid and accurate detection of minute levels of contamination. Standard curves were prepared with disodium diaminostilbene disulfonate solutions ranging in concentration from 0. 3 ppm to 70 ppm. Linear plots with R 2 values of ≥ 0. 987 were obtained for the standard curves, which were then used to determine the concentration of optical brighteners in water samples...|$|R
5000|$|Larkin's first {{salesman}} was his wife's brother, Elbert Hubbard, who {{had also}} been working for J. Weller & Co. in Chicago as a salesman. The business grew very quickly, and in 1877 Larkin bought land on Seneca Street in Buffalo and built his first factory. By 1878, the company was producing 9 different soap products, ranging from [...] "Boraxine" [...] soap powder, {{through a variety of}} <b>laundry</b> <b>soaps</b> to [...] "Jet" [...] harness soap, [...] "Oatmeal" [...] toilet soap and Glycerine. In 1878, 13-year-old Darwin D. Martin was hired as a salesman in Boston.

More than 10 Venezuelan companies produce and sell it, but two companies hold almost 85 percent of the market share, with the Las Llaves brand, alone, holding nearly 70 percent. Management for Las Llaves is concerned about how to remain competitive not only with quality and acceptance of its product (effectiveness) but also with how to produce the soap efficiently (at the lowest possible cost) to remain competitive in today’s global economic environment. The objective of this thesis is to identify and analyze the sourcing costs of three raw ingredients used to produce <b>laundry</b> bar <b>soap</b> in the Las Llaves facility and to provide a model scenario to support the decision making analysis within the purchasing department...|$|R

Increasing the frequency of diaper changes and topical application of emollients are sufficient to resolve most cases. Dermatitis of the vulva in older children is usually caused by exposure to an irritant (e.g. scented products that come into contact with the vulva, <b>laundry</b> detergent, <b>soaps,</b> etc.) and is treated with preventing exposure and encouraging sitz baths with baking soda as the vulvar skin heals.

30|$|From {{the view}} point of {{biomedical}} engineering, the element silver {{is well known}} for its broad spectrum antibacterial effect at very low concentrations [23], and it possesses many advantages, such as good antibacterial ability, excellent biocompatibility, and satisfactory stability [24, 25]. The scientific literature points to the wide use of silver in numerous applications. It is well established that silver nanoparticles are known for their strong antibacterial effects for a wide array of organisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi) [26]. Therefore, silver nanoparticles are widely used in medical devices and supplies such as wound dressings, scaffold, skin donation, recipient sites, and sterilized materials in hospitals, medical catheters, contraceptive devices, surgical instruments, bone prostheses, artificial teeth, and bone coating. One can also observe their wide use in consumer products such as cosmetics, lotions, creams, toothpastes, <b>laundry</b> detergents, <b>soaps,</b> surface cleaners, room sprays, toys, antimicrobial paints, home appliances (e.g., washing machines, air, and water filters), automotive upholstery, shoe insoles, brooms, food storage containers, and textiles [27 – 30].|$|R
