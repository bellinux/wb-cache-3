5|$|Firehawk {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains. There are six cars with four seats in each row {{for a total}} of 24 riders per train. There were three trains during the ride's first year at Geauga Lake, however only two have been used since. The third train became a parts donor for the first two. Originally, riders reclined on the lift hill – rather than in the station – and returned to an upright position prior to re-entering the station. However, this was changed to occur in the station due to problems that arose during the ride's first season. The trains feature the Firehawk logo on the front colored yellow and red. Previously at Geauga Lake, the X-Flight logo was colored <b>lime</b> <b>green</b> and dark blue.|$|E

25|$|As railway {{lines have}} been {{transferred}} to London Overground operation, services are sometimes operated using rolling stock inherited from the previous train operating company, and for a temporary period these trains have been branded with transitional livery until they are replaced with newer rolling stock.

Following {{the lead of the}} parent club (which was widely criticized for its 1980s uniforms), the Toros introduced what some consider the ugliest uniform in the history of organized baseball: orange pants with yellow and red stripes, and a jersey with a turquoise back, yellow raglan sleeves, and a front resplendent in yellow, avocado, red, orange, and <b>lime</b> <b>green</b> stripes of various widths. The look in 1981, an all-orange uniform with red and yellow trim, was similarly ill-received.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the more}} {{distinct}} International promotionals was the boxy Metro delivery van which International made from 1948 to about 1959. PMC's Metro {{appears to have been}} made in the later 1950s, and was one of the company's last promotional offerings. It had an opening rear door which slid outward from the rear of the van, revealing storage space inside. This model was offered in a common light yellow, a purple, and a less common <b>lime</b> <b>green.</b> The PMC offering was often packaged in a toy-like plastic bag stapled to a cardboard hanging card. One recent eBay offering of the Metro in original packaging was being sold for $200.00.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were assigned}} to three locomotive depots: Finsbury Park in London, Gateshead over the Tyne from Newcastle, and Haymarket in Edinburgh. They arrived from the manufacturer painted in two-tone green, the dark BR green on top, with a narrower strip of a lighter, <b>lime</b> <b>green</b> along the bottom. This helped to disguise {{the bulk of the}} locomotive body. The cab window surrounds were picked out in cream-white. Although delivered without it, they all soon sported the bright yellow warning panel at each end common to all British diesel and electric locomotives, to make them more conspicuous. Very soon, all were named; the Gateshead and Edinburgh Haymarket locomotives after regiments of the British Army from the North-East of England and from Scotland, respectively, while London Finsbury Park followed the LNER tradition of naming locomotives after winning racehorses.|$|E
25|$|Headgear {{included}} a service cap for dress and semi-dress and a field cap or bush hat worn with fatigues.

Other beret colors are: black for armored corps, turquoise for artillery personnel; olive drab for infantry; grey for combat engineers. For all other army personnel, except combat units, the beret for men was green and for women, black. Women in the navy wore a black beret with gold insignia. Males in the navy once wore a blue/black beret but replaced it with the US Navy's sailor cap.|$|E
5|$|The {{variety of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} that Bengal has to offer is incredible.

People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|R
