Brokers provide services beyond procuring insurance, such as providing risk assessments, insurance consulting services, insurance-related regulatory and <b>legislative</b> updates, claims <b>assistance</b> services, assisting with employee enrollment, and helping to resolve benefit issues. [...] However, some states consider the provision of services that are unrelated to the insurance procured through the broker to be an impermissible rebate or inducement.|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} ‘An Analysis of <b>Legislative</b> <b>Assistance</b> in the EP’ {{treats the}} problem of unelected parliamentary officials, which assist the elected members in the EP. The main research question is how does the organisational form of <b>legislative</b> <b>assistance</b> affect {{the functioning of the}} EP. The dissertation contributes to a new area of research in legislative studies on the relationship between technocracy and democracy. To gain an insight into the research question, the dissertation is concerned with the institutional design of <b>legislative</b> <b>assistance</b> in two different ways. First, the research project explains the form of <b>legislative</b> <b>assistance</b> in the EP between 1952 and 2013. Second, the dissertation investigates the behavioural consequences (i. e. staff’s frequency of involvement in assistance) of the administrative form in the seventh term (2009 - 2014). Following these aims, the dissertation is divided into two empirical parts. The qualitative part explains the form of <b>legislative</b> <b>assistance</b> in the EP based on new-institutionalists approaches to organisational design and qualitative methods (content analysis of interview and secondary data). The quantitative part investigates how the form of <b>legislative</b> <b>assistance</b> affects the behaviour of staff based on organisation theory and quantitative methods (PCA/regression). A comparison with the national legislatures reveals that in most aspects the organisation of <b>legislative</b> <b>assistance</b> in the EP resembles the one in state-parliaments, while other aspects are exclusive to the EP. State-parliament characteristics were adopted already in the 1950 s due to functional-ideational considerations. Changes were more dynamic in the 1960 s/ 1970 s compared to the 1980 s/ 1990 s. Until the 1980 s, the administrative structures of the EP were responding to political events. Organisational structures significantly determine the frequency staff assist MEPs. To sum up, while the behaviour of staff is conditioned by the organisation of <b>legislative</b> <b>assistance,</b> the organisation itself is conditioned by the historical institutional environment and functional considerations of the EP...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Despite {{a variety}} of Federal, Tribal, State and even local laws passed over the last 85 years the amount of looting and {{vandalism}} of irreplaceable archeological resources continues to increase. Archeological sites are located on {{both public and private}} lands. Many of the areas are remote and difficult to patrol, although considerable numbers of archeological sites are also to be found in more densely populated areas such as New-England, the Midwest, Southeast, and the West Coast. This technical brief examines: (1) the current profiles of civil and criminal actions brought since passage of the Archeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA); (2) the potential areas of application for ARPA; (3) other laws and regulations that afford protection to archeological resources; and (4) case patterns through an overview of LOOT information currently available.

In exercising their legislative functions, the Members of the EP are assisted - as in most parliaments - by a number of internal services, and they have access to a large variety of external sources, not the least to sources based on specific interests, the so-called lobby.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring (OMHAR) administers the mark-to-market program, which was created to preserve the affordability of low-income rental housing while reducing the long-term costs of Section 8 project-based <b>assistance.</b> <b>Legislative</b> authorization for both the mark-to-market program and OMHAR is scheduled to terminate on September 30, 2001. If the legislative authority for the mark-to-market program provided for in Subtitle A of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 is allowed to expire, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimates {{it will have to}} reduce the rents to market levels of well over 1, 000 properties without having the tools to mitigate the potential effects of such reductions. If the reduced rents do not provide sufficient revenues to cover the properties' operating expenses, mortgage payments, and repair needs, owners may be forced to reduce expenditures for maintenance or other operating expenses or may default on their mortgages. Such action could result in deteriorating property conditions and substantial claims against the Federal Housing Administration insurance fund, which, in turn, could adversely affect property residents and lead to a decrease in the supply of affordable housing. Transferring authority for the mark-to-market program to HUD's Office of Housing could potentially help facilitate the handling of some mark-to-market related functions that have required coordination between OMHAR and the Office of Housing. While the mark-to-market program has brought about successful and restructurings resulting in Section 8 savings at a number of properties, the requirement that rents be reduced to market has increased the risk of physical and financial problems at other properties. ...|$|R
40|$|Magister Legum - LLMThis {{research}} {{acknowledges that}} although literature abounds on development assistance in general, {{not much has}} been published yet on Cameroon specifically. Therefore, this mini-thesis seeks to contribute to fill this gap. Moreover, it aims to examine both development <b>assistance</b> <b>legislative</b> frameworks in Cameroon and above all to compare {{them in order to}} find out which development assistance approach is the most aligned in terms of international obligations relative to human rights and economic development. The IMF-World Bank’s Comprehensive Approach to debt Reduction, (the HIPC Initiative), and China’s White Paper on Foreign Aid have been specifically chosen for this research for two main reasons: first, these two international instruments are significantly impacting upon and reshaping Cameroon’s political, social and economic development architecture since Cameroon economic crisis exists till today; and secondly, to enlighten the public, academicians, policy makers, on development assistance in Cameroon given that legal sources on the topic exist but mostly unpublished and inaccessible Therefore this research will be restricted to the period from Cameroon’s economic crisis in 1980 up to 2014. Given the limited availability of primary legal sources at both the international and domestic levels, this research will primarily look at HIPC Initiative Agreement and the Chinese White Paper on Foreign Aid. Moreover, this study will be conducted in form of the available HIPC documents and reports on Cameroon regularly published by the staff of IMF and the World Bank and specifically the HIPC Decision Point Document and the HIPC Completion Point Document of Cameroon. In addition, this study will rely on primary legal sources relative to states international obligations regarding human rights and economic cooperation such as, the UDHR (10 December 1948), the ICCPR (16 December 1966), the ICESCR (16 December 1966) and the Declaration on the Right to Development (4 December 1986). In the case of China’s development assistance approach, given that neither China nor Cameroon release specific bilateral treaties or agreements related to their development co-operation and the fact that documents and publications relative to Cameroon’s development assistance are mostly unpublished and inaccessible, this study will principally focus on the Chinese White Paper on Foreign Aid. It will also look, amongst others, at the Beijing Declaration of the FOCAC (2004), the White Paper on China-Africa Economic and Trade Co-operation (August 2013). Moreover this research will be complemented through secondary sources such as books, journals articles, report, working papers, press reviews, drafts, deliberation of international conferences and international summits, and internet source...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 1990 ties, legislators of many States, {{essentially}} of Eastern Europe and ex-USSR, {{requested the}} assistance of the Commission for Democracy through Law – Venice Commission – and of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights – ODIHR – in order to draft their Laws on Freedom of Religion or Belief and on relations towards religions. Thereby, these two institutions wrote about thirty opinions, each of them commenting a draftlaw according to the criteria of the International Standards of Human Rights, among which the Right to Freedom of Religion or Belief. From their experiences, they edited guidelines (in 2004 and in 2014) directing any legislator wishing to draft a law on Freedom of Religion or Belief conformingly to the Human Rights. This study focuses on the right of religious or belief communities to legal status – especially legal personality –, other privileges and the conditions to obtain them, according to the commented draftlaws. After analysing the working modalities of the <b>legislative</b> <b>assistance</b> by the Venice Commission and the ODIHR, this study discovers and presents the pecularities of the implementation of the International Standards by these institutions to stipulations of draftlaws concerning religions or beliefs, the influence of their work on national legislations and their indirect impact on the International Standards themselves. The background question of this study permits us to state that the support to the right to Freedom of Religion or Belief by Venice Commission and ODIHR assistance to the national legislators drafting of laws is not an imperialism of Western worldviews as it promotes actually the official goals of these instances, i. e. democracy, peace and human rights, thus the manifestation and expression of any worldview, religion or belief in the usual limits of the respect of others. In order to answer that question, this study took into account the religious and cultural context of the States concerned by international <b>legislative</b> <b>assistance,</b> checking on the one hand its link or distance with the international standard of freedom or belief {{and on the other hand}} the corelation between a State’s history of religions-State relations and its desire or necessity to request international assistance to draft laws on freedom of religion or belief respectuous of international standards.
