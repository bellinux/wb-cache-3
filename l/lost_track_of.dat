5|$|The {{majority}} {{of illegal immigrants}} come from the southern provinces of the People's Republic of China, with Asia as a whole, Eastern Europe, Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East all contributing to the illegal population. Estimates of numbers of illegal immigrants range between 35,000 and 120,000. A 2008 report by the Auditor General of Canada, Sheila Fraser, stated that Canada has <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> approximately 41,000 illegal immigrants whose visas have expired.|$|E
5|$|Loire and Sémillante {{had escaped}} from the battle into Black Sod Bay, where they hoped to hide until they had a clear passage back to France. However, late on 15 October, a British frigate {{squadron}} under James Newman-Newman rounded the southern headland of the bay, forcing the French ships to flee to the north. Pressing on sail in pursuit, Newman ordered HMS Révolutionaire to focus on Sémillante whilst he pursued Loire in HMS Mermaid, accompanied by the brig HMS Kangaroo under Commander Edward Brace. Loire and Sémillante separated to divide their pursuers; Mermaid and Kangaroo <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> Loire in the early evening, and Sémillante evaded Révolutionaire after dark.|$|E
5|$|The 1920 Akron Pros {{had one of}} {{only two}} African American players in the AFPA, Fritz Pollard. He later went on to be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame's class of 2005. Even though the Pros were given the trophy in 1920, the league <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> the event {{and for a long time}} {{published}} in its own record books that the 1920 championship was undecided. It was not until the 1970s that the NFL remembered its early vote on awarding the Akron Pros the championship.|$|E

5|$|Navarin, {{named after}} the Battle of Navarino, was ordered on 24 April 1889 from the Franco-Russian Works and {{construction}} began on 13 July 1889 at their Saint Petersburg shipyard. The ship was laid down on 31 May 1890 and launched on 20 October 1891. She was transferred to Kronstadt in 1893 for fitting out, but did not enter service until June 1896 {{at a cost of}} over nine million rubles. Construction was seriously delayed by problems with the boilers and late deliveries of armor plates, the gun mountings, and other components, compounded by inefficiencies in building. One example of such was that the Russian armor plate company lacked the capacity to make gun port armor for the gun turrets of the required thickness, but the builder somehow <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> this fact and had to place a rush order with the French company of St. Chamond.|$|E
5|$|At 08:50, {{the lead}} U.S. attack {{formation}} from Hornet spotted four ships from Abe's Vanguard force. Pressing on, the U.S. aircraft sighted the Japanese carriers {{and prepared to}} attack. Three Zeros from Zuihō attacked the formation's Wildcats, drawing {{them away from the}} bombers they were assigned to protect. Thus, the dive bombers in the first group initiated their attacks without fighter escort. Twenty Zeros from the Japanese carrier CAP attacked the SBD formation and shot down four of them. The remaining 11 SBDs commenced their attack dives on Shōkaku at 09:27, hitting her with three to six bombs, wrecking her flight deck and causing serious damage to the interior of the ship. The final SBD of the 11 <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> Shōkaku and instead dropped its bomb near the Japanese destroyer , causing minor damage. The six TBFs in the first strike force, having become separated from their strike group, did not find the Japanese carriers and eventually turned back towards Hornet. On the way back, they attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser , missing with all their torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of Ostend following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys. This careful study was, however, rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore. Steaming {{back and forth across}} the harbour entrance in the fog as the monitors and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking the entrance to the canal. As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from Ostend to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped back to shore. During this period, Godsal's motor launches <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> the cruiser in the murk, and it was not until the third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches. Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictives port propeller.|$|E

5|$|The bay {{has been}} {{strategically}} {{important for the}} military. General Zachary Taylor stationed his men on Rincon Point during the Mexican-American War, and a Union invasion was halted by Confederates on the same point in 1862, during the American Civil War. The Port of Corpus Christi {{was used by the}} Confederates to bring in supplies during the war effort until the Union bombarded Corpus Christi and occupied the bay and port from 1863 to 1870. In 1940, the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi was established on the bay, and by 1944 had transformed into a major base with one main air station and six additional stations. Notably, during a March 1960 practice run from the base, future Senator John McCain <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> his altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-pistoned-engine AD-6 Skyraider crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and sank to the bottom. He squeezed out of the cockpit, swam ten feet to the surface, and was carried to safety by a rescue helicopter, therefore escaping without major injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{province}} {{now seemed}} secure and Graham saw {{the opportunity to}} continue pacification on a more methodical basis in Phuoc Tuy. Planning to attack the remaining Viet Cong where they were most vulnerable, the Australians returned to interdicting communist supply lines and bases, with 2 RAR conducting two search and destroy operations {{to the east of}} Dat Do—Operation Cairns in late-July followed by Operation Atherton in mid-August, both of which resulted in only minor contact. Meanwhile, the Hat Dich area had been quiet since US forces had swept of the area as part of Operation Akron (9–29 June), and Australian intelligence assessed that it was free of Viet Cong main force combat units. By late-July communist rear services units and other supporting units were believed to have begun moving back into the area, in an attempt to rehabilitate their base areas that had been destroyed in the earlier fighting. Yet in reality the location of communist forces was largely unknown to the Australians. In mid-July, the Viet Cong 274th Regiment—now believed to be commanded by Ut Thoi—had been forced to move from the Hat Dich towards its north-eastern base areas due to Operation Paddington and Australian signals intelligence had been able to effectively track the regiment's movement due to the location of its transmitter. However, 1 ATF intelligence officers had then <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> the unit.|$|E
25|$|After the lunch, Smith {{reportedly}} {{rushed to}} his editor, Phelps, with the story, but {{it amounted to}} nothing. Smith left his job the next day for Yale Law School, and Phelps <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> the story while covering the 1972 Republican Convention.|$|E

25|$|Off the pitch, the scorers and {{scoreboard}} operators <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> {{what was}} happening and at one point resorted to consulting with spectators to try to resolve the chaos.

25|$|The {{novel is}} {{considered}} a classic of English literature, though some critics claim that it has structural problems; Thackeray sometimes <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> the huge scope of his work, mixing up characters' names and minor plot details.

5000|$|The {{original}} track listing, {{as reported}} by KNAC on December 22, 2001, featured several tracks that did not appear on the final album.

25|$|On September 6, 1976, Soviet Air Force pilot Viktor Belenko {{successfully}} {{defected to}} the West, flying his MiG-25 'Foxbat' to Hakodate, Japan.

25|$|In 1937, Parker {{played at}} a jam {{session at the}} Reno Club in Kansas City. His attempt to improvise failed when he <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> the chord changes. This {{prompted}} Jo Jones, the drummer for Count Basie's Orchestra, to contemptuously throw a cymbal at his feet as a signal to leave the stage. However, rather than discouraging Parker, the incident caused him to vow to practice harder, and {{turned out to be}} a seminal moment in the young musician's career when he returned as a new man a year later.|$|E
25|$|At first, little {{interest}} {{was shown in}} the parchment object itself. Madison had custody of it as Secretary of State (1801–1809) but having left Washington, he had <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> it in the years leading to his death. A publisher had access to it in 1846 for {{a book on the}} Constitution. In 1883 historian J. Franklin Jameson found the parchment folded in a small tin box {{on the floor of a}} closet at the State, War and Navy Building. In 1894 the State Department sealed the Declaration and Constitution between two glass plates and kept them in a safe.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the songs}} [...] "Crucifixion Destruction" [...] and [...] "White Devil Rise" [...] were {{mentioned}} in interviews and articles throughout 1994, with Danzig even discussing {{the latter in}} some detail, neither song was included on {{the final version of}} the album.

50|$|In October 2006, Glenn Danzig {{released}} Black Aria II, {{the follow-up}} to his solo classical album, Black Aria. Black Aria was re-released by Evilive in May 2007. He {{spent the rest}} of the year completing the production and packaging <b>of</b> The <b>Lost</b> <b>Tracks</b> <b>of</b> Danzig, a double CD containing twenty-six unreleased songs that span the entire Danzig catalog, which was released on July 10, 2007.

60|$|Again {{the hours}} drifted slowly by. The boys had really <b>lost</b> all <b>track</b> <b>of</b> time. They dozed off {{and did not}} awaken until some time later. Whether they had slept through a night or not they did not know.|$|R
25|$|The last {{well-known}} use of {{the tomb}} itself was in the Claudio-Neronian period, when the daughter and the grandchild of Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus were buried here. These burials may {{be an attempt to}} emphasize for ideological reasons his descent from the Scipios; on the other hand, the latter speculation seems a harsh view of a man who, on the presumption that he was emotionally normal, must have been in grief at the death of his child. Repairs on the tomb continued until the 4th century. After then the mainly Christian Romans (who did not have the same loyalties to the traditions of pagan Rome) apparently stopped maintaining it and <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|E
25|$|Gasporotto {{decided to}} give up the {{ownership}} of Hotelito Desconocido after suffering an accident where he lost his eye. Members of the fisherman group said that Gasporotto left to Uruguay, but they said they <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> him when he moved to South America. According to local residents, once the ownership of Hotelito Desconocido was passed on to W Arquitectos, they began to see suspicious activity near the hotel. One {{of the members of the}} fisherman group stated that some of the hotel workers said they sometimes saw helicopters deliver packages at the hotel. He also stated to have seen suspicious convoys of black vehicles in some of the dirt roads leading to the hotel.|$|E
25|$|While Favorite was sailing under Commander John Davie, L'Hermite's {{squadron}} captured her on 6 January 1806.

Favourite cast off her tow and attempted to move to windward of the strangers but <b>lost</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> them. Next morning Favourite saw {{what appeared to be}} three large East Indiamen with a brig as escort, sailing towards her. As they closed, Davie realized that the strange vessels were a ship of the line, two frigates and a sloop. He tried to sail away, but eventually had to surrender when he found himself trapped between Régulus and Président. The French brought their prize into service as Favorite.|$|E

2500|$|In October and November 2007, Danzig {{toured the}} western United States, along with Gorgeous Frankenstein, Horrorpops, and Suicide City. This [...] "3 Weeks of Halloween" [...] tour was {{in support of}} his most recent album, The <b>Lost</b> <b>Tracks</b> <b>of</b> Danzig, as well as the newest graphic novel release from Verotik, Drukija: Countessa of Blood. On October 23, 2007, Danzig was {{performing}} the song [...] "How the Gods Kill" [...] in Baltimore and fell off the stage, injuring his left arm. He did not perform the Misfits set that night, but he continued the tour and played classic Misfits tunes with Doyle onstage as an encore with a sling on his left arm after the injury.|$|R
50|$|Glenn Danzig {{mentioned}} {{a compilation of}} unreleased songs in several interviews as early as 1990, prior {{to the release of}} Lucifuge. Due to his touring schedule and various other projects, the material that comprises The <b>Lost</b> <b>Tracks</b> <b>of</b> Danzig was set aside for a number of years, and was finally confirmed to be under preparation in the summer of 2006. He was only able to start work on the project after gaining back the rights to Danzig's unreleased material from American Recordings. Originally scheduled for release on May 29, 2007, it was delayed twice before its official release in North America on July 10, 2007, and in Europe one week earlier. The set was made available over iTunes in June 2007.|$|R
