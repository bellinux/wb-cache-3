5|$|Casterman {{felt that}} the {{black-and-white}} volumes of The Adventures of Tintin were not selling as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour. At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in <b>length</b> <b>to</b> 62. Hergé was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their demands in February 1942. For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Hergé insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, {{and that it would}} not be used for shading.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century, {{appreciation}} of Bashō's poems grew more fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru {{went to great}} <b>length</b> <b>to</b> find references in his hokku to historical events, medieval books, and other poems.

5|$|Hygrocybe appalachianensis {{mushrooms}} {{produce a}} white spore print. Both the spores and the basidia are dimorphic. The larger spores (macrospores) are smooth, ellipsoid, and measure 11–17.5 by 7–10µm. They are hyaline (translucent), and inamyloid. The macrobasidia are club shaped, measuring 38–57 by 8–14µm, {{and can be}} one- two-, three- or four-spored. The ratio of macrobasidia <b>length</b> <b>to</b> macrospore length is usually less than five to one. Clamp connections are present on the hyphae of several tissues of the mushroom. The hyphae of the gills (the lamellar trama) are arranged in a parallel fashion.|$|E

On many of the Indian selections, instruments such as sitar, surbahar and harmonium provide a drone-like backing, over which Harrison's chosen instrument plays the main musical theme.|$|E
5|$|The queen only lays 10–20 eggs in {{the very}} early stages of the colony, but lays as many as 1,000 a day when the colony is several years old. At maturity, a primary queen has a great {{capacity}} to lay eggs. In some species, the mature queen has a greatly distended abdomen and may produce 40,000 eggs a day. The two mature ovaries may have some 2,000 ovarioles each. The abdomen increases the queen's body <b>length</b> <b>to</b> several times more than before mating and reduces her ability to move freely; attendant workers provide assistance.|$|E

5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in <b>length</b> <b>to</b> A Clash of Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious colour {{differences}} between crested and marbled newts, {{species in the}} genus also have different body forms. They range from stocky with sturdy limbs in the Anatolian, Balkan and the southern crested newt {{as well as the}} marbled newts, to very slender with short legs in the Danube crested newt. These types were first noted by herpetologist Willy Wolterstorff, who used the ratio of forelimb <b>length</b> <b>to</b> distance between fore- and hindlimbs to distinguish subspecies of the crested newt (now full species); this index however sometimes leads to misidentifications. The number of rib-bearing vertebrae in the skeleton was shown to be a better species indicator. It ranges from 12 in the marbled newts to 16–17 in the Danube crested newt and is usually observed through radiography on dead or sedated specimens.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used to identify}} Bovista pila in the field include its relatively small size, the metallic lustre of the endoperidium, {{and the presence of}} rhizomorphs. B.plumbea is similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its typically smaller fruit body and the blue-gray color of its inner coat. Unlike B.pila, B.plumbea is attached to the ground by a mass of mycelial fibers known as a sterile base. Microscopically, B.plumbea has larger spores (5–7 by 4.5–6.0μm); with long pedicels (9–14μm). Another lookalike is the European B.nigrescens, which can most reliably be distinguished from B.pila by its microscopic characteristics. The spores of B.nigrescens are oval rather than spherical, rougher than those of B.pila, and have a hyaline (translucent) pedicel about equal in <b>length</b> <b>to</b> the spore diameter (5μm). The puffball Disciseda pila was named for its external resemblance to B.pila. Found in Texas and Argentina, it has much larger, warted spores that measure 7.9–9.4μm.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, the {{watershed}} {{became part of}} a rancho. In 1966, the creek was dammed to form Laguna Niguel Lake, while the surrounding hills were leveled as residential communities were constructed in the area following the '60s and '70s. The creek's basin eventually {{became part of the}} cities of Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, and a small portion in San Juan Capistrano. Increasing urban runoff in the 1960s caused most of the flow in the creek to be unnatural.

5|$|Eilat Airport was {{established}} in 1949 by the Israel Air Force, following the 1948 Israeli War of Independence. During its early years, the airport aimed to establish a comprehensive set of connections to towns across the country, most notably with Tel Aviv and Haifa. Consequently, a regular route from Eilat to Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion International Airport) was started. Soon after, a route to Haifa Airport became operational. In December 1950, following their establishment, Arkia Israel Airlines became the largest domestic operator at Eilat Airport, taking {{the position of the}} former companies Eilata and Aviron. To this day, they retain this position. Later, in 1964 the runway was expanded to 1500m, and a passenger terminal was built. Five years later, the runway was further expanded increasing the <b>length</b> <b>to</b> 1900m. In 1975, Eilat Airport started to attract Scandinavian airlines. The first international flight arrival to Eilat, of the Danish airline, Sterling Airlines landed in this year. Since then, many international routes have been established directly linking Eilat with Europe, however, the airport is still unable to handle landings of large aircraft which have to fly to Uvda International Airport.|$|E
5|$|He {{began in}} 1962 by writing a Fortran {{compiler}} for the PDP-4, before {{contributing to the}} development of the PDP-5 instruction set. Under Harlan Anderson (vice president of engineering), principal architect Gordon Bell led a team, including Kotok as an assistant logic designer, which developed the first commercial time-sharing computer, the PDP-6, designed and delivered in 1963–1964. Aiming at a scientific market, Digital machines had a 36-bit word <b>length</b> <b>to</b> accommodate artificial intelligence work in Lisp and to compete with IBM mainframe computers. In 1965, in what may have been the first around-the-world networking connection, a PDP-6 at the University of Western Australia in Perth was operated from Boston in the United States via a telex link.|$|E
