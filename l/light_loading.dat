A survey has been conducted to collect relevant data of lighting utilization in Surabaya. Important findings from the survey include determination of number of each lamp type, average number of lamps per household, total number of lamps in households, and average daily operating hours.

50|$|Gasoline engines have a {{limit on}} the maximum {{pressure}} during the compression stroke, after which the fuel/air mixture detonates rather than burns. To achieve higher power outputs at the same speed, more fuel must be burned and therefore more air is needed. To achieve this, turbochargers or superchargers are used to increase the inlet pressure. This would result in detonation of the fuel/air mixture unless the compression ratio was decreased, i.e. the volume above the piston made greater. This {{can be done to}} a greater or lesser extent with massive increases in power being possible. The down side of this is that under <b>light</b> <b>loading,</b> the engine can lack power and torque. The solution is to be able to vary the inlet pressure and adjust the compression ratio to suit. This gives the best of both worlds, a small efficient engine that behaves exactly like a modern family car engine but turns into a highly tuned one on demand.|$|E

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{touched down}} on runway 4R at 23:50:20. About two {{seconds after the}} wheels touched down, First Officer Origel stated, [...] "We're down. We're sliding." [...] Because the pilots failed to arm the autospoiler, the spoilers did not deploy automatically on landing, and the flight crew did not manually deploy them. Spoilers disrupt the airflow over the wing and prevent it from generating lift. That causes the plane's weight to be borne by the landing gear. About 65 percent of Flight 1420's weight would have been supported by the plane's landing gear if the spoilers are deployed, but without the spoilers this number dropped to only 15 percent. With the <b>light</b> <b>loading</b> of the landing gear, the aircraft's brakes were ineffective at slowing down the plane, which continued down the runway at high speed. Directional control was lost when Captain Buschmann applied too much reverse thrust, which reduced {{the effectiveness of the}} plane's rudder and vertical stabilizer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{strength}} of a regular arch (also known as a [...] "square" [...] or [...] "right" [...] arch) {{comes from the fact}} that the mass of the structure and its superincumbent load cause lines of force that are carried by the stones into the ground and the abutments without producing any tendency for the stones to slide with respect to one another. This is due to the fact that the courses of stone are laid parallel to the abutments, which in a regular arch causes them also to lie perpendicular to its faces. For only slightly oblique bridges, where the skew angle is less than approximately 15° it is possible to use the same construction method, laying the stones in courses parallel to the abutments. The result is known as a [...] "false" [...] skew arch and analysis of the forces within it shows that in each corner where the face forms an acute angle with an abutment there are resultant forces that are not perpendicular to the planes of the stone courses whose tendency is to push the stones out of the face, the only resistance to this being provided by friction and the adhesion of the mortar between the stones.An example of such a false skew arch is the Colorado Street Bridge in Saint Paul, Minnesota.Before starting work on Store Street Aqueduct, Outram built a number of false skew arches, one of them with a skew angle as great as 19°, as accommodation bridges across the Huddersfield Narrow Canal.

40|$|Abstract — A {{multi-mode}} {{control strategy}} for a synchronous buck converter operating {{over a wide}} load range, is presented. For heavy loads, the converter runs in fixed-frequency continuous conduction mode (CCM). At <b>light</b> <b>loads,</b> it enters discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) with synchronous rectification. At still <b>lighter</b> <b>loads,</b> synchronous rectification is disabled in DCM. At very <b>light</b> <b>loads,</b> the converter operates in variable-frequency pulse skipping mode. The synchronous rectifier (SR) timing is scheduled {{as a function of}} the load current, enabling appropriate transition among the modes. An on-line adaptive algorithm to optimize the SR timing, based on power loss minimization, is presented. This control strategy is particularly well suited for a digital controller implementation, since it uses sophisticated computations, while not requiring high analog-to-digital conversion rates.

The most effective method to improve <b>light</b> <b>load</b> efficiency is to operate the DC-DC converter under pulse-frequency-modulation (PFM) to reduce the switching loss.
