The {{following}} day Brooke died and was buried on Skyros by his close circle, the officers known as the Latin Club - the critic and composer, W.

Shaw-Stewart, scholar and, {{at the age of}} 25, a director of Barings Bank; Bernard Freyberg (later General Lord Freyberg VC and Governor-General of New Zealand); and 'Cleg' Kelly. Kelly's measured description of both the death and burial of the poet have been extensively quoted in the Brooke literature. It was W.

After the Hood Battalion left England, the friendship between Kelly and Brooke had deepened. There are frequent references to their being together on group outings on leave, nights spent together at the dinner table, of W.

Brooke's death was a personal loss. Kelly is said to have begun composing his Elegy dedicated to Brooke as the poet lay dying nearby.|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{contributes to a}} growing strand of literature on the nature and causes of trade liberalisation from a political economy perspective. In three core chapters, I identify distinct and novel features of trade liberalisation. In Chapter 2, I demonstrate that unilateral and cooperative trade policy de- pend crucially {{on the degree of}} natural trade costs, or transport costs, in a model where terms-of-trade and profit-shifting motives for trade policy are important. When trade costs decline, a conflict of interest between unilateral and cooperative trade policy intensifies: unilateral policy aims to optimally exploit a country's monopoly power over its terms of trade, whereas cooperative policy aims to min- imise <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit.</b> <b>In</b> a framework where cooperative trade policy must be sustained by a reputational mechanism, I demonstrate that import tariffs can be lowered in response to decreases in natural trade costs, provided the long-run co- operative objectives of minimising <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> are more important than the short-run temptation of distorting the terms of trade and shifting profits towards the domestic market. These temptations become larger when trade costs decline since when the degree of natural distortions of consumer prices, and the degree of natural profit-shifting are lower, import tariffs are more effective at doing the job. I also demonstrate that a free trade agreement can be supported for a larger range of discount factors when trade costs decline. In Chapter 3, I analyse the sustainability of unilateral and bilateral trade lib- eralisation by introducing a time-inconsistency problem in addition to standard terms-of-trade manipulations. I find that the government's bargaining power vis- a-vis a politically organised lobby is a key parameter in the determination of the sustainability of trade liberalisation. Unilateral trade liberalisation, which is when the government unilaterally sets the dynamically efficient trade policy, can be sus- 1 tained for every discount factor if the government has no bargaining power. This is because when the government has no bargaining power, it is only just compen- sated for the short-run distortion associated with trade policy, and not for the long-run distortions which come about from overinvestment in protected sectors. As the government's bargaining power increases, the level of patience required to sustain unilateral trade liberalisation also increases, and when the bargaining power exceeds a critical threshold, the government is able to extract so much rent that it is better off continuing its implicit contract with the lobby. Bilateral trade liberalisation imposes further sanctions {{on the part of a}} deviating country when its trading partner punishes it. This ensures that bilateral trade liberalisation can be sustained for all levels of the government's bargaining power provided the world is sufficiently patient. However, for low bargaining powers unilateral trade liber- alisation can be supported for a larger range of discount factors whereas when the bargaining power exceeds a critical level, a trade agreement is needed to sustain trade liberalisation. In the last of the core chapters, Chapter 4, the question I address is one of the nature rather than the causes of trade liberalisation as in the two chapters that preceded it. I carry out an empirical examination of the political-economy model in Maggi and Rodriguez-Clare (2007). The model makes clear predictions regarding the tariff cuts in a trade agreement which can be perfectly enforced internation- ally. There are two distortions of non-cooperative trade policy: terms-of-trade manipulations, and a dynamic inconsistency. Thus, when two countries come to- gether to sign a trade agreement these are the distortions they solve. The model predicts that tariff cuts should be explained by a terms-of-trade component, which I capture by the value of net imports, and inter-industry capital mobility, which I measure using three different variables: persistence of profits, capital-labour ratios and four-firm concentration ratios. I find that the first two variables capturing 2 capital mobility perform very well at explaining the speed of liberalisation of US import protection on Mexican products. The results on the terms-of-trade com- ponent are less convincing although on most econometric specifications I obtain the correct sign. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Para tentar auxiliar na resoluÃÃo do problema da seca, as decisÃes polÃticas priorizaram a construÃÃo de reservatÃrios, produzindo âredes de alta densidade de reservatÃriosâ na regiÃo Nordeste Brasileira. Via de regra, a construÃÃo de um reservatÃrio interrompe o fluxo natural do rio, interferindo, assim, na dinÃmica de Ãgua a jusante. Objetivou com esse trabalho estudar os processos envolvidos na conectividade hidrolÃgica, bem como a interferÃncia da rede de mÃltiplos reservatÃrios na conectividade hidrolÃgica de uma grande bacia semiÃrida. O estudo de caso Ã a bacia hidrogrÃfica do aÃude OrÃs â BHAO (24. 211 km 2), situada no SemiÃrido do CearÃ. A pesquisa foi iniciada com o levantamento da topologia da rede densa de reservatÃrio da BHAO, realizada utilizando tÃcnicas de sensoriamento remoto (SR), ferramentas de geoprocessamento (SIG) e imagem de satÃlite no fim do perÃodo chuvoso de 2011. A anÃlise da conectividade hidrolÃgica foi realizada usando o modelo âReservoir Network Modelâ (ResNetM), que simulou os processos hidrolÃgicos e considerou a conectividade hidrolÃgica entre os reservatÃrios, {{conforme}} os critÃrios estabelecidos nesta pesquisa. Na busca de se identificar os principais elementos naturais e antrÃpicos da bacia que afetam a conectividade hidrolÃgica, foi realizada uma anÃlise de sensibilidades (IS) de alguns parÃmetros de entrada do modelo, o que possibilitou avaliar o impacto da rede de reservatÃrios sobre o volume armazenado no aÃude OrÃs. O levantamento da rede de reservatÃrios com SR e ferramentas automÃticas de SIG demonstrou duas falhas: a interpretaÃÃo de sombras como reservatÃrios e a mÃ identificaÃÃo da superfÃcie da Ãgua real devido Ã presenÃa de macrÃfitas nos reservatÃrios. Desse modo, foram gerados automaticamente 6. 002 polÃgonos, dos quais, apÃs ajuste manual, confirmaram-se, como reservatÃrios, apenas 4. 717 polÃgonos (79 %). A pesquisa constatou que, na Ãltima dÃcada, ocorreu um aumento de 17, 5 % no nÃmero de reservatÃrio da BHAO e que, nas regiÃes com embasamento cristalino, a densidade de reservatÃrios Ã 80 % maior do que nas regiÃes sobre geologia sedimentar. A anÃlise de sensibilidade indicou que o nÃmero de reservatÃrio da rede foi a variÃvel Ã qual o sistema apresentou maior sensibilidade (IS = 1, 07), considerando-se a conectividade hidrolÃgica. Contrariamente, a variaÃÃo da evaporaÃÃo (IS = 0, 19) e da perda em trÃnsito (IS= 0, 01) nÃo induziu a mudanÃas significativas da conectividade hidrolÃgica da BHAO. O volume armazenado no aÃude OrÃs nÃo sofreu mudanÃas significativas (IS = 0, 21) ao se modificar a topologia da rede de reservatÃrio. Por exemplo, ao se simular a retirada dos pequenos e mÃdios reservatÃrios da rede (4. 664, ou 98, 9 % dos reservatÃrios), o aÃude OrÃs indicou um acrÃscimo de apenas 14 % em seu volume mÃdio armazenado. Com base nas observaÃÃes, concluiu-se que ocorreu uma reduÃÃo na taxa de incremento anual de reservatÃrios na BHAO nos Ãltimos 10 anos, o que marca o inÃcio da fase de estabilizaÃÃo da referida rede. Entre os elementos naturais avaliados, o coeficiente de escoamento superficial (natural) foi o que demonstrou maior significÃncia para a conectividade hidrolÃgica. Sua importÃncia deve-se ao fato de, no sistema natural da BHAO, raramente se observa escoamento de base significativo. Dos elementos antrÃpicos analisados, a rede densa de reservatÃrios, obteve a maior importÃncia para a conectividade hidrolÃgica. O motivo para esse comportamento Ã que os reservatÃrios promovem a laminaÃÃo da onda de cheia, aumentando o nÃmero de dias com vazÃo fluvial e, consequentemente, maior frequÃncia da conectividade hidrolÃgica. AlÃm disso, novos reservatÃrios diminuem o comprimento dos trechos a serem ligados, atenuando as perdas em trÃnsito e facilitando a ocorrÃncia da conectividade hidrolÃgica. A variaÃÃo da rede de reservatÃrio comprovou que, ao diminuir o nÃmero de reservatÃrio da rede, ocorre uma reduÃÃo na conectividade hidrolÃgica da BHAO, porÃm, nÃo altera significativamente a vazÃo afluente ao aÃude OrÃs, o exutÃrio da bacia deste trabalho. A rede densa de reservatÃrios provou que, no inÃcio do perÃodo chuvoso, atua como barreira Ã vazÃo fluvial, causando a quebra da conectividade hidrolÃgica. Com o passar do tempo e com a continuidade da precipitaÃÃo, os milhares de reservatÃrios favorecem a conectividade hidrolÃgica por meio da laminaÃÃo da onda de cheia. Attempting {{to solve}} the drought problem, political decisions prioritized the construction of reservoirs, what eventually resulted {{in the construction of}} a "high density network of reservoirs" in the Brazilian Northeast. Usually, a reservoir interrupts the natural river flow, thus interfering in the water dynamics downstream. This work was aimed at studying the processes involved in the hydrological connectivity as well as the interference of multiple reservoirs in the hydrologic network connectivity of a large semiarid basin. The case study is the catchment area of the OrÃs - BHAO (24, 211 km 2) reservoir, located in Semiarid CearÃ. The research began with a survey of the BHAO dense reservoir network topology, conducted using remote sensing (RS), GIS tools (GIS) and satellite image {{at the end of the}} 2011 rainy season. The hydrological connectivity analysis was performed using the 'Reservoir Network Model' (ResNetM), which simulated hydrologic processes and considered the hydrological connectivity between the reservoirs, according to the criteria established in this research model. While seeking to identify the key natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the hydrological connectivity of the basin, an analysis of input sensitivity (IS) of some input parameters of the model was performed, this allowed us to evaluate the reservoir network impact on the stored volume on the OrÃs reservoir. The survey of the network of reservoirs with SR and automatic GIS tools showed two shortcomings: the misinterpretation of shadows as reservoirs and the misidentification of the actual water surface due to the macrophyte presence in reservoirs. Thus, of the 6, 002 automatically generated polygons, only 4717 polygons (79 %) were confirmed as reservoirs, after manual adjustment. The survey found that in the last decade, there was a 17. 5 % increase in the number of BHAO reservoirs and that, in regions with crystalline geology, the density of reservoirs is 80 % higher than in regions of sedimentary geology. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the number of reservoirs in the network was the variable to which the system showed higher sensitivity (SI = 1. 07), considering the hydrological connectivity. In contrast, the evaporation variation (SI = 0. 19) and <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> (SI = 0. 01) did not induce significant changes on BHAO hydrological connectivity. Also, the volume stored in the OrÃs reservoir showed no significant changes (SI = 0. 21) when the reservoir network topology was modified. For example, when the removal of small and medium network reservoirs (4, 664, or 98. 9 % of the reservoirs) was simulated, the OrÃs reservoir indicated an increase of only 14 % in its average volume stored. Based on observations, it was concluded that there was a reduction in the rate of annual BHAO reservoir increment in the past 10 years, marking the beginning of the stabilization phase of the said network. Among the evaluated natural elements, it was the (natural) runoff coefficient which was demonstrated to have the most significance for the hydrological connectivity. Its importance is due to the fact that in the BHAO natural system, underground flow is infrequent. Of the human elements analyzed, the dense reservoir network, obtained the highest importance for hydrological connectivity. The reason for this is that the reservoirs promote the lamination of the flood wave, increasing the number of days with river flow and, consequently, increase the frequency of hydrological connectivity. In addition, new reservoirs decrease the length of the passages to be connected, reducing losses in transit and promoting hydrological connectivity. The variation of the reservoir network demonstrated that decreasing the number of network reservoirs, a decrease in BHAO hydrological connectivity occurs, not changing, however, significantly the inflow to the OrÃs reservoir, the convergence focus of the network. A dense reservoir network showed that, at the beginning of the rainy season, it acts as a barrier to river flow, breaking hydrological connectivity. Over time and with continued rainfall, the thousands of reservoirs promote hydrological connectivity by lamination of the flood wave...|$|E

Under {{the provisions of}} the Primary Producers' Co-operative Associations Act 1923, in order to continue to use the word [...] "co-operative", the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Company Ltd was de-registered under the Companies Act 1863 to 1913, and in February 1925 was re-registered under the 1923 Act as the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd. In the same year the PCD erected its own cold stores at Gladstone, with storage capacity for 150 tons of butter. This obviated the heavy costs of railage to Brisbane, as well as Brisbane cold storage charges, and reduced <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> quality during <b>transit</b> to Brisbane. As a consequence, a higher grade of export butter, and direct overseas shipment of butter from Gladstone, were made possible. The installation of coldstores at the PCD's Gladstone factory had important long-term effects for the Port of Gladstone, where butter formed the staple export from 1926 to 1934, prior to the first chilled beef (distinct from frozen beef) being exported in 1935.|$|R
50|$|Abandonment {{occurs when}} the insured surrenders to the insurer all rights to damaged or lost {{property}} and claims payment for a total loss. Sometimes, this is permitted only when damage constitutes constructive total <b>loss.</b> <b>In</b> marine insurance parlance, abandonment involves the surrender of a ship or goods to the insurer, who becomes the abandonee. Abandonment can also mean refusal to accept from a delivering carrier a shipment so damaged <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> as to be worthless.|$|R
25|$|EGYPT: Responding to a {{directive}} from Augustus, the prefectures Aegypti, Aelius Gallus (no relation to his predecessor, Cornelius Gallus) leads an expedition across the Red Sea against the Sabaeans of Arabia Felix (mod. Yemen). The key attraction {{was that this}} region produced aromatic substances such as frankincense and myrrh, which were greatly prized in Rome. In addition, occupation of Sabaea would give the Romans control of {{both sides of the}} entrance to the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, since Cornelius Gallus had established a garrison at Arsinoe (near Assab, Eritrea) on the Ethiopian shore. The expedition consists of 10,000 troops including allies, and 130 freight-ships. Gallus was counting on the assistance of the Nabataean Arabs of NW Arabia, whose king Obodas was a Roman ally and contributed 1,000 warriors under his chief secretary, Syllabus. But the latter allegedly sabotaged the mission throughout with poor advice. The force sails by ship from Clysma (Suez, Egypt) to Luke Come (prob. Sharmah, Hijaz, NW Saudi Arabia) but suffers heavy <b>losses</b> to storms <b>in</b> <b>transit,</b> so that on arrival, Gallus is forced {{to spend the rest of}} the year at Lake Come to give his men a chance to recuperate and to effect repairs to his fleet.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- H. 264 /AVC, {{the latest}} video Codec {{standard}} {{is the most}} popular among Video professionals owing to its exact and unambiguous guidelines for dealing with the input stream to be transported from one place to another, having minimum <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the <b>transit</b> and a very good compression ratio, both attributes highly sought after in today’s world of high quality multimedia broadcast and reception. Another parameter is the bit rate with which the data has to be transmitted. This paper is an attempt to show how various input parameters affect the output of the H. 264 Codec. The input video file is a. yuv file, which after encoding becomes a. 264 file, which is also called a stream file because this file has to be sent as a stream to various locations owing to its small size. At the receiving end, this stream file is decoded back into. yuv file. In the entire process, there is some <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the quality of the video transmitted. This loss has to be minimum and is indicated by a parameter called PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio). Apart from PSNR, there are some other parameters as well like sequence parameter set, picture parameter set, information about different frames as regards slices and macroblocks, all ensconced in different files. PSNR being an important parameter will be dealt with here. There are three different input profiles namely, baseline profile, main profile and extended profile for H. 264. In this work, variation of bit rate versus PSNR is studied in all the three profiles. A higher PSNR for a given constant bit rate is rated as a better performance. Here, the input sequence is a yuv file (foreman_part_qcif. yuv) with one reference frame. The quantization parameter for the I, B and P slices has been set at 30. The PSNR is plotted against bit rate and it is observed that they show a striking similarity with each other...|$|R

40|$|This work proposes an {{analytical}} model {{to characterize the}} performance of a loss-free transmission strategy for Optical Burst and Packet Switched Networks, which ensures that a burst/packet will successfully reach its destination once it has been scheduled in the first link of its path. In this paper this strategy is called Sent-But-Sure (SBS) because it avoids <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> any intermediate node. The SBS strategy combines a routing and wavelength assignment scheme with simple contention resolution mechanisms. As a result, new burst/packet allocation attempts in an intermediate node only contend with bursts/packets <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> coming from a single input link. Moreover, bursts/packets <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> always have priority over bursts/packets whose transmission has not been scheduled yet. These two main features of the SBS strategy allow us to develop {{an analytical}} model based on a twopriority M/G/ 1 queueing model to characterize the network performance.

50|$|A {{letter of}} credit or LC can also {{be the source of}} payment for a transaction, meaning that redeeming the {{letter of credit}} will pay an exporter. Letters of credit are used {{primarily}} in international trade transactions of significant value, for deals between a supplier in one country and a customer in another. They are also used in the land development process to ensure that approved public facilities (streets, sidewalks, stormwater ponds, etc.) will be built. The parties to a letter of credit are usually a beneficiary who is to receive the money, the issuing bank of whom the applicant is a client, and the advising bank of whom the beneficiary is a client. Almost all letters of credit are irrevocable, i.e., cannot be amended or canceled without prior agreement of the beneficiary, the issuing bank and the confirming bank, if any. In executing a transaction, letters of credit incorporate functions common to giros and traveler's cheque. Typically, the documents a beneficiary has to present in order to receive payment include a commercial invoice, bill of lading, and a document proving the shipment was insured against <b>loss</b> or damage <b>in</b> <b>transit.</b> However, the list and form of documents is open to imagination and negotiation and might contain requirements to present documents issued by a neutral third party evidencing the quality of the goods shipped, or their place of origin.|$|R
