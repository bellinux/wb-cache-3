5|$|The {{forests and}} meadows of Bryce Canyon provide the habitat to support diverse animal life {{including}} foxes, badgers, porcupines, elk, black bears, bobcats, and woodpeckers. Mule deer {{are the most}} common <b>large</b> <b>mammals</b> in the park. Elk and pronghorn, which have been reintroduced nearby, sometimes venture into the park.|$|E

Around 25% of the <b>large</b> <b>mammal</b> species {{discovered at}} the site are now currently extinct.|$|R
50|$|Protracted {{poaching}} led {{to serious}} depletion of all <b>larger</b> <b>mammal</b> populations prior to 2011. With {{the involvement of}} the Kasanka Trust in park management, improved law-enforcement efforts have been possible since 2011. These seem to have already lead to significant recovery of several <b>large</b> <b>mammal</b> species. Densities however are still very low. The only ungulates which are currently fairly common are Common Duiker, Reedbuck and Sable. There are small herds of Puku. The most common (diurnal) <b>large</b> <b>mammal</b> probably is the Kinda Baboon. Warthog are also frequently sighted.|$|R
5|$|Writing in 1988, naturalist J. Whitfield Gibbons {{asserted}} that {{awareness of the}} conservation needs of reptiles had lagged that of <b>large</b> <b>mammals</b> and game species.

5|$|After {{the last}} ice age only <b>large</b> <b>mammals</b> such as mammoths, bison and woolly {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from {{the northern part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are <b>large</b> <b>mammals</b> of {{the family}} Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Three species are {{currently}} recognized: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the {{vicinity}} of Roxy Ann Peak for the past 8,000 to 10,000 years. The first inhabitants were semi-nomadic, most likely living off edible bulbs and <b>large</b> <b>mammals</b> such as mastodons and giant bison. Within the last millennium, the region became home to the Latgawa Native American tribe, who called the peak Al-wiya. They probably used the mountain for gathering acorns and hunting black-tailed deer and small birds, animals which are still abundant there.|$|E
5|$|Ordinarily, spinner sharks do {{not pose}} a {{substantial}} danger to humans; they do not perceive <b>large</b> <b>mammals</b> as prey, as their small, narrow teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting. However, they can become excited {{by the presence of}} food, so caution is warranted if this species is encountered while spearfishing. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed 16 unprovoked attacks and one provoked attack attributable to the spinner shark, none of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|The Laguna Canyon area {{supports}} {{a variety of}} native Southern California wildlife, including <b>large</b> <b>mammals</b> such as mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes and mule deer. Like Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park to the south, the canyon supports over one hundred species of birds. Some of its endangered species include California gnatcatcher, cactus wren, and orange-throated whiptail. Except for the Laguna Lakes, the canyon has no fish habitat, and riparian habitat is sparse because the local creeks have only seasonal flow.|$|E

5|$|The end of {{the rapid}} growth phase {{suggests}} the onset of sexual maturity in Albertosaurus, although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals' lives. Sexual maturation while still actively growing {{appears to be a}} shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in <b>large</b> <b>mammals,</b> such as humans and elephants. This pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds, which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing.|$|E
5|$|The loss {{of species}} from {{ecological}} communities, defaunation, is primarily driven by human activity. This has resulted in empty forests, ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates. In the Quaternary extinction event, the mass die-off of megafaunal variety coincided {{with the appearance of}} humans, suggesting a human influence. One hypothesis is that humans hunted <b>large</b> <b>mammals,</b> such as the woolly mammoth, into extinction.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the finest megafauna wildlife habitat in the lower 48 states. There are almost 60 species of mammals in the park, including the gray wolf, coyote, the threatened Canadian lynx, and grizzly bears.

5|$|A few species, {{specifically}} the common, white-winged, and hairy-legged vampire bats, exclusively consume animal blood (hematophagy). The common vampire bat typically feeds on <b>large</b> <b>mammals</b> such as cattle, while the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds instead. Vampire bats target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing. Heat sensors {{in the nose}} help them to detect blood vessels near {{the surface of the}} skin. They pierce the animal's skin with their teeth, biting away a small flap, and lap up the blood with their tongues, which have lateral grooves adapted to this purpose. The blood is kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} will occasionally prey on <b>large</b> <b>mammals,</b> such as deer, {{but will}} usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, American alligators {{have been observed}} killing and eating bobcats, but such events are not common and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although American alligators have been listed as predators of West Indian manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, American alligators have been recorded preying on them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and <b>large</b> <b>mammals.</b> Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation {{near the end of the}} nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to mid-twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Elk (also {{known as}} wapiti), mule deer, and {{pronghorn}} (also called pronghorn antelope) {{are some of}} the most commonly seen <b>large</b> <b>mammals.</b> During winter, pronghorn that spend the summer in the Sawtooth Valley migrate south to the lower elevations on the Snake River Plain, and some sections of the forest are closed to motorized use to protect the elk winter range. Bighorn sheep are rare sights in the forest, but the forest contains one-third of Idaho's mountain goat population, and they are commonly seen at high elevations in the Boulder, White Cloud, Pioneer, and Sawtooth mountains. Other mammals in the forest include the coyote, moose, bobcat, beaver, yellow-bellied marmot, pika, and badger.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for food {{on dry land}} at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows <b>large</b> <b>mammals</b> such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park {{has almost}} all its {{original}} native {{plant and animal}} species. <b>Large</b> <b>mammals</b> such as Grizzly bears, moose, and mountain goats, as well as rare or endangered species like wolverines and Canadian lynxes, inhabit the park. Hundreds of species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species, and a few reptile and amphibian species have been documented. The park has numerous ecosystems ranging from prairie to tundra. Notably, the easternmost forests of western redcedar and hemlock grow in the southwest portion of the park. Large forest fires are uncommon in the park. However, in 2003 over 13% of the park burned.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Like {{elsewhere}} in West Africa, the landscapes of Sierra Leone are strongly human-dominated with consequences for <b>large</b> <b>mammal</b> distribution and diversity. Sierra Leone is currently {{going through a}} phase of post-war recovery, with accelerating devel-opment of the mining, forestry, agricultural and infrastructure sectors. As environmental issues are increasingly considered, comprehensive biodiversity information is required. Here we evaluate spatial patterns of <b>large</b> <b>mammal</b> diversity throughout Sierra Leone to make inferences about species persistence. We used systematic line transect sampling for assessing <b>large</b> <b>mammal</b> distribution. GLMs and canonical correspondence analyses were {{used to evaluate the}} relative importance of human impact for every species while con-trolling for environmental gradients and to make countrywide spatial model predictions. We further developed an algorithm to identify core distributional ranges for the most common species. A total of 562 km of transects were surveyed and 35 <b>large</b> <b>mammal</b> species encountered. Species diversity was impoverished in the country’s south and center and strongly increased towards the north and east.
