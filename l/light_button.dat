5000|$|Scuderia Ferrari, a Formula One racing team, {{formerly}} used {{a traffic}} light system during their pit stops to signal to their drivers to when to leave the pits. The red light was on when the tires were being changed and fuel was being added, yellow was on when the tires were changed, and green was on when all work was completed. The system is (usually) completely automatic. However, the system was withdrawn after the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, {{due to the fact}} that it heavily delayed Felipe Massa during the race, when he was in the lead. Usually, the system was automatic, but heavy traffic in the pit lane forced the team to operate it manually. A mechanic accidentally pressed the green <b>light</b> <b>button</b> when the fuel hose was still attached to the car, causing Massa to drive off, towing the fuel hose along. Additionally, Massa drove into the path of Adrian Sutil, earning him a penalty. He finally stopped at the end of the pit lane, forcing Ferrari's mechanics to sprint down the whole of the pit lane to remove the hose. As a result of this, and the penalty he also incurred, Massa finished 13th. Ferrari decided to use a traditional [...] "lollipop" [...] for the remainder of the 2008 season.|$|E

40|$|The {{medium of}} {{computer}} graphics provides a capability {{for dealing with}} pictures in man-machine communication. Graph Theory is used to model relationships which are represented by pictures and is therefore an appropriate discipline {{for the application of}} an interactive computer graphics system. Previous efforts to solve Graph Theoretic problems by computer have usually involved specialized programs written in a symbolic assembly language or algebraic compiler language. In recent years, graphics equipment with processing power has been commercially available for use as a remote terminal to a large central computer. Although these terminals typically include a small general purpose computer, the potential of using one as programmable subsystem has received little attention. These motivations have led to the design and implementation of an interactive graphics system for solving Graph Theoretic problems. The system operates on an IBM 7040 with a DEC- 338 graphics terminal connected by voice-grade telephone line. To provide effective response times, computing power is appropriately divided between the two machines. The remote computer graphics terminal is controlled by a special-purpose executive program. This executive includes an interpreter of a command language oriented towards the control of existence and display of graphs. Several interactive functions such as graph drawing and editing are available to a user through <b>light</b> <b>button</b> and pushbutton selection. These functions which are local to the terminal are programmed in a mixture of the terminal computer 2 ̆ 7 s machine language and the interpreted command language. For more significant computational requirements the central computer is used, but response time for interactive operation is then diminished. In order to overcome the speed of the telephone link, the central computer may call upon a program at the terminal as a subroutine. Based on the mathematical terminology used to define graphs, a high level language was developed for the specification of interactive algorithms. A growing library of these algorithms provides routines to aid in the construction and recognition of various types of graphs. Other routines are used for computing certain properties of graphs. Graphs may be transformed by some routines with respect to both connectivity and layout. Any number of graphs my be saved and later restored. A programmer using the terminal as an alphanumeric console may call upon the programming features of the system to develop new interactive algorithms and add them to the library. Programs may also be created for the display terminal, using the central computer for assembly. Examples of system use which are presented include finding a shortest path between any pair of vertices in a weighted directed graph, determining the maximally complete subgraphs of an arbitrary graph, interpreting a graph as a Mealy model of a finite state machine, and laying out a tree for aesthetic presentation...|$|E

40|$|Background: Motor {{skills can}} be learned {{explicitly}} (dependent on working memory (WM)) or implicitly (relatively independent of WM). Children born very preterm (VPT) often have working memory deficits. Explicit learning may be compromised in these children. Aims: This study investigated implicit and explicit motor learning {{and the role of}} working memory in VPT children and controls. Methods: Three groups (6 – 9 years) participated: 20 VPT children with motor problems, 20 VPT children without motor problems, and 20 controls. A nine button sequence was learned implicitly (pressing the <b>lighted</b> <b>button</b> as quickly as possible) and explicitly (discovering the sequence via trial-and-error). Results: Children learned implicitly and explicitly, evidenced by decreased movement duration of the sequence over time. In the explicit condition, children also reduced the number of errors over time. Controls made more errors than VPT children without motor problems. Visual WM had positive effects on both explicit and implicit performance. Conclusion: VPT birth and low motor proficiency did not negatively affect implicit or explicit learning. Visual WM was positively related to both implicit and explicit performance, but did not influence learning curves. These findings question the theoretical difference between implicit and explicit learning and the proposed role of visual WM therein...|$|R
