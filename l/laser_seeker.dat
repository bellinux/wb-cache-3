25|$|Based on an air-to-air missile, the beam-riding Kh-66 {{had been}} the Soviet Union's first {{air-to-ground}} missile for tactical aircraft, entering service in 1968. However it proved difficult to use in practice as the launch aircraft had to dive towards the target. A version with radio-command guidance, the Kh-23, was first tested in 1968 but problems with the guidance system meant {{that it would not}} enter service for another five years. So in 1971 work began on a version with a semi-active <b>laser</b> <b>seeker,</b> which became the Kh-25. This was initially known in the West as the Kh-23L. State testing began on 24 November 1974, and the Kh-25 entered production in 1975.|$|E
2500|$|The missile was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} an evolution of the original laser AGM-114 Hellfire, with the <b>laser</b> <b>seeker</b> replaced by a millimetre wave (mmW) seeker.

40|$|Abstract—To {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} high repetition frequency laser jamming on <b>laser</b> <b>seeker’s</b> distinguishing and locking stage for decoding process, two models are built to quantitatively study the jamming effect under the different coding systems, one is normalized cross-correlation function model, the other is jamming efficiency model. The simulation result indicates that, at the stage of code distinguishing, the jamming frequency is a dominant factor in affecting the jamming effect; The effect of high repetition frequency <b>laser</b> jamming <b>seeker</b> under the different coding system is different; The greater the seeker sampling interval is, the better the effect is. At the stage of code locking, the leading time of high repetition frequency laser to guidance signal {{is an important factor}} in affecting the jamming efficiency; The higher the jamming frequency and the wider the time gate’s width is, the higher the average efficiency of interference is. High repetition frequency laser can completely jam the decoding process of the two stages when the laser frequency is high enough.

50|$|Experience during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom led US {{air power}} {{planners}} to seek additional capabilities in one package, resulting in ongoing program upgrades {{to place a}} precision terminal guidance seeker in the JDAM kit. The Laser JDAM (LJDAM), as this upgrade is known, adds a <b>laser</b> <b>seeker</b> to the nose of a JDAM-equipped bomb, giving the ability to engage moving targets to the JDAM. The <b>Laser</b> <b>Seeker</b> is a cooperative development between Boeing's Defense, Space and Security unit and Israel's Elbit Systems. It is called Precision Laser Guidance Set (PLGS) by Boeing and consists of the <b>Laser</b> <b>Seeker</b> itself, now known as DSU-38/B, and a wire harness fixed under the bomb body to connect the DSU-38/B with the tail kit. During FY2004, Boeing and the U.S. Air Force began testing of the laser guidance capability for JDAM, with these tests demonstrating {{that the system is}} capable of targeting and destroying moving targets. This dual guidance system retains the ability to operate on GPS/INS alone, if laser guidance is unavailable, with the same accuracy of the earlier JDAM.|$|E
50|$|Bina (بینا) is an Iranian laser guided dual-capability surface-to-surface and air-to-surface missile.

50|$|On June 11, 2007, Boeing {{announced}} {{that it had been}} awarded a $28 million contract by the U.S. Air Force to deliver 600 <b>laser</b> <b>seekers</b> (400 to the Air Force and 200 to the Navy) by June 2009. According to the Boeing Corporation, in tests at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcons and F-15E Strike Eagles dropped twelve 500 lb LJDAMs that successfully struck high-speed moving targets. Using onboard targeting equipment, the launch aircraft self-designated, and self-guided their bombs to impact on the targets. In addition to the LJDAM kits, Boeing is also testing under a Navy development contract, an anti-jamming system for the JDAM, with development expected to be completed during 2007, with deliveries to commence in 2008. The system is known as the Integrated GPS Anti-Jam System (IGAS).|$|R

50|$|In 70 {{months of}} {{production}} from 2008 to early February 2014, Raytheon delivered 2,000 Griffin missiles. In late February 2014, Raytheon demonstrated the improved Griffin Block III missile, hitting static and moving targets. The Block III includes an improved semi-active <b>laser</b> <b>seeker</b> with better electronics and signal processing {{and a new}} Multi-Effects Warhead System to maximize lethality against different targets.|$|E
50|$|Raytheon {{developed}} Griffin as {{a low-cost}} modular system, using components from earlier projects, including the FGM-148 Javelin and the AIM-9X Sidewinder. It was {{originally designed to}} be launched from the US Special Operations Command's MC-130W Dragon Spear gunship and can be guided either by a semi-active <b>laser</b> <b>seeker</b> or with GPS. Its precision combined with a relatively small 5.9 kg warhead reduces collateral damage.|$|E
50|$|Such {{tracking}} radars {{can also be}} used to predict the range error of individual rockets. Trajectory correcting munitions may then benefit from this, as a directional radio may send a coded message to the rocket to deploy air brakes just at the right time to correct most of the range error. This requires that the rockets were originally aimed too far, as the range can only be shortened by the air brakes, not extended.A more sophisticated system makes use of radar data and one-way radio datalink to initiate a two dimensional (range and azimuth) correction of the rocket's flight path with steering by fins or nose thrusters. The latter is more common with systems which can be used to upgrade old rockets and the Israeli Accular is an example.Fin-stabilised rockets also allow for easy course corrections using rudders or minute charges. Guided munitions have been introduced to exploit this. Guidance principles such as GPS satellite navigation, inertial navigation system and semi-active <b>laser</b> <b>seekers</b> are used for this. This improves dispersion from a CEP of hundreds of metres at dozens of kilometers range to just a few meters, and (except for INS, as INS navigation creates a small dispersion that's about proportional to range) largely independent of the range of the shot. This in turn made great increases of rocket (or missile) ranges useful; previously dispersion had made rockets too inefficient and often too dangerous to friendly troops at long ranges.Long range MRL missiles often fly a higher quasiballistic trajectory than shorter ranged rockets and pose thus a deconfliction challenge, as they might collide with friendly aircraft in the air.|$|R
50|$|Q-5D: Interim attack {{aircraft}} introduced {{during the}} 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the separate doppler navigation system and GPS of the Q-5C {{was replaced by}} the DG-1 integrated doppler navigation/GPS system.

A new weapon aiming sight, the SH-1II (射轰-1乙), replaced the older SH-1I (射轰-1甲), and No. 5311 Factory managed to successfully integrate this sight with the new laser rangefinder and Type 205 navigation radar.|$|R
50|$|Cirit is a next {{generation}} 70 mm (2.75 in) guided rocket system {{fitted with a}} semi-active <b>laser</b> homing <b>seeker.</b> The seeker and guidance section {{is attached to a}} purpose-built warhead with a Class 5 Insensitive Munition (IM). The multipurpose warhead has a combined armour-piercing ammunition with enhanced behind armor anti-personnel and incendiary effects. The engine is of reduced smoke design, with IM properties. It is connected to the rear section by a roll bearing that enables it to rotate in flight. There are four small stabilising surfaces at the very rear of the missile in front of the exhaust nozzle that ensures stable flight. Roketsan has developed a new launch pod and a new canister in which Cirit is delivered as an all-up round. The Cirit has a maximum effective guided range of 8 km with a high probability of hit on a 3×3 m target at this range.|$|R

25|$|Lockheed Martin {{successfully}} {{conducted the}} first test flight of a prototype NetFires Loitering Attack Missile (LAM) at Eglin Air Force Base, on 11 November 2002. The LAM vertically launched flawlessly, transitioned to stable flight and performed several maneuvers during the short flight test. Test objectives were successfully achieved. The Lockheed Martin-designed LAM was flown without a <b>Laser</b> Radar (LADAR) <b>seeker</b> or warhead. A solid rocket motor vertically launched the , 100-pound missile from a closed breach canister mounted in a Lockheed Martin prototype launcher. Control surfaces and a pivoting wing deployed as planned as the missile began its programmed assent-phase roll and pitch maneuver. Protective covers on the forward dome, scoring camera and turbojet inlet were ejected properly and engine start sequence began as scheduled. Turbojet ignition sequence completed approximately five seconds after launch, and the engine came up to speed as the prototype approached apogee. For the next eight minutes, the LAM prototype executed preprogrammed maneuvers over the Eglin test range, demonstrating impressive stability and validating aerodynamic performance, navigation and autopilot performance design parameters.|$|R
