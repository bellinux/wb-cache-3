50|$|Damselfly nymphs are aquatic, and prey {{on small}} aquatic insects or other aquatic larvae. The adult damselflies prey on small flying insects, caught using their <b>legs</b> like a <b>basket</b> to scoop the prey up while flying, or insects taken from leaves.|$|R
60|$|Six {{strips of}} blanket were wound round Madame Duchesne {{as she lay}} on the hand-barrow; one was across her {{forehead}} so as to prevent her head from dropping forward, one was under the arms, and two more round the body, {{the other two were}} over her <b>legs.</b> The <b>baskets</b> and other things had been taken from the barrow. It was now lifted on to one end {{to see if there was}} any sign of the body slipping. However, it remained firm in its upright position. The blankets had already been knotted by Nat, whose training enabled him to fasten them so securely that there was no risk of their slipping. Then he ascended to the top of the steps and took his place on the little platform on which the bushes were growing.|$|R
5|$|The thorax {{has three}} segments, {{each with a}} pair of robust legs, and a pair of {{membranous}} wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae, and in many species the hind <b>legs</b> bear pollen <b>baskets,</b> flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing. The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting.|$|R
5000|$|While Post was {{focusing}} on painting maps and landscapes, Eckhout made pieces about the inhabitants and still lifes with fruits and vegetables. His work {{is said to}} give the first realistic image of the native population, part of the Tupi and Tapuia tribes. One of his famous works is of a calmly composed Tupian woman, who holds a human hand and has a human <b>leg</b> in her <b>basket,</b> an example of cannibalism. The Tapuya dance, performed by eight Tapuia Indians with their characteristic mushroom hair style, cudgels and spears, deals with the preparation for the confrontation with the enemy. This picture was much more {{in accordance with the}} mental image of the natives back in Europe.|$|R
500|$|Phaeacius {{is unusually}} {{sedentary}} for a jumping spider, generally {{resting in the}} flattened pose for hours or days on logs, pieces of wood or any other solid surface, and captures particular types of prey more often when the predator matches this background. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body or legs. However, if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly, driving its body upward [...] and forward about half the length of its body. The lunge ends with the spider's fangs in the prey and often with the foremost two pairs of <b>legs</b> forming a <b>basket</b> over the prey. When the prey stops struggling, Phaeacius resumes the flattened pose and then feeds.|$|R
50|$|The bee {{ranges from}} Montana and South Dakota to New Mexico, west to California and north to Oregon, and often inhabits meadows and gardens. The bee is black, but covered by golden/yellow hair on its face, behind its eyes, on its thorax, below its wings (which are blackish) {{and on its}} <b>legs.</b> The pollen <b>basket</b> of the species is located under its abdomen. As often found with most bees, Megachile fidelis feeds on the nectar of flowers - {{particularly}} the nectar of composite flowers. The nests of M. fidelis are created in {{almost exactly the same}} fashion as, M. perihirta, the Western Leafcutting Bee. However, adult bees do not leave their brood cells until all the cells between their cell {{and the end of the}} tunnel have been vacated. As with the case of many bees, larva grow extremely rapidly when in their brood cells. It is often found that this species of bee leave their nests around spring.|$|R
40|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century, {{representations}} of taverns and inns increased in both prominence and number within the visual art of northern Europe. From Hieronymus Bosch to Pieter Bruegel, painters and designers of prints made images employing taverns and inns as {{the setting for}} religious and secular subjects. Bosch’s panel painting of a traveling merchant, variously titled the Wayfarer, Peddler, and the Prodigal Son, from ca. 1510), includes {{one of the earliest}} renderings of the tavern or inn in European art. Traditional interpretations of the work’s subject as the Prodigal Son underscore the religious and moralizing meanings both painting and inn have held within the discipline of art history. The Prodigal Son “wasting his substance in riotous living” (Luke 15 : 13) undoubtedly offered fuel for visual thought in such imagery. In Bosch’s painting. the man with tattered clothing, bandaged <b>leg,</b> and <b>basket</b> on back walks to the right while looking back over his shoulder toward the inn, with what may be longing, even regret. Bosch’s inn stands in a partial state of disrepair. The roof and windows are riddled with holes and one window shutter hangs precariously from a hinge. Art historians have interpreted Bosch’s inn as an emblem of moral degeneration based on its physical decay, yet the fabric of the building appears intact. In the doorway of the inn the man fondling the breast of the woman and the man urinating around the comer support the moralizing interpretation. In addition, the pigs eating from the trough in front of the doorway appear to identify the man at the center of Bosch’s painting as the Prodigal Son—seen, for example, in Albrecht Dürer’s engraving of the subject from ca. 1496. Art historians have, in sum, viewed the tavern—and its more ambitious counterpart, the inn—within sixteenth-century Northern art as a locus of negative behavior whose representation elicited a moralizing interpretation from the viewer. This essay expands this traditional moralizing and negative approach to public houses by investigating images of taverns designed by Sebald Beham, a pupil of Dürer in Germany. Published in Beham’s home town of Nuremberg between 1528 and 1535 as woodcut prints, the works have as their subject kermis (Kirchweih), which was centered around a tavern or inn in the sixteenth century. Kermis was the most popular peasant festival during the late Middle Ages and Reformation period, and it celebrated the anniversary of either a church’s consecration or saint’s day. In Beham’s kermis images, the exterior of a tavern provides the setting for celebrating by peasants and a few members of other social classes. In this essay, Beham’s Large Kermis woodcut (Figure 2), the physically largest and most complex example of the theme, will be explored for the variety of meanings and associations the tavern held in sixteenth-century Germany and that reach beyond art history’s traditional moralizing approach. I argue that art historians need to consider a wider range of sources and associations when considering the tavern, including those relating to eating and drinking, social gatherings, and peasant festivals. Only then will tavern and kermis be viewed neutrally if not joyously...|$|R
