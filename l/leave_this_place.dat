The lyrics follow the course of Madonna's rise from figuratively being a [...] "hungry sibling" [...] ("I'm gonna <b>leave</b> <b>this</b> <b>place,</b> So I can forget every single hungry face") to being a superstar ("I hit the big time but I still get the blues, Everyone's a stranger, City life can get to you").|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{at a press}} {{briefing}} in Sandton after the confrontation, AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa said management had reneged on commitments it had made to miners earlier in the week, claiming the shootings {{could have been avoided}} if management made good on their commitments to workers.
