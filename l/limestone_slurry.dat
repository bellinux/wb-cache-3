40|$|EN] The {{effect of}} {{different}} additives on the re-emission of Hg 0 in wet limestone-based flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) conditions is assessed. Because re-emission of elemental mercury from <b>limestone</b> <b>slurries</b> {{is dependent on}} the pH of the gypsum slurry, re-emission of elemental mercury was evaluated for different additives using gypsum slurry with a constant pH value of 7. The additives investigated included oxidizing and reducing agents (Fenton reagents and sodium thiosulfate) and also chelating agents (2, 4, 6 trimercaptotriazine trisodium and sodium hydrosulfide). Fenton reagents were added to prevent the reduction of oxidized mercury species as H 2 O 2 was the precursor used to convert sulfite ions into sulfate or to oxidize Hg 0. Thiosulfate were added so that mercury could be retained in the gypsum at low concentrations as insoluble HgS, while mercury is being stabilized in the liquid fraction at higher additive doses. The addition of 2, 4, 6 trimercaptotriazine trisodium (TMT) and NaHS in low doses prevented the reduction of oxidized mercury species as insoluble HgS and Hg 3 (TMT) precipitate onto the gypsum slurry. TMT was found to be most effective additive for Hg 2 + capture. This work was financed by the projects CTM 2011 - 22921 and PI Programme (CSIC) (Ref. PI- 200780 I 008). R. O.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{model for the}} stability of paste was proposed and an experimental system, HYdroStatic Pressure Test (HYSPT), was developed for detecting the sedimentation of fresh cement paste. By accurate measurements of the hydrostatic pressure, p, at a depth h and time t, both sedimentation rate and state of flocculation are assessed from pressure drop vs. time curves (dp/dt). Material parameters like solid fraction, water reducer, VMA and limestone replacement were studied with HYSPT. For normal cement paste with high solid fraction (Φ), as Φ increases (w/c = 0. 7 – 0. 4), the sedimentation is speeded up. Dispersion of the particles by water reducers has a clear effect of slowing down the movement and producing less clear sedimentation plateau pressures. This effect is clearer for <b>limestone</b> <b>slurries</b> of varying Φ than for cement pastes, so cement needs more SP than limestone filler to be dispersed and behave according to the Richardson-Zaki equation. At 40 % limestone replacement (causing increase of w/c from 0. 5 to 0. 835 to keep  constant) 0. 6 % SP stabilized slightly better when added as mass fraction of powder than when added as mass fraction of cement. Thus, limestone gave improved stability at higher total SP content and w/c. VMA enhanced stabilization only when combined with water reducer.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The definition, history and applications of Microfiltration (MP) are briefly reviewed in Chapter 1. The physical mechanisms and mathematical models of the filtration process including concentration polarization (CP), gel polarization (GP) and pore blocking are given in Chapter 2. Crossflow microfiltration membrane fouling and the deposition of solids onto the filter surface have been investigated using a process fluid (seawater), latex and a ground mineral. The performance of various membrane materials has also been studied, including: acrylonitrile, polypropylene, PTFE, ceramic and stainless steel. The seawater filtration work showed in Chapter 3 that good filtrate flux rates can be maintained if material fouling or depositing on the membrane can be prevented from entering the membrane structure. A surface deposit may be removed by mechanical means such as backflushing with permeate or compressed air. This aspect of the work indicated that a more comprehensive study of fouling was required. Existing crossflow filtration membrane models did not adequately represent even the simplest filtration when penetration of the membrane structure applied. Such conditions occurred during latex filtration in Chapter 4. Latex of varying sizes and density were manufactured and filtrations using acrylonitrile membranes were performed. Considerable deposition of latex inside the membrane pores occurred despite the nominal rating of the membrane being less than the latex particle diameter. Thus the membranes relied on a depth filtration mechanism rather than a surface straining mechanism for filtration effectiveness. A standard filtration blocking model was modified for use in crossflow microfiltration, coupled with a mass balance {{on the amount of}} material filtered. This mathematical model was then used to predict and correlate the rate of filtration flux decay with respect to filtration time during crossflow filtration. The model provided acceptable accuracy and is an improvement on existing empirical models for the flux decay period. Under the circumstances of membrane penetration it is advisable to minimise the amount of material entering the membrane structure. Mechanical means to achieve this were investigated and a novel anti-fouling method using a centrifugal field force and enhanced shear stress at the membrane surface was developed. The filtration of <b>limestone</b> <b>slurries</b> with three different tubular filters are presented in Chapter 5, in which one filter was conventional, the other two novel ones were specially designed for the separation of particles with a density {{different from that of the}} liquid, one used a helical channel around the filter, and the other had tangential inlet and outlet endcaps. The centrifugal force produced by the spinning flow around these two filters retarded the approach of particles towards the membrane surface so that the particle deposition was reduced.

Multicycle absorption and regeneration tests showed that plaster-based pellets out performed the limestone-based pellets primarily due to a higher surface area and mesoporosity.;The effect of pore-modifiers on the {{reactivity of}} limestone with H 2 S was investigated by incorporating additives such as cornstarch, graphite and polyvinylalcohol (PVA) in the sorbent. Multicycle sulfidation and regeneration tests of the modified sorbent showed that starch did not improve the reactivity of the limestone, graphite reduced the reactivity, while PVA improved it.;The effect of the chemical additives MgO and SrO on the performance of CaO-based sorbent pellets was investigated. The effect of MgO was tested by starting with materials that contained MgCO 3 in a natural form, such as dolomite. The effect of SrO was tested by starting with SrCO 3 either co-precipitated with CaCO 3 or by wet-mixing SrCO 3 with <b>limestone</b> in <b>slurry</b> form. The MgO was found to improve the thermal stability of the CaO-based sorbent but lowered the overall absorption capacity of the material when reacted with CO 2 or H 2 S, while SrO decreased the thermal stability of the sorbent when it was reacted with CO 2; no absorption tests were run with H 2 S.;A study of the performance of pelletized CaO-based cores coated with a refractory material such as alumina and limestone or alumina and kaolin was conducted.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. A {{great deal}} of {{research}} effort has been undertaken to find an effective {{solution to the problem}} of acid mine drainage. Indeed, South African legislation requires mining companies to respect environmental regulations by minimising water intake from local municipalities and providing a rehabilitation plan. In order for the South African mining industry to remain competitive, the proposed solutions have to be not only efficient but also economic. This is the reason for the use of a waste material being attractive for water treatment and an integrated treatment technology being developed to treat water to different quality levels. The main objectives of this study were to develop more cost-effective treatment processes specific to the needs of the mining industry in southern Africa and to investigate the technical and environmental feasibility of utilising an alkaline waste product from the local paper industry as stabilising agent for acid mine residues. All the research and development work was carried out on laboratory and pilot scale plants. Five papers, with the present author as principal contributor, will form the basis of this thesis, of which one has been published and four are being peer reviewed, presented at international conferences (locally and overseas) and published in the proceedings of the various conferences. Another five papers, with the author as co-author, have also been presented at international conferences and are being published in the proceedings of these conferences, and are included in this thesis. The results of the laboratory and pilot scale studies have been incorporated into the design and implementation of the following full-scale plants: •	A limestone handling and dosing system to supply <b>slurried</b> <b>limestone</b> of constant density to the neutralisation plant was constructed and commissioned during 2001 at Navigation Section of Landau Colliery, Witbank • A limestone handling and dosing system, including a fluidised-bed limestone neutralisation plant, was constructed and commissioned during 2001, at Ticor, Empangeni •	An iron(II) -oxidation and fluidised-bed limestone neutralisation plant was constructed and commissioned during 2002 at BCL, Selebi-Phikwe, Botswana • A limestone handling and dosing system, to supply <b>slurried</b> <b>limestone</b> of constant density to the neutralisation plant, was constructed and commissioned during 2003, at Kromdraai Colliery, Witbank •	An iron(II) -oxidation and fluidised-bed limestone neutralisation plant was constructed and commissioned during 2004, at the Navigation Section of Landau Colliery, Witbank. These plants consist of specific units (stages) of the completely integrated process, developed by the CS 1 R:Environmentek over the past four years. These stages are: • Heating unit: Production of CaO (quick lime) and C 02 -gas from burned coal and precipitated CaC 03 (limestone) • Limestone neutralisation and partial sulphate removal to a level of 1 900 mg/l • Ca(OH) 2 (hydrated lime) stage: CaO contacted with the acid water to produce Ca(OH) 2 • Lime treatment stage: Partial sulphate removal as CaS 04 (gypsum) to below 1 200 mg/l, and full removal of magnesium and other metals • pH adjustment stage: C 02 from the heating unit applied to reduce the pH to 8. 6 while CaC 03 precipitates • Barium sulphide treatment or biological sulphate removal treatment: Removal of sulphate to below 200 mg/l •	Production (regeneration) of barium sulphide: Heating barium sulphate from the above stage • Stripping of H 2 S either from the barium sulphide or the biological sulphate removal processes.

The results reveal that when the solids concentration of a <b>limestone</b> <b>slurry</b> (75 wt. % or 52. 63 vol. %). At a certain shear rate, the apparent viscosity and the relative viscosity of the slurry increase exponentially with the solids concentration. The extrapolated Bingham yield stress increases in a power- law form with increasing solids concentration when the solids concentration of the slurry is larger than 70 wt. % (i. e., 46. 36 vol. %). The maximum packing solids fraction attainable is predicted as 64. 6 vol. % at the certain limestone-water suspension system. Besides, the smaller the particle size, the more evident the pseudoplastic property of <b>limestone</b> <b>slurry</b> are with a larger yield stress and a larger apparent viscosity at a given shear rate. Furthermore, the apparent viscosity and the extrapolated Bingham decrease with increasing temperature in a range of 20 to 40 oC. Also, wet ultra-fine grinding of a limestone powder (83 vol. %). For a certain level of bead load, an optimal solids concentration exists for more effective grinding.

At a certain shear rate, the apparent viscosity and the relative viscosity of the slurry increase exponentially with solids concentration. The extrapolated Bingham yield stress increases rather sharply in a power-law form with increasing solids concentration when the solids concentration of the slurry is larger than 70 wt. % (i. e., 46. 36 vol. %). An attainable maximum packing solids fraction (phim) is predicted as phim = 64. 6 vol. % at the certain limestone–water suspension system. A polymeric dispersant named Dispersant S 40 with a molecular weight of 5500 appears most effective for {{the reduction of the}} apparent viscosity of <b>limestone</b> <b>slurry</b> due to its good electrosteric stabilization and effective avoidance of depletion flocculation.

In this article the mechanisms affecting the re-emission of oxidized mercury species in WFGD conditions via sulphite ions are discussed. The parameters studied include the operating temperature, the pH, the redox potential, the concentrations of mercury and oxygen in the flue gas and the concentration of reductive ions in the solution. The results show that temperature, pH and the concentration of mercury at the inlet of the WFGD systems are the most important factors affecting oxidized mercury removal. The results indicate that sulphite ions, not only contribute to the reduction of Hg 2 +, but that they may also stabilize the mercury in the liquid fraction of the WFGD <b>limestone</b> <b>slurry.</b> Consequently, factors that increase the sulphite content in the slurry such as a low oxygen concentration promote the co-capture of mercury with sulphur.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of three slurries was tested for treating of acidity caused by pyrite weathering. Slurries of BauxsolTM, powdered limestone, and brucite [Mg(OH) 2] were sprayed onto 10 -ton masses of pyritic aggregate, and the acidity and sulfate concentrations of outflows were monitored for 21. 5 months. After addition in identical procedures, neutralization of the outflow to a pH of above 6 {{was achieved by}} Bauxsol for about 1 day, by limestone for 4 days, and by Mg(OH) 2 for the 652 days of the testing. Limestone control of pH was limited by armoring of the CaCO 3 by gypsum [CaSO 4 ? 2 H 2 O] and by restricting of water flow to channels so that most of this slurry remained unreacted. Channels were not evident in the Mg(OH) 2 -treated aggregate. With the limestone and Mg(OH) 2 slurries, sulfate concentrations were controlled by crystallization of gypsum, or at higher concentration of sulfate by hexahydrite [MgSO 4 ? 6 H 2 O]. The <b>limestone</b> <b>slurry</b> limited sulfate concentration to approximately 25 percent less than that occurring with the Mg(OH) 2 slurry. An ideal slurry might include Mg(OH) 2 for neutralization, limestone for limiting sulfate concentration, and other components to alter rheological behavior. Thixotropic behavior that favors initial dispersion of the slurry solids yet reduces loss in outwash and also limits channelization of water flow is best...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates slurry {{rheology}} {{of industrial}} minerals (limestone and quartzite) {{and its effects}} on wet ultra-fine grinding in order to reduce energy cost, increase the throughput as well as the product fineness. The influences of solid concentration, molecular weight of a dispersant, and particle size and distribution on the rheological behaviour of original limestone slurries have been investigated. The results reveal that when the solid concentration of a <b>limestone</b> <b>slurry</b> (< 100 ¦Ìm) is increased from 60 wt. % (35. 71 vol. %) to 78. 5 wt. % (57. 49 vol. %), the rheological behaviour of the slurry is transformed from a weakly dilatant or Newtonian characteristic to a pseudoplastic one with a yield stress, which is in combination with a thixotropic property at a higher solid concentration (i. e., ¡Ý 75 wt. % or 52. 63 vol. %). At a certain shear rate, the apparent viscosity and the relative viscosity of the slurry both increase exponentially with solid concentration. The extrapolated Casson yield stress increases in a power-law form with increasing solid concentration when the solid concentration is larger than 70 wt. % (i. e., 46. 36 vol. %). The maximum attainable packing solid fraction (m) is predicted as 64. 6 vol. % at the limestone-water suspension. A polymeric dispersant named Dispersant S 40 with a molecular weight of 5, 500 Da appears most efficient for the reduction of the apparent viscosity of <b>limestone</b> <b>slurry.</b> The smaller the particle size and the narrower the size distribution, the more evident the pseudoplastic behaviour of <b>limestone</b> <b>slurry</b> is with a higher yield stress and a larger apparent viscosity at a given shear rate in the range 12 - 1200 s- 1. However, a sufficient addition dosage of Dispersant S 40 significantly decreases or even eliminates the rheological differences of limestone slurries (apparent viscosity and extrapolated yield stress) resulting from differences in particle size and distribution. Wet ultra-fine grinding of a limestone material (< 100 ¦Ìm) has been investigated in a stirred media mill with respect to the effect of slurry rheology. The results obtained by varying operation parameters (i. e., molecular weight of a dispersant, solid concentration, addition dosage, addition method and bead load) are evaluated in terms of energy efficiency and the fineness. Dispersant S 40 gives the superior results compared to the other dispersants (i. e., BCX- 476 and BCX- 552). For a certain level of bead load, an optimal solid concentration exists for more effective grinding. At 0. 1 wt. % of addition dosage of Dispersant S 40 or more (¡Ü 0. 6 wt. %), a smaller addition amount of Dispersant S 40 leads to a higher energy efficiency and a smaller median size at a lower level of specific energy input. However, the excessive amount of the dispersant causes the grinding less efficient. This can be avoided by either the multi-point addition of the dispersant or a higher bead load (¡Ý 83 vol. %). The role of slurry rheology in stirred media milling of quartzite has also been performed by varying important grinding parameters such as media bead density, addition of chemicals, solid concentration, stirrer rotational speed as well as the combined effect of these factors. Media bead density has an evident but complex effect on stirred milling performance, depending on stirrer rotational speed and solid concentration. Addition of Dispersant S 40 or a lower solid concentration results in better grinding performance (i. e., a higher energy efficiency and a smaller median size) due to maintenance of lower viscosities at shear rates investigated during grinding. Stirrer rotational speed interacts with solid concentration. For a given solid concentration, an optimal stirrer speed exists. The observed phenomena {{can be explained by the}} effect of slurry rheology on the stress intensity of individual grinding bead. The flowability of ground limestone slurries during grinding has been monitored and characterized. The rheological behaviour of ground limestone slurries varies with grinding from a starting dilatant flowability to a resultant pseudoplastic one with an evident Casson yield stress in combination with a thixotropic character. The appearance of pseudoplastic flowability with a thixotropy is related to the fineness of a ground product and its specific surface area, which are both correlated to solid concentration and the addition amount of Dispersant S 40. However, the rheological characterization of time-dependent fluids is dependent upon the instruments used and operating conditions. In addition, an empirical particle size-energy model provides a good fit to the wet ultra-fine grinding results for both limestone and quartzite under the experimental conditions investigated.

40|$|The {{emission}} of Arsenic from {{coal-fired power plants}} has generated widespread environmental and human health concerns. This paper discusses Arsenic partitioning from three 440 t/h circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers co-firing petroleum coke and coal. All the boilers were equipped with electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or fabric filter (FF), and wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD). Flue gas was sampled simultaneously both up- and down-stream of the ESP/FF and at the outlet of the WFGD based on EPA Method 29. Concurrent with flue gas sampling, feed fuel, bottom ash, ESP/FF ash, WFGD gypsum, WFGD wastewater, <b>limestone</b> <b>slurry</b> and flush water were also collected. The results show that, for three tested CFB boilers, the overall mass balance ratios of As ranged from 80. 0 %– 114. 2 %, which can {{be considered to be}} acceptable and reliable. Most of the As was distributed in the bottom ash and ESP/FF ash with the values of 17. 4 %– 37. 5 % and 55. 6 %– 77. 5 %, respectively. Speciation analysis suggests that As 5 + was the major water-soluble species in the feed fuel, bottom ash and fly ash, while As 3 + was found to be the dominant species in WFGD wastewater. For three CFB boilers, the concentrations of total As in the stack emission were 0. 97, 0. 32 and 0. 31 μg/m 3, respectively. The CFB boiler equipped with ESP/FF + WFGD was shown to be able to provide good control of the {{emission of}} As emitted into the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Microbial biofilms {{were grown}} on strips of epoxy-impregnated filter paper {{submerged}} at four sites in water contaminated with metals from mine wastes. At two sample stations, {{the water was}} acidic (pH 3. 1); the other sites were in a lake restored to a near neutral pH level by application of a crushed <b>limestone</b> <b>slurry.</b> During a 17 -week study period, planktonic bacterial counts increased from 101 to 103 CFU/ml at all sites. Biofilm counts increased rapidly over the first 5 weeks and then leveled to 104 CFU/cm 2 in the neutral pH system and 103 CFU/cm 2 at the acidic sites. In each case, the biofilms bound Mn, Fe, Ni, and Cu {{in excess of the}} amounts adsorbed by control strips covered with nylon filters (pore size, 0. 22 μm) to exclude microbial growth; Co bound under neutral conditions but not under acidic conditions. Conditional adsorption capacity constants, obtained graphically from the data, showed that biofilm metal uptake at a neutral pH level was enhanced by up to 12 orders of magnitude over acidic conditions. Similarly, adsorption strength values were usually higher at elevated pH levels. In thin sections of the biofilms, encapsulated bacterial cells were commonly found enmeshed together in microcolonies. The extracellular polymers often contained iron oxide precipitates which generated weak electron diffraction patterns with characteristic reflections for ferrihydrite (Fe 2 O 3 · H 2 O) at d equaling 0. 15 and 0. 25 nm. At neutral pH levels, these deposits incorporated trace amounts of Si and exhibited a granular morphology, whereas acicular crystalloids containing S developed under acidic conditions...|$|E
