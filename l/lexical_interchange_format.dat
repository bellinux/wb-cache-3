In particular completeness is identified as an important design criterion for <b>interchange</b> <b>formats.</b> Afterwards the superset of metamodel concepts is extracted from 15 currently available XML-based specifications for business process modelling. Furthermore, these concepts are used {{as a framework for}} comparing the completeness of 15 specifications. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Petri Net Markup Language (PNML) is an XML-based <b>interchange</b> <b>format</b> for Petri nets. In {{order to}} support {{different}} versions of Petri nets and, in particular, future versions of Petri nets, PNML allows the definition of Petri net types. Due to this flexibility, PNML is {{a starting point for}} a standard <b>interchange</b> <b>format</b> for Petri nets. This paper discusses the design principles, the basic concepts, and the underlying XML technology of PNML. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to disseminate the ideas of PNML and to stimulate discussion on and contributions to a standard Petri net <b>interchange</b> <b>format.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Interchange</b> <b>formats</b> {{have been}} the {{backbone}} of the EDA industry for several years. They are used as a way of helping the development of design flows that integrate foreign tools using formats with different syntax and, more importantly, different semantics. The need for integrating tools coming from different communities is even more severe for hybrid systems because of the relative immaturity of the field and the intrinsic difficulty of the mathematical underpinnings. In this paper, we provide a discussion about <b>interchange</b> <b>formats</b> for hybrid systems, we survey the approaches used by different tools for analysis (simulation and formal verification) and synthesis of hybrid systems, and we give a recommendation for an <b>interchange</b> <b>format</b> for hybrid systems based on the Metropolis metamodel. The proposed <b>interchange</b> <b>format</b> has rigorous semantics and can accommodate the translation to and from the formats of the tools we have surveyed while providing a formal reasoning framework. ...|$|R

This paper discusses aspects of data <b>interchange</b> <b>formats</b> for exchanging reengineering related data.

Keywords: reengineering, data <b>interchange</b> <b>format,</b> tool interoperability, graph technology 1. Motivation An important topic at WCRE' 98 were talks [29, 30] and discussions on representation formats used in different reengineering toolsets. As a result of these discussions a general and powerful format allowing the exchange of reengineering data between different toolsets was required. This paper aims at motivating and presenting an approach to such an <b>interchange</b> <b>format</b> in order to continue the discussions from WCRE' 98. Current activities in softwa [...] ...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In 1993, The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) studied several syntaxes for <b>interchange</b> <b>formats</b> in healthcare, but {{excluded}} SGML due to resource constraints. We {{sought to}} extend the CEN report and formally evaluate the use of SGML as a message <b>interchange</b> <b>format.</b> METHODS: We followed the methodology set forth by CEN, using their example scenarios and healthcare data model. General message descriptions based on this model set the functional requirements for the <b>interchange</b> <b>format.</b> These general requirements are then mapped into SGML {{to see how well}} they can be supported. RESULTS: Results follow the CEN format, enabling a direct comparison of SGML with ASN. 1, ASTM E 1238, EDIFACT, EUCLIDES, and ODA (those syntaxes studied by CEN). CONCLUSION: SGML compares favorably with other syntaxes investigated by CEN. None of the <b>interchange</b> <b>formats</b> support all functional requirements. Optimal and standard mechanisms of combining different formats through a modular approach to achieve greater overall functionality requires further study...|$|R
