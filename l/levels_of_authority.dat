[...] In the USA, for example, an Interstate is a Federal roadway that is often maintained by the State, but the local county or municipal authorities may be involved too. [...] The legislation would need to set the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> of each agency. [...] In Pennsylvania, for example, municipalities tend to have greater authority than counties and sometimes even the State whereas neighboring Maryland has more authority at the county level than at municipal level; and State roads are almost exclusively controlled by the State. [...] It would also have to be determined which other agencies can use the data (i.e. law enforcement, Census, etc.) and to what degree it is permissible to use the information. Law enforcement would be needed to minimise data misuse. [...] The various <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> could also increase incompatibility.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{prior to}} Saharan desertification, the {{communities}} that developed south of Egypt, {{in what is now}} Sudan, were full participants in the Neolithic revolution and lived a settled to semi-nomadic lifestyle, with domesticated plants and animals. It has been suggested that megaliths found at Nabta Playa are examples of the world's first known archaeoastronomical devices, predating Stonehenge by some 1,000 years. The sociocultural complexity observed at Nabta Playa and expressed by different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> within the society there has been suggested as forming the basis for the structure of both the Neolithic society at Nabta and the Old Kingdom of Egypt.|$|E
2500|$|During the Neolithic Era, {{before the}} onset of {{desertification}} around 9500 BCE, the central Sudan had been a rich environment supporting a large population ranging across what is now barren desert, like the Wadi el-Qa'ab. By the 5th millennium BCE, the people who inhabited what is now called Nubia, were full participants in the [...] "agricultural revolution", living a settled lifestyle with domesticated plants and animals. Saharan rock art of cattle and herdsmen suggests the presence of a cattle cult like those found in Sudan and other pastoral societies in Africa today. Megaliths found at Nabta Playa are overt examples of probably the world's first known archaeoastronomy devices, predating Stonehenge by some 2,000 years. This complexity, as observed at Nabta Playa, and as expressed by different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> within the society there, likely formed the basis for the structure of both the Neolithic society at Nabta and the Old Kingdom of Egypt.|$|E

2500|$|The {{more recent}} {{influence}} of New Historicism and post-colonial studies have yielded readings of Shakespeare that typify the play as subversive, or challenging {{the status quo}} of Western imperialism. The critic Abigail Scherer's claim that [...] "Shakespeare's Egypt is a holiday world" [...] recalls the criticisms of Egypt put forth by earlier scholarship and disputes them. Scherer and critics who recognise the wide appeal of Egypt have connected the spectacle and glory of Cleopatra's greatness with the spectacle and glory of the theatre itself. Plays, as breeding grounds of idleness, were subject to attack by all <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> in the 1600s; the play's celebration of pleasure and idleness in a subjugated Egypt makes it plausible to draw parallels between Egypt and the heavily censored theatre culture in England. In the context of England's political atmosphere, Shakespeare's representation of Egypt, as the greater source of poetry and imagination, resists support for 16th century colonial practices. Importantly, King James' sanction {{of the founding of}} Jamestown occurred within months of Antony and Cleopatras debut on stage. England during the Renaissance found itself in an analogous position to the early Roman Republic. Shakespeare's audience may have made the connection between England's westward expansion and Antony and Cleopatras convoluted picture of Roman imperialism. In support of the reading of Shakespeare's play as subversive, it has also been argued that 16th century audiences would have interpreted Antony and Cleopatras depiction of different models of government as exposing inherent weaknesses in an absolutist, imperial, and by extension monarchical, political state.|$|E
2500|$|Romanians' {{image of}} Antonescu shifted several times after the 1989 Revolution toppled communism. Polls {{carried out in}} the 1990s show the Conducător was well liked by {{portions}} of the general public. This tendency, Lucian Boia argues, was similar to a parallel trend favoring Wallachia's 15th century Prince Vlad III the Impaler, indicating a preference for [...] "authoritarian solutions" [...] and reflecting [...] "a pantheon that was largely set in place in the 'Ceaușescu era' [...] ". It was also popular at the time to see the 1944 Coup exclusively as the onset of communization in Romania, while certain sections of the public opinion revived the notion of [...] "Jewish Bolshevism", accusing Jews of having brought communism to Romania. British historian Tony Judt connected such reflexes to growing anti-Russian sentiment and Holocaust denial in various countries of the former Eastern Bloc, and termed them collectively [...] "mis-memory of anti-communism". Vladimir Tismăneanu, a prominent Romanian-born political scientist, referred to Antonescu's [...] "pseudo-sacred" [...] image with the post-1989 public, and to the phenomenon as [...] "fantasies of persecution." [...] The wartime dictator's image appealed to many politicians of the post-1989 period, and sporadic calls for his rehabilitation were issued at the highest <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b> Far right groups issued calls for his canonization by the Romanian Orthodox Church (together with a similar request to canonize Corneliu Zelea Codreanu). Certain neofascist groups claim to represent a legacy of Codrenism from which Sima was a deviationist, and these have also become Antonescu apologists.|$|E
