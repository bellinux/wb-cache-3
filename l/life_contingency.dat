40|$|What actuaries call {{cash flow}} testing is a {{large-scale}} simulation pitting a company's current policy obligation against future earnings based on interest rates. While <b>life</b> <b>contingency</b> {{issues associated with}} contract payoff are a mainstay of the actuarial sciences, modeling the random fluctuations of US Treasury rates is less studied. Furthermore, applying standard simulation techniques, such as the Monte Carlo method, to actual multi-billion dollar companies produce a simulation that can be computationally prohibitive. In practice, only hundreds of sample paths can be considered, not the usual hundreds of thousands one might expect for a simulation of this complexity. Hence, insurance companies have a desire to accelerate the convergence of the estimation procedure. This paper reports the results of cash flow testing simulations performed for Conseco L. L. C. using so-called quasi-Monte Carlo techniques. In these, pseudo-random number generation is replaced with deterministic low discrepancy sequences. It was found that by judicious choice of subsequences, the quasi-Monte Carlo method provided a consistently tighter estimate, than the traditional methods, for a fixed, small number of sample paths. The techniques used to select these subsequences are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Copula {{models are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular tool for modeling dependencies between random variables, especially in such fields as biostatistics, actuarial science, and finance. The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to provide preliminary discussion about the project aimed to investigate models and inference methods for multiple lives–based insurance data by means of copula. In the <b>life</b> <b>contingency</b> models for several individuals, the life time of insured individuals have been assumed to be mutually independent. This means that for combination of lives, the life time probability of one live and life time of another lives do not directly impact each other. Independence assumption in multiple lives contigency models is often considered becauce this is more mathematically tractable to compute straightforwardly actuarial present value or benefit premiums and reserves. However, this may be unrealistic because intutitively, life times of several associated individuals, such as married couples, can exhibit “dependence ” because of such conditions as common disaster, common life style, or the broken–heart syndrome. Using actual data on mortality of spouses that hold a last–survivor annuity policies in Indonesia, this research project will apply the basic concepts of copula inference in empirically investigating the presence of dependence in multiple lives–based insurance contract. There is a growing number of papers that explore the issue of dependencies on joint life times contracts, but no paper that has provided a detail lists of inference methods in copula modeling for multiple lives theory. Key-words: copula function, multiple lives model, joint survival function, conditional copula, IFM method, Bayesian estimation. ...|$|E

According to the Regulation of the Ministry of Culture in Bucharest, the title „Living Human Treasures” is the <b>life</b> <b>contingency,</b> personal and in transmissible. The person „must, simultaneously fulfill bearing, preserving and creating qualities of intangible heritage, be able to transmit traditional cultural models and be recognized as so by other LHT and the scientific community”. In six years, between 2010 and 2015 in Romania were granted 45 titles: half to craftsmen (weavers, carpenters, iconographers, furriers, builders of musical instruments, pottery etc.) and half to performers of folklore (folk interpreter, rhapsodists, dancers etc.). Most distinctions, eight and seven, were awarded in Cluj and Alba county, followed by Brașov, Suceava county, each with five distinctions. Discussions are held about the possibilities of granting life annuity, following the model of athletes and some artists and writers. It is clear however that the title holders and their performance can be assimilated to tourism assets, as attractions of itself, transforming communities they belong to genuine tourist destinations. Furthermore, it would avoid the exhausting movements of artisans at the various trade fairs, being preferable to receive the audience in their personal household tranquility. A series of semi structured personal interviews with some LHT confirm this hypothesis. Strong promotion of those tourist destinations should no longer delay. At the central level it would require that the Tourism Authority take the „dossiers” for those LHT and promote them in a centralized manner, dedicating them an advertising brochure and a map...|$|E

40|$|Insuring {{the access}} to an {{adequate}} housing is frequently a pre-condition for the exercise of many other basic rights that any individual must gain. Lacking {{the access to}} civilized living conditions probably signifies the most serious manifestation of social exclusion. Lacking a home is synonimous to the extreme poverty, in fact, representing more than a <b>life</b> <b>contingency</b> but the extreme frame of a deficit of means and opportunities. The term ”homeless” defines a human condition which {{is hard to believe}} that someone would have problems in understanding it. However, almost everybody who uses this term uses a different definition to define it. These definitions become mere ”instruments” which justify the action or the lack of it depending on who uses it. The condition of an adult homeless person presupposes a series of attributes which define it. Therefore, the state of isolation, marginalization, alienation and social exclusion have extreme outcomes within the frame of emotional, relational and social integration. In this respect, there must be built and emproved new programmes and social services for the benefit of the homeless persons. As a result of the work experience with these homeless persons I identified some stages of the adaptation to the street life. It is self-evident that the psycho-social degradation is a process and not a gradual evolution. The intervention of the specialists through the specialized services is vital for the emprovement of the quality of life for these beneficiaries of welfare work. The present research develops a strategy related to the social services in Braila offered as a method of social reinsertion of the street life, especially those from the municipality of Braila...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{law reform}} efforts are {{underway}} {{to reverse the}} no-implied-conditions-of-survivorship rule historically applying to future interests. Yet, whenever the NICS rule is reversed, a reversion arises in the transferor of the future interests—which reversion will take effect if the newly-implied conditions of survivorship fail—unless the NICS-rule-reversal reform itself negates that reversion. The most well-known NICS-rule-reversal reform, Uniform Probate Code section 2 - 707, negates the transferor’s reversion, but other reforms do not. When the reversion is not negated, complicated transfer tax issues arise. First, for gift tax purposes, the reversion must be valued, because {{the value of the}} reversion is subtracted in valuing the transferor’s gift. Second, if the transferor dies at a time when any of the future interests she created continue as future interests (i. e., the interests have yet to arise in possession or fail), the at-death value of the transferor’s reversion is included in her federal gross estate under Internal Revenue Code section 2033, unless her reversion fails at her death, in which case Internal Revenue Code section 2037 includes an amount greater than the immediately-before-death value of the transferor’s reversion; section 2037 includes the after-death value of the property interests replacing the reversion. Application of section 2037 and of section 2033 in this context always requires determining the probability that one person survives another, and nothing presently exists in the legal literature to demonstrate how to do that. This article surveys <b>life</b> <b>contingency</b> actuarial mathematics and provides a method. Two points become clear. First, whatever the merits of reversing the NICS rule, the transferor’s reversion should be negated in any reform, which argues for the UPC approach. Second, through a series of case examples, this article demonstrates how to value a reversion, both when an inartful NICS-reversal reform creates one, and when a transfer expressly creates one, either by real intention or, as is more likely, by inadvertence...|$|E

40|$|The {{extension}} {{of the theory of}} <b>life</b> <b>contingencies</b> to a stochastic interest environment and its application to solvency valuation are discussed. Although <b>life</b> <b>contingencies</b> are widely used in traditional actuarial valuations of life insurance contracts, certain complications arise in a stochastic interest environment that are not evident when using traditional deterministic interest assumptions. In particular, many insurance functions can no longer be expressed in a simple form, resulting in a loss of the intuitive appeal of these functions. In this paper, a stochastic interest environment is introduced and analyzed in terms of its effects on insurance functions. Although the model is less general than others introduced in the literature, it is sufficiently flexible to handle the volatility and certain autocorrelation aspects of interest series. Its main advantage is the simple form of the resulting insurance functions and, hence, its intuitive appeal. To examine the performance of a block of business, the assets as well a...|$|R
