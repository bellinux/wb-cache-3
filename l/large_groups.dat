40|$|In the {{literature}} on the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> there are two omissions which need to be confronted: one is theoretical, the other empirical.

The “blank pages ” are no accident, they have a dynamic meaning within the social foundation matrix of the group analytic movement. (1) The omissions mirror Foulkes’s ambivalence towards the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> and are reflected in the different approaches adopted by the group analytic heirs of the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> which pay more homage to Bion than to Foulkes. The intention of the paper is to show that there is a third position which assumes a dialectical relationship between destructive and creative forces in the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> and which returns to Foulkes's ideas on the conductor role...|$|R

5|$|The idea {{of group}} living has been {{discussed}} by many evolutionists for its costs and benefits. Alexander predicted that the cost to <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> {{is that they are}} more likely to suffer from parasitism, but at the same time, they benefit by defense against predation. This theory is not supported in the case of P.exclamans because the parasitism does not always increase with nest size and the predation rate was independent of size.|$|E

40|$|<b>Large</b> <b>group</b> {{interventions}} {{are an important}} method of organization change. The <b>large</b> <b>group</b> intervention literature is largely descriptive and normative and contains a number of case studies that describe the process and some immediate outcomes. There is a large void with respect to empirical investigation. This research tested fundamental hypotheses related to <b>large</b> <b>group</b> composition, process, and outcomes in a field study. Six <b>large</b> <b>group</b> interventions (decision accelerators) were used to develop clinical service area strategies and instigate strategic change in a health care system. The results support the assertion that stakeholder diversity in the group’s composition affects the number of stakeholder perspectives that were heard during the meeting and the breadth of issues addressed during decision making, but failed to support the assertion that composition affects the intensity of debate and disagreement. Stakeholder diversity had a weak relationship with novel and relevant <b>large</b> <b>group</b> outcomes, but debate intensity was strongly related to those outcomes. The implications of these results on <b>large</b> <b>group</b> intervention research and practice are discussed...|$|R

5|$|All {{pinnipeds}} are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, {{they mostly}} feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded") prey like sea birds. While most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders, {{a few are}} specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats krill, the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and the bearded seal and walrus, which feed on clams and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in <b>large</b> <b>groups,</b> locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature that distinguished Maqam al-Khawwas from the Deir Ghassaneh mosque {{was that it}} acted primarily as a women's domain whereas the mosque had largely been a male domain. In the pre-British Mandate era, it was frequented by women {{on a daily basis}} and during a seasonal pilgrimage for women known as mawsim al-banat. During this pilgrimage, which coincided with the Nabi Salih pilgrimage, a largely male affair, <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of women and children from the villages of Bani Zeid would visit the Khawwas mausoleum to celebrate festivities, socialize with other women and pray. According to Palestinian architecture expert Suad Amiry, Maqam al-Khawwas's isolation and the ritual of having to travel uphill to reach the sanctuary added to the tranquil feeling of the visit.|$|E
