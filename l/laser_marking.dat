50|$|A {{new method}} of marking using lasers is now available, which is {{especially}} valuable for delicate items and hollowware, which would be damaged or distorted by the punching process. <b>Laser</b> <b>marking</b> also means that finished articles {{do not need to}} be re-finished. <b>Laser</b> <b>marking</b> works by using high power lasers to evaporate material from the metal surface. Two methods exist, 2D and 3D <b>laser</b> <b>marking.</b> 2D <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> burns the outline of the hallmarks into the object, while 3D <b>laser</b> <b>marking</b> better simulates the marks made by punching.|$|E

50|$|Laser engraving, {{which is}} a subset of <b>laser</b> <b>marking,</b> is the {{practice}} of using lasers to engrave an object. <b>Laser</b> <b>marking,</b> on the other hand, is a broader category of methods to leave marks on an object, which also includes color change due to chemical/molecular alteration, charring, foaming, melting, ablation, and more. The technique does not involve the use of inks, nor does it involve tool bits which contact the engraving surface and wear out, giving it an advantage over alternative engraving or marking technologies where inks or bit heads {{have to be replaced}} regularly.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a secure anti-counterfeiting {{solution}} {{based on the}} ex- traction of a unique identifier out of the random profile of <b>laser</b> <b>marks</b> that are engraved on the surface or in the bulk of physical objects. Given today's tech- nology, the 3 D profile of a <b>laser</b> <b>mark</b> can be considered uncloneable. Indeed, reproducing a mark would be so expensive that it thwarts any attempt to build a twin of a given mark. Actually, we rely on the resolution difference {{that can be achieved}} between the engraving which can be seen as pretty coarse, and the much more precise reading process. The solution we propose exploits these phys- ical features in the design of a comprehensive anti-counterfeiting system based on existing tools.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Certain {{applications}} {{have recently}} appeared in industry where a traditional bar code printed on a label {{will not survive}} because the item to be tracked has {{to be exposed to}} harsh environments. <b>Laser</b> direct-part <b>marking</b> is a manufacturing process used to create permanent marks on a substrate that could help to alleviate this problem. In this research, a 532 nm laser was utilized to create a direct-part marked Data Matrix symbol onto carbon steel substrates with different carbon content. The quality of the <b>laser</b> <b>marked</b> Data Matrix symbol was then evaluated according to the criteria outlined in the ISO/IEC 16022 bar code technology specification for Data Matrix. Several experiments were conducted to explore the effects that different parameters have {{on the quality of the}} <b>laser</b> direct-part <b>marked</b> symbols. First, an experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of two different laser tool path patterns. In later experiments, parameters such as type of carbon steel, percent of laser tool path overlap, profile speed, average power and frequency were found to have significant effects on the quality of <b>laser</b> direct-part <b>marked</b> Data Matrix symbols. The analysis of the results indicated that contrast and print growth were the critical standard performance measures that limited <b>laser</b> direct-part <b>marked</b> Data Matrix symbols from achieving a higher final grade. No significant effects were found with respect to other standard performance measures (i. e., encode, axial uniformity, and unused error correction). Next, the experimental data collected for contrast and print growth was utilized as training, validation and testing data sets in the modeling of artificial neural networks for the <b>laser</b> direct-part <b>marking</b> process. Two performance measures (i. e., mean squared error and correlation coefficient) were employed to assess the performance of the artificial neural network models. Single-output artificial neural network models corresponding to a specific performance measure were found to have good learning and predicting capabilities. The single-output artificial neural network models were compared to equivalent multiple linear regression models for validation purposes. The prediction capability of the single-output artificial neural network models with respect to <b>laser</b> direct-part <b>marking</b> of Data Matrix symbols on carbon steel substrates was superior to that of the multiple linear regression models...|$|R

In this second development order, pure vanadium and alloy titanium (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) were spin-formed, {{as well as}} additional copper and 21 - 6 - 9 stainless. In the first development order the following materials had been spin-formed: copper (alloy C 11000 ETP), 6061 aluminum, 304 L stainless steel, 21 - 6 - 9 stainless steel, and tantalum- 2. 5 % tungsten. Significant challenges included properly adjusting the rotations-per-minute (RPM), cracking at un-beveled edges and <b>laser</b> <b>marks,</b> redressing of notches, surface cracking, non-uniform temperature evolution in the titanium, and cracking of the tailstock. Lessons learned were that 300 RPM worked better than 600 RPM for most materials (at the feed rate of 800 mm/min); beveling the edges to lower the stress reduces edge cracking; notches, <b>laser</b> <b>marks,</b> or edge defects in the preform doom the process to cracking and failure; coolant is required for vanadium spin-forming; {{increasing the number of}} passes to nine or more eliminates surface cracking for vanadium; titanium develops a hot zone in front of the rollers; and the tailstock should be redesigned to eliminate the cylindrical stress concentrator in the center...|$|R
