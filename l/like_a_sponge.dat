It produces sponge-like, rubbery orange fruit bodies that have a fruity or musky odour. The fruit bodies reach dimensions of [...] wide by [...] tall. <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sponge,</b> they will resume their original shape if water is squeezed out. The spores, produced on the surfaces of the hollows of the sponge, are almond-shaped with rough surfaces, and measure 10–12.5 by 6–7 micrometers. The name of the fungus {{is derived from the}} cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. S.squarepantsii is one of two species in Spongiforma; it differs from S.thailandica in its colour, odour, and spore structure.|$|E

The pore surface is orange with angular pores that are usually larger than 1mm in diameter. It features thin partitions that split to form a teeth-like layer. The flesh is soft and pale orange, up to 2mm thick, with a felt-like texture. The tubes are the same color as the pores, and continuous with the flesh, measuring up to [...] thick. Bruised pores sometimes turn black. [...] All tissues of the fungus turn bright red if a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide is applied.

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Phellodon species have caps and stipe, and thus {{fall into the}} general {{category}} [...] "stipitate hydnoid fungi". The cap surfaces are initially velvety to tomentose, eventually becoming matted. The surface is rough, with pits and ridges, and sometimes with concentrical zones of color or texture. The color can vary considerably, from cream to yellowish, brownish, greenish, greyish or black. Neighboring fruitbodies can fuse together, forming intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. Alexander H. Smith wrote of P.tomentosus, [...] "It often occurs in large mats of fused caps almost producing a ceiling over {{large areas of the}} moss under conifers." [...] Phellodon fruitbodies can envelop nearby grass or twigs. The stipe is thickly tomentose or smooth, typically the same color as the cap or darker. In P.niger, the outer covering of the stipe is a thick felty layer of mycelium that absorbs water <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sponge.</b> [...] The hymenophore (the fertile, spore-bearing surface) is {{on the underside of the}} cap. The spines become grey at maturity. In conditions of high humidity, P.niger can form striking drops of black liquid on the actively growing caps.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{is being}} done testing various {{activated}} carbons' ability to store natural gas and hydrogen gas. [...] The porous material acts <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sponge</b> for different types of gases. The gas is attracted to the carbon material via Van der Waals forces. Some carbons {{have been able to}} achieve bonding energies of 5–10 kJ per mol. The gas may then be desorbed when subjected to higher temperatures and either combusted to do work {{or in the case of}} hydrogen gas extracted for use in a hydrogen fuel cell. Gas storage in activated carbons is an appealing gas storage method because the gas can be stored in a low pressure, low mass, low volume environment that would be much more feasible than bulky on board compression tanks in vehicles. The United States Department of Energy has specified certain goals to be achieved in the area of research and development of nano-porous carbon materials. All of the goals are yet to be satisfied but numerous institutions, including the ALL-CRAFT program, are continuing to conduct work in this promising field.|$|E

In his first season at Yorkshire, Plunkett played in 12 of the club's 16 matches in the County Championship, managing to take 36 wickets. He credits Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire's coach and former Australia international fast bowler, with helping him regain his confidence and felt that his problems had been exacerbated by over-coaching.

He had at this time an ambition to be assigned to the Chindits units operating in Burma, and secured an interview with their Commander Orde Wingate to this end whilst the latter was on a temporary stop-over in Cairo, but Powell's duties and rank precluded the assignment. Having declined two posts carrying the rank of full colonel (in Algiers and Cairo, which would have left him in the now moribund North African theatre [...] "indefinitely"), and despite expecting to have to accept a reduction in rank to major in order to get the transfer, he eventually secured a posting to the British Imperial Indian Army at Delhi as a lieutenant-colonel in military intelligence in August 1943.
