25|$|Sting {{began to}} {{question}} Hogan's trustworthiness and credibility in {{the weeks leading up}} to Fall Brawl. At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a baseball bat to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel for the first time in WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent attitude change did not resonate with the WCW fans. They still cheered Sting despite the fact he was supposed to be the villain (reminiscent of The Road Warriors' heel turn in late 1988). At Halloween Havoc, Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in street clothes and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for <b>later</b> <b>tonight.</b> Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee Charles Robinson. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official.|$|E

He began in vaudeville at the age of three. By the ripe old age of nine, he was billed as America's greatest boy actor, at least that's how his parents had him billed in theater ads. Later he became a writer and director and among the films he directed was the Marx Brothers comedy The Cocoanuts. He also did six comedies with Judy Canova, he directed Music in My Heart with Rita Hayworth and three of Ann Sothern's movies, including a comedy called She's Got Everything, which we'll be showing <b>later</b> <b>tonight.</b> Up next, though, Ann joins Fredric March and Joan Bennett in a film from nineteen thirty-eight which made a big change in the future of Ann as a movie star." ...|$|E
50|$|Del {{explains}} to Rodney {{the reason why}} he has to play the poker game tonight: Rodney does not remember the day their father Reg left home after their mother Joan died, because {{he was only a}} small infant at the time. Del came home that evening and found that Reg had packed his bags and gone for good. He left them with nothing, and even opened Rodney's piggy bank. The only thing that Reg did not get was the money Joan had left her sons, because Del hid it too well. And it was Del's birthday; Reg even took his cake. From that day forward, Del swore that he would never run away from anything in his life, and that is why he has to play the poker game with Boycie <b>later</b> <b>tonight.</b> Rodney understands it all eventually and goes off to get more stake money for his older brother by returning empty bottles to the shop.|$|E

As Albert prepares some breakfast, Del Boy then tells his uncle that Raquel is now sleeping with him {{instead of in}} Rodney's bedroom. Albert then asks Del if he'll do something because Rodney has been drinking at The Nag's Head every night {{ever since he was}} thrown out of his flat by Cassandra, who has gone on holiday to Spain with her mother Pam. Del says that he's having a chat with Cassandra's father Alan <b>later</b> <b>tonight</b> to try and solve the problem. As Del and Raquel leave, Rodney enters from the bedrooms completely hung-over and asks Albert to phone the printing firm since he does not feel well enough to work today. Del re-enters the flat just to find the keys to the Trotter van. He also tells Rodney that Alan is not very happy with Rodney's drinking and taking various days off work.|$|E

5000|$|With Jones still {{involved}} in the process, the officials once again ordered the court to be cleared, the players to be brought back into position, the clock to be reset, and the final three seconds be replayed. Furious over the decision to deny the U.S. victory and allow the Soviets yet a third inbounds play, the U.S. coaches briefly considered unilaterally declaring the game to be over by pulling their team off the floor. However, head coach Hank Iba was concerned that such an action would leave the U.S. vulnerable to a Soviet appeal, which {{might lead to a}} ruling that the U.S. had forfeited the game. U.S. assistant coach John Bach reported that Jones threatened him directly with such a forfeiture should the U.S. team not return to the floor. In finally deciding to comply with the officials, Iba reportedly told his coaching staff, [...] "I don't want to lose this game <b>later</b> <b>tonight,</b> sitting on my butt." ...|$|E

In an Interview with Punknews.org Tim McIlrath was asked about The Killing Tree's future and said:"I would love to. I would love to right now. I'd love to call those guys and just fucking write a record right now if we could. I think Neil is getting back from Europe today and I'm going {{to hang out with}} him <b>later</b> <b>tonight.</b> Todd is out of LA right now doing a bunch of graphic design stuff and Jeff is doing Holy Roman and also doing his masters degree at UIC. For me and Neil to actually have lunch together though, that's like the stars are aligned. It's a fucking miracle. I would love to and I think that I still love the Killing Tree and what we've created. I love the record, {{it was a lot of}} fun. But, there's no real mystery to why we're not doing records- it's simply because there's no time. If there was, we'd all be having a lot of fun and writing some new songs or at least playing some shows. But who knows, we tend to do a show every year or so in Chicago somewhere.." ...|$|E

I {{want to thank the}} Institute of Regulation & Risk for inviting me to speak tonight and express my particular gratitude to Ms. Au King-chi of the Hong Kong Government and Mr. Norman Chan of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. I’m especially grateful to our gracious host Mr. Robert Pringle. Given the limited time I have, I will try to lay out some broad themes concerning the implications of the financial crisis for regulatory reform and monetary policy. My comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my Federal Reserve colleagues. I look forward to the extended discussion we shall have <b>later</b> <b>tonight</b> when {{we will be able to}} delve more deeply into these critical issues. In the past, monetary and regulatory policies have generally been viewed as separate domains with distinct objectives. The primary focus of monetary policy has been on attaining the macroeconomic goals of low inflation and a stable economy. In the United States, these goals find their expression in the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. By contrast, regulatory policy has generally pursued significantly different ends: protecting the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and reducing systemi...|$|E
