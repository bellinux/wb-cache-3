5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money <b>last</b> <b>season)</b> <b>and</b> proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard salary cap (at $45 million per team) {{as opposed to a}} soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes. Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout. In May 2011, the NBPA {{filed a complaint with the}} National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing the league of negotiating in bad faith by failing to provide critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal labor laws. The union also considered the option of decertification, which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.|$|E

Frye was the offensive coordinator at McCormick High School in McCormick, South Carolina <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>and</b> played offensive line at the University of South Carolina. Batichon, a graduate of Appalachian State University (where he played wide receiver), came to SSU from Watauga High School in Boone, North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|This was the 65th {{meeting between}} the teams with Nebraska clearly {{in control of the}} series 45–17–2 and 7–3 in the last 10. Nebraska went 8–4 <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>and</b> beat Colorado 30–3 in part of the tailspin of Colorado of the 2005 season. Colorado failed to prevent just its third 10-loss season in 117 years of intercollegiate {{football}} (going 1–10 in 1980 and 1984) as well as to end a 13-game losing streak to ranked teams. Nebraska had already captured the Big 12 North Division title and a bowl game yet to be determined. Colorado won’t be going to a bowl for just the fifth time since 1984, and this is just school’s fourth losing season in that time frame (1997, 2000, 2003 and 2006).|$|E

25|$|Sussex won the toss at the Oval {{and elected}} to bat. Mark Ramprakash captained Surrey as Mark Butcher {{has still not}} {{recovered}} from the injury that saw him miss England's winter tour. Only 49 overs could be bowled on the first day, as rain delayed the start till after lunch, and bad light brought an early conclusion. Cloud cover helped the bowlers, but Sussex, thanks to Michael Yardy's 44 not out, finished the day on 171 for 4. The second day saw 61 overs. Yardy, again under cloud-covered skies, progressed to 111, which will have {{gone a long way}} to helping him cement a regular first team place. Rikki Clarke, who took 4 for 91, appears a yard quicker than <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> <b>and</b> to have improved after his poor season last year. Sussex finished the second day on 370, and Surrey on 6 for 1.|$|E
25|$|In May 1985, Liverpool {{were the}} {{defending}} European Champions' Cup winners, having won the competition after defeating Roma in the penalty shootout {{in the final}} of the previous season. Again they would face Italian opposition, Juventus, who had won, unbeaten, the 1983–84 Cup Winners' Cup. Juventus had a team comprising many of Italy's 1982 FIFA World Cup winning team–who played for Juventus for many years–and their playmaker Michel Platini was considered the best footballer in Europe, being named Footballer of The Year by France Football magazine {{for the second year in}} a row in December 1984. Both teams were placed in the two first positions in the UEFA club ranking at the end of the <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>and</b> were regarded by the specialist press as the best two sides on the continent at the time. Both teams had contested the 1984 European Super Cup four months before, finishing with victory for the Italian side by 2–0.|$|E

The next tournament the Northern Ireland Trophy brought more luck; he won through the qualifying beating Fraser Patrick, Joe Delaney and Rory McLeod on the way. In the last 48, he faced Gerard Greene, but lost 2–5. He did not do {{as well in the}} UK Championship; he lost in the second qualifying round to David Roe 2–9. He also failed to qualify for the Welsh Open, falling at the last hurdle losing to Andrew Norman 2–5.

25|$|On 18 September, Parma hosted {{former manager}} Domenico Di Carlo's Chievo at the Tardini with an {{unchanged}} line-up {{and were the}} better side {{for much of the}} first half and saw their dominance rewarded with a Giovinco goal with 24 minutes on the clock from a headed Pellè flick-on. The second half was, however, Chievo's, the majority of the action coming in Antonio Mirante's goalmouth, although chances were still at a premium. Chievo made their improved performance count through ex-Parma frontman Alberto Paloschi with 12 minutes to go and a draw looked the fair result, but a late Giovinco finish from substitute Jonathan Biabiany's inch-perfect whipped cross saw Parma snatch all three points and Giovinco become the first player since Adriano in 2003–04 to score 3 goals in the first two matches. Two-goal Giovinco was then sent off in injury time after he was shown a second yellow card for kicking the ball into the net following the referee's decision to penalise the diminutive Italian. The result represented a fifth consecutive victory at home for Parma – a feat last achieved in 2000–01 – after victories over Juventus, Palermo and Inter <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>and</b> Grosseto this.|$|E
25|$|It was Neil's <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>and</b> {{it was a}} {{shame that}} his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

500|$|Leigh has {{received}} mixed feedback {{for her role}} as Lexie Grey. People, less than impressed, criticized the way Leigh's character initially approached her sister, calling it [...] "rude". Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly was also critical of Leigh's early appearances, referring to her as [...] "awkward". However, Armstrong later noted that the [...] "sparkling" [...] friendship development between Lexie and O'Malley [...] "won her over". The character's transition from season four to five was positively reviewed, with Keen of The Trades writing: [...] "Her presence and confidence have increased quite a bit since <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> <b>and</b> actress, Chyler Leigh, does a fantastic job of making this progression feel seamless.

500|$|Series co-creator and {{executive}} producer Weiss praised Clarke's portrayal in the scene saying [...] "Emilia absolutely crushed it. It's one of those weird scenes because it was half shot in Spain, half in Belfast. But largely due to her performance, it works brilliantly." [...] Sackheim, {{the director of the}} episode, noted in an interview, [...] "With the interior, {{there was only one way}} for her to play it, which is, bemused. She's the keeper of the secret. She knows how to extricate herself from this. I thought the ease with which she delivered the lines was necessary for the audience to feel jeopardy for her and for them to think she was crazy. The sequence outside was all about claiming the throne — or reclaiming the throne." [...] Sackheim also stated, [...] "We wanted to clearly distinguish everything we've seen from the end of the <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>and</b> the beginning of this one." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{revealed}} {{before the}} Charity Shield game {{that he was}} not overly concerned with Anelka leaving, rather the injuries that were depleting his squad: [...] "I cannot forget that it was because of a poor start to last season that we lost the championship to Manchester United." [...] He refused to categorise the match as a [...] "friendly" [...] much like it is traditionally viewed as: [...] "There is a trophy and medals at stake. We won it <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>and</b> our players want to win it again." [...] Ferguson described the 3–0 defeat in the previous season's Shield as a [...] "humiliation", before discussing how it made the team prepare for the challenges ahead: [...] "I have reminded the players {{how hard it is to}} lose when you are playing for United these days – it makes so many other people happy." [...] Indeed, United only lost five matches of the whole of last season, with their last defeat coming at home to Middlesbrough in December 1998.|$|E

500|$|Leicester {{initially}} {{struggled in}} their domestic form during 2016–17, spending {{much of the}} first few months in {{the bottom half of the}} table. In December 2016, Ranieri was awarded coach of the year and Leicester team of the year at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. However, on 23 February 2017, Ranieri was sacked due to the club's continuing poor form, resulting in them being only one point above the relegation zone. Gary Lineker called the sacking [...] "very sad" [...] and [...] "inexplicable", while Manchester United manager José Mourinho blamed it on [...] "selfish players". Rumours began emerging some days later that players had been meeting with the owners to discuss Ranieri's sacking without Ranieri knowing, which sparked widespread outrage over social media. Commenting on the collapse in form of the team and particularly Jamie Vardy during the first 20 matches of the 2016–17 season, Alan Shearer said Vardy had signed a [...] "bumper new contract", but was no longer doing what brought him success <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> <b>and</b> that the entire club was [...] "no longer doing the basics".|$|E
500|$|Doby hit 20 {{home runs}} and 69 RBIs in 1951, both fewer than <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> <b>and</b> his batting average {{improved}} to [...]295. His 21-game hit-streak was the second-longest for the Indians that season, behind Dale Mitchell's mark of 23 games in a row. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg reduced Doby's salary due to the lower home run numbers despite Doby, who attributed the lower numbers to tightness in his legs, stating he would not accept a pay cut. Indians manager Al López confirmed that Doby was injury-riddled throughout the season, stating that he [...] "was beset by first one injury and then another" [...] including [...] "a muscle tear in his thigh, a groin pull, an ankle twist." [...] Doby received blame for the Indians' failure to win the AL pennant and was labeled a [...] "loner" [...] by some in the press, including Plain Dealer sports editor Gordon Cobbledick who {{in an article in}} Sport wrote [...] "Larry's a mixed-up guy—a badly mixed-up guy" [...] stemming from [...] "the emotional impact of discovering racial prejudice against him." [...] Cobbledick also took issue with Doby's assertion that opposing pitchers were knocking him down due to Doby being black. The assertion was confirmed by Sam Lacy, who wrote in the Baltimore Afro-American, [...] "Statistics show that eight colored players in the two major leagues were hit by pitches a total of 68 times during the 1951 campaign, an average of [...] times per man. No other player was hit as many as eight times in the season." ...|$|E
500|$|Bridges re-joined Conference National side Kettering Town on 1 August 2011, {{signing a}} two-year {{deal with the}} club. He joined Kettering on a free transfer, having been out of {{contract}} at Stevenage — [...] "I got injured at {{the back end of}} <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>and</b> I was out of contract and because of all the deals that needed to be sorted at Stevenage, I wasn't a priority and I had to wait. There comes a time when you can't wait any longer and I needed to sort my future out so here we are". Bridges made his Kettering Town debut in a 2–0 away win at Lincoln City on 10 September 2011, the club's first away victory of the season. After making just five appearances for Kettering, Bridges was transfer-listed by new manager Mark Stimson on 29 September. Despite being transfer-listed due to Kettering's financial problems, Bridges continued to play in the first-team, and he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw against Ebbsfleet United, scoring from close range to give the club an initial one-goal lead. Bridges scored once again in a 2–1 home defeat to Grimsby Town on 26 November 2011, scoring in injury-time to half the deficit. Bridges was forced to take training following the departure of Stimson, with only six other Kettering players turning up to train due to unpaid wages. Despite the off-field problems, he remained ever-present {{for the remainder of the}} season, playing 38 times in all competitions, and scoring his third and final goal of the campaign in a 1–1 home draw with Barrow in April 2012. Kettering were relegated, finishing bottom of the league, and faced a further relegation due to entering a Company Voluntary Arrangement. Bridges had one year remaining on his contract at Kettering, but left in July 2012, calling the campaign the [...] "worst of his career".|$|E

At age 37, Robinson announced that year as his <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> <b>and</b> his playing time was cut by coach Popovich to save his energy for the playoffs. The Spurs qualified easily for the playoffs, concluding the regular season as the Conference number one seed with a 60–22 record. Although San Antonio now had new offensive threats in Tony Parker and Manu Ginóbili, during the playoffs, it was Duncan's performance in the semi-finals against the Los Angeles Lakers which was singled out for praise by Popovich, who stated: [...] "I thought in Game 5 and Game 6, he [...] was astounding in his focus. He pulled everyone along these last two games." [...] In the series, Duncan was matched up against forward Robert Horry, {{and was able to}} dominate him the entire series and closed out the series in style; Duncan finished Game 6 with 37 points and 16 rebounds, allowing Spurs coach Popovich to call timeout with 2:26 left to instruct his team not to celebrate excessively. The Spurs made it to the finals, and defeated the New Jersey Nets 88–77 in Game 6 to win another NBA championship. Helped by an inspired Robinson, Duncan almost recorded a quadruple double in the final game, and was named the NBA Finals MVP. Duncan said of the victory: [...] "We were all confident that something would happen, that we would turn the game to our favor, and it did", but felt sad that Robinson retired after winning his second championship ring. Following this successful Spurs campaign, Robinson and Duncan were named Sports Illustrateds 2003 [...] "Sportsmen of the Year".|$|E
