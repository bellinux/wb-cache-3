Primary data were collected using a set of structured questionnaire from two hundred poultry egg farmers who were selected using multi stage sampling techniques, from five Local Government Areas (LGA) of Osun state, Nigeria. Results showed that poultry egg production was in the rational stage of production (stage II) as depicted by the Returns to Scale (RTS) of 0. 771. The variables of interest, stock of birds, operating costs, and other costs were effectively allocated and used, as confirmed by each variable having estimated coefficient value between zero and unity.

40|$|Farmers in Illubabor Zone, Ethiopia, lead a {{subsistence}} {{existence and}} hence any crop loss to wildlife {{is perceived to}} threaten food security. In the context of increasing farmer concerns {{about the level of}} crop damage caused by wild vertebrates, this study aimed to (1) determine the perceived impacts of a 2004 cull on wildlife and patterns of crop-raiding by wild vertebrates; (2) quantify current wildlife damage events in study farms by species responsible, time of damage, and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> affected; (3) identify features of the agricultural landscape that influence patterns of crop-raiding. Research involving participatory investigations with local farmers and field monitoring of wildlife damage events was undertaken over a 3 -week period on eight farms spread across two study sites in central Illubabor. Farmers’ perceptions of the effectiveness of the 2004 cull were found to be spatially variable; baboon-attributed crop losses were perceived to have declined in some but not all areas, whilst crop damage attributed to other species increased beyond pre-cull levels. Wildlife monitoring data suggest significant spatial and temporal variation in crop losses attributed to individual species, although baboon damage appears to occur more frequently, relative to other species, in farms located at the forest edge. This study provides the first quantitative assessment of crop damage by primates within Illubabor and serves as an initial exploratory analysis upon which future studies can build...|$|E

40|$|One {{major goal}} of {{prescription}} farming is to optimize application rates for seed fertilizer, and other agricultural inputs {{as a function}} of location within a field. There are four main components of a variable rate application system: (1) A method of determining the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> equipment (e. g. combines, tractors) within a field. (2) A system for controlling the application rate of materials (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides). (3) The capability to measure the results using a real time yield monitor. (4) An algorithm or prescription for determining what rates of materials to apply at each location. In this dissertation it is the fourth component that is the focus of the research. The main objective of this research was to develop a method of predicting yields {{as a function of}} position in the field {{that can be used to}} make fertilizer application rate decisions in a prescription farming system;The dissertation is organized into three parts: a discussion of general strategies for determining application rates and a review of the literature on research into in-field variability; development of a fuzzy logic yield model for predicting yields as a function of location; and discussion on implementation of a variable rate application system;In the yield model, rules combined yield data, weather data and estimated physical and chemical properties of the soil. The rules were adjusted manually for two transects and then applied to a third transect. Reasonably good agreement between measured and predicted yields at each position was obtained. The results indicated that this type of model could be combined with variable rate fertilizer application results and used as a decision support system for variable rate application. The results also indicated that it may be possible to develop a yield modeling program that operates only on yield history, weather data and application rates. However, the specific model described in this dissertation should not be used without incorporating some method of automatically optimizing the rules...|$|E
40|$|Effluent from a {{land based}} shrimp farm was {{detected}} in a receiving creek as changes in physical, {{chemical and biological}} parameters. The extent and severity of these changes depended on farm operations. This assessment was conducted at three different stages of shrimp-pond maturity, including (1) when the ponds were empty, (2) full and (3) being harvested. Methods for assessing farm effluent in receiving waters included physical/chemical analyses of the water column, phytoplankton bioassays and nitrogen isotope signatures of marine flora. Comparisons were made with an adjacent creek {{that served as the}} farms intake creek and did not directly receive effluent. Physical/chemical parameters identified distinct changes in the receiving creek with respect to farm operations. Elevated water column NH 4 + (18. 5 +/- 8. 0 muM) and chlorophyll a concentrations (5. 5 +/- 1. 9 mug/l) were measured when the farm was in operation, in contrast to when the farm was inactive (1. 3 +/- 0. 3 muM and 1. 2 +/- 0. 6 mug/l, respectively). At all times, physically chemical parameters {{at the mouth of the}} effluent creek, were equivalent to control values, indicating effluent was contained within the effluent-receiving creek. However, elevated delta(15) N signatures of mangroves (up to similar to 8 parts per thousand) and macroalgae (up to similar to 5 parts per thousand) indicated a broader influence of shrimp farm effluent, extending to the lower regions of the farms intake creek. Bioassays at upstream sites close to the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> effluent discharge indicated that phytoplankton at these sites did not respond to further nutrient additions, however downstream sites showed large growth responses. This suggested that further nutrient loading from the shrimp farm, resulting in greater nutrient dispersal, will increase the extent of phytoplankton blooms downstream from the site of effluent discharge. When shrimp ponds were empty water quality in the effluent and intake creeks was comparable. This indicated that observed elevated nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations were directly attributable to farm operations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the impact of economic and non-economic factors on the off-farm work efforts of Oregon farm husbands and wives. A total of 283 Oregon farm households (with husbands and wives) {{were randomly selected from}} lists of persons deferring taxes for farm purposes, obtained from County Assessors' offices in each of eight randomly selected counties. Counties with larger number of farms had a higher probability of being selected. Data came from an Oregon State University Agricultural Experiment Station study conducted during 1988 - 89. The empirical findings from the maximum likelihood Tobit model showed plausible directional impacts. Off-farm wage rate, the basis of a reduced labor supply model, was the key variable in explaining off-farm work. Wives' off-farm work response to off-farm wage was more elastic when compared to husbands' off-farm work. Additional significant variables to affect either or both husbands' and wives' total off-farm work were total farm debt, husband's age, education, urban/rural <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm,</b> net farm income, age-square, farm life satisfaction, and total family income before tax. Education was positively related to off-farm work only for wives. Results also indicate that high levels of net farm income as well as farm debt reduce the likelihood and extent of off-farm work. The location of the farm closer in proximity to metropolitan areas, was a significant factor in increased off-farm work hours. Farm life satisfaction was negatively significant for both wives and husbands. The effect of farm life satisfaction was more prominent for wives than for husbands. Total family income was significant and negatively related to wives' off-farm work but not husbands, indicating that women may be more sensitive to a choice for leisure or household work and the motivation for husbands' off-farm work may be higher. Despite a substantial incidence of low profitability and low farm income from farming and some unhappiness and hard work, these farmers generally reported a high level of satisfaction with their farming operations. Any policy implications based on {{the findings of this study}} must be cautiously interpreted based on farm types and the work motivation of farmers in Oregon...|$|E
