On {{the very first}} day of filming, he asked the actor to [...] "pick up the pace", {{prompting}} Brimley to reply, [...] "Hey, I didn't know anybody dropped it." [...] On another occasion, when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding, [...] "Now look, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> I'm Harry. Harry's not over there, Harry's not over here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I'm Harry, and whatever I do is fine 'cause I'm Harry." [...] Duvall said he believed the on-set wrangling resulted in a combination of the director's and actors' visions and ultimately improved the picture. Likewise, Beresford said he did not feel the fights negatively affected the film because he and Duvall never disagreed on the interpretation of the Mac Sledge character.|$|E

People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have {{the same level of}} connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult." ...|$|E
