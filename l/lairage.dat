40|$|Feed {{restriction}} {{and handling}} of animals {{destined to be}} slaughtered have are two factors that affect meat quality negatively. Where handling of slaughter animals is inevitable, fasting is applied to meat producing animals in the ante mortem period to minimise microbial contamination of carcasses or to lower the metabolic rate of certain cattle breeds as an adaptive mechanism to hot climates. From the present study, animals that are historically more docile had higher urinary catecholamine concentrations per se. By quantifying the relationship between catecholamines and animal temperament in cattle, selection of animals with a more favourable catecholamine profile, could enhance the ease of handling slaughter animals and reduce carcass bruising. The difference in urinary catecholamines of three commercial beef breeds types; Brahman, Nguni and Simmental; retained in <b>lairages</b> at an abattoir for either 24 or 3 hours ante mortem was measured. This was done in order to investigate whether longer feed withdrawal periods will lead to increased urinary catecholamine concentrations; a shift in post mortem energy metabolism and negative effects on meat quality. Catecholamine turnover rate from dopamine to norepinephrine and epinephrine, differed between breed types and feed withdrawal periods. Results indicated a relationship between energy metabolism, feed withdrawal period and catecholamine turnover. Twenty four hours feed withdrawal increased the rate of catecholamine turnover for Brahman and Nguni. Lower early post mortem glycogen together with higher glucose- 6 -phosphate indicated that glycogenolysis increased for this Brahman and Nguni just before slaughter. Twenty four hours feed withdrawal triggered glycogenolysis via increased catecholamine turnover from dopamine to norepinephrine and epinephrine for Brahman and Nguni. In contrast, feed restriction {{had no effect on}} catecholamine turnover. Slightly higher early post mortem glycogen and lower glucose- 6 -phosphate indicated lower energy metabolism for the Simmental breed type just before slaughter. It seemed as if feed restriction had an energy sparing effect on Simmental type cattle with a consequent negative effect on meat quality. Warner-Bratzler shear force results were the same among breed types when feed withdrawal was not longer than 3 hours and the values emphasise the importance of providing feed to animals kept in <b>lairages</b> or transported over long distances. When feed is available up until 3 hours before slaughter, irrespective of breed type, meat tenderness was not affected negatively. When feed was restricted, additional sarcomere shortening and creatine phosphate depletion while the carcass was still warm, occurred {{to such a degree that}} the meat from Simmental was tougher. It is clear that feed withdrawal of 24 hours has a significantly negative impact on Warner-Bratzler sheer force of Simmental. In this study with non-electrically stimulated carcasses it is clear that feed must be provided to Simmental up until 3 hours before slaughter to prevent excessive sarcomere shortening and meat toughness. This was explained by a probable lowered metabolic rate and changes in mitochondrial ATP turnover for the Simmental breed type. Cattle from differend breed types react differently to feed withdrawal periods and this knowledge should be applied in the meat industry to assure more consistent meat quality.

40|$|Abstract Robyn Petrie-Ritchie AN INVESTIGATION OF THE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO SECURE A FUTURE FOR THE PONY ON DARTMOOR: A BEHAVIOURAL AND OPINION BASED EVALUATION. The {{management}} of the pony (Equus Caballus) herds on Dartmoor commons has become a contentious issue between all stakeholders. There are three types of pony being bred on common land and {{only one of these}} is the recognised Dartmoor breed. However all originate from the same stock thought to have been introduced by Phoenician traders around 2000 years BCE. Recent changes to export laws and consequently market demand have meant the unhandled pony from Dartmoor now has little or no market. With no enforcement in place to control breeding, and {{as a consequence of the}} lack of market demand, up to 1500 ponies are being destroyed annually which is considered by many pony keepers, charities and members of the public to be an unacceptable form of management causing much negative media attention. Questions over what impact changing the management would have on the herds have caused there to be no agreed change. The results of this report have the potential to allow a management plan to be developed for common land, notably on Dartmoor, but also on other similar areas such as Bodmin. A semi structured questionnaire was designed and 51 farmers approached to gain a clear picture of the issues being faced. This report found that in 2014 a significant majority (92 %) of Pony keepers are in agreement that the management should change as opposed to staying as it is and a similar majority (69 %) wish to see Stallion Removal implemented as the method of breeding control. The behavioural impact on pony herds of three different breeding control strategies including stallion removal, stallion vasectomy and mare immuno-contraception were assessed based on extensive stallion and mare ethograms. All behavioural measures were non-parametric for both mare and stallion behaviours (all AD P< 0. 05). The results show that the removal of the stallion has no negative impact on behaviour. The proportions of time spent engaging in identified behaviours by mares under the three management plans differed. In the Stallion Removed herd the individuals within become less closely grouped (P< 0. 05). However, contrary to expectation (of those against SR) <b>lairages</b> (the areas the herds graze in) were not broken by mares when the stallion was removed. Overall the most effective form of breeding control on Dartmoor to reduce the unwanted foal ‘crop’ and achieve a high level of welfare which is supported by the majority of pony keepers, is the complete removal of ‘entire’ males from the open commons. In addition to removal of stallions, sterilisation of stallions was also found to be an effective option with herding behaviour kept high in this management option, which is highly supported by pony keepers. The findings of this report can be utilised to inform the future {{management of}} ponies on the moor. With the UK currently in a National Equine Crisis and with charities full of unwanted ponies a change to the existing management and implementation of a new breeding control plan is crucial on Dartmoor...|$|R

Preslaughter data from 13, 937 broiler flocks were recorded daily during 2006 in a commercial slaughterhouse in southeastern Brazil. The main factors that influenced daily mortality rate were mean dry bulb temperature and RH, <b>lairage</b> time, daily periods, density of broilers per crate, season of the year, stocking density per lorry, transport time, and distance between farms and slaughterhouse. A holding area at the slaughterhouse with environmental control was assessed. Using a double GLM for mean and dispersion modeling, the seasons were found to have significant effects (P < 0. 05) on average mortality rates. The highest incidence was observed in summer (0. 42 %), followed by spring (0. 39 %), winter (0. 28 %), and autumn (0. 23 %).

40|$|Three {{experiments}} using 63 pigs {{were conducted}} to determine if infrared thermography could segregate pigs based on subsequent pork quality. Pigs were subjectively classified as either “hot” or “normal” based on infrared surface temperature of the loin region prior to slaughter. In the first experiment 18 market weight pigs were transported, imaged by infrared thermography and slaughtered immediately after 1 to 4 h of <b>lairage.</b> Differences in meat quality were detected; hot pigs had lower a* (less red) and chroma (less intense red color) values, and higher hue angle (less red/more yellow) values, all of which indicate paler muscle color. In the second experiment, 27 market weight pigs were transported, held in <b>lairage</b> for 12 to 16 h, imaged by infrared thermography, and then slaughtered. In the third experiment, 18 market weight pigs were transported, imaged by infrared thermography, held in <b>lairage</b> for 12 to 16 h, and then slaughtered. Regardless of the time infrared images were taken, no meat quality differences between hot and normal pigs were detected when pigs were held in <b>lairage</b> for 12 to 16 h. These data suggest that measurement of live animal surface temperature by infrared thermography may allow for detection of poor meat quality if pigs are slaughtered without extended <b>lairage...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present experiment were 1) to {{study the effects of}} transport conditions and <b>lairage</b> duration on stress level, muscle glycolytic potential, and pork quality; and 2) to investigate whether the negative effects of high stress immediately preslaughter are affected by preceding handling factors (transport and <b>lairage).</b> In a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design, halothane-free pigs (n = 384) were assigned to either short (50 min) and smooth or long (3 h) and rough transport; long (3 h) or short (0. 30), tended to increase (P = 0. 06) muscle glycolytic potential. Long transport tended to increase (P = 0. 08) electrical conductivity, and decreased a* (P 0. 40) affected by high stress, but water-holding properties (measured by electrical conductivity, filter paper moisture, and drip loss) were impaired (P 0. 12) affected by any treatment. Comparisons with the "optimal" handling (short transport, long <b>lairage,</b> and minimal stress) revealed that, with regard to water-holding properties, the negative effects of high stress were aggravated by suboptimal transport and <b>lairage</b> conditions. High stress alone increased electrical conductivity by 56 %, whereas high stress in combination with short <b>lairage</b> led to an 88 % increase. However, high preslaughter stress contributed most and was the major factor responsible for reductions in pork quality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A study {{involving}} {{two groups}} of feedlot cattle (n = 84 and 112) was undertaken to compare the effect of two preslaughter <b>lairage</b> (L) durations (3 h v. 18 h) on carcass and meat quality properties. The cattle were grainfed for 150 days before slaughter and had a mean carcass weight of 347. 0 ± 25. 4 kg. Cattle from the same feedlot pen were randomly allocated to the two treatments {{on the day before}} slaughter. One group was transported to the abattoir the day before slaughter and held overnight (L– 18 h) whereas the other group remained at the feedlot and was transported the following morning and remained in the <b>lairage</b> for 3 h before slaughter (L– 3 h). After slaughter, meat quality was evaluated on a subset of 15 carcasses/lairage treatment from the two slaughter groups. Objective meat quality measures were made on unaged and 14 -day-aged striploins (longissimus lumborum) from these carcasses. Cattle from the reduced <b>lairage</b> treatment had heavier bled bodyweights at slaughter (P 0. 05) on carcass weight, muscle glycogen concentration, pH 3 h, ultimate pH, shear force or Minolta lightness values. Significant interactions (P< 0. 05) between <b>lairage</b> duration and aging were observed for cooking loss percentage and Minolta a ∗ and b ∗ values but these were relatively small in magnitude. There were no differences in the incidence of ingesta contamination or rumen rupture between the <b>lairage</b> treatments. It was concluded that shortening holding times in <b>lairage</b> from 18 to 3 h for cattle that have travelled < 6 h would not affect carcass or beef quality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in the <b>lairage</b> of a pork abattoir on different days of the week and to investigate the effect of daily wash-ing routines and disinfection procedures on contamination levels with Salmonella spp. In total, 359 swabs were collected from <b>lairage</b> pen floors at three time points during the course of two slaughter days. All samples were analysed quantitatively. On day 1 (Monday), following cleaning and disinfection, 6 % of samples were positive for Salmonella spp. On day 2 (Thursday), <b>lairage</b> pens were subjected to cold water washing in between batches of pigs; 44 % of samples were positive for Salmonella spp. The number of positive samples isolated increased significantly {{over the course of the}} slaughter week (P < 0. 001). Quantitative analysis revealed that the numbers of salmonellae rose from < 0. 46 organisms/ 100 cm 2 to levels of approximately 4 organisms/ 100 cm 2 over the course of the week. Introduction Studies have shown that the <b>lairage</b> environment in pork plants can be highly con-taminated with Salmonella enterica (Rostagno et al., 2003), (Swanenburg et al., 2001 a). In addi-tion it has been demonstrated that pigs can become rapidly infected with S. Typhimurium, when exposed to a contaminated environment (Hurd et al., 2001). Therefore the <b>lairage</b> may represent...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the effects of different <b>lairage</b> times and the position of chicken crates during transport to the slaughterhouse on the biochemical and hematological profile and physical parameters of broilers, such as color and pH of their breast meat. The treatments were defined by the animals slaughtered after 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours of <b>lairage</b> time at the slaughterhouse, transported in crates located in {{the top and bottom}} layers of the truck. It was found that increasing the <b>lairage</b> time at the slaughterhouse to over two hours reduced the number of lymphocytes and increased the heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and the basophil count in the hemogram. In addition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and cholesterol levels increased and plasma triglyceride and glucose levels decreased. The position of the crates in the truck altered the creatine kinase (CK) activity, and the highest enzyme activity was found in birds transported in the top layer of crates in the truck. Furthermore, the long <b>lairage</b> time in the slaughterhouse increased the pH and the value of a* (redness value) and decreased the lightness value of breast fillets. The interaction significant between 4 and 6 hours of <b>lairage</b> time and the position of the crate in the top layer of the truck favored the development of dark, firm, dry (DFD) meat...|$|E

40|$|With the aim to {{contribute}} to the determination of an adequate resting time for cattle after long transportation, the effects of different <b>lairage</b> times on some haematic parameters and meat quality of bulls subjected to long commercial journeys were investigated. Thirty-nine Limousine bulls supplied by one farm located near to Saragoza (Spain) were examined after 5 consignments at the final destination, following a journey of 2, 550 km to the “San Giorgio” abattoir (Palermo, Italy). Transport time was of 53. 6 ± 10. 9 h; <b>lairage</b> duration for bulls of the 1 st, 3 rd and 5 th consignments was of 31 h on average (“Short Lairage” group), whereas, for those of the 2 nd and 4 th consignments, was of 59 and 57 h, respectively (“Long Lairage” group). As regards the blood cell counts, data showed a significant effect (P 0. 05) affect the incidence of slight and severe carcass bruises. As regards meat quality, <b>lairage</b> duration significantly influenced the pHu which was higher (P< 0. 01) in the muscle of the “Long Lairage” group, the luminosity at 24 h post mortem which was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in animals of the “Short Lairage” group, and the red and yellow indices which were higher in the “Long Lairage” group. The “Short Lairage” group showed a lower (P< 0. 01) value of cooking loss and higher (P< 0. 01) value of tenderness. Data show that pre-slaughter <b>lairage</b> duration after a long transport may influence the blood parameters as well as meat quality. On the whole, the increase in <b>lairage</b> duration over 36 h does not determine any benefit for the animal’s well-being whereas it can cause a reduction in beef quality. For very long transports, {{it would be better to}} have an adequate organisation of the facilities in order to diminish the pre-slaughter <b>lairage</b> duration...|$|E
