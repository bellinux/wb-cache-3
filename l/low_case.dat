5000|$|With one exception, the {{clinical}} results {{are limited to}} case series and other non-comparative studies. In 2013 Anders et al. published results of a [...] randomized controlled trial (RCT) which was launched in 2004. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AMIC over microfracture. The outcome scores applied (modified ICRS, modified Cincinnati, VAS pain) showed no significance between the two treatment methods. Radiologic evaluation showed slightly inferior outcome for AMIC, especially with regard to the surface of the regenerate and degree of integration. The value of the study is limited due to <b>low</b> <b>case</b> numbers, short follow-up periods and weaknesses in the study design and implementation.|$|E
50|$|Carbonitriding {{also has}} other {{advantages}} over carburizing. To begin, {{it has a}} greater resistance to softening during tempering and increased fatigue and impact strength. It is possible to use both carbonitriding and carburizing together to form optimum conditions of deeper case depths and therefore performance of the part in industry. This method is applied particularly to steels with <b>low</b> <b>case</b> hardenability, such as {{the seat of the}} valve. The process applied is initially carburizing to the required case depth (up to 2.5 mm) at around 900-955°C, and then carbonitriding to achieve required carbonitrided case depth. The parts are then oil quenched, and the resulting part has a harder case than possibly achieved for carburization, and the addition of the carbonitrided layer increases the residual compressive stresses in the case such that the contact fatigue resistance and strength gradient are both increased.|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of imaging arrays for System-On-a-Chip (SOC) is aided by using fault-tolerant light sensors. Fault-tolerant redundancy in an Active Pixel Sensor (APS) is obtained by splitting the photodiode and readout transistors into two parallel operating devices, while keeping a common row select transistor. This creates a redundant APS that is self-correcting for most common faults. Simulations suggest that, by combining hardware fault-tolerance capability with software correction, Active Pixel Sensor arrays could be virtually immune to defects. To test this concept in hardware, a fault-tolerant photodiode APS {{was designed and}} fabricated using a CMOS 0. 18 µm process. Testing included both fully functional APS’, and those in which various failure modes and mechanisms are introduced (equivalent to stuck low and stuck high faults). Test {{results show that the}} output voltage for the stuck high case and the stuck <b>low</b> <b>case</b> varies linearly with light intensity. For the stuck <b>low</b> <b>case,</b> the sensitivity is 0. 57 of that for a non-defective redundant APS, and the stuck high case is 0. 40.

40|$|Background: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is {{the major}} cause of viral hepatitis. A few studies {{revealed}} that HCV genotypes; 3 a, 3 b, 1 a and 1 b {{are the most common}} genotypes found in the general population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Aims and Objective: The current is designed to find out the prevalence of HCV genotypes among both sexes of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Study Methods: The present study was carried out in various area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the period of July, 2012 to July, 2013. All the HCV positive samples were genotyped. The statistical analysis of the data was done by using Statistix 9. 0 software. Result: The results showed that the male, 53. 1 % (n= 340) were more infected as to female, 46. 8 % (n= 300).
