40|$|Abstract. The CTTN–system is a {{computer}} program which provides advanced processing of temporal notions. The basic data structures of the CTTN–system are time points, crisp and fuzzy time intervals, labelled partitionings of the time <b>line,</b> <b>durations,</b> and calendar systems. The la-belled partitionings are used to model periodic temporal notions, quite regular ones like years, months etc., partially regular ones like timeta-bles, but also very irregular ones like, for example, dates of a conference series. These data structures {{can be used in}} the temporal specification language GeTS (GeoTemporal Specifications). GeTS is a functional spec-ification and programming language with a number of built-in constructs for specifying customised temporal notions. CTTN is implemented as a Web server and as a C++ library. This paper gives a short overview over {{the current state of the}} system and its components. ...|$|R

50|$|In early 1995 Marshall Bus of Cambridge were {{contracted}} to overhaul all of West Midland Travel's Metrobus fleet. This {{was the largest}} used bus overhaul programme in Europe {{at the time and}} Marshalls set up a dedicated business division and staff to handle it. Many unavailable parts had to be sourced and made to original patterns by the Marshall procurement team. A production line was established in one of Marshall's aircraft hangars and anything up to 30 Metrobuses could be found in work at some stage along the <b>line.</b> <b>Duration</b> of refurbishment of each bus was usually 2-3 per week. No powerline items were included with the result that original engines were simply put back in the overhauled buses as they were. This had the effect that as the vehicles were driven from the West Midlands to Marshalls at Cambridge and driven back once completed, they frequently broke down. Over 600 mainly MkII metrobuses were overhauled and the contract ended abruptly in 1999 due to lack of confidence in Marshall Bus over delays with WMT orders for their new single deck buses. As a result of the unique experience gained by Marshall Bus on the Metrobus programme, they won a similar contract to overhaul Transport for London AEC Routemasters starting in 1999.|$|E

In this problem it is necessary to schedule several jobs. These jobs involve four processes: Printing, Laminating, Cutting and Packing and for each one of them there is a group of machines available (of similar characteristics). Each job is described by a list of four activities of given processing times, that perform the mentioned processes in that order. Each activity is performed on just one machine. For our application the scheduling must also try to verify certain conditions. For each process there is a list of attributes.

In this paper I show that there are faults both in their original argument, and in the claims which underlie it. I present new data, based on the measurement of <b>line</b> <b>durations</b> in publicly available recorded performances of 54 metrical poems; in this corpus, lines of performed metrical verse are often longer than three seconds: 59 % of the 1155 lines are longer than 3 seconds, 40 % longer than 3. 5 seconds and 26 % longer than 4 seconds. On the basis of weaknesses in the original paper, and the new data presented here, I propose, against Turner and Pöppel, {{that there is no}} evidence that lines of verse are constrained by a time-limited psychological capacity...|$|R

Due to its importance in the global maintenance of both rolling stock and infrastructure, this topic deserved the attention of several regulations in the last decade. In order to investigate the effects of electro-mechanical wear on both contact wire and contact strip, a new test equipment has been designed and installed at Politecnico di Milano. A series of tests have been performed, involving different kinds of collector strip materials and contact conditions, tested at varying speeds and current intensities. This investigation concerned different collector strip configurations intended for 3 kV D. C. lines. The combination of different contents of copper and metallised carbon in the collector has been found to influence the wear rate of both collector strip and contact wire.

40|$|The {{first product}} to be {{clinically}} evaluated as a microbicide contained the nonionic surfactant nonoxynol- 9 (nonylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol; N- 9). Many laboratories have used N- 9 {{as a control}} compound for microbicide assays. However, no published comparisons of the results among laboratories or attempts to establish standardized protocols for preclinical testing of microbicides have been performed. In this study, we compared results from 127 N- 9 toxicity and 72 efficacy assays that were generated in five different laboratories {{over the last six}} years and were performed with 14 different cell lines or tissues. Intra-assay reproducibility was measured at two-, three-, and fivefold differences using standard deviations. Interassay reproducibility was assessed using general linear models, and interaction between variables was studied using step-wise regression. The intra-assay reproducibility within the same N- 9 concentration, cell type, assay duration, and laboratory was consistent at the twofold level of standard deviations. For interassay reproducibility, cell <b>line,</b> <b>duration</b> of assay, and N- 9 concentration were all significant sources of variability (P 24 h) and short (< 2 h) exposures of cells to N- 9 showed variability, while assays with 4 to 8 h of N- 9 exposure gave results that were not significantly different. This is the first analysis to compare preclinical N- 9 toxicity levels that were obtained by different laboratories using various protocols. This comparative work can be used to develop standardized microbicide testing protocols that will help advance potential microbicides to clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Large {{individual}} differences between adult laying hens in their propensity for feather pecking {{are known to}} exist. However, not much research {{has been carried out}} into the {{individual differences}} concerning the development of feather pecking behaviour. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether contrasting levels of feather pecking, observed among adult birds from two lines of laying hens, already occur at an early age. Further-more, an important question to be discussed was whether different behavioural systems may be related to the occurrence of feather pecking. Therefore, this study consisted of studying and comparing the behaviour of White Leghorn laying hens from a high (HFP) and low feather pecking line (LFP) during the first 8 weeks of life. Chicks were reared in litter-floor pens and were kept in groups of five animals per line (12 groups per line). HFP chicks showed significantly higher levels of gentle feather pecking (gentle FP) than LFP chicks at the age of 14 and 28 days. Furthermore, HFP chicks spent significantly more time preening than LFP chicks on days 14, 28 and 41. Duration of foraging behaviour and feeding behaviour was significantly higher in the LFP line compared to the HFP line on days 41 and 56 and days 28, 41 and 56, respectively. HFP chicks showed a significant negative correlation between gentle FP and preening on days 3 (r = - 0. 49) and 41 (r = - 0. 86). In the LFP <b>line</b> <b>duration</b> of feeding correlated negatively with gentle FP on day 3 (r = - 0. 63). A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that in the HFP line, gentle FP and preening exhibited high and opposite loadings on the same component at all ages, whereas feeding consistently loaded on the other component. This outcome contrasted with that of the LFP line. In this line feeding predominantly loaded on the same principal component as gentle FP with loadings opposite to those of gentle FP, whereas preening showed the same loadings as gentle FP, on days 3 and 41. In conclusion, differences in feather pecking behaviour between HFP and LFP chicks can already be observed at a very early age during development. Furthermore, our results indicate that HFP and LFP chicks differ in the way pecking behaviour is targeted. This difference could be related to the existence of a difference in underlying motivational system controlling the development of feather pecking between the two lines. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.
