50|$|One of {{the generic}} uses of a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> as {{mentioned}} previously includes as a lid for beakers. In {{this case a}} <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> is placed above the container, which {{makes it easier to}} control and alter vapour saturation conditions. Moreover, a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> is often used to house solids being weighed on the scale. Prior to weighing desired amount of solid, a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> is placed on the scale, followed by taring or zeroing the scale so that only the weight of the sample substance is obtained.|$|R
50|$|<b>Watch</b> <b>glasses</b> {{are named}} {{so because they}} {{are similar to the}} glass used for the front of old-fashioned pocket watches. In {{reference}} to this, large <b>watch</b> <b>glasses</b> are occasionally known as clock glasses.|$|R
50|$|There are two types, <b>Glass</b> <b>watch</b> <b>glasses</b> and Plastic <b>watch</b> <b>glasses</b> {{used in the}} laboratory. These watch-glasses are {{available}} in various sizes and widths. Watch-glass are usually thicker than any other glass or plastic lab-ware.|$|R
50|$|Not {{only can}} a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> {{be used for}} observing {{precipitation}} patterns and crystals, {{it can also be}} used for drying solids. When further drying is required, a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> is often used in cases where a particular type of solid needs to be separated from its comparatively volatile solvent. The solid is spread on a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> and, often time, a folded filter paper is placed above to keep out airborne particles from contaminating the product.|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of a spout means that the beaker cannot have a lid. However, when in use, beakers may be covered by a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> to prevent contamination or loss of the contents, but allowing venting via the spout. Alternatively, a beaker may be covered with another larger beaker that has been inverted, though a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> is preferable.|$|R
50|$|To {{maximize}} the drying rate, a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> {{can be placed}} inside a fume hood to provide good air circulation for a adequate amount of time. Another technique used in chemistry laboratories to increase the drying rate is passing a gentle stream of dry air or nitrogen gas over the <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> from an inverted funnel clamped above it.|$|R
30|$|After {{complete}} spawning, {{the worms}} {{were removed from}} the <b>watch</b> <b>glasses.</b> The <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> with eggs and seawater was slightly swirled or rotated {{in such a way that}} the bigger and heavier mature eggs settled in the center and the lighter and smaller eggs remained at the periphery of the <b>watch</b> <b>glass.</b> Such smaller eggs along with some seawater were decanted out. This process was repeated five times. By this method, the eggs were also washed well. Only bigger, heavier, and healthier eggs were selected for the experiment, and unwanted debris was removed. Eggs were used for the experiment within 15  min of release.|$|R

50|$|Plastic <b>watch</b> <b>glasses</b> - These are {{disposable}} watch-glass used {{in laboratory}} work {{to avoid any}} cross-contamination while preparing the samples.

These plastic <b>watch</b> <b>glasses</b> are less expensive and light in weight.|$|R

50|$|A <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> is a {{circular}} concave {{piece of glass}} used in chemistry as a surface to evaporate a liquid, to hold solids while being weighed, for heating {{a small amount of}} substance and as a cover for a beaker. The latter use is generally applied to prevent dust or other particles entering the beaker; the <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> does not completely seal the beaker, so gas exchanges still occur.|$|R

40|$|Some dosimetric {{properties}} of <b>watch</b> <b>glasses</b> were studied applying the thermoluminescence technique. The <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> samples were powdered, and the selected grains were mixed with Teflon (TM). The mixture was pressed and sintered to produce pellets of watch glass-Teflon (TM) composites. The glow curves of the pellets show two peaks at 130 and 195 degrees C. Reproducibility of TL response {{was estimated to}} have a maximum coefficient of variation of 4. 0 %. The dose-response curve is sublinear between 0. 5 and 20. 0 kGy. The calibration curve is linear between 1. 0 Gy and 1. 0 kGy. The minimum detection limits were also determined. The gamma radiation dose response and the thermal stability of the materials were studied with the purpose to establish the best conditions of <b>watch</b> <b>glasses</b> for use in gamma radiation dosimetry.
