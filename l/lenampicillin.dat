40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{properties of}} <b>lenampicillin</b> (KBT- 1585), a new ampicillin ester, were investigated in 41 healthy volunteers. The maximum concentration of ampicillin in serum after oral administration of 400 mg of <b>lenampicillin</b> was 6. 5 micrograms/ml at 0. 70 h, and {{that after a}} equimolar dosage of ampicillin was 2. 9 micrograms/ml at 0. 87 h...|$|E
40|$|A {{crossover}} study was performed comparing serum kinetics and urinary excretion in six healthy, fasting volunteers after ingcstion of comparable amounts of <b>lenampicillin,</b> bacampicillin and amoxycillin. Venous blood samples and urine samples were taken at intervals for 6 and 12 h respectively post-tablet ingestion and assayed for free ampicillin or amoxycillin concentration with Bacillus sub tilts as indicator organism. The most rapid T ^ {{and the highest}} CmMX were achieved with <b>lenampicillin.</b> The AUC was similar for <b>lenampicillin,</b> bacampicillin and amoxycillin as was the total percentage urinary recovery of antibiotic. Potential pharmacokinetic advantage of orally administered <b>lenampicillin</b> and bacampicillin compared to comparable doses of amoxycillin are higher peak serum concentrations (12 - 0 mg/ 1 lenampicillin; 9 - 7 mg/ 1 bacampicillin; 7 - 6 mg/ 1 amoxycillin) and more rapid time to peak concentration (0 - 6 h lenampicillin; 07 h bacampicillin and 1 - 4 h amoxycillin) ...|$|E
40|$|Olmesartan medoxomil (OM) is a prodrug type {{angiotensin}} II type 1 receptor antagonist widely prescribed as an antihypertensive agent. Herein, {{we describe}} the identification and characterization of the OM bioactivating enzyme that hydrolyzes the prodrug and converts to its pharmacologically active metabolite olmesartan in human liver and intestine. The protein was purified from human liver cytosol by successive column chromatography and was identified by mass spectrometry to be a carboxymethylenebutenolidase (CMBL) homolog. Human CMBL, whose endogenous function has still not been reported, is a human homolog of Pseudomonas dienelactone hydrolase involved in the bacterial halocatechol degradation pathway. The ubiquitous expression of human CMBL gene transcript in various tissues was observed. The recombinant human CMBL expressed in mammalian cells was clearly shown to activate OM. By comparing the enzyme kinetics and chemical inhibition properties between the recombinant protein and human tissue preparations, CMBL was demonstrated {{to be the primary}} OM bioactivating enzyme in the liver and intestine. The recombinant CMBL also converted other prodrugs having the same ester structure as OM, faropenem medoxomil and <b>lenampicillin,</b> to their active metabolites. CMBL exhibited a unique sensitivity to chemical inhibitors, thus, being distinguishable from other known esterases. Site-directed mutagenesis on the putative active residue Cys 132 of the recombinant CMBL caused a drastic reduction of the OM-hydrolyzing activity. We report {{for the first time that}} CMBL serves as a key enzyme in the bioactivation of OM, hydrolyzing the ester bond of the prodrug type xenobiotics...|$|E
