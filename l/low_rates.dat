5|$|In the r/K-selection model, {{the first}} {{variable}} r is the intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} in population {{size and the}} second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r-selected characteristics. In contrast, a K-selected species has <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} occur with treatment; for example a {{granuloma}} can form at the suture site. Also, the sutured wound can tear again, as occurs {{when there is}} excessive pressure in the airways from ventilation. However, {{for people who do}} receive surgery soon after the injury to repair the lesion, outcome is usually good; the long-term outcome is good for over 90% of people who have TBI surgically repaired early in treatment. Even when surgery is performed years after the injury, the outlook is good, with <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> of death and disability and good chances of preserving lung function.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — <b>Low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS {{attacks are}} {{emerging}} {{threats to the}} TCP traffic, and the VoIP traffic in the Internet. They are hard to detect as they intelligently send attack traffic inside the network to evade current router based congestion control mechanisms. We propose a practical attack model in which botnets that can pose {{a serious threat to}} the Internet are considered. Under this model, an attacker can scatter bots across the Internet to launch the <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack, thus essentially orchestrating the <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack that uses random and continuous IP address spoofing, but with valid legitimate IP addresses. It is difficult to detect and mitigate such an attack. We propose a <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack detection algorithm, which relies on the core characteristic of the <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack in introducing high rate traffic for short periods, and then uses a proactive test based differentiation technique to filter the attack packets. The proactive test was originally proposed to defend DDoS attacks and <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attacks which tend to ignore the normal operation of network protocols, but it is tailored here to differentiate the legitimate traffic from the <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack traffic instigated by botnets. It leverages on the conformity of legitimate flows, which obey the network protocols. It mainly differentiates legitimate connections by checking their responses to the proactive tests which include puzzles for distinguishing botnets from human users. We finally evaluate and demonstrate the performance of the proposed <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack detection and mitigation algorithm on the real Internet traces.

5|$|White's {{ability to}} attract new writers {{suffered}} because of the <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was not selling elsewhere. White made a deal in 1971 with Gordon Eklund, who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed {{it was a good}} story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic over the next few years.|$|E

5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a lesser}} extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> of reproduction and movement.|$|E

5|$|At this time, Cantillon became {{involved}} with British mercantilist John Law through the Mississippi Company. Based on the monetary theory proposed by William Potter in his 1650 tract The Key of Wealth, John Law posited that increases in the money supply {{would lead to the}} employment of unused land and labour, leading to higher productivity. In 1716, the French government granted him both permission to found the Banque Générale and virtual monopoly over the right to develop French territories in North America, named the Mississippi Company. In return, Law promised the French government to finance their debt at <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> of interest. Law began a financial speculative bubble by selling shares of the Mississippi Company, using the Banque Générales virtual monopoly on the issue of bank notes to finance his investors.|$|E

The park is once again a major centre of employment in Trafford, and its regeneration has led to a high start-up rate for businesses and <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> of unemployment in the area.

5|$|Degenerate {{stars have}} {{contracted}} into a compact mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid rate of rotation.

5|$|In a {{study of}} a {{district}} general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital's self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3 although the self-harm rates {{for males and females}} over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a history of earlier self-harm, while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low, which could be explained by the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition, such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse. However, NICE Guidance on Self-harm in the UK suggests that older people who self-harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 older people who self-harm going on to end their life. A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self-harm, but comparatively <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> of suicide.|$|E

Ralph Klein's folksy appeal helped the Progressive Conservatives renew themselves. He led the party through two elections, gaining in popularity each time. The price of oil rebounded and the government, despite <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> of taxes on the wealthy and corporations, was showing a surplus of $3 billion every year. In early 2004, Klein announced that the Alberta debt had been paid in full. He was rewarded by voters in the 2004 election, despite running a campaign with no new policies. His party lost a number of seats, and during the campaign he stated this would be his last election. In 2006 at a Progressive Conservative convention delegates forced him to pick a retirement date by giving him relatively low numbers in a leadership review.|$|E
