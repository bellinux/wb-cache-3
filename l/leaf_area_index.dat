In the first part, a land use and land cover classification system (RUB-LUGS: Ruhr University Bochum-Land Use and Land Cover Classification System) is developed for providing distributed information for hydrological modelling and for detection of distributed land use changes. Applying this system to Landsat data, land use time series is created for hydrological modelling of effects of man-made changes in the Sauer River Basin. In the second part, equations are established for estimating <b>leaf</b> <b>area</b> <b>indices</b> using vegetation indices calculated from remote sensing data and a two stream approximation model for estimating <b>leaf</b> <b>area</b> <b>indices</b> is applied to the Sauer River Basin.

25|$|The open {{canopy of}} cumin is another problem. Only a low {{proportion}} of the incoming light is absorbed. The <b>leaf</b> <b>area</b> <b>index</b> (LAI) of cumin is low (about 1.5). This might be a problem because weeds can compete with cumin for essential resources such as water and light and thereby lower yield. The slow growth and a short stature of cumin favours weed competition additionally. Two hoeing and weeding sessions (30 and 60 days after sowing) are needed for the control of weeds. During the first weeding session (30 days after sowing), thinning should be done, as well, to remove excess plants. The use of preplant or pre-emergence herbicides is very effective in India, but this kind of herbicide application requires soil moisture for a successful weed control.|$|E

40|$|Climate change {{predictions}} {{derived from}} coupled carbon-climate models are {{highly dependent on}} assumptions about feedbacks between the biosphere and atmosphere. One critical feedback occurs if C uptake by the biosphere increases {{in response to the}} fossil-fuel driven increase in atmospheric [CO 2] (“CO 2 fertilization”), thereby slowing the rate of increase in atmospheric [CO 2]. Carbon exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere are often first represented in models as net primary productivity (NPP). However, the contribution of CO 2 fertilization to the future global C cycle has been uncertain, especially in forest ecosystems that dominate global NPP, and models that include a feedback between terrestrial biosphere metabolism and atmospheric [CO 2] are poorly constrained by experimental evidence. We analyzed the response of NPP to elevated CO 2 (≈ 550 ppm) in four free-air CO 2 enrichment experiments in forest stands. We show that the response of forest NPP to elevated [CO 2] is highly conserved across a broad range of productivity, with a stimulation at the median of 23 ± 2 %. At low <b>leaf</b> <b>area</b> <b>indices,</b> {{a large portion of the}} response was attributable to increased light absorption, but as <b>leaf</b> <b>area</b> <b>indices</b> increased, the response to elevated [CO 2] was wholly caused by increased light-use efficiency.
