The base ingredients for a nimono is typically a vegetable, fish, seafood, or tofu, either singly, or in combination. The shiru stock for a nimono is generally dashi. Other than sake and soy sauce, the stock can be further flavored by mirin, sugar, salt, vinegar, miso, or other condiments. A heavy covered pot is used in making nimono in order to spread the heat evenly throughout the ingredients during the simmering process.|$|E
50|$|The rectum ampulla (anatomically also: ampulla recti) {{temporarily}} stores fecal waste. As {{the waste}} fills the rectum and expands the rectal walls, nervous system stretch receptors in the rectal walls stimulate {{the desire to}} defecate. This urge to defecate arises from the reflex contraction of rectal muscles, relaxation of the internal anal sphincter, and an initial contraction of the skeletal muscle of the external anal sphincter. If the urge is not acted upon, the material in the rectum is often returned to the colon by reverse peristalsis, where more water is absorbed and the faeces is stored until the next mass peristaltic movement of the transverse and descending colon. If defecation is delayed for a prolonged period the fecal matter may harden, resulting in constipation. If defecation occurs too fast, before excess <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> <b>absorbed,</b> diarrhea may occur.|$|E
40|$|It has {{previously}} been determined that different acids have different effects on molecular weight, and that methanol greatly increases degradation, while ethanol, though very similar in structure and properties, has no effect. This leads to the study that {{is the focus of}} this thesis. Our goal is to determine if the reason some acids or alcohols have different effects on the polymer is because of the extent of diffusion into the polymer matrix. The theory is that depending on molecular size, not all acids/alcohols will <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> to the same extent and therefore not have the same opportunity to react. We determine how differently sized molecules <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the polymer by aging polyamide- 11 beads in various acid and alcohol solutions.

Chicken plov is rare but found in traditional recipes originating in Bukhara. Plov is usually spiced with whole black cumin, coriander, barberries, red pepper, marigold, and pepper. Heads of garlic and garbanzo beans are buried into the rice during cooking. Sweet variations with dried apricots, cranberries and raisins are prepared on special occasions.|$|E

Such a composite can be used for cooling febrile patients by evaporative cooling as the evaporative cooling liquid in the matrix changes from a liquid to a gaseous state to absorb thermal energy. The composite can be made with a perforated barrier material around the outside to regulate the evaporation rate of the phase change liquid. Alternatively, the composite can be made with an imperveous barrier material or semipermeable membrane on one side to prevent the liquid from contacting the person's skin. The evaporative cooling liquid in the matrix can be recharged by soaking the material in the liquid. The multilayer composite material can be fashioned into blankets, garments and other articles...|$|E

The system has aspects of both transient and supersolidus liquid phase sintering. Zinc melts and eutectic liquids form during heating to the sintering temperature but these <b>liquid</b> phases <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the aluminium on further heating. Sintering above the solidus induces the formation of additional liquid.

5000|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{ultrasonic}} nozzles can be effectively used to manufacture Proton exchange membrane fuel cells. The inks typically used are a platinum-carbon suspension, wherein the platinum acts as a catalyst inside the cell. Traditional methods to apply the catalyst to the proton exchange membrane typically involve screen printing or doctor-blades. However, this method can have undesirable cell performance due to the tendency of the catalyst to form agglomerations resulting in non-uniform gas flow in the cell and prohibiting the catalyst from being fully exposed and running {{the risk that the}} solvent or carrier <b>liquid</b> may <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the membrane, both of which impeded proton exchange efficiency. [...] When ultrasonic nozzles are used, the spray can be made to be as dry as necessary {{by the nature of the}} small and uniform droplet size, by varying the distance the droplets travel and by applying low heat to the substrate such that the droplets dry in the air before reaching the substrate. Process engineers have finer control over these types of variables as opposed to other technologies. Additionally, because the ultrasonic nozzle imparts energy to the suspension just prior to and during atomization, possible agglomerates in the suspension are broken up resulting in homogenous distribution of the catalyst, resulting in higher efficiency of the catalyst and in turn, the fuel cell.|$|R
