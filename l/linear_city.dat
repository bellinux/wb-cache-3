25|$|Many of the Constructivists {{hoped to}} see their ambitions {{realised}} during the 'Cultural Revolution' that accompanied the first five-year plan. At this point the Constructivists were divided between urbanists and disurbanists who favoured a garden city or <b>linear</b> <b>city</b> model. The <b>Linear</b> <b>City</b> was propagandised {{by the head of}} the Finance Commissariat Nikolay Milyutin in his book Sozgorod, aka Sotsgorod (1930). This was taken to a more extreme level by the OSA theorist Mikhail Okhitovich. His disurbanism proposed a system of one-person or one-family buildings connected by linear transport networks, spread over a huge area that traversed the boundaries between the urban and agricultural, in which it resembled a socialist equivalent of Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City. The disurbanists and urbanists proposed projects for new cities such as Magnitogorsk were often rejected in favour of the more pragmatic German architects fleeing Nazism, such as 'May Brigade' (Ernst May, Mart Stam, Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky), the 'Bauhaus Brigade' led by Hannes Meyer, and Bruno Taut.|$|E

The design was a radical {{plan for the}} reorganization and expansion of the capital in order to cater for a population beyond 10 million. The design was for a <b>linear</b> <b>city</b> that used a series of nine-kilometre modules that stretched 80km across Tōkyō Bay from Ikebukuro in the north west to Kisarazu in the south east. The perimeter {{of each of the}} modules was organised into three levels of looping highways, as Tange was adamant that an efficient communication system would be the key to modern living. The modules themselves were organised into building zones and transport hubs and included office, government administration and retail districts as well as a new Tōkyō train station and highway links to other parts of Tōkyō. Residential areas were to be accommodated on parallel streets that ran perpendicular to the main linear axis and like the Boston Bay project, people would build their own houses within giant A-frame structures.|$|E

A numerical experiment is conducted to test the model. The results obtained are compared with results from a previous study where a deterministic approach was employed in modelling the equilibrium instead of the Logit approach...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores {{a design}} of a colony in outer space able to comfortably sustain a dense growing {{population}} of 1 million inhabitants. This visionary colony, will exist in the Moon-Earth Lagrange Point 1 and aims {{to take advantage of}} the unique physical, phenomenological, and technological aspects of space while providing a level of comfort on par with that of a first world city. This paper engages the practice of architecture by exploring beyond our current ability to shape our habitation, examining a new frontier, one enabled by being surrounded in outer space. Ultimately the work seeks to answer the question of ‘what sequence of events will allow for a self-sustaining and expanding city in space, and what type of life may we lead within?’ The major studies in this thesis revolve primarily around four categories: the potential technology required, the abstract mechanics of how various systems would interact to support life, the timeline that would be required for a space colony to be built, and the urban design that a city of the sky should enjoy. The goal is to synthesize these areas and ultimately determine the schematic design approach for the creation of a space colony. To this end topics relating to energy production, mining, ecological footprint, modern scenes of fantasy, mechanical and structural engineering, alternative housing, <b>linear</b> <b>cities</b> and political governing will be explored topics of study. The overarching goal of all of this is to discover how we can to build a habitat in orbital space based on our current and projected technology, and to explore the emerging field of space urbanism...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of {{population}} uncertainty on the socially optimum timing of a congestion-relief project in a <b>linear</b> monocentric <b>city</b> with fixed boundaries, where congestion pricing cannot be implemented. This project requires time to bear fruit but no urban land. Under certainty, we show that utility maximization is roughly equivalent to a standard benefit-cost analysis (BCA). Under Uncertainty, we derive an explicit optimal threshold for relieving congestion when the urban population follows a geometric Brownian motion. If the time to implement the project is short, we show analytically that deciding on the timing of congestion relief based on a BCA could lead to acting prematurely; the reverse holds if project implementation is long and uncertainty is large enough.

50|$|Milyutin's {{concept of}} city {{development}} outlined in his 1930 book, Sotsgorod (Socialist City), was superficially similar {{to an earlier}} de-urbanist concept of a <b>linear</b> <b>city</b> put forward by Mikhail Okhitovich. Unlike Okhitovich, whose <b>linear</b> <b>city</b> was terminated with industrial hubs and thus limited in growth, Milyutin's concept allowed for practically unrestricted linear growth. Milyutin as an economist was very well aware of construction costs and shortage of funds {{in the period of}} rapid industrialisation, and carefully weighed costs and benefits of available growth scenarios. His concept was based on decentralisation of industry, which needed to be spread in a thin line along a mainline railroad route, ideally - according to the natural flow of production from raw supplies to finished goods (Milyutin concentrated on gigantic mass production plants like the GAZ or the STZ). The housing zone, separated from the industrial zone by a park strip, would develop concurrently, and ideally residents will be settled directly across their employers, eliminating the need for private or public transportation. In another departure from <b>linear</b> <b>city,</b> he did not insist on building housing in a continuous strip; on the contrary, Milyutin proposed a less expensive model of initially isolated housing hubs spread along the main line which might, eventually, merge into a continuous housing belt.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple spatial equilibrium {{model for a}} <b>linear</b> monocentric <b>city</b> to investigate the effects of rationing and pricing on morning commuters' travel cost and modal choice behavior in each location. Under rationing and pricing, {{every day in the}} morning peak hour, each commuter is classified as either "free" or "rationed". "Free" commuters are allowed to use the highway without paying the toll, whereas "rationed" commuters can avoid the toll only if they travel by transit. Each day, a fraction of commuters are rationed in their free use of the highway, and the rationing fractions are determined systematically so that everyone is equally rationed in a given period. It is found that Pareto-improving rationing and pricing scheme might be obtained as a combination of the rationing degree and the toll associated with rationing. Extension to the rationing and pricing scheme with cordon and park-and-ride service has been made. Cordon and park-and-ride might help in improving the efficiency of rationing and pricing strategy although remains its Pareto-improving property. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new model for {{investigating}} the effects of integrated rail and property development {{on the design of}} rail line services in a <b>linear</b> monocentric <b>city,</b> in which the property development rights at railway station areas are conferred to a private rail operator. The proposed model allows an explicit consideration of the interaction between two types of agents in the economy: (1) a private rail operator who seeks to optimize rail service variables-rail line length, number and spacing of stations, headway and fare-to maximize its own net profit, which is the sum of revenues from passenger fare-box and property development; and (2) households who choose the residential locations that maximize their own utilities subject to a budget constraint. The solution properties of the proposed model are analyzed, and a heuristic solution algorithm is presented. An illustrative example is used to show the application of the proposed model. The findings show that integrated rail and property development can change a city's land-use pattern and housing market (in terms of housing density, space, and price), and its economic viability is closely related to household income level and residential density of the city. © 2012. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
