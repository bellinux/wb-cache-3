5|$|Since the attack, Canadians have debated various {{interpretations of}} the events, their significance, and Lépine's motives. Many feminist groups and public {{officials}} have characterized the massacre as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal violence against women. Consequently, {{the anniversary of the}} massacre has since been commemorated as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. Other interpretations emphasize Lépine's abuse as a child or suggest that the massacre was simply the isolated act of a madman, unrelated to <b>larger</b> <b>social</b> issues. Still other commentators have blamed violence in the media and increasing poverty, isolation, and alienation in society, particularly in immigrant communities.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the <b>larger</b> <b>social</b> good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E
5|$|The Danebod Gym Hall {{was erected}} in 1904 {{and is a}} {{cruciform}} clapboard building. The {{two sides of the}} entrance arm project forward to the eaves, and the sides plus a small roof enclose the entrance. It was originally built as a space for Danish gymnastics, folk dancing, music, theatrical performances, <b>larger</b> <b>social</b> gatherings, and worship for the Folk School students and other locals. Every year in the Gym Hall, the Danebod Lutheran Church upholds the Danish tradition of dancing around the Christmas tree. The basement is also commonly used for crafts such as stained glass and woodworking. In 1928 it was enlarged with a stage, basement and furnace. Many home talent plays were presented there, and it is still used for an occasional play, and is also used by the camps and retreats for folk dancing. Points of interest are the statue with an original canvas curtain with advertising, bars used years ago by gymnasts (on the south wall), and the original wainscoting on the walls.|$|E

5|$|The older houses relied {{mainly on}} heating from open coal fires, {{which led to}} {{problems}} with smog (in 1962, 24 deaths in Leeds were attributed to this), although this problem was partially relieved in the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} the Clean Air Act 1956. Although a slum clearance scheme was under way in the 1930s, it took until after the Second World War, for the scheme to get well under way. In the 1950s, the largest social housing project began with the building of the Seacroft Estate. Seacroft was planned at the time to be a 'Satellite town within the city limits'. The building of new council estates was most prevalent in the city's east end and because of this the city expanded much further East {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century then it did any other direction. The Langbar Gardens Estate (completed 1966) in Swarcliffe lay right on the eastern fringes of the city sprawl until it was demolished in the early 21st century, including the high-profile implosions of Langbar Towers, Langbar Grange and Ash Tree Grange. By the 1960s and 1970s land for social housing was becoming scarcer and the council started looking towards building 'high rise', with such estates as Cottingley sporting prominent tower blocks. By the 1970s less land was available for such developments and the particularly large estates were becoming unpopular, however faced with a need for a <b>larger</b> <b>social</b> housing stock, Leeds City Council built smaller estates such as Holt Park (in partnership with Norman Ashton), replaced the prefabricated 'war houses' in Cottingley with newer prefabs and redeveloped areas such as Beckhill in Meanwood.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} the letter being {{addressed}} directly to D'Alembert, it is undoubtedly meant {{to have an effect}} on the general population. The work is famous for displaying Rousseau's charismatic rhetoric and digressive tendencies, all with his personal experience woven into the text. It may be considered to portray Rousseau's vanity, narcissism and biases, but the text could also be thought of more positively; as expressive, lyrical and austere. The Letter shows Rousseau's tendency to think of the events in his own life as highly significant, as reflections of the <b>larger</b> <b>social</b> picture. An example is how the Letter itself is open and expressive in style, while the content of the Letter is about this openness.|$|E
25|$|The word utility {{is used to}} mean general {{well-being}} or happiness, and Mill's view is that utility is {{the consequence}} of a good action. Utility, {{within the context of}} utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. With social utility, he means the well-being of many people. Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that people really do desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a <b>larger</b> <b>social</b> utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.|$|E

Although most fought for Americans, there were several who fought for the Loyalists and as a result had their own plantations destroyed.|$|E

25|$|The Antioch Review, {{founded in}} 1941, {{is one of}} the oldest {{continuously}} publishing literary magazines in America. They publish fiction, essays, and poetry from both emerging as well as established authors. Throughout the history of the magazine questions about race, ethnicity, sex, education, and the American experience have had a large place. Academic questions in their formal sense have not loomed large, and the magazine’s policy of refusing to run footnotes is, in fact, a statement about the non- (rather than anti-) academic nature of the journal. Academics by the score have contributed, but always within a belles-lettres or journalistic tradition. So the magazine was open to both Malcolm Bradbury and Eric Bentley, sans footnotes. The Antioch Review has always avoided narrow academic debates and tried to suggest that although professors may be for the academy, their commentaries can bear on <b>larger</b> <b>social</b> and intellectual processes. The Review has always tried to be a forum for new writers and ideas in poetry and the short story.|$|E
25|$|Having {{spent time}} amongst the artists of Paris in the 1920s, McKay was intimately {{acquainted with the}} {{dynamics}} between painters and models {{and the manner in}} which modernist painters presented African subjects and African culture. In her article, “Caribbean Models for Modernism in the Work of Claude McKay and Jean Rhys,” Leah Rosenberg writes, “The fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and avant-garde primitivism”. The inclination to stereotype and caricatures the African physical form created, however inadvertently, a form of hegemony reminiscent to McKay of the colonialism he grew up with in Jamaica. “Sexuality and black culture,” Rosenberg explains, “held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from Picasso to Gertrude Stein”. In need of money, McKay posed nude for the Cubist painter Andre Lhote. Through his experience, McKay saw first-hand how the <b>larger</b> <b>social</b> hegemony between European white supremacy and people of Afro-Caribbean descent could play itself out between the artist and its subject. McKay critically recalled the experience in various ways in many of his most notable works. In doing so, he shined a critical light on a cornerstone of modernism and once again pushed back against a system in which he found himself.|$|E
