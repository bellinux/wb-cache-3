5|$|During his tenure, Chongqing {{reported}} annual GDP growth far {{exceeding the}} national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> up 29%. Several major corporations built or greatly expanded their manufacturing operations in Chongqing, including Hewlett-Packard, Foxconn, Ford motors, and BASF.|$|E
5|$|Money was {{allegedly}} lent by the banks {{to their employees}} and associates so they could buy shares in those same banks while simply using those same shares as collateral for the loans. Borrowers were then allowed to defer paying interest on the loan {{until the end of}} the period, when the whole amount plus interest accrued was due. These same <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> then allegedly written off days before the banks collapsed.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October, {{it emerged}} that a Norwegian export credit company (Eksportfinans) {{had made a}} {{complaint}} to Norwegian police concerning the alleged embezzlement of 415 million Norwegian kroner (€47 million) by Glitnir since 2006. The Icelandic bank had acted as an agent for Eksportfinans, administering loans to several companies: however Eksportfinans alleges that, when the <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> paid off early by borrowers, Glitnir kept the cash and merely continued with the regular payments to Eksportfinans, effectively taking an unauthorized loan itself.|$|E

5|$|The Inter-American Development Bank {{approved}} $197.4million {{in loans}} in 1998, {{most of which}} due to Hurricane Mitch. The <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> to assist in rebuilding damaged infrastructure, including for water systems, transportation, and houses. Various countries provided nearly $2.8billion to the country in aid, which limited the annual debt following the hurricane's damage. The foreign aid due to the storm largely ended by 2003.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies. Just {{as he had done}} in Liaoning, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> up 29%.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Washington pumped USD322.4 {{million into}} South Vietnam, and the {{historian}} George McTurnan Kahin calculated that 87% of this {{came through the}} CIP. From the end of 1955, when Diem took full {{control of the country}} after ousting Bảo Đại and declaring himself president, until 1961, the US provided Saigon with USD1.447 billion in aid, mostly through the CIP. In addition, USD95.6 million of <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> given. In 1958 and 1959, the CIP accounted for around 80% of economic assistance. By 1960, Diem had accumulated USD216.4 million in reserves. The amount of CIP aid peaked at USD398 million in 1966 and began dropping thereafter, reaching USD233 million by 1973.|$|E

5|$|In other areas, Grameen has {{had very}} high payback rates—over 98 percent. However, {{according}} to the Wall Street Journal, in 2001 {{a fifth of the}} bank's <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> more than a year overdue. Grameen says {{that more than half of}} its borrowers in Bangladesh (close to 50 million) have risen out of acute poverty thanks to their loan, as measured by such standards as having all children of school age in school, all household members eating three meals a day, a sanitary toilet, a rainproof house, clean drinking water, and the ability to repay a 300 taka-a-week (around 4 USD) loan.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1820s, when Manuel José García was Minister of Finance, the {{government}} borrowed heavily to finance new projects {{and to pay}} off war debts. These <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> tendered at usurious rates: in one notorious loan, {{the government}} received credit for £570,000 from the Baring Brothers {{in exchange for a}} debt of £1,000,000. In the 1820s, the peso papel began to lose value rapidly with respect to the peso fuerte, which was linked to the price of gold. In 1827 the peso papel was devalued by 33%, and was devalued again by 68% in 1829.|$|E
5|$|In 1239 Henry {{introduced}} different policies, possibly {{trying to}} imitate those of Louis of France: Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned {{and forced to}} pay fines equivalent {{to a third of}} their goods, and any outstanding <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> to be released. Further huge demands for cash followed – £40,000 was demanded in 1244, for example, of which around two-thirds was collected within five years – destroying the ability of the Jewish community to lend money commercially. Henry had built the Domus Conversorum in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s. Anti-Jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice flourished in the 1250s and, in response, Henry passed the Statute of Jewry in 1253, which attempted to segregate Jews and enforce the wearing of Jewish badges; it remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry.|$|E
50|$|Bridging <b>loans</b> <b>are</b> {{defined as}} either ‘opened’ or ‘closed’. A <b>loan</b> <b>is</b> closed if the {{borrower}} {{has a clear}} and credible repayment plan or exit strategy in place, such as {{the sale of the}} loan security or longer-term finance. Open bridging <b>loans</b> <b>are</b> riskier to both the borrower and creditor due to the greater likelihood of default.|$|R

5|$|In July 1780 Adams {{replaced}} Laurens as {{the ambassador}} to the Dutch Republic, {{then one of the}} few other republics in the world. With the aid of the Dutch Patriot leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19, 1782. In February 1782 the Frisian states was the first Dutch province to recognize the United States, while France had been the first European country to grant diplomatic recognition in 1778. He also negotiated a loan of five million guilders financed by Nicolaas van Staphorst and Wilhelm Willink. By 1794 a total of eleven <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> granted in Amsterdam to the United States with a value of 29 million guilders. In October 1782, he negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce, the first such treaty between the United States and a foreign power following the 1778 treaty with France. The house that Adams bought during this stay in The Netherlands became the first American-owned embassy on foreign soil.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979, the {{dilapidated}} theatre {{was purchased}} by a trust headed by Jeremy Fry for £155,000. The following year, an appeal was launched {{to raise money for}} renovations, including the complete rebuilding of the stage, installation of a steel grid to hold stage lighting and scenery and a higher fly system, to allow major touring companies, including the Royal National Theatre under Peter Hall, to be booked to perform. The total projected cost was £3.5 million, of which £1.8 million was seen as being essential to reopening the theatre. Money and donations in kind were received from the city council, Arts Council England, Bath Preservation Trust, Leche Trust, Historic buildings council, Manifold Trust, South-West Stonecleaning and Restoration Company and many individuals. Work on the building started to designs by Dowton and Hurst. However, as insufficient funds had been raised by 1982 to complete the work, <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> negotiated with the Bristol & West and Lombard North Central with guarantees from local councils. The theatre reopened on 30 November 1982 with a performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream, featuring a cast from the National Theatre led by Paul Scofield. The event was attended by Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the Glazers were to pay off the remaining £220million contained within the PIK loans by 22 November 2010. The <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> by then accruing interest at a rate of 16.25%, as the club's overall debt had exceeded its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by more than five times. However, the club claimed that none of its own money had been put towards the repayment, raising questions as to how the Glazer family had raised the funds; suggested methods include the sale of a minority stake in the club to a third party, the sale of {{some or all of the}} family's other businesses, and – the most likely option – the refinancing of the PIKs with another loan at a lower interest rate.|$|E

Sometimes, shareholder <b>loan</b> <b>is</b> confused with a loan from company extended to its shareholders.|$|R
5|$|The {{estimated}} cost {{to clean up}} debris from the two killer tornadoes was estimated at $500,000. The governor of Wilson County requested that the areas struck by the EF3 tornado and the EF2 prior as disaster areas to allow federal assistance. In Kenly, hospital staff raised about $300 to help a family whose home was completely destroyed. Up to 125 personnel were deployed to check on residents who were still at home and to assist those in need. Several volunteers helped remove trees and debris off roads {{to make way for}} aid. Two Red Cross teams set up a shelter at the Kenly Free Will Baptist Church. During church ceremonies, volunteers organized outside the church to feed residents who lost their homes. A Methodist church group from Virginia arrived in Johnston and Wilson counties the day after the tornadoes to assist with cleanup efforts. A fund was set up for the 11-year-old boy, Joshua Wiggens, who was killed by the Elm City tornado. By November17, the Red Cross funds were depleted funds needed to keep the organization out of debt were $38million below what was required. About $20,000 was spent in the charity effort in Kenly and the governor of Wilson County urged residents who were no affected by the storm to send donations to the Red Cross. The lack of funding for the Red Cross prompted the governor to allow up to $28,000 in the state's emergency funds to be used for assistance by the Red Cross. On November21, low-interest <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> approved for residents in the affected counties. Homeowners in Johnston, Franklin, Harnett, Nash, Sampson, Wake, Wayne and Wilson counties were able to apply for loans up to $200,000 to repair storm damage and businesses were allowed to apply for loans up to $2million. On November24, an unknown member of the 82nd Airborne Division donated 50 cases of non-perishable food and water to assist victims of the tornado. The relief goods were dropped off at the J.S. Waters School in Goldston without notice.|$|E
