25|$|Frequently {{prescribed}} ACE inhibitors include benazepril, zofenopril, perindopril, trandolapril, captopril, enalapril, <b>lisinopril,</b> and ramipril.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of ACE inhibitors, captopril is not administered as a prodrug (the only other being <b>lisinopril).</b> About 70% of orally administered captopril is absorbed. Bioavailability is reduced by presence of food in stomach. It is partly metabolised and partly excreted unchanged in urine.|$|E
25|$|In August 2011, Publix began {{offering}} <b>Lisinopril,</b> an ACE inhibitor {{that is used}} to prevent, treat, or improve symptoms of high blood pressure, certain heart conditions, diabetes, and certain chronic kidney conditions, as another free prescription. Customers can get a 90-day supply of this prescription for free at any Publix Pharmacy, up to a maximum of 180 tablets. Lisinopril-HCTZ combination products are excluded.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms and Treatment: There are few {{reports of}} ACE {{inhibitor}} overdose in the literature. The most likely manifestations are hypotension, {{which may be}} severe, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia and renal impairment with metabolic acidosis. Treatment should be mainly symptomatic and supportive, with volume expansion using normal saline to correct hypotension and improve renal function, and gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal and a cathartic to prevent further absorption of the drug. Captopril, enalapril, <b>lisinopril</b> and perindopril {{are known to be}} removable by hemodialysis.|$|E

2500|$|Aldosterone {{is part of}} the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. It has a plasma {{half-life}} of under 20minutes. Drugs that interfere with the secretion or action of aldosterone are in use as antihypertensives, like <b>lisinopril,</b> which lowers blood pressure by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), leading to lower aldosterone secretion. The net effect of these drugs is to reduce sodium and water retention but increase retention of potassium. In other words, these drugs stimulate the excretion of sodium and water in urine, while they block the excretion of potassium.|$|E
50|$|The {{selection}} of long-acting active ingredients over short-acting ones may also reduce pill burden. For instance, ACE inhibitors {{are used in}} the management of hypertension. Both captopril and <b>lisinopril</b> are examples of ACE inhibitors. However, <b>lisinopril</b> is dosed once a day, whereas captopril may be dosed 2-3 times a day. Assuming that there are no contraindications or potential for drug interactions, using <b>lisinopril</b> instead of captopril may be an appropriate way to limit pill burden.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Lisinopril</b> {{has been}} {{assigned}} to pregnancy category D by the FDA. Animal and human data have revealed evidence of lethal harm to the embryo and teratogenicity associated with ACE inhibitors. No controlled data in human pregnancy are available.

However, there have been reports of death and increased toxicities to the fetus and newly born child with the use of <b>lisinopril</b> {{in the second and third}} trimesters. The label states, [...] "When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Zestril as soon as possible."

50|$|<b>Lisinopril</b> is the lysine-analog of enalapril. Unlike other ACE inhibitors, {{it is not}} a prodrug and is {{excreted}} unchanged in the urine. In {{cases of}} overdosage, it can be removed from circulation by dialysis.|$|E
50|$|In many cases, {{patients}} experience significant {{heart conditions}} as well. These conditions {{are much more}} treatable, and are often countered with ACE inhibitors such as enalapril or <b>lisinopril</b> and other heart medications such as digoxin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lisinopril</b> is an ACE Inhibitor, {{meaning it}} blocks {{the actions of}} {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme (ACE) in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), keeping Angiotensin I from being converted to Angiotensin II. The inhibition of this system causes an overall decrease in blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|The dose must be {{adjusted}} {{in those with}} poor kidney function. Dose adjustments may be required when creatinine clearance is {{less than or equal}} to 30mL/min. Since <b>lisinopril</b> is removed by dialysis, dosing changes must also be considered for people on dialysis.|$|E

5000|$|Angiotensin II {{receptor}} blockers {{are used}} {{primarily for the}} treatment of hypertension where the patient is intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy. They do not inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin or other kinins, and are thus only rarely associated with the persistent dry cough and/or angioedema that limit ACE inhibitor therapy. More recently, they have been used {{for the treatment of}} heart failure in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy, in particular candesartan. Irbesartan and losartan have trial data showing benefit in hypertensive patients with type II diabetes, and may delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy. A 1998 double-blind study found [...] "that <b>lisinopril</b> improved insulin sensitivity whereas losartan did not affect it." [...] Candesartan is used experimentally in preventive treatment of migraine. <b>Lisinopril</b> has been found less often effective than candesartan at preventing migraine.|$|E

50|$|Unlike loop diuretics, {{chlortalidone}} efficacy {{is diminished}} {{in patients with}} certain renal diseases (e.g. chronic renal disease). A clinical trial (ALLHAT) in 2002 compared chlortalidone to doxazosin {{in the treatment of}} high-risk hypertensive patients. In this study, only chlortalidone significantly reduced the risk of combined cardiovascular disease events, especially heart failure, when compared with drugs such as doxazosin. Chlortalidone was approved by the FDA in 1960. The ALLHAT study conclusions showed that {{there was no significant difference}} in all-cause mortality, fatal heart disease, or non-fatal myocardial infarction when chlortalidone was compared with <b>lisinopril</b> or amlodipine but did show decreased rates of heart failure after 6 years when compared with amlodipine and decreased rates of cerebrovascular disease after 6 years when compared with <b>lisinopril</b> leading the study conclusions to say that thiazide-type diuretics are preferred first-step in antihypertensive therapy.|$|E

50|$|Ending September 2006, the Arnulfo Arias Madrid Hospital at Panama City {{was getting}} full with {{patients}} with contradictory symptoms. The symptoms seemed {{to match with}} Guillain-Barré syndrome, but these patients were also losing their ability to urinate, a symptom not related to Guillain-Barré. The death rate of this mysterious illness was nearly 50%, when hospital management decided to isolate all the patients with the illness in a large room and doctors could compare notes and theories. Soon, patients {{from other parts of}} the country started to arrive at hospitals. Doctors had no idea what was happening: the mysterious illness was attacking elderly citizens with hypertension and diabetes history. About half were receiving <b>Lisinopril</b> (a blood pressure medicine), and many did not remember clearly if they had been taking other drugs. Suspecting something wrong with <b>Lisinopril,</b> the medicine was removed from the pharmacies while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted lab analyses, revealing the blood pressure drug was safe; CDC epidemiologists were then invited to participate.|$|E
50|$|Scientists at Merck created <b>lisinopril</b> by {{systematically}} altering each {{structural unit}} of enalaprilat, substituting various amino acids.

Merck conducted clinical trials, and the drug was approved for hypertension in 1987 and congestive heart failure in 1993.|$|E
