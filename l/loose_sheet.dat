The first of these was entered into the verse draft of the text, the second into Wagner's copy of the 1853 printing of the text; the third was written on an undated sheet of music paper. All three were subsequently used by Wagner.|$|E

You understand l'affaire Poynton now? It is very simple. That English boy actually witnessed a meeting between the Czar and the Emperor, and turns up in Paris with a <b>loose</b> <b>sheet</b> of a treaty between the two, relative to an attack upon England. Our people got hold of him at the Café Montmartre, and we have hidden him away ever since. Our friends, the Germans, who seem to have had some suspicions about him, have filled the city with spies, but from the first we have kept them off the scent. We had a little difficulty in convincing our friends your country-people, but we managed to borrow a few papers from the German Ambassador whilst he was staying at a country-house in England, which were sufficient." ...|$|E
6000|$|This [...] "Valley of Waters," [...] {{with its}} pink and yellow (chloritic) sands, is bounded {{on the right}} near the sea by a {{sandbank}} about one hundred feet high, a <b>loose</b> <b>sheet</b> thinly covering the dykes of syenite and the porphyritic trap which in places peep out. Possibly it contains, like the left flank, veins of quartz, lowered by corrosion, and concealed by the sand-drift spread by the prevalent western winds. The high-level abounds in detached springs, probably the drainage of the Rughámat Makná, the huge [...] "horse" [...] or buttress of gypsum bearing north-east from the harbour. The principal veins number three. The uppermost and sweetest is the Ayn el-Tabbákhah; in the middle height is El-Túyuri (Umm el-Tuyúr), with the dwarf cataract and its tinkling song; whilst the brackish 'Ayn el-Fara'í occupies the valley sole. Besides these a streak of palms, perpendicular to {{the run of the}} Wady, shows a rain-basin, dry during the droughts, and, higher up, the outlying dates springing from the arid sands, are fed by thin veins which damp the rocky base. Hence, probably, Dr. Beke identified the place with the [...] "Elim" [...] of the Exodus: his artist's sketch from the sea (p. 340) is, however, absolutely unrecognizable.|$|E
60|$|Matravers {{stood at}} an open window, reading a note by the grey dawn light. Below him {{stretched}} the broad thoroughfare of Piccadilly, noiseless, shadowy, deserted. He had thrown up the window overcome {{by a sudden}} sense of suffocation, and a chill, damp breeze came stealing in, cooling his parched forehead and hot, dry eyes. For {{the last two or}} three hours he had been working with an unwonted and rare zest; it had happened quite by chance, for as a rule he was a man of regular, even mechanical habits. But to-night he scarcely knew himself,--he had all the sensations of a man who had passed through a new and altogether unexpected experience. At midnight he had let himself into his room after that swift, impulsive departure from the Milan, and had dropped by chance into the chair before his writing-table. The sight of his last unfinished sentence, abruptly abandoned in the centre of a neatly written page of manuscript, had fascinated him, and as he sat there idly with the <b>loose</b> <b>sheet</b> in his hands, holding it so that the lamplight might fall upon its very legible characters, an idea flashed into his brain,--an idea which had persistently eluded him for days. With the sudden stimulus of a purely mental activity, he had hastily thrown aside his outdoor garment, and had written for several hours with a readiness and facility which seemed, somehow, for the last few days to have been denied to him.|$|E
