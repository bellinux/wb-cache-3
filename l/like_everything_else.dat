5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else,</b> it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E

500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead. Wyle, {{who worked with}} TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said {{part of the reason}} he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. [...] "With the birth of my kids, I started to really look at my career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering me toward certain things and away from other things," [...] he said. He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character, stating [...] "I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty." [...] Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: [...] "Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But {{it was more of a}} drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg." [...] Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. [...] "I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from something I had done already," [...] she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. [...] "This one came to me through my agent, just <b>like</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b> We even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, [...] "Oh yeah, I might have a chance." [...] We were just joking." [...] He auditioned four times for the part.

Gedeon played outfield for the Washington Senators before he joined the United States Army in March 1941. Notable players who served from the American League included Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, Hank Greenberg and Phil Rizzuto. On the playing field, scoring was noticeably lower; most players were over 35, or classified 4-F for physical disabilities.

The war-ships in the air suggested the railway horrors, and three nights afterward the railway horrors suggested my dream. The work of association was going on in my head, unconsciously, all that time. It was an admirable dream, what there was of it.|$|R

Historical determinism (a sort of path dependence) can also be synonymous with causal determinism. Causal determinism has also been considered more generally as the idea that everything that happens or exists is caused by antecedent conditions. In the case of nomological determinism, these conditions are considered events also, implying that the future is determined completely by preceding eventsa combination of prior states of the universe and the laws of nature. Yet they can also be considered metaphysical of origin (such as in the case of theological determinism).|$|E
