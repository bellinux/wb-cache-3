5|$|The genus Triakis {{contains}} two subgenera, Triakis and Cazon. The <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> is placed within the subgenus Triakis {{along with the}} banded houndshark (T. (Triakis) scyllium). A 2006 phylogenetic analysis by J. Andrés López and colleagues, based on protein-coding genes, revealed that Triakis and Cazon are in fact not closely related, and additionally that the <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> {{may be the most}} basal member of its family.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{sometimes}} called the <b>leopard</b> <b>shark,</b> a name otherwise used for Triakis semifasciata.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the related}} grey and brown {{smoothhounds}} that share its range, the <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> has {{smaller and more}} numerous red blood cells, allowing it to process oxygen more efficiently. This may be an adaptation for foraging in deoxygenated estuary environments. Their eyes contain very few cone cells, likely due to the murky water they inhabit. Small leopard sharks fall prey to larger sharks such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). On one occasion, a sevengill shark was seen ambushing a <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> on a tidal mudflat in Humboldt Bay, striking with such momentum that the larger predator momentarily beached itself. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Phyllobothrium riseri, Lacistorhynchus dollfusi and Paraorygmatobothrium barber, {{as well as the}} copepods Echthrogaleus eoleoptratus and Achtheinus oblongatus.|$|E

5|$|Wary {{and quick}} to flee, leopard sharks pose almost no danger to humans. There {{is a single}} record from 1955 of a <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> harassing a skin diver with a nosebleed, though no {{injuries}} resulted. This species is caught by commercial fisheries using gillnets and longlines, and by recreational anglers and spearfishers; it is also caught as bycatch in bottom trawls. The meat is considered excellent eating and is sold fresh or frozen. However, leopard sharks living alongside human development may accumulate pollutants such as mercury, pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) within their bodies, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife warns against eating them regularly. The <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> is prized by the aquarium trade for its attractive appearance and hardiness; this led to many newborn pups being captured with hook-and-line off southern California in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It may live for over 20 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> {{consists}} of small benthic and littoral animals, most significantly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish (including anchovies, herring, topsmelt, croakers, surfperch, gobies, rockfish, sculpins, flatfish, and midshipmen), fish eggs, clams, and the echiurid fat innkeeper worm (Urechis caupo). This opportunistic hunter {{has also been}} known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). Eelgrass (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the banded houndshark was authored by German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, based on a dried specimen from Japan, in their 1838–41 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. They gave it the specific epithet scyllium, derived from the Ancient Greek skylion ("dogfish"), {{and placed it in}} the genus Triakis. Within the genus, it is placed in the subgenus Triakis along with the <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> (T. (Triakis) semifasciata).|$|E

5|$|The <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> captures prey by {{expanding}} its buccal cavity {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its jaws forward to grip the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|E
5|$|The <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> is aplacental viviparous, {{with the}} {{developing}} embryos sustained by a yolk sac until birth. In northern areas, females use bays and sloughs as nursery areas, while {{to the south}} they give birth in more open areas. Known breeding grounds {{along the coast of}} California include Humboldt Bay, Tomales Bay, Bodega Bay, San Francisco Bay, Elkhorn Slough, Morro Bay, Santa Monica Bay (Los Angeles), Catalina Harbor (Santa Catalina Island), and San Diego Bay.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> {{is caught}} by {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries {{for food and}} the aquarium trade. This species is mostly fished in the waters off California where, {{after a period of}} population decline in the 1980s, new fishing regulations in the early 1990s reduced harvesting to sustainable levels. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as of Least Concern, while noting that local stocks may easily become overfished because of the shark's slow growth and limited migratory habits.|$|E

5|$|Later {{authors have}} reassigned the sharptooth houndshark to the genus Triakis, more {{specifically}} to the subgenus Cazon alongside the sharpfin houndshark (T. acutipinna) and the spotted houndshark (T. maculata). A 2006 phylogenetic study by J. Andrés López and colleagues, based on four protein-coding gene sequences, found that this species did not group with the <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> (T. semifasciata). Instead, it and the flapnose houndshark (Scylliogaleus quecketti) formed a clade within the Mustelus lineage. This result suggests that the two subgenera of Triakis—Cazon and Triakis—may not be closely related, which would warrant a redefinition of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the California {{spiny lobster}} include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant sea bass and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and <b>leopard</b> <b>shark,</b> octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, spiny lobsters including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E
5|$|The <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> (Triakis semifasciata) is {{a species}} of houndshark, in the family Triakidae. It is found along the Pacific coast of North America, from the U.S. state of Oregon to Mazatlán in Mexico. Typically {{measuring}} 1.2–1.5 m (3.9–4.9ft) long, this slender-bodied shark is immediately identifiable by the striking pattern of black saddle-like markings and large spots over its back, from which it derives its common name. Large schools of leopard sharks are a common sight in bays and estuaries, swimming over sandy or muddy flats or rock-strewn areas near kelp beds and reefs. They are most common near the coast, in water less than 4m (13ft) deep.|$|E

500|$|An active {{species that}} swims {{with a strong}} undulating motion, the <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> is {{commonly}} spotted cruising in or just beyond the surf zone. It is more active at night than during the day, and sometimes lies still on the bottom. In Tomales Bay and elsewhere, the <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> follows the tide onto mudflats to forage for food, retreating just fast enough to prevent being stranded or trapped as the water recedes. At Santa Catalina Island, resident sharks spend the day together in the shallows and at night disperse into deeper water, ranging up to [...] away.|$|E
500|$|The large first {{dorsal fin}} is {{positioned}} about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins; the second is almost {{as large as the}} first and much larger than the anal fin.

500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> as of Least Concern. It is highly susceptible to local depletion {{due to its}} slow growth rate and low level of exchange between regional stocks. It was considered for, but is not managed under, the U.S. Pacific Fishery Management Council's (PMC) 1982 Groundfish Management Plan. In 1992, the State of California imposed a recreational minimum size limit of [...] and a possession limit of three fish, a move that was strongly supported and promoted by the sport fishing community. In 1993, the State also instituted a minimum size limit of [...] for the commercial harvesting of all sharks and rays, including for the aquarium trade. In addition, Californian restrictions {{on the use of}} certain types of fishing gear in near-shore waters confer good protection to this shark's core population. These management measures seem to have successfully reduced fishing mortality and halted the population decline from the 1980s; the status of the <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> off California is regarded as secure, with demographic models estimating an annual population increase of 3ndash&6% with sustainable fishing.|$|E

5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} <b>leopard</b> <b>sharks</b> often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most <b>leopard</b> <b>sharks</b> tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|R
40|$|Shark angling derbies {{have been}} held in Elkhorn Slough since 1946, and archery derbies since about 1973. Elkhorn Slough is an {{important}} pupping and breeding area for <b>leopard</b> <b>sharks,</b> Triakis semifasciata, and bat rays, Myliobatis californica, and a spawning or nursery area for many other species of fish. With {{the establishment of the}} Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, these derbies, especially the archery derby, have become somewhat controversial. <b>Leopard</b> <b>sharks</b> pup in late spring to early summer, peaking in June. Bat ray pupping peaks in July. Both species breed shortly after pupping. Since 1988, most sharks and rays caught in the angling derbies have been tagged and released under a program developed by Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. No tags have been recovered, suggesting a large population in the area. Prior to the tagging program most sharks and rays taken in the angling derby were rendered at the local tallow works. All sharks and rays that are taken in the archery derby are killed, but relatively few sharks and rays are taken by archers. In 1993, 43 sharks and rays were kept by anglers and 13 by archers. The commercial catch of <b>leopard</b> <b>sharks</b> in California averaged 43, 000 pounds from 1990 to 1992, and the estimated sport catch of <b>leopard</b> <b>sharks</b> is about 270, 000 pounds annually. In comparison, the take during Elkhorn Slough shark derbies is not significant and is not considered a threat to the resource. However, the moral or ethical issue of conducting shark derbies in a marine sanctuary remains. (7 pp. ...|$|R
500|$|Most of {{the fishing}} for leopard sharks occurs in the waters off California, where {{commercial}} landings peaked at [...] in 1983 and has averaged [...] annually since 1991. These figures {{are believed to be}} underestimates, as an unknown portion of the <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> catch is recorded simply as [...] "shark". In recent decades the number of sharks taken recreationally has exceeded those taken commercially, with sport fishers catching an average of 52,000 sharks per year from 1980ndash&1988, and 45,000 sharks per year since 1993. This species contributes negligibly to fishery landings off Oregon. The status of leopard sharks off Mexico is uncertain, although Mexican shark fisheries tend to focus more on larger species.|$|E
500|$|The first {{scientific}} name {{applied to the}} <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> was Triakis californica, coined by British zoologist John Edward Gray in the 1851 List of the specimens of fish {{in the collection of}} the British Museum. However, Gray did not furnish the name with a proper description, rendering it a nomen nudum. In December 1854, American ichthyologist William Orville Ayres gave a lecture describing the species as Mustelus felis, which included the first scientific description of the species. [...] His lecture was reprinted first in The Pacific, a San Francisco newspaper, and then in the journal Proceedings of the California Academy of Natural Sciences. In April 1855, French biologist Charles Frédéric Girard published another description of this species, naming it Triakis semifasciata.|$|E
500|$|The <b>leopard</b> <b>shark</b> has a {{moderately}} stout body, with a short, rounded snout. There are well-developed, triangular flaps of skin {{in front of}} the nares. The eyes are large and oval, with a nictitating membrane (a protective third eyelid). The line of the mouth is strongly curved. There are furrows at the corners of the mouth extending onto both jaws, with those on the lower jaw almost long enough to meet at the midline. The tooth rows number 4155 in the upper jaw and 3445 in the lower jaw; each tooth has a slightly oblique, smooth-edged cusp in the center and 12 small cusplets on either side. These teeth are arranged into a flat, [...] "pavement"-like surface with overlapping ridges.|$|E
