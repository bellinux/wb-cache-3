5|$|The {{specific}} epithet nidiformis {{is derived}} from the Latin terms nīdus 'nest' and forma 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'. <b>Lampas</b> {{is derived from}} the Greek lampas/λαμπας 'torch'. Common names include ghost fungus and Australian glow fungus. Drummond reported that the local aborigines were fearful when shown the luminescent fungus and called out chinga, a local word for spirit; Drummond himself likened it to a will-o'-the-wisp. Likewise on the Springbrook Plateau in southeastern Queensland, the local Kombumerri people believed the lights to be ancestors and gave the area a wide berth out of respect.|$|E
25|$|With the {{decrease}} in mortality rates, the region has undergone a general increase in infant births, primarily associated with late births, but also an increase in seniors in the community (56.5% in 2001). Yet Sintra is still considered to have a structurally young population, the youngest in the Greater Metropolitan Area of Lisbon. Young adults (30- to 39-year-olds) dominate Sintra's communities, with the parishes of Pêro Pinheiro, Terrugem, São Martinho, São João das <b>Lampas,</b> Santa Maria e São Miguel, Montelavar, Colares, Queluz and Almargem do Bispo all having higher rates of seniors in the population. Approximately 80% of the population are born outside the town, 21% of these being foreign born residents. While the resident population in Lisbon has seen a gentle decrease since the mid-1960s, Sintra has grown comparably.|$|E
25|$|The {{biggest change}} to the room was in the window treatments. Jacqueline Kennedy {{specifically}} asked for new curtains for the East Room consisting of opaque silk undercurtains and yellow drapes. Boudin oversaw the design of new draperies, with silk provided by Maison Jansen. A draft design of the drapes and valances was not ready until mid-1963. Boudin, apparently wishing {{to draw attention to}} the center window between the fireplaces, designed a valance for the center window while putting all other drapes behind window boxes. For the drapes, Boudin suggested a braid border and tie-backs made of ball fringe covered in satin. Kennedy disapproved of Boudin's proposal for the valance and window boxes, as it did not make use of the historic 1902 gilt window cornices. She did, however, approve of the fabric and tie-backs. Made of a custom-manufactured gold and cream silk <b>lampas,</b> the fabric contained a non-repetitive design of birds, butterflies, cupids, flowers, medallions, roosters, and wheat and featured heavy fringe at the bottom. The drapes were hung in straight panels from the carved and gilded 1902 wooden cornices. The design of the valances was not finalized until April 1964. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson asked Jacqueline Kennedy to assist her in finalizing the design. Originally, they were to be of brocatelle, a jacquard weave fabric similar to brocade but thicker and heavier and with designs in high relief. But this design was countermanded by Boudin. Instead, gold <b>lampas,</b> trimmed with braid and hemmed with gilt, spun-metal twisted fringe at the bottom, was installed in flat panels from behind each cornice. The curtains and valances took nearly three years to design and manufacture, and were not hung in the room until the Johnson administration in 1965. The drapes and valances cost $26,149. The cost was covered by sales of Jacqueline Kennedy's guidebook to the White House, which by 1965 was in its fourth edition.|$|E

500|$|First {{described}} scientifically in 1844, {{the fungus}} {{has been known}} by several names in its taxonomic history. It was assigned its current name by Orson K. Miller, Jr. in 1994. Its scientific name {{is derived from the}} Latin nidus [...] "nest", hence 'nest shaped'. Similar in appearance to the common edible oyster mushroom, it was previously considered a member of the same genus, Pleurotus, and described under the former names Pleurotus nidiformis or Pleurotus <b>lampas.</b> Unlike oyster mushrooms, O.nidiformis is poisonous; while not lethal, its consumption leads to severe cramps and vomiting. The toxic properties of the mushroom are attributed to compounds called illudins. O.nidiformis is one of several species in the cosmopolitan genus Omphalotus, all of which have bioluminescent properties.|$|E
500|$|The ghost fungus was {{initially}} described in 1844 by English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley as Agaricus nidiformis. Berkeley {{felt it was}} related to Agaricus ostreatus (now Pleurotus ostreatus) but remarked it was a [...] "far more magnificent species". Material was originally collected by Scottish naturalist James Drummond in 1841 on Banksia wood along the Swan River. He wrote [...] "when this fungus was laid on a newspaper, it emitted by night a phosphorescent light, enabling us to read the words around it; and it continued {{to do so for}} several nights with gradually decreasing intensity as the plant dried up." [...] More material collected from near the base of a [...] "sickly but living" [...] shrub (Grevillea drummondii) was named as Agaricus <b>lampas</b> by Berkeley. He noted both were phosphorescent and closely related species. Tasmanian botanist Ronald Campbell Gunn collected material in October 1845 from that state, which Berkeley felt differed from previous collections in having more demarcated and less decurrent gills and a shorter stipe, and named it Agaricus phosphorus in 1848. Italian mycologist Pier Andrea Saccardo placed all three named taxa in the genus Pleurotus in 1887. These names have been synonymised with O.nidiformis, although the name Pleurotus <b>lampas</b> persisted in some texts, including the 1934–35 monograph of Australian fungi by John Burton Cleland. In reviewing the published literature, Victorian botanical liaison officer Jim Willis was aware of Rolf Singer's placing of Pleurotus olearius into the genus Omphalotus, but stopped short of transferring the ghost fungus across, even though he conceded it was wrongly placed in Pleurotus. Investigating the species in 1994, Orson K. Miller, Jr. gave the ghost fungus its current binomial name when he transferred it to the genus Omphalotus with other bioluminescent mushrooms.|$|E
2500|$|New {{types of}} looms and weaving {{techniques}} {{also played a}} part. Plain-woven or tabby silks had circulated in the Roman world, and patterned damask silks in increasingly complex geometric designs appear from the mid-3rd century. Weft-faced compound twills were developed not later than 600, and polychrome (multicoloured) compound twills became the standard weave for Byzantine silks {{for the next several}} centuries. Monochrome <b>lampas</b> weaves became fashionable around 1000 in both Byzantine and Islamic weaving centres; these fabrics rely on contrasting textures rather than colour to render patterns. [...] A small number of tapestry-woven Byzantine silks also survive.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the five}} basic weaves used in Byzantium and the Islamic weaving {{centers of the}} Mediterranean – tabby, twill, damask, <b>lampas</b> and {{tapestry}} – the most important product was the weft-faced compound twill called samite. The word is derived from Old French samit, from medieval Latin samitum, examitum deriving from the Byzantine Greek [...] ἑξάμιτον hexamiton [...] "six threads", usually interpreted as indicating the use of six yarns in the warp. In samite, the main warp threads are hidden {{on both sides of}} the fabric by the ground and patterning wefts, with only the binding warps that hold the wefts in place visible.|$|E
2500|$|Urban areas {{represent}} [...] of the municipality, or approximately 17.4% of Sintra's territory; 35% of {{the population}} reside in places of between 50,000 and 100,000 inhabitants. Many of these areas are anchored to lines of access, in particular, the Sintra Line and the IC19 motorway which connects the principal towns of Queluz, Agualva-Cacém, Algueirão/Mem Martins, Rio de Mouro and Belas). Many of these urban areas are composed of a fabric of building projects that have historically resulted in dense buildings of concrete, normally seven or more floors in height. The greatest growth in residential homes {{has occurred in the}} south of the municipality, in the triangle of São Pedro de Penaferrim, Santa Maria e São Miguel and Casal de Cambra. In addition, there is a major concentration and growth in family dwellings of a seasonal nature, or second homes, in this region, and a proliferation of illegal construction in the parishes of São João das <b>Lampas,</b> São Pedro de Penaferrim, Belas, Agualva-Cacém and Casal de Cambra.|$|E
2500|$|During the Middle Ages the Armenian {{cochineal}} dyestuff vordan karmir, {{also known}} in Persia as kirmiz, was widely {{celebrated in the}} Near East. [...] Kirmiz {{is not to be}} confused with dyer's kermes, which was derived from another insect. [...] The Armenian cities Artashat and Dvin were early centers of the production of kirmiz: [...] during the 8th through 10th centuries Arab and Persian historians even referred to Artashat as [...] "the town of kirmiz". [...] The Arabs and Persians regarded kirmiz as one of the most valuable commodities exported from Armenia. [...] The Armenians themselves used vordan karmir to produce dyes for textiles (including oriental rugs) and pigments for illuminated manuscripts and church frescos. [...] Chemical analyses have identified the dye of Porphyrophora hamelii in Coptic textiles of the 3rd through 10th centuries, a cashmere cloth used in a kaftan from Sassanid Persia in the 6th or 7th century, silk liturgical gloves from 15th-century France, Ottoman fabrics such as velvets and <b>lampas</b> of the 15th through 17th centuries, and a 16th-century velvet cap of maintenance that belonged to Henry VIII of England.|$|E
