5|$|Marcus Schouler brings Trina Sieppe, {{his cousin}} and {{intended}} fiancée, into McTeague's office for dental work. Schouler and McTeague are friends and McTeague gladly agrees to examine her. As {{they wait for}} an opening, Trina buys a <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket.</b> McTeague becomes enamored with Trina and begs Schouler for permission to court Trina. After seeing McTeague's conviction, Schouler agrees. Trina eventually agrees to marry McTeague and shortly afterwards her <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket</b> wins her $5,000. Schouler bitterly claims that the money should have been his, causing a rift between McTeague and Schouler. After McTeague and Trina wed, they {{continue to live in}} their small apartment with Trina refusing to spend her $5,000.|$|E
5|$|Schouler {{leaves the}} city to become a cattle rancher. Before he goes, he secretly, in order to ruin his former friend, reports McTeague for {{practicing}} dentistry without a license. McTeague is ordered to shut down his practice or face jail. Even though she has saved over $200 {{in addition to the}} original $5,000 from the <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket,</b> Trina is unwilling to spend her money. Money becomes increasingly scarce, with the couple forced to sell their possessions. McTeague finally snaps and bites Trina's fingers in a fit of rage. Later, he goes fishing to earn money, taking Trina's savings (now totaling $450).|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Lottery is an {{independent}} agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It was created in 1987 when Virginians {{voted in favor of}} a state lottery. The first ticket was sold on September 20, 1988. All profits from Virginia <b>Lottery</b> <b>ticket</b> sales go to K-12 public education. In Fiscal Year 2017, the Lottery's profits totaled well over a half billion dollars, accounting for approximately 9 percent of school funding in Virginia. That brought total Lottery profits in Virginia (from 1989 to June 2017) to more than $11 billion.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, Campfield {{introduced}} a bill to limit lottery winnings to $600 for people on public assistance. Campfield said that people on public assistance should not be buying <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets</b> and instead should be using that money to buy food for their children. Tennessee law already prohibited {{the use of public}} assistance money to purchase <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets.</b> The bill also prohibited prisoners from redeeming winning <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets.</b>|$|R
50|$|In September 2015 the {{government}} announced a new paradigm {{for the sale of}} <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets.</b> <b>Lottery</b> vendors will be able to buy <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets</b> directly from GLO under a scheme to reduce the high price of <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets.</b> Direct purchase is available only through Krung Thai Bank. Vendors must first register with the GLO and must open bank accounts for payment of their purchases. The new arrangement will go into effect with the 16 October 2015 drawing. Vendors are allowed to purchase from 5-50 books at the price of 70.40 baht for a pair of tickets. Each book includes 100 ticket-pairs. What is not clear how this will reduce the price of <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets</b> as under the old scheme vendors paid the same price (70.40 baht) to ticket wholesalers. The new scheme will increase the number of <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets</b> for sale by 7-8 million.|$|R
5|$|In 2006, John Koza, a {{computer}} {{science professor at}} Stanford, was the lead author of Every Vote Equal, a book that makes a detailed case for his plan for an interstate compact to establish National Popular Vote. (Koza had previously had exposure to interstate compacts from his work with state lottery commissions after inventing the scratch-off <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket.)</b> That year, Koza, Barry Fadem and others formed National Popular Vote, a non-profit group to promote the legislation. The group has a transpartisan advisory committee including former US Senators Jake Garn, Birch Bayh, and David Durenberger, and former Representatives John Anderson, John Buchanan, and Tom Campbell.|$|E
5|$|Von Stroheim's {{original}} edit contained {{two main}} sub-plots that were later cut. The point of these sub-plots was to contrast two possible outcomes of Trina and McTeague's life together. The first depicted {{the lives of}} the junkman Zerkow and Maria Miranda Macapa, the young Mexican woman who collects junk for Zerkow and sold Trina the <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket.</b> Maria often talks about her imaginary solid gold dining set with Zerkow, who becomes obsessed by it. Eventually, believing she has riches hidden away, Zerkow marries her. He often asks about it, but she gives a different answer each time he mentions it. Zerkow does not believe her and becomes obsessed with prying the truth from her. He murders her and after having lost his mind, leaps into San Francisco Bay.|$|E
5|$|St. Paul, Minnesota: in a store, Clyde Bruckman (Peter Boyle), a life {{insurance}} salesman, purchases a {{paper and a}} <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket</b> and leaves. In the street, he almost bumps into an inconspicuous man (Stuart Charno), who heads to a gypsy palm reader named Madame Zelma (Karin Konoval). After seeking his fortune, the inconspicuous man attacks and kills her. A few days later, the eyes and entrails of a tea leaf reader, {{who was also a}} doll collector, have been found in her apartment, her body being missing. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive at the scene of that murder to help the local cops, who have recruited the help of a psychic, the eccentric Stupendous Yappi (Jaap Broeker). Although the psychic delivers extremely vague clues, the cops are thoroughly impressed; both Scully and Mulder, however, are not, especially after Yappi diagnoses that it is Mulder—not Scully—who is a skeptic.|$|E
50|$|Zwillman {{was unable}} {{to compete with the}} cheaper Prince Street pushcarts, however, so he moved to the more upper-class {{neighborhood}} of Clinton Hill, where he began selling <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets</b> to local housewives. He observed that much more money was made selling <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets</b> than produce, so he concentrated on selling <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets</b> through local merchants. By 1920, Zwillman controlled the bulk of the numbers racket with the help of hired muscle.|$|R

5|$|Everyone in {{the family}} has to create budget cuts in their daily routine, such as Homer having {{to give up on}} buying beer and Marge having to cook with lower-quality food and forgo her weekly <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket.</b> Bart must get his hair cut at a local barber school, Lisa can no longer get her volumes of Encyclopedia Generica, and Maggie's clothes have to last a little bit longer. They {{eventually}} save up enough money for the operation, which is a success. The family is joyous that their dog is well again, but soon begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices. As a result, the morale of the family suffers and they take their annoyance out on Santa's Little Helper. Feeling unwanted, he runs away from home and goes off on an adventure, only to be captured, taken to the dog pound, and adopted by Mr. Burns, who trains him to be one of his vicious attack hounds. After a long brainwashing process, consisting of the Ludovico technique, Santa's Little Helper is turned into a bloodthirsty killer.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{the lottery}} money {{received}} was an {{interest free loan}} to the government during the three years that the tickets ('without any Blankes') were sold. In later years, the government sold the <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket</b> rights to brokers, who in turn hired agents and runners to sell them. These brokers eventually became the modern day stockbrokers for various commercial ventures.|$|E
25|$|Accidental loss: The {{event that}} {{constitutes}} the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, {{or at least}} outside {{the control of the}} beneficiary of the insurance. The loss should be pure, {{in the sense that it}} results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost. Events that contain speculative elements such as ordinary business risks or even purchasing a <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket</b> are generally not considered insurable.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1911, the City of Seattle {{created the}} first {{full-time}} jobs to support Market farmers and customers. The Market Inspector, his assistant, and a janitor were the first ever employees of the Pike Place Market. The Inspector, which was renamed Market Master shortly afterward, assigned stalls to farmers and collected their daily fees. The first Market Master, John Winship, initiated a lottery scheme to replace the previous first-come system. To buy a <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket</b> for a stall, farmers had to pay the next day's fee ahead of time. The Pike Place Market had many Japanese farmers, and Winship at first had them choose from a roll of tickets that made it more likely they would receive vendor stalls furthest from the heaviest customer foot traffic. Once the Japanese and other farmers complained about the practice, he quickly stopped it to ensure a fair lottery. In 1912, the Corner Market building was completed, {{across the street from}} the Bartell Building, which would later become the Economy Market.|$|E

25|$|She was {{the only}} {{daughter}} of Dr George Mitford, or Midford, who apparently trained as a medical doctor, and Mary Russell, a descendant of the aristocratic Russell family who grew up near Jane Austen and was an acquaintance of hers when young. At ten years old in 1797, young Mary Russell Mitford won her father a <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket</b> worth £20,000, but by the 1810s the small family suffered financial difficulties. In the 1800s and 1810s they lived in large properties in Reading and then Grazeley (in Sulhamstead Abbots parish), but, when the money was all gone after 1819, they lived on a small remnant of the doctor's lost fortune and the proceeds of his daughter's literary career. He {{is thought to have}} inspired Mary with the keen delight in incongruities, the lively sympathy, self-willed vigorous individuality, and tolerance which inspire so many of her sketches of character. She cared for her mother and father until their deaths and supported them and herself by proceeds from her writing.|$|E
25|$|The {{purchase}} of lottery tickets cannot {{be accounted for}} by decision models based on expected value maximization. The reason is that lottery tickets cost more than the expected gain, as shown by lottery mathematics, so someone maximizing expected value should not buy lottery tickets. Yet, lottery purchases can be explained by decision models based on expected utility maximization, as the curvature of the utility function can be adjusted to capture risk-seeking behavior. More general models based on utility functions defined on things other than the lottery outcomes can also account for lottery purchase. In addition to the lottery prizes, the ticket may enable some purchasers to experience a thrill and to indulge in a fantasy of becoming wealthy. If the entertainment value (or other non-monetary value) obtained by playing is high enough for a given individual, then the {{purchase of}} a <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket</b> could represent a gain in overall utility. In such a case, the disutility of a monetary loss could be outweighed by the combined expected utility of monetary and non-monetary gain, thus making the purchase a rational decision for that individual.|$|E
25|$|Thirty-five years later, Babette Hersant (Stéphane Audran) {{appears at}} their door. She carries only {{a letter from}} Papin, {{explaining}} {{that she is a}} refugee from counter-revolutionary bloodshed in Paris, and recommending her as a housekeeper. The sisters cannot afford to take Babette in, but she offers to work for free. Babette serves as their cook for the next 14 years, producing an improved version of the bland meals typical of the abstemious nature of the congregation, and slowly gaining their respect. Her only link to her former life is a <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket</b> that a friend in Paris renews for her every year. One day, she wins the lottery of 10,000 francs. Instead of using the money to return to Paris and her lost lifestyle, she decides to spend it preparing a delicious dinner for the sisters and their small congregation {{on the occasion of the}} founding pastor's hundredth birthday. More than just a feast, the meal is an outpouring of Babette's appreciation, an act of self-sacrifice; Babette tells no one that she is spending her entire winnings on the meal.|$|E

The McGees won their house in a raffle from Mr. Hagglemeyer's Wistful Vista Development Company, with <b>lottery</b> <b>ticket</b> #131,313, happened upon by chance while on a pleasure drive in their car.

500|$|Homer and Marge are {{scheduled}} to do a singing toast at their cousin Valerie's wedding, causing Marge to become nervous, due to her fear of embarrassment. Homer tells her not to worry, saying that he will {{make sure they do}} not mess up. Homer gets a fortune cookie stating that today will be his lucky day, but he does not believe so. However, he starts to believe this occurs when he crashes into a vending machine causing all of the snacks to fall out on him, and finds an Emerson, Lake & Palmer CD in the parking lot.

Eventually, Homer decides to tell Marge himself and get it over with. Taking Marge on a hot-air balloon, he reveals he won the lottery, causing Marge to become very glad and not furious about his absence at the wedding; he tells her he spent it all, leaving them poor as usual. However, Marge does not care, saying at least they have each other. Homer then reveals he spent the last of the money on a giant cherry blossom grove in the shape of Marge's face with the words [...] "Love of my Life".
