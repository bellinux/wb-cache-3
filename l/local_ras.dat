The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the expression of the <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> components in chondrocytes in vivo and the conditions allow-ing the expression. We stained five major regions of 8 -week-old C 57 BL/ 6 adult mice in which chondrocytes exist, including epiphy-seal plates and hyaline cartilages, with anti-bodies to <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> components. We also exam-ined the expression of <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> components in the cultured bovine’s articular cartilage chondrocytes using quantitative reverse tran-scription polymerase chain reaction and west-ern blot analysis. In result, hypertrophic chon-drocytes of epiphyseal plates included in the tibia and the lamina terminals expressed <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> components.

40|$|Retinoic acid (RA), {{an active}} form of vitamin A, is {{essential}} for life in vertebrates, owing to its capacity of influencing expression of a sizable fraction of all genes and proteins. It functions via two modes: (1) as controlling ligand for specific transcription factors in the nucleus it stimulates or inhibits gene expression from RA response elements in gene promoters; (2) in non-genomic pathways it activates kinase-signaling cascades that converge with additional influences to regulate gene expression and mRNA translation. RA performs {{a critical role in}} morphogenesis of the developing embryo, which is reflected in spatio-temporally changing expression patterns of RA-synthesizing and RA-degrading enzymes and in its biophysical characteristics as a small diffusible lipid. Because its histological localization cannot be directly visualized for technical reasons, its sites of action in vivo are inferred from the locations of the metabolic enzymes and through use of two kinds of RA reporter systems. Here we explain techniques for use of RA reporter cells and RA reporter mice, and we describe in situ hybridization methods for the three major RA-degrading enzymes: CYP 26 A 1, CYP 26 B 1, and CYP 26 C 1. Comparisons of the different indicators for sites of RA signaling demonstrate that <b>local</b> <b>RA</b> peaks and troughs are important for inferring some but not all locations of RA actions.

Recently, there has been a shift of emphasis from the circulating RAS to the <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> in the regulation of individual tissue functions via a paracrine and/or autocrine mechanism.

In this study, we analyzed the glomerular expression of RAS components in nephrotic models and the effect of Ang II receptor blockers (ARB) on the expression of angiotensinogen (AGT). Methods: The levels of glomerular expression of RAS components were analyzed in two nephrotic models: anti-nephrin antibody-induced nephropathy and PAN nephropathy, a mimic of human minimal change nephrotic syndrome. The effect of the ARB irbesartan on the expression of AGT in the nephrotic model was analyzed. Results: Glomerular expression of AGT and the receptors for Ang II was clearly increased in the nephrotic models, while the expression levels of renin, ACE and ACE 2 were decreased. ARB treatment suppressed the increase of glomerular expression of AGT in the nephrotic model.

The molecular basis of the Raldh 2 L-/- phenotype relies in part on the deregulation of Hoxc 8, which in turn regulates the RA receptor RARbeta. We further show that Hoxc 8 mutant mice, which exhibit a similar congenital forepaw defect, display at embryonic stages molecular defects that phenocopy the Raldh 2 L-/- motoneuron abnormalities.

However, it is unknown whether the <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> is related to bone mineral density (BMD) in glucocorticoid-induced {{osteoporosis}} (GIOP). Here, we revealed that the two main characteristics of GIOP might inhibit bone formation and enhance bone resorption. INTRODUCTION: The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the expression of the main RAS components in the trabecular bone of lumbar vertebrae in GIOP and analyze the relationship between the major RAS components and BMD. METHODS: We collected 96 inpatient cases of lumbar disc herniation from patients who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry examinations followed by surgical treatment in our hospital. Patients were divided into the GIOP group (n = 48) and control group (n = 48). The circulating and local expression levels of the main RAS components were examined. The correlation between the main RAS components and BMD was then analyzed. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of local bone angiotensin type 1 and 2 receptors (AT 1 R and AT 2 R, respectively) and RANKL was higher in the GIOP group compared with the control group (p 0. 05). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that AT 1 R and AT 2 R expression and the RANKL/OPG ratio in local bone were negatively associated with BMD (p < 0. 001, odds ratio (OR) 1. 236, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 207 - 1. 333; p < 0. 001, OR 1. 971, 95 % CI 1. 809 - 2. 233; and p < 0. 001, OR 1. 676, 95 % CI 1. 546 - 1. 845, respectively).

40|$|Research {{studies have}} been done on the {{influence}} of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on numerous tissues and organs. The <b>local</b> <b>RAS,</b> which is frequently of paracrine/autocrine origin, caters to specific organ and tissue needs through actions that add to, or differ from, the circulating RAS. Recent data have demonstrated a functional expression of RAS in the carotid body, wherein the carotid chemoreceptors play a major physiological role in the regulation of autonomic responses to changes in arterial chemical content. However, the angiotensin II and other vasoactive substances can directly modulate the excitability of the chemoreceptor. Long-term hypoxia modifies the level of gene expression in the carotid body by increasing the expression of AT 1 receptors along with sensitivity of the chemoreceptor to angiotensin II. Even though these findings support a physiological role of RAS in the carotid body, it has yet to be clearly defined. As a result this review will present current information about expression and localization of AT 1 receptors, and show that <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> exists in the carotid body.

However, factors that can increase or reduce the expressivity and penetrance of malformations in pregnancies in women with diabetes remain poorly identified. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) plays crucial roles in embryogenesis. Here, we find that Cyp 26 a 1, which encodes a key enzyme for catabolic inactivation of RA required for tight control of <b>local</b> <b>RA</b> concentrations, is significantly downregulated in embryos of diabetic mice. Embryonic tissues expressing Cyp 26 a 1 show reduced efficiency of RA clearance. Embryos exposed to diabetes are thus sensitized to RA and more vulnerable to the deleterious effects of increased RA signaling. Susceptibility to RA teratogenesis is further potentiated in embryos with a preexisting genetic defect of RA metabolism. Increasing RA clearance efficiency using a preconditioning approach can counteract the increased susceptibility to RA teratogenesis in embryos of diabetic mice. Our findings provide new insight into geneenvironment interactions that influence individual risk in the manifestation of diabetes-related birth defects and shed light on environmental risk factors and genetic variants for a stratified medicine approach to screening women with diabetes who are of childbearing age and assessing the risk of birth defects during pregnancy.

The {{aim of this study}} was to systematically review the effects of dietary lipids, either administrated as lipid-based diets or as supplements on RAS and hypertension in basic studies. Methods: Literature search was performed using Embase, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed and google scholar database for preclinical studies on the effect of lipid-base diets/supplements on RAS and hypertension. The articles had to be published between 1960 and 2014 written in English. Results: From the initial 3392 hits, 31 studies were included in the review.

40|$|Although the {{renin-angiotensin system}} (RAS) was classically {{considered}} as a circulating system that regulates blood pressure, many tissues are now known to have a <b>local</b> <b>RAS.</b> Angiotensin, via type 1 receptors, is a major activator of the NADPH-oxidase complex, which mediates several key events in oxidative stress and inflammatory processes involved in the pathogenesis of major aging-related diseases. Several studies have observed the presence of RAS components in the basal ganglia, {{and particularly in the}} nigrostriatal system. In the nigrostriatal system, RAS hyperactivation, via NADPH-oxidase complex activation, exacerbates oxidative stress and the microglial inflammatory response and contributes to progression of dopaminergic degeneration, which is inhibited by angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Several factors may induce an increase in RAS activity in the dopaminergic system. A decrease in dopaminergic activity induces a compensatory upregulation of <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> function in both dopaminergic neurons and glia. In addition to its role as an essential neurotransmitter, dopamine may also modulate microglial inflammatory responses and neuronal oxidative stress via RAS. Important counterregulatory interactions between angiotensin and dopamine have also been observed in several peripheral tissues. Neurotoxins and proinflammatory factors may also act on astrocytes to induce an increase in RAS activity independent or before the loss of dopamine. Consistent with a major role of RAS in dopaminergic vulnerability, increased RAS activity has been observed in the nigra of animal models of aging, menopause and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, which also showed higher dopaminergic vulnerability.

The underlying intraglomerular mechanisms {{are not yet}} fully elucidated. As podocyte injury constitutes a critical step in the pathogenesis of glomerular proteinuria, beneficial effects of ACEI and ARB may partially result from interference with a local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in podocytes. The knowledge of expression and function of a <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> in podocytes is limited. In this study, we demonstrate functional expression of key components of the RAS in differentiated human podocytes: podocytes express mRNA for angiotensinogen, renin, ACE type 1, and the AT 1 and AT 2 angiotensin receptor subtypes. In Western blot experiments and immunostainings, expression of the AT 1 and AT 2 receptor was demonstrated both in differentiated human podocytes and in human kidney cortex. ANG II induced a concentration-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration via AT 1 receptors in differentiated human podocytes, whereas it did not increase cAMP. Furthermore, ANG II secretion was detected, which was blocked by neither the ACEI captopril nor the renin inhibitor remikiren nor the chymase inhibitor chymostatin. ANG II secretion of podocytes was not increased by mechanical stress. Finally, ANG II was found to increase staurosporine-induced apoptosis in podocytes. We speculate that ACEI and ARB exert their beneficial effects, in part, by interfering with a <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> in podocytes.

In this experimental study we tested the relevance of naturally occurring genetic variation of ACE expression in animal models in the context of spontaneous polygenetic hypertension in the SHRSPHD model. We analyzed a congenic strain (SHRSP. WKY-Ace), derived from SHRSPHD in which a chromosomal fragment of rat chromosome 10 including Ace was replaced by the WKY- 0 HD locus. We analysed blood pressure levels by radiotelemetry, plasma ACE activity and tissue ACE messenger RNA in lung, kidney and the left cardiac ventricle in adult animals. Congenic animals showed a twofold increase in plasma ACE activity in comparison to SHRSPHD consistent with WKY- 0 HD. The increased tissue expression of ACE messenger RNA in the analyzed organs was equally increased in the congenic and WKY- 0 HD animals compared to the SHRSPHD Animals. The analysis of the congenic strain confirms that the Ace locus fully accounts for the difference observed between the two parental strains and also the cosegregation of the Ace locus is not related to blood pressure. There is no evidence of impact of the genetic determination within the hypertensive background.

From the Swedish National Hospital Discharge Register and the national Swedish Causes of Death Register, information about all first-ever myocardial infarctions and strokes in Malmo" residents between July 1997 and December 1999 was retrieved.

There was no association between COPD or restrictive pulmonary dysfunction and subsequent development of RA. Current smoking was a strong predictor for RA [odds ratio (OR) 1. 79; 95 % CI 1. 32, 2. 42]. Blue-collar workers had an increased risk of RA (OR 1. 54; 95 % CI 1. 12, 2. 10), independent of smoking. Conclusion. Pulmonary dysfunction did not predict RA, but smoking and low socio-economic status were independent risk factors for RA. Other effects of smoking may be important for RA susceptibilit...|$|R
40|$|For years, the {{renin-angiotensin system}} (RAS) was {{described}} as a circulating humoral system that regulates blood pressure and water homeostasis. Angiotensin II (AII) is the most important effector peptide. However, in addition to the “classical” humoral RAS there exist <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> in many tissues and locally formed AII activates NADPH-dependent oxidases, which are a major source of superoxide and are upregulated in major aging-related diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Accordingly, disruption of AII receptors promotes longevity in mice. The brain has an independent <b>local</b> <b>RAS,</b> which was also initially associated with the central control of blood pressure. However, more recent studies have involved brain RAS in brain disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. The interaction between AII and dopamine is particularly interesting. Recent evidence suggests that dopamine and AII systems directly counterregulate each other in renal cells {{as well as in the}} striatum and substantia nigra. Dopamine depletion may induce RAS upregulation as a potential compensatory mechanism. However, RAS hyperactivation also exacerbates NADPH-oxidase activity, oxidative stress and the microglial inflammatory response and contribute to progression of dopaminergic neuron loss, as observed in recent studies with animal models of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Aging is the most prominent risk factor for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, we observed increased activation of the NADPH oxidase complex and increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the nigra of aged male rats, which was associated with increased RAS activity and was reduced by treatment with AII antagonists. We also observed that the lack of oestrogen may act as an additional factor for increasing RAS activity in the nigra in aged females, which was significantly reduced by treatment with AII antagonists. Manipulation of the brain RAS may constitute an effective neuroprotective strategy against the aging-related risk of dopaminergic degeneration...|$|E
40|$|The renin {{angiotensin}} system (RAS) {{has long}} been a known endocrine system that is involved in regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance. Over the last 2 decades, evidence has accrued that shows that there are <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> that can affect cellular activity, tissue injury and tissue regeneration. There are locally active ligand peptides, mediators, receptors and signaling pathways of the RAS in the bone marrow (BM). This system is fundamentally involved and controls the essential steps of primitive and definitive blood cell production. Hematopoiesis, erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis, thrombopoiesis, formation of monocytic and lymphocytic lineages, as well as stromal elements are regulated by the local BM RAS. The expression of a local BM RAS has been shown in very early, primitive embryonic hematopoiesis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE- 1, CD 143) is expressed on the surface of hemangioblasts and isolation of the CD 143 positive cells allows for recovery of all hemangioblast activity, the first endothelial and hematopoietic cells, forming the marrow cavity in the embryo. CD 143 expression also marks long-term blood-forming CD 34 + BM cells. Expression of receptors of the RAS is modified in the BM with cellular maturation and by injury. Ligation of the receptors of the RAS has been shown to modify the status of the BM resulting in accelerated hematopoiesis after injury. The aim of the present review is to outline the known functions of the local BM RAS within the context of primitive and definitive hematopoiesis as well as modification of BM recovery by administration of exogenous ligands of the RAS. Targeting the actions of <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> molecules could represent a valuable therapeutic option for the management of BM recovery after injury as well as neoplastic disorders...|$|E
40|$|The {{initiation}} or {{progression of}} periodontitis might involve a local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in periodontal tissue. The {{aim of this}} study was to further characterize the <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> in human and rat periodontal tissues between healthy and periodontally-affected tissue. Components of the RAS were investigated using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experiments involving both human and Wistar rat periodontium. Although not upregulated when challenged with P. gingivalis-lipopolysaccharide, human gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblasts expressed RAS components. Likewise, healthy and inflamed human gingiva expressed RAS components, some of which were shown to be functional, yet no differences in expression were found between healthy and diseased gingiva. However, in inflamed tissue the immunoreactivity was greater for the AT 1 R compared to AT 2 R in fibroblasts. When compared to healthy tissue, ACE activity was increased in human gingiva from volunteers with gingivitis. Human-gingiva homogenates generated Ang II, Ang 1 - 9 and Ang 1 - 7 when incubated with precursors. In gingiva homogenates, Ang II formation from Ang I was nearly abolished only when captopril and chymostatin were combined. Ang 1 - 7 formation was significantly greater when human gingiva homogenates were incubated with chymostatin alone compared to incubation without any inhibitor, only captopril, or captopril and chymostatin. In rat gingiva, RAS components were also found; their expression was not different between healthy and experimentally induced periodontitis (EP) groups. However, renin inhibition (aliskiren) and an AT 1 R antagonist (losartan) significantly blocked EP-alveolar-bone loss in rats. Collectively, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that a <b>local</b> <b>RAS</b> system is not only present but is also functional in both human and rat periodontal tissue. Furthermore, blocking AT 1 R and renin can significantly prevent periodontal bone loss induced by EP in rats...|$|E

40|$|This thesis studies {{resource}} allocation (RA) problems in multi-cell orthogonal frequency {{division multiple access}} (OFDMA) downlink systems with co-channel interference (CCI). This thesis contains four parts. In the first part, four signal models used for formulating RA problems in multi-cell OFDMA downlink systems are overviewed. For comparison, the classic sum rate maximized RA problem with per-station individual power constraints is considered. Applying the four signal models, exact formulations of the considered RA problem are proposed. Properties of the different formulations are unveiled and compared. Based on existing RA methods, suggestions about choosing a suitable signal model and problem formulation are given. Finally, an interesting property of the recommended formulations is unveiled. In the second part, the sum (over all cells and all destinations) rate maximized problem is considered in multi-cell decode-and-forward (DF) relay-aided OFDMA downlink systems. An iterative RA algorithm is proposed to optimize mode selection (decision whether the relay should help or not), subcarrier assignment and pairing (MSSAP) and power allocation (PA) in an alternate way. The proposed algorithm is coordinate ascent (CA) based and can reach a local optimum in polynomial time. In the third part, user fairness is further considered in multi-cell DF relay-aided OFDMA downlink systems. The problem of maximizing the weighted sum of per cell min-rate (WSMR) with per-cell total power constraints is formulated and its per-cell maximum fairness property is proven. An iterative RA algorithm is proposed to obtain a local optimum of the problem. The convergence and the per-cell user fairness of the proposed RA algorithm are proven. In the fourth part, multiple DF relay stations (RSs) are considered to assist data transmission in each cell. An iterative semi-distributed RA algorithm is firstly proposed to reach a local optimum with guaranteed convergence. Then a modified iterative waterfilling (IWF) algorithm is further proposed {{to solve the problem}} autonomously. An optimum algorithm is proposed to solve the <b>local</b> <b>RA</b> problem in each cell. (FSA - Sciences de l) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
