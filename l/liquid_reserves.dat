Argentina's pound Sterling surpluses earned after 1946 (worth over US$200million) were made convertible to dollars by a treaty negotiated by Central Bank President Miguel Miranda; but after a year, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee suspended the provision. Perón accepted the transfer of over 24,000km (15,000mi) of British-owned railways (over half the total in Argentina) {{in exchange for the}} debt in March 1948. Due to political disputes between Perón and the U.S. government (as well as to pressure by the U.S. agricultural lobby through the Agricultural Act of 1949), Argentine foreign exchange earnings via its exports to the United States fell, turning a US$100million surplus with the United States into a US$300million deficit. The combined pressure practically devoured Argentina's <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> and Miranda issued a temporary restriction on the outflow of dollars to U.S. banks. The nationalization of the Port of Buenos Aires and domestic and foreign-owned private cargo ships, as well as the purchase of others, nearly tripled the national merchant marine to 1.2million tons' displacement, reducing the need for over US$100million in shipping fees (then the largest source of Argentina's invisible balance deficit) and leading to the inauguration of the Río Santiago Shipyards at Ensenada (on line to the present day).|$|E

For example, an acceptable debt structure could have an average maturity—averaged over estimated distributions for relevant financial variables—in excess of a certain limit.

50|$|The {{opening of}} a {{financial}} account of the balance of payments has been important during the last decade. Hence, financial flows such as direct investment and portfolio investment became more important. Usually financial flows are more volatile that enforce the necessity of higher reserves. Moreover, holding reserves, {{as a consequence of}} the increasing of financial flows, is known as Guidotti-Greenspan rule that states a country should hold <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> equal to their foreign liabilities coming due within a year. For example, international wholesale financing relied more on Korean banks in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, when the Korean Won depreciated strongly, because the Korean banks' ratio of short-term external debt to reserves was close to 100%, which exacerbated the perception of vulnerability.|$|E

40|$|We {{modify the}} {{compound}} Poisson surplus model for an insurer by including <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> and {{interest on the}} surplus. When the surplus of an insurer is below a fixed level, the surplus is kept as <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves,</b> which do not earn interest. When the surplus attains the level, the excess of the surplus over the level will receive interest at a constant rate. If the level goes to infinity, the modified model is reduced to the classical compound Poisson risk model. If the level is set to zero, the modified model becomes the compound Poisson risk model with interest. We study ruin probability and other quantities related to ruin in the modified compound Poisson surplus model by the Gerber-Shiu function and discuss the impact of interest and <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> on the ruin probability, the deficit at ruin, and other ruin quantities. First, we derive a system of integro-differential equations for the Gerber-Shiu function. By solving the system of equations, we obtain the general solution for the Gerber-Shiu function. Then, we give the exact solutions for the Gerber-Shiu function when the initial surplus {{is equal to the}} liquid reserve level or equal to zero. These solutions are the key to the exact solution for the Gerber-Shiu function in general cases. As applications, we derive the exact solution for the zero discounted Gerber-Shiu function when claim sizes are exponentially distributed and the exact solution for the ruin probability when claim sizes have Erlang(2) distributions. Finally, we use numerical examples to illustrate the impact of interest and <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> on the ruin probability...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a compound Poisson surplus model with constant dividend barrier and <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> under absolute ruin. When the surplus is negative, the insurer {{is allowed to}} borrow money at a debit interest rate to continue the business; when the surplus is below a fixed level △, the surplus is kept as <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves,</b> which do not earn interest; when the surplus attains the level △, the excess of the surplus over the level receives interest at a constant rate; when the surplus reaches a higher level b, the excess of the surplus above b is all paid out as dividends to shareholders of the insurer. We first derive the integro-differential equations satisfied by the moment-generating function and moment of the discounted dividend payments until absolute ruin. Then, applying these results, we get explicit expressions of them for exponential claims and discuss {{the impact of the}} model parameters on the expected dividend payments by numerical examples.|$|E

40|$|Making {{use of a}} {{structural}} model that allows for optimal liquidity management, we study the role that repos play in a bank׳s financing structure. In our model the bank׳s assets consist of illiquid loans and <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> and are financed {{by a combination of}} repos, long-term debt, deposits and equity. Repos are a cheap source of funding, but they are subject to an exogenous rollover risk. We show that the use of repos inflicts two types of indirect (“shadow”) costs on the bank׳s shareholders: first, it induces the bank to maintain higher <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> in order to alleviate the additional default risk; second, it adds to the cost of long-term debt financing. These shadow costs limit the bank׳s appetite for cheap but unstable repo funding. This effect is, however, weakened under poor returns on risky assets, access to deposit funding and the depositor preference rule. We also analyze the impact of a liquidity coverage ratio, payout restrictions and a leverage ratio on the bank׳s financing choices and show that all these tools are able to curb the bank׳s reliance on repos...|$|E

It had expanded into the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Like Japanese banks, domestic securities firms were supervised by the Japanese Ministry of Finance (MoF). Their levels of financial risk were monitored by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which tracked information pertaining to the daily business transactions of Yamaichi and other major firms and frequently conducted on-site examinations.

40|$|Empirical {{analysis}} {{does not}} suggest that reserves are "too high" {{in the majority of}} Asian countries, though China may be a special case. Much of the reserve increase in Asia can be explained by an optimal insurance model under which reserves provide a steady source of liquidity to cushion the impact of a sudden stop in capital inflows on output and consumption. Moreover, the benefits of reserves in terms of reduced spreads on privately held external debt further explains the observed growth in reserves since 1997 - 98. Using threshold estimation techniques, the paper shows that most of Asia can still benefit from higher reserves in terms of reduced borrowing costs.

40|$|This article {{examines}} whether financial sector development has ‘caused’ {{economic growth and}} investment in Ghana between 1970 and 2007. As a proxy for financial sector development we use credit to private sector as per cent of GDP, bank <b>liquid</b> <b>reserve</b> – asset ratio and liquid liability as a per cent of GDP. We use GDP growth {{as a proxy for}} economic growth and real domestic investment for investment growth. The dynamic interactions between the growth of real Per capita Gross Domestic Product, real domestic investment and indicators of financial sector development are investigated using the concept of Granger Causality after testing for cointegration using Johansen techniques. The empirical results obtained by the Johansen method suggest the existence of a stable long-run relationship between growth rate and financial sector development indicators identified in the study. The same is true for investment growth. However, with the exception of credit to private sector where the causality runs from economic growth only, we find bidirectional causality between economic growth and financial sector development indicators. For investment growth, the causality runs from investment growth to financial sector indicators except between investment growth and Liquid liability where bidirectional causality recorded.

40|$|We {{study the}} long {{standing}} {{issue of whether}} markets can supply banks with sufficient liquidity or whether markets should be complemented with a lender of last resort (LOLR). For this purpose, we develop an extended version of the recent model of Holmström and Tirole (1998) on the supply of liquidity to firms. H&Ts original model analyses liquidity supply to firms that are facing solvency shocks. We apply their framework to banking and extend the framework to admit the analysis of problems associated with transitory liquidity outflows, even absent any change in a bank's value. Our premise is that the scope for moral hazard may increase in connection with liquidity outflows. Moral hazard, which we interpret as the possibility of laxity in banks' monitoring of firms, may increase with liquidity outflows because banks need to increase their monitoring efforts in order to safeguard their own interests. The model illustrates many key aspects the classical LOLR debate. The model shows how moral hazard limits of banks’ ability to borrow from markets to cover liquidity outflows. It also predicts banks’ demand for <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> and the economies associated with centralization of reserves in a liquidity pool when the holding of <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> entails opportunity costs. Finally, the model enables discussion of viable lending policies for the LOLR and contrasts these with the ‘Bagehotian principles’, which are still widely used as benchmark criteria in evaluating LOLR operations. liquidity; lender of last resort; banking; central banking...|$|E
