5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all the cars <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grid per FIA race procedure. As Charlie Whiting signalled the green light to start the {{formation}} lap, a full field of twenty cars set off as normal for a single lap before forming the starting grid. At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E
5|$|Kubica had {{problems}} when running the soft compound tyre managing seventh but {{was happy with}} his lap in the final part of qualifying. He was ahead of Massa in the faster of the two Ferrari cars. Petrov secured ninth in the slower Renault car. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Sutil was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session in eleventh; his best time of 1:27.525 was eight tenths of a second slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alonso recorded the twelfth fastest time and could not secure {{a position in the}} final session as his car touched a white line under braking on the circuit, causing his car to slide. Nevertheless, Alonso thought that the error did not cost him time. He was followed by Pedro de la Rosa in the other Sauber car in 13th, who in turn, was ahead of Sébastien Buemi for Torro Rosso and Williams driver Rubens Barrichello. This formation continued on the eighth row of the grid, which was occupied by Jaime Alguersuari in the second Torro Rosso and Nico Hülkenberg in the other Williams. Vitantonio Liuzzi failed to move beyond the first session; the Force India driver qualified in 18th. The Lotus cars of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli lined up in 19th and 20th respectively. Timo Glock and Bruno Senna <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eleventh row of the grid, with their teammates Lucas di Grassi and Karun Chandhok qualifying {{at the rear of the}} field.|$|E

25|$|At the time, {{the players}} ascended a podium {{to receive their}} medals and then <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice for the playing of the {{national}} anthem, as the podium was only meant to accommodate one person. Only the team captains remained on the podium for the duration. After {{the completion of the}} anthem, Eruzione motioned for his teammates to join him on the podium. Today, podiums are not used for ice hockey; the teams line up on their respective bluelines after the final game.|$|E
25|$|Nondisjunction usually {{occurs as}} the result of a {{weakened}} mitotic checkpoint, as these checkpoints tend to arrest or delay cell division until all components of the cell are ready to enter the next phase. If a checkpoint is weakened, the cell may fail to 'notice' that a chromosome pair is not <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mitotic plate, for example. In such a case, most chromosomes would separate normally (with one chromatid ending up in each cell), while others could fail to separate at all. This would generate a daughter cell lacking a copy and a daughter cell with an extra copy.|$|E
25|$|At Jericho Mills, Warren {{found the}} river ford unprotected. He ordered Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin's {{division}} to wade across {{and establish a}} beachhead. By 4:30p.m., {{the rest of the}} corps crossed on pontoon bridges. Hearing from a prisoner that Confederates were camped nearby at the Virginia Central Railroad, Warren arranged his men into battle lines: the division of Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left, Griffin's on the right. Brig. Gen. Lysander Cutler's division then began moving onto Griffin's right. General Lee convinced his Third Corps commander, A.P. Hill, that Warren's movement was simply a feint, so Hill sent only a single division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox, along with artillery commanded by Col. William J. Pegram, to deal with Warren's supposedly minor threat.|$|E

25|$|However, the Thai {{artillery}} strongpoint at Ban Na {{had come}} under siege {{during the opening}} of Campaign 74B. Now the 165th Regiment from the 312th Division joined the attack. However, weather {{was not the only}} hindrance to close air support for the Thais; U.S. tactical air was also being diverted to bomb North Vietnam. Instead, BC 605 and BC 606 were tasked with seizing Hill 1663, four kilometers southwest of Ban Na. On 29 March, they <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> landing zone for insertion into a landing zone at the foot of Hill 1663. Forty troopers from BC 605 deserted rather than load up; they walked back to Long Tieng.

25|$|It was March 1968 at a minor club meeting when 17-year-old racer Barry Sheene <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{starting}} grid, on a works 125cc Bultaco, for {{his first}} race. It was an impressive debut by anyone's standards. Sheene had {{worked his way up}} to second place and threatening the leader, Mike Lewis, when the bike seized and spat its rider off over the handlebars. A rostrum position in the day's 250cc race was a great achievement, but an even better wasn’t very far away. Just one week later, and again at Brands, Sheene took his first race win, and he did it is style by an incredible 12 seconds. And the best was yet to come, for he dominated a field of 350cc machines, riding special 250cc Bultaco (with an enlarged 280cc capacity).|$|E
25|$|On April 15 {{humanitarian}} aid organizations were granted {{access to the}} camp {{for the first time}} since the invasion had begun. Palestinian Red Crescent Society and International Committee of the Red Cross staff entered the camp, accompanied by the IDF. Officials from the Red Crescent told lawyer Hassan Jabareen that the IDF did not allow them to move around the camps freely, and that advanced decomposition, as well as the enormous destruction in the camp, made it impossible to find and retrieve bodies without the proper equipment. That same day Adalah and LAW, the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment, filed a petition asking the Court to order the IDF to immediately hand over the bodies of Palestinians to the Red Cross or the Red Crescent, saying that the bodies of dead Palestinians were being left to rot in the camp. On April 19, a day after Israeli troops withdrew from the camp, journalists reported counting about 23 bodies that were <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outdoor grounds of the clinic, before being quickly buried by Palestinians.|$|E

500|$|Schulz {{returned}} to coaching in 1913 as the line coach and chief assistant coach for Fielding H. Yost at Michigan. [...] He held that position for three seasons from 1913–1915. [...] While {{working as an}} assistant coach at Michigan, Schulz has been credited with introducing the technique of overshifting a lineman on defense. [...] In 1913, Schulz developed a new blocking technique by shifting one of the linemen. [...] Coach Yost was unconvinced until Schulz performed a demonstration using Michigan's left guard Royce Traphagen. [...] Schulz first put Traphagen in the line position designated by Yost, Schulz <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side of the line and charged, [...] "almost wrecking Traphagen". [...] Then, Schulz had the groggy Traphagen line up in the spot designated by Schulz, and when Schulz charged he missed. [...] Schulz implemented the overshift technique during the 1913 season.|$|E
500|$|By September, the Dutch fleet under De Winter were {{blockaded}} {{within their}} harbour in the Texel by the British North Sea fleet under Duncan. At {{the start of}} October, Duncan was forced to return to Yarmouth for supplies and De Winter used the opportunity to conduct a brief raid into the North Sea. When the Dutch fleet returned to the Dutch coast on 11 October, Duncan was waiting, and intercepted De Winter off the coastal village of Camperduin. Attacking the Dutch line of battle in two loose groups, Duncan's ships broke through at the rear and [...] and were subsequently engaged by Dutch frigates <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side. The battle [...] split into two melees, one to south, or leeward, where the more numerous British overwhelmed the Dutch rear, and one to the north, or windward, where a more evenly matched exchange centred on the battling flagships. As the Dutch fleet attempted to reach shallower waters {{in an effort to}} escape the British attack, the British leeward division joined the windward combat and eventually forced the surrender of the Dutch flagship Vrijheid and ten other ships.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined up {{on one side of the}} room, and my guys were <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job". [...] In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.|$|E

50|$|Requirements for {{defensive}} tackles {{are highly}} dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{version of the}} defense being played. For example, the 4-4 of Joe Roman requires quickness, size, and a player no taller than 6' 4". In the 4-4 Split of Roman, the defensive tackles <b>line</b> <b>up</b> heads <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> offensive guard, or perhaps on their outside shoulder. In the 'G front' of Frank Beamer's teams, the weak side tackle <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside shoulder of the offensive guard, and the strong side tackle <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside shoulder of the offensive guard.|$|R
500|$|The {{older one}} sees White {{attack in the}} centre with moves like b2–b3, Bc1–b2, Qd1–d5, Nc3–e4 and c4–c5. White gets an {{important}} space advantage in the centre, but Black can attack the kingside with rook lifts. After 10.b3 a5 White can try to capture the Bc5 with 11.Na4 or 11.Ne4, one point being that the retreat 11...Ba7 would lock the Ra8 because Black has not played Ra8–a6 already. Lalic still thinks 11...Ba7 is the right move after 11.Ne4 due {{to the importance of}} the a7–g1 diagonal, but Black can also reroute the bishop with 11...Bf8 and [...] "White has no obvious path to even a minute advantage". After 11.Na4 Black can also simply react by 11...b6 when the loss of the bishop pair is compensated by the semi-open b-file and improved control of the central squares. Tseitlin considers that after the exchange on c5 Black has the better position. Hence the main continuation is 11.Bb2, keeping the knight jumps for later. Then the most common plan for Black is a rook lift: the plan Ra8–a6–h6 was tried in the much-commented game Åkesson–Tagnon (Berlin Open 1984). Black duly won, but after the game continuation 11...Ra6 12.Qd5! Qe7 13.Ne4 Ba7 14.c5 Rg6 15.Rac1 Bb8 16.f4 authors do not agree on which side had the advantage. Borik and Tseitlin both consider White to have a positional advantage, with Tseitlin recommending instead 15...Nc6!, with dangerous threats. However Lalic writes of 15...Bb8, [...] "it is true that the bishop pair looks a bit pathetic <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back rank just now, but {{there is no way to}} stop them breaking out later".|$|E
500|$|Vettel set {{the fastest}} {{time in the}} final session which {{clinched}} him the sixth pole position of his season (and his third consecutive) with a lap of 1:13.791 which was recorded on his final timed lap. Although {{he was happy to}} start on the pole he said his lap was not [...] "100% perfect" [...] as he drove off the circuit after he pushed hard. Vettel was joined on the grid's front row by Alonso who recorded a lap 0.002 seconds off Vettel's pace. Alonso had recorded the fastest times in the first and second sessions and was happy to start on the grid's front row. Massa took third despite running wide on his final timed lap but was optimistic on a track where he felt comfortable. Webber, fourth, ran wide at the Nordkurve right-hand corner on his final lap when he turned in late and cut the kerb which cost him three seconds and he opted to abandon his lap. The two McLaren cars <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grid's third row (with Button ahead of Hamilton). Button was happy with his lap whilst Hamilton said his qualifying pace was poor despite the McLaren drivers recording the fastest speeds on the circuit's main straight. Kubica qualified seventh and felt he could have set a faster lap time as he was held up in the track's final sector. He also believed that he would not have qualified in a higher position had he not been held up. Barrichello experienced understeer in the final session and lost his car's balance which restricted him to eighth position. Rosberg and Hülkenberg rounded out the top ten qualifiers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{was held on}} December 17, with attendance of Moses and company, along with Alfred Smith. 300 cars were <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> asphalt, {{which was designed to}} make night driving much easier over the concrete. Smith cut the ribbon on the new extension in Westbury, about [...] east of Glen Cove Road. A tour of the new parkway extensions was held, but not over the entire thing. The group went from Westbury along the new alignment of the Northern State, and south on the Wantagh to the Southern State. New lights were installed on the median of the parkways to help with lighting of the parkway. Before a luncheon for the officials, over 600 people were presented the new parkways. The new parkway opened to traffic, connecting drivers to various places along Long Island and New York City.|$|E

In October 1949 she again entered service between London and Australia, now with berths for 497 first class passengers and 487 in tourist class. During this period Felicity Kendal travelled to India on the ship, as a small child.

2500|$|An {{investigation}} into the accident was conducted by the Aviation Safety Council (ASC) of the Republic of China. The final report was issued by the ASC on 24 April 2002. In the report section [...] "Findings Related to Probable Causes," [...] which detailed factors that {{played a major role}} in the circumstances leading to the accident, it was stated that the flight crew did not review the taxi route, despite having all the relevant charts, and as a result did not know the aircraft had entered the wrong runway. Upon entering the wrong runway, the flight crew had neglected to check the paravisual display (PVD) and the primary flight display (PFD), which would have indicated that the aircraft was <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong runway. According to the ASC, these errors, coupled with the imminent arrival of the typhoon and the poor weather conditions, caused the flight crew to lose situational awareness and led them to attempt to take off from the wrong runway.|$|E
50|$|If, for example, {{eight men}} <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of scrimmage, the team loses an {{eligible}} receiver.
