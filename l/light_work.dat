5|$|The average modern horse on good hay or pasture with <b>light</b> <b>work</b> {{usually does}} not need supplements; however, horses {{subjected}} to stress due to age, intensive athletic work, or reproduction may need additional nutrition. Extra fat and protein are sometimes added to the horse's diet, along with vitamin and mineral supplements. There are hundreds, if not thousands of commercially prepared vitamin and mineral supplements on the market, many tailored to horses with specialized needs.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{travelled}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the four}} Tests, and being severely attacked in the previous match at Headingley, Johnson was dropped in favour of leg spinner Doug Ring. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. England were dismissed for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon with Ring not required to bowl, as the pacemen made <b>light</b> <b>work</b> of the hosts. Ring was economical in the second innings, taking 1/44 from 28 overs as Australia sealed the series 40 with another innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{then headed}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. England were {{dismissed}} for 52 in 42.1 overs {{on the first}} afternoon; Loxton bowled only two overs for one run as the frontline pacemen made <b>light</b> <b>work</b> of the hosts. His other notable action in the field occurred when Len Hutton the first runs of the match, a single in the first over. This had almost turned into a five when Loxton fired in a wide return, but Barnes managed to prevent from going for four overthrows. Loxton came in {{on the second day}} with the score at 5/265 and accompanied the centurion Morris for 39 further runs before Edrich had him caught behind for 15. He appeared uncomfortable with the outswingers and leg cutters of Bedser, and was beaten several times, before Edrich dismissed him. Australia ended at 389. Loxton was economical in the second innings, taking 0/16 from 10 overs as Australia dismissed the hosts for 188 to seal the series 4–0 with another innings victory.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, UUTV's great grandparent, <b>Light</b> <b>Works</b> Community Darkrooms, re-entered UUTV's {{life in a}} most {{unexpected}} manner. SU announced that they had accepted a very substantial grant, which would further develop the photography program of <b>Light</b> <b>Works</b> Community Darkrooms. Unfortunately, <b>Light</b> <b>Works</b> was physically located directly next to the UUTV studios in the Watston Theater complex. <b>Light</b> <b>Works</b> was hungry to acquire the UUTV real estate for their upcoming expansion, and their newfound grant money provided the political and monetary support that they needed. SU administration was eager to accept the <b>Light</b> <b>Works</b> grant, and only nominally aware of UUTV's activities. Consequently, the original Watson Theater television studio was completely gutted {{to make room for}} the <b>Light</b> <b>Works</b> expansion. The UUTV studios and offices were moved down the hall and squeezed into a space that formerly housed the original UUTV offices and the independent student radio station, WJPZ. The Watson Theater complex was renamed the Robert B. Menschel Media Center, in recognition of the <b>Light</b> <b>Works</b> donor.|$|R

25|$|Almost {{every country}} in the world has laws {{relating}} to and aimed at preventing child labour. International Labour Organisation has helped set international law, which most countries have signed on and ratified. According to ILO minimum age convention (C138) of 1973, child labour refers to any work performed by children under the age of 12, non-light work done by children aged 12–14, and hazardous work done by children aged 15–17. <b>Light</b> <b>work</b> was defined, under this Convention, as any work that does not harm a child's health and development, and that does not interfere with his or her attendance at school.

25|$|Oxen (singular ox) are cattle {{trained as}} draft animals. Often they are adult, {{castrated}} males of larger breeds, although females and bulls {{are also used}} in some areas. Usually, an ox is over four years old due {{to the need for}} training and to allow it to grow to full size. Oxen are used for plowing, transport, hauling cargo, grain-grinding by trampling or by powering machines, irrigation by powering pumps, and wagon drawing. Oxen were commonly used to skid logs in forests, and sometimes still are, in low-impact, select-cut logging. Oxen are most often used in teams of two, paired, for <b>light</b> <b>work</b> such as carting, with additional pairs added when more power is required, sometimes up to a total of 20 or more.|$|E
25|$|England won the toss and {{opted to}} bat first on a pretty benign pitch. Atherton (55) and Alec Stewart (70) made <b>light</b> <b>work</b> {{of the early}} going, {{advancing}} steadily throughout the first session. They added 121 for the first wicket but then the fireworks came. An hour before tea, Kenny Benjamin (6–66) had both openers caught behind by Junior Murray, then Robin Smith was clean bowled by Courtney Walsh for a duck. Graeme Hick and Graham Thorpe consolidated, before the former was winkled out by Adams, and Thorpe and Jack Russell followed with the score remaining on 172. Matthew Maynard dug in, but with wickets falling all around him, especially with Kenny Benjamin's impressive line and movement, {{he was unable to}} attack, and none of the tail could muster any significant support.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, in 1996, member {{countries}} of the European Union, per Directive 94/33/EC, agreed {{to a number of}} exceptions for young people in its child labour laws. Under these rules, children of various ages may work in cultural, artistic, sporting or advertising activities if authorised by the competent authority. Children above the age of 13 may perform <b>light</b> <b>work</b> for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country. Additionally, the European law exception allows children aged 14 years or over to work as part of a work/training scheme. The EU Directive clarified that these exceptions do not allow child labour where the children may experience harmful exposure to dangerous substances. Nonetheless, many {{children under the age of}} 13 do work, even in the most developed {{countries of the}} EU. For instance, a recent study showed over a third of Dutch twelve-year-old kids had a job, the most common being babysitting.|$|E

25|$|Bopara {{headed for}} the West Indies with England Lions in January 2011 after he missed out for the 2010-11 Ashes series Test and ODI squad and the 2011 World Cup. His stay in the Caribbean was cut short when he was called up to England's World Cup squad before the tournament as a {{replacement}} for the injured Eoin Morgan. Bopara played in England's opening match against the Netherlands and scored a match-winning 30 from 20 balls. After that, he did not play against India and Ireland as England chose to field a second spinner, Michael Yardy. Bopara returned to play against South Africa in place of the dropped Paul Collingwood. Bopara came in with the score at 15/3 and managed a partnership of 99 with Trott; Bopara ended with 60 of 98 balls. England restricted South Africa to 165 and Bopara was named the man of the match. England lost he next match by two wickets against Bangladesh, with Bopara scoring 16 runs. Bopara did not perform well against he West Indies, making just 4 with the bat, although England went on to win by 18 runs and progress to the quarter finals. Here, England were thrashed by ten wickets as Sri Lanka's openers made <b>light</b> <b>work</b> of England's target. Bopara scored 31 when he batted in the first innings.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fourth}} round Arsenal faced Stoke City of the Second Division at home. They made <b>light</b> <b>work</b> of the opposition, winning by three goals {{and once more}} set a unique record: David O'Leary's strike meant all 10 regular outfield players each had scored for Arsenal during the season. In his match report for The Times, Stuart Jones assessed: [...] "Having {{experienced}} northing but victory {{since the end of}} August, Arsenal are walking around with almost too much belief," [...] and felt complacency was the only issue preventing the club from reaching the quarter-finals.|$|E

As a slave, {{she could}} not have a {{marriage}} recognized under Virginia law, but many slaves at Monticello are known to have taken partners in common-law marriages and had stable lives. (No such marriage for Hemings is noted in the records.) While Sally Hemings worked at Monticello, she had her children nearby. According to her son Madison, while young, the children [...] "were permitted to stay about the 'great house', and only required to do such <b>light</b> <b>work</b> as going on errands". At the age of 14, each of the children began their training: the brothers with the plantation's skilled master of carpentry, and Harriet as a spinner and weaver. The three boys all learned to play the violin (Jefferson played the violin).|$|E

500|$|The {{opening of}} the 19th century was marked by an {{increase}} in interest in the connection between climate and plant distribution. Carl Willdenow (1765–1812) examined the connection between seed dispersal and distribution, the nature of plant associations and the impact of geological history. He noticed the similarities between the floras of N America and N Asia, the Cape and Australia, and he explored the ideas of [...] "centre of diversity" [...] and [...] "centre of origin". German Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859) and Frenchman Aime Bonpland (1773–1858) published a massive and highly influential 30 volume work on their travels; Robert Brown (1773–1852) noted the similarities between the floras of S Africa, Australia and India, while Joakim Schouw (1789–1852) explored more deeply than anyone else the influence on plant distribution of temperature, soil factors, especially soil water, and <b>light,</b> <b>work</b> that was continued by Alphonse de Candolle (1806–1893). Joseph Hooker (1817–1911) pushed the boundaries of floristic studies with his work on Antarctica, India and the Middle East with special attention to endemism. August Grisebach (1814–1879) in [...] (1872) examined physiognomy in relation to climate and in America geographic studies were pioneered by Asa Gray (1810–1888).|$|E

2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of the 2002 Polo, the GTI model was discontinued and was given no direct replacement. There was however a GT model produced, featuring the same 1.9 TDI [...] engine found in the popular Škoda Fabia vRS and SEAT Ibiza FR TDI as well as a six-speed gearbox. Although this model had a relatively slow 0–100nbsp&km/h (62nbsp&mph) time of over 9 seconds, it did have impressive mid-range clout with torque figures of 310 Nm (228nbsp&lb-ft). This gave the GT very impressive in-gear acceleration, meaning it could make <b>light</b> <b>work</b> of overtaking as well as pull itself out of corners on twisting B roads with ease whilst returning fuel economy of over 50 mpg.|$|E

Workers, except for those in merchant shipping, are also entitled to bargain collectively. There is a National Consultation and Collective Bargaining Commission that takes part in such negotiations. Forced labor is illegal, although it exists in a number of sectors, with children often involved. Children under 12 may not work at any job; those between 12 and 14 may do <b>light</b> <b>work</b> or hold domestic jobs.

[...] According to Associated Press writer Jennifer Kay, Pym is a swiftly paced satire which [...] "skewers Edgar Allan Poe, race in America, the snack-food industry, academia, landscape painting and abominable snowmen." [...] She concluded, [...] "A commentary on racial identity, obsessions and literature should not be as funny as Pym, but Johnson makes <b>light</b> <b>work</b> of his heavy themes."
