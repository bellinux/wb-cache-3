25|$|Machine <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{scientific}} discipline {{that deals with}} the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data. Such algorithms operate by building a model based on inputs and using that to make predictions or decisions, rather than following only explicitly programmed instructions.|$|E

25|$|Other constructivist {{scholars}} {{agree with}} this and emphasize that individuals make meanings through the interactions {{with each other and}} with the environment they live in. Knowledge is thus a product of humans and is socially and culturally constructed (Ernest 1991; Prawat and Floden 1994). McMahon (1997) agrees that <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> social process. He further states that learning is not a process that only takes place inside our minds, nor is it a passive development of our behaviors that is shaped by external forces and that meaningful learning occurs when individuals are engaged in social activities.|$|E

25|$|Reinforcement <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> third {{branch of}} machine learning, {{distinct}} from supervised and unsupervised learning, which also admits quantum enhancements. In quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning, a quantum agent interacts with a classical environment and occasionally receives rewards for its actions, {{which allows the}} agent to adapt its behaviour—in other words, to learn {{what to do in}} order to gain more rewards. In some situations, either because of the quantum processing capability of the agent, or due to the possibility to probe the environment in superpositions, a quantum speedup may be achieved. Implementations of these kinds of protocols in superconducting circuits and in systems of trapped ions have been proposed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} primary Upanishadic texts, Devas and Asuras discuss and act to seek knowledge, for {{different}} purposes. In one case, for example, {{they go to}} Prajāpati, their father, {{to understand what is}} Self (Atman, soul) and how to realize it. The first answer that Prajāpati gives is simplistic, which the Asuras accept and leave with, but the Devas led by Indra do not accept and question because Indra finds that he hasn't grasped its full significance and the given answer has inconsistencies. Edelmann states that this symbolism embedded in the Upanishads is a reminder that one must struggle with presented ideas, <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> process, and Deva nature emerges with effort.|$|E
25|$|The Centre for Extended <b>Learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{facility}} {{owned and}} {{managed by the}} university and is in Kitchener, Ontario. It provides pre-university courses, part-time studies, online learning and professional development courses. Another facility which is owned and managed by the university is the Waterloo Summit Centre for the Environment, in Huntsville, Ontario. It is a year-round research and teaching centre, which regularly hosts post-secondary student field courses and professional development programs, and {{also serves as a}} university outreach facility for the whole region. Close to Algonquin and Arrowhead Provincial Park, the centre's facilities are used for research in ecological restoration and conservation. It also hosts an ecological research facility, including a wet laboratory.|$|E

25|$|Sparse {{dictionary}} <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> representation learning method {{which aims}} at finding a sparse {{representation of the}} input data (also known as sparse coding) {{in the form of}} a linear combination of basic elements as well as those basic elements themselves. These elements are called atoms and they compose a dictionary. Atoms in the dictionary are not required to be orthogonal, and they may be an over-complete spanning set. This problem setup also allows the dimensionality of the signals being represented to be higher than the one of the signals being observed. The above two properties lead to having seemingly redundant atoms that allow multiple representations of the same signal but also provide an improvement in sparsity and flexibility of the representation.|$|E
25|$|A related finding {{indicates}} that slightly older infants can acquire both lexical and grammatical regularities {{from a single}} set of input, suggesting {{that they are able}} to use outputs of one type of statistical learning (cues that lead to the discovery of word boundaries) as input to a second type (cues that lead to the discovery of syntactical regularities. At test, 12-month-olds preferred to listen to sentences that had the same grammatical structure as the artificial language they had been tested on rather than sentences that had a different (ungrammatical) structure. Because learning grammatical regularities requires infants to be able to determine boundaries between individual words, this {{indicates that}} infants who are still quite young are able to acquire multiple levels of language knowledge (both lexical and syntactical) simultaneously, indicating that statistical <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> powerful mechanism at play in language learning.|$|E

According to the Universal approximation theorem, deep-ness isn't necessary for a neural network {{to be able to}} approximate arbitrary continuous functions. Even so, there are many problems that are common to shallow networks (such as overfitting) that deep networks help avoid. As such, deep neural networks are able to realistically generate much more complex models as compared to their shallow counterparts.|$|E

[...] Cooperative Learning Centers have been established in many countries around the world, as the Hong Kong Cooperative Learning Center, which had Johnson conduct a seven-year project to train faculty from all seven Hong Kong universities and many mainland universities in the use of cooperative learning. Cooperative Learning Centers can be found in Shanghai, Japan, Cyprus, Norway, Italy, and at multiple places in the United States and Canada.|$|E
2500|$|The kind of {{learning}} found among other primates is [...] "emulation learning," [...] which [...] "focuses {{on the environmental}} events involved– results or changes of state in the environment that the other produced– {{rather than on the}} actions that produced those results." [...] Tomasello emphasizes that emulation <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> highly adaptive strategy for apes because it focuses on the effects of an act. In laboratory experiments, chimpanzees were shown two different ways for using a rake-like tool to obtain an out-of-reach-object. Both methods were effective, but one was more efficient than the other. Chimpanzees consistently emulated the more efficient method.|$|E

2500|$|Latent <b>{{learning}}</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> form {{of learning}} that is not immediately expressed in an overt response; it occurs without any obvious reinforcement of the behaviour or associations that are learned. One example in fish comes from research with male three spot gouramis (Trichopodus trichopterus). [...] This species quickly form dominance hierarchies. To appease dominants, subordinates adopt a typical body posture angled at 15-60º to the horizontal, all fins folded and pale body colors. Individuals trained to associate a light-stimulus with the imminent arrival of food exhibit this associative learning by approaching the surface where the food is normally dropped immediately the light-stimulus is presented. However, if a subordinate is placed in a tank with a dominant individual and the light-stimulus is presented, the subordinate immediately assumes the submissive posture rather than approaching the surface. The subordinate has predicted that going to the surface to get food would place it in competition with the dominant, and to avoid potential aggression, it immediately attempts to appease the dominant.|$|E
2500|$|Connected <b>{{learning}}</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> type {{of learning}} that integrates personal interest, peer relationships, and achievement in academic, civic, or career-relevant areas. In addition, connected learning is an approach to educational reform keyed to the abundance of information and social connection brought about by networked and digital media. Advocates of connected learning posit that this approach leverages new media to broaden access to opportunity and meaningful learning experiences. The connected learning model suggests that youth learn best when: {{they are interested in}} what they are learning; they have peers and mentors who share these interests; and their learning is directed toward opportunity and recognition. According to the proponents of connected learning, social support for interest-driven learning and connections to multiple sites of learning activity drive individual learning outcomes. These individual outcomes also lead to collective outcomes by building knowledge, capacity and expertise in diverse communities. [...] Environments that support connected learning are generally characterized as having a sense of shared purpose, a focus on production, and openly networked infrastructures.|$|E

As Krakauer et al. put it: [...] "machine <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> powerful means of preprocessing data in preparation for mechanistic theory building, but should not be considered the final goal of a scientific inquiry." [...] In regard to cancer biology, Raspe et al. state: [...] "A better understanding of tumor biology is fundamental for extracting the relevant information from any high throughput data." [...] The journal Science chose cancer immunotherapy as the breakthrough of 2013. According to their explanation a lesson to be learned from the successes of cancer immunotherapy is that they emerged from decoding of basic biology.|$|E
