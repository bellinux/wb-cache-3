5000|$|Islamic law, {{like the}} legal systems of {{classical}} antiquity {{and the ancient}} Near East, does not contain a true equivalent of the modern concept of rape, which is in turn based on the modern notions of individual autonomy and inviolability of the body, particularly the female body. In modern terms, rape is {{at its most basic}} level a violation of another person's sexual autonomy. In the communally and patriarchically oriented societies of Late Antiquity, a woman's sexuality was construed as something in control of her <b>legal</b> <b>guardian</b> <b>or</b> owner rather than in her individual control. Therefore, the category of coercive sexual violation was not clearly differentiated from other categories such as consensual violation of sexual norms (seduction).|$|R
50|$|Legal {{incapacity}} is an invasive and sometimes, difficult legal procedure.

Most states' laws require that {{a minimum of two}} doctors or other health professionals, provide reports as evidence of such incompetence and the person must be represented by an attorney. Only then can the individual's legal rights be removed and legal supervision by a <b>guardian</b> <b>or</b> conservator be initiated.
