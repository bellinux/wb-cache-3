25|$|The Internet {{standards}} {{describe a}} framework {{known as the}} Internet protocol suite. This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols, originally documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123. The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the application layer, space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the client-server application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a peer-to-peer paradigm. Below this top layer, the transport layer connects applications on different hosts with a <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> through the network with appropriate data exchange methods.|$|E

25|$|Child {{partitions}} do {{not have}} direct access to hardware resources, but instead have a virtual view of the resources, in terms of virtual devices. Any request to the virtual devices is redirected via the VMBus to the devices in the parent partition, which will manage the requests. The VMBus is a <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> which enables inter-partition communication. The response is also redirected via the VMBus. If the devices in the parent partition are also virtual devices, it will be redirected further until it reaches the parent partition, where it will {{gain access to the}} physical devices. Parent partitions run a Virtualization Service Provider (VSP), which connects to the VMBus and handles device access requests from child partitions. Child partition virtual devices internally run a Virtualization Service Client (VSC), which redirect the request to VSPs in the parent partition via the VMBus. This entire process is transparent to the guest OS.|$|E
5000|$|One DTE-DCE {{interface}} to an X.25 {{network has}} {{a maximum of}} 4095 logical channels on which it is allowed to establish virtual calls and permanent virtual circuits, although networks {{are not expected to}} support a full 4095 virtual circuits. For identifying the channel to which a packet is associated, each packet contains a 12 bit <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> identifier made up of an 8-bit <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> number and a 4-bit <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> group number. [...] <b>Logical</b> <b>channel</b> identifiers remain assigned to a virtual circuit {{for the duration of the}} connection. [...] <b>Logical</b> <b>channel</b> identifiers identify a specific <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> between the DTE (subscriber appliance) and the DCE (network), and only has local significance on the link between the subscriber and the network. The other end of the connection at the remote DTE is likely to have assigned a different <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> identifier. The range of possible logical channels is split into 4 groups: channels assigned to permanent virtual circuits, assigned to incoming virtual calls, two-way (incoming or outgoing) virtual calls, and outgoing virtual calls. [...] (Directions refer to the direction of virtual call initiation as viewed by the DTE they all carry data in both directions.) The ranges allowed a subscriber to be configured to handle significantly differing numbers of calls in each direction while reserving some channels for calls in one direction. All International networks are required to implement support for permanent virtual circuits, two-way logical channels and one-way logical channels outgoing; one-way logical channels incoming is an additional optional facility. [...] DTE-DCE interfaces are not required to support more than one <b>logical</b> <b>channel.</b> [...] <b>Logical</b> <b>channel</b> identifier zero will not be assigned to a permanent virtual circuit or virtual call. [...] The <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> identifier of zero is used for packets which don't relate to a specific virtual circuit (e.g. packet layer restart, registration, and diagnostic packets).|$|E

30|$|In IEEE 802.15. 4 networks, when non-interfering <b>logical</b> <b>channels</b> {{are used}} in {{multiple}} PANs operating in a Personal Operating Space the inter-PAN communication is not possible because the PANs in the same region remain unaware of each other’s presence. This situation adversely hinders realizing the pervasive and synergistic vision of PANs, e.g., sharing information of common interest amongst PANs and accessing infrastructure networks hopping through multiple PANs. In this paper, we have presented a novel mechanism to allow communication between multiple PANs in the same POS that are using different <b>logical</b> <b>channels.</b> We have proposed a framework that enables neighboring PANs {{to communicate with each}} other by diffusing into each other through “bordering nodes”. The simulation results show improvement in delivery ratio when number of border nodes is increased, and also hinting at the likely detrimental effects when the borders nodes are indefinitely increased.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{wireless}} protocol, called the Adaptive Graph Partitioning Wireless Protocol, that dynamically partitions nodes into the available <b>logical</b> <b>channels</b> {{in such a}} manner so as to improve performance by balancing the intra-logical channel traffic between the available <b>logical</b> <b>channels,</b> and minimising the inter-logical channel traffic. We have simulated the performance of a simplified model of the system, at an instant in time, based on the following parameters: nodal load, number of channels, node buffer size, central entity buffer size, channel locality factor, and packet transmission probability. The simulations show the benefits of graph partitioning: when the channel loads are balanced and the channel locality factor is high, performance is significantly improved. We have also developed analysis for this simplified model of the system which serves as a upper bound calculation for packet loss in the system. 1.

50|$|MHL {{uses the}} same Transition-minimized {{differential}} signaling (TMDS) as HDMI to carry video, audio, and auxiliary data. However, MHL differs from HDMI in {{that there is only}} one differential pair to carry the TMDS data lane, compared to HDMI's four (three data lanes, plus the clock). Therefore these three <b>logical</b> data <b>channels</b> are instead time-division multiplexed into the single physical MHL data lane (i.e., with the <b>logical</b> <b>channels</b> sent sequentially), and the clock signal carried as a common mode signal of this pair. From MHL 3 onwards, the method for carrying the clock signal changed to being carried separately on the MHL CBUS pin instead.|$|R
