He {{became a member of}} the University of Adelaide Council in April 1912, as a representative of the Parliament. In 1913, a referendum to fix the closing time of licensed premises was proposed by the ULP. Even after the governing <b>Liberal</b> <b>Union</b> agreed to the conduct of the referendum at the next state election, Denny attacked them, claiming that they had no intention of implementing the outcome of the referendum if they were re-elected. Denny was returned unopposed at the March 1915 state election.|$|E
5|$|The first Labor {{party in}} South Australia was the United Labor Party in 1891, {{born out of}} a trade union {{association}} that recommended and supported trade unionist candidates. In response, the National Defence League (NDL) was born two years later. In 1909, the NDL combined with the Liberal and Democratic Union and the Farmers and Producers Political Union to form the <b>Liberal</b> <b>Union,</b> later known as the Liberal Federation. The ULP morphed into the Australian Labor Party in 1910, and has been known by this name ever since. A separate Country Party subsequently emerged, representing rural interests, but this was assimilated back into the conservative side of politics {{with the formation of}} the Liberal and Country League (LCL) in 1932. The South Australian party system has not deviated from this two-party divide, and all other parties gained negligible representation or influence, until the emergence of smaller parties such as the Australian Democrats in the late 20th century, and the Australian Greens and Family First Party in the 21st century.|$|E

5000|$|Although the <b>Liberal</b> Democratic <b>Union,</b> a {{coalition}} of centrist parties, received a slim plurality of votes, the conservative governing party, the National Radical Union, won the most seats due to a complex and controversial electoral system enacted by Karamanlis. A [...] "first past the post" [...] system was applied in the rural constituencies where the ERE was expected to gain a plurality, while proportional representation was reserved for the urban constituencies, where the <b>Liberal</b> Democratic <b>Union</b> was expected to lead. As a result, the <b>Liberal</b> Democratic <b>Union</b> came up 19 seats short of a majority.|$|R

The trials helped the party (also called the <b>Liberal</b> <b>Union</b> party) root out the Committee of Union and Progress from the political arena. On the 23rd of July, 1919, during the Erzurum Congress, General Kâzım Karabekir was issued a direct order from the Sultanate to place Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and Rauf Orbay under arrest and assume Kemal's position as Inspector-General of the Eastern Provinces.

25|$|On 3 July, the Romanian Parliament, at the {{proposal}} of majority represented by Social <b>Liberal</b> <b>Union,</b> voted {{the dismissal of}} President of the Senate and President of the Chamber of Deputies. Through an Emergency Ordinance, the government restricted the attributions of the Constitutional Court, restoring them to the 2010 status. Likewise, USL leaders Victor Ponta and Crin Antonescu started procedures to dismiss President Traian Băsescu. These measures irritated the international politicians which expressed concerns over the state of democracy {{and the rule of}} law in Romania. On 6 July, Băsescu was suspended after the impeachment motion filed by the ruling coalition passed the Parliament's vote. The motion passed with 256 votes, 39 more than the minimum required. USL leaders argued their action by saying that President Traian Băsescu has breached the Constitution and overstepped his authority.|$|E
