40|$|In 1997 the Flemish Environmental Agency (FEA) {{started a}} {{monitoring}} program "Pesticides in Rain in Flanders, Belgium". The original {{purpose of the}} monitoring program {{was to examine the}} possible occurrence of dichlorvos in rainwater and subsequent deposition. However, it was thought necessary from the beginning to monitor a wide range of pesticides. During the first year some 62 pesticides and metabolites and 9 polychlorinated biphenyls, were monitored at 4 locations. Nowadays the monitoring program has grown up to more than 100 pesticides and metabolites and I I polychlorinated biphenyls examined at 8 different locations. Rainwater is collected continuously and samples are examined for pesticides and PCB's on a weekly basis. In agreement with other European studies pesticides are found in rainwater samples during times of application. Pesticides which are most frequently detected are alpha-, beta-endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate, gamma-HCH (lindane), dichlorvos, atrazine, diuron, DNOC, glyphosate and AMPA and isoproturon. Furthermore it was seen that most pesticides showed a deposition pattern related to <b>local</b> <b>spraying</b> operations...|$|E
40|$|Transmission of dengue viruses (DENV), {{the leading}} cause of arboviral disease worldwide, is known to vary through time and space, likely owing to a {{combination}} of factors related to the human host, virus, mosquito vector, and environment. An improved understanding of variation in transmission patterns is fundamental to conducting surveillance and implementing disease prevention strategies. To test the hypothesis that DENV transmission is spatially and temporally focal, we compared geographic and temporal characteristics within Thai villages where DENV are and are not being actively transmitted. Cluster investigations were conducted within 100 m of homes where febrile index children with (positive clusters) and without (negative clusters) acute dengue lived during two seasons of peak DENV transmission. Data on human infection and mosquito infection/density were examined to precisely (1) define the spatial and temporal dimensions of DENV transmission, (2) correlate these factors with variation in DENV transmission, and (3) determine the burden of inapparent and symptomatic infections. Among 556 village children enrolled as neighbors of 12 dengue-positive and 22 dengue-negative index cases, all 27 DENV infections (4. 9 % of enrollees) occurred in positive clusters (p < 0. 01; attributable risk [AR] = 10. 4 per 100; 95 % confidence interval 1 - 19. 8 per 100]. In positive clusters, 12. 4 % of enrollees became infected in a 15 -d period and DENV infections were aggregated centrally near homes of index cases. As only 1 of 217 pairs of serologic specimens tested in positive clusters revealed a recent DENV infection that occurred prior to cluster initiation, we attribute the observed DENV transmission subsequent to cluster investigation to recent DENV transmission activity. Of the 1, 022 female adult Ae. aegypti collected, all eight (0. 8 %) dengue-infected mosquitoes came from houses in positive clusters; none from control clusters or schools. Distinguishing features between positive and negative clusters were greater availability of piped water in negative clusters (p < 0. 01) and greater number of Ae. aegypti pupae per person in positive clusters (p = 0. 04). During primarily DENV- 4 transmission seasons, the ratio of inapparent to symptomatic infections was nearly 1 : 1 among child enrollees. Study limitations included inability to sample all children and mosquitoes within each cluster and our reliance on serologic rather than virologic evidence of interval infections in enrollees given restrictions on the frequency of blood collections in children. Our data reveal the remarkably focal nature of DENV transmission within a hyperendemic rural area of Thailand. These data suggest that active school-based dengue case detection prompting <b>local</b> <b>spraying</b> could contain recent virus introductions and reduce the longitudinal risk of virus spread within rural areas. Our results should prompt future cluster studies to explore how host immune and behavioral aspects may impact DENV transmission and prevention strategies. Cluster methodology could serve as a useful research tool for investigation of other temporally and spatially clustered infectious diseases...|$|E

Two constant gas densities of 15 kg/m 3 and 30 kg/m 3 were maintained under non-evaporating (ambient temperature 40 ºC) and evaporating (ambient temperature 400 ºC) conditions. The range of injection pressure was from 800 bar to 1600 bar. Liquid phase <b>spray</b> penetration and <b>local</b> <b>spray</b> cone angle along the spray profile were measured based on high speed shadowgraph images.

The majority of patients perceive TRUS-guided {{prostate biopsy}} as a physically and psychologically traumatic experience. We aimed to compare in this paper the efficacy of three different anesthesia techniques to control the pain during the procedure. Materials and methods: 150 patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy were randomly divided into three groups. Group A included 50 patients who received one hour before the procedure a mixture of 2. 5 % lidocaine and 2. 5 % prilocaine, Group B: 50 patients who received intrarectal local anesthetic administration (lidocaine 5 ml 10 %) and lidocaine <b>local</b> <b>spray</b> 15 % and Group C included 50 patients who received periprostatic block anesthesia (lidocaine 10 ml 10 %). Visual analogue scale (VAS) of patients in different groups was evaluated {{at the end of the}} biopsy and 30 minutes after the procedure. Results: The VAS of patients in Group A was 1. 32 ± 0. 65 (VAS I) and 2. 47 ± 0. 80 (VAS II). In group B the VAS of patients was 1. 09 ± 0. 47 (VAS I) and 1. 65 ± 0. 61 (VAS II).

40|$|In Diesel engines, {{the quality}} of fuel {{atomization}} and fuel-air mixing inside the cylinder have important effects on the combustion process, and therefore strongly related to the fuel efficiency and emission formation. To understand how the injected fuel mixes with air and combustion processes in a Diesel engine, fundamental spray experiments {{can be carried out}} in a constant chamber under different engine-like conditions. In this thesis, two investigations are included, one to investigate liquid phase spray images and the other to investigate spray characteristics of Diesel-ethanol fuel blends under non-combusting and combusting conditions. Although Diesel spray experiments have been carried out over several decades, some basic questions remain unclear, such as how to define, calculate and evaluate liquid phase spray penetration lengths and cone angles. Hence, in this work, Diesel spray experiments were performed under non-evaporating, evaporating and combusting conditions, and shadowgraph spray images were evaluated. It was found that penetration lengths determined from either instantaneous or averaged images were similar and little influenced by the threshold level. Under combusting conditions, during the early phase of injection, there were little differences in the penetration length when the threshold level was changed, whereas during the later phase of injection, the measured penetration length was sensitive to changes in the threshold level and there were significant differences between the penetration lengths determined from instantaneous and averaged images. The <b>local</b> <b>spray</b> cone angle was calculated along the whole spray profile by measuring the width at different distances from the nozzle tip. It was found that at around 12 mm from the nozzle tip, the measured <b>local</b> <b>spray</b> cone angle was constant during most injections. Further downstream, the <b>local</b> <b>spray</b> cone angle increased up to about 75 % of the penetration length under non-evaporating and evaporating conditions, whereas it decreased under combusting conditions. To reduce soot formation, one of the pathways is to increase the content of oxygen atoms in the fuel itself. Since ethanol contains oxygen atoms and has a low carbon-to-hydrogen (C/H) ratio, it can be used as an additive to reduce soot emission. In addition, ethanol can be produced as a sustainable fuel. Therefore, in the present work, 10 % and 20 % ethanol was blended in Diesel fuel (European EN 590 standard Diesel fuel) and the influence of the fuel blends on spray characteristics was investigated under non-combusting and combusting conditions in the Chalmers high-pressure/high-temperature spray chamber. It was found that differences in the fuel composition did not significantly affect the liquid phase spray penetration length or cone angle under non-evaporating or evaporating conditions. Under combusting conditions, reducing the ambient temperature increased the ignition delay and delayed the onset of soot formation for all fuels. Furthermore, E 10 and E 20 showed longer ignition and soot formation delays than pure Diesel. As the ethanol content of the fuel was increased from 0 % to 20 %, the lift-off length increased and the detectable soot luminescence decreased...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} spray angle on the {{properties}} of plasma spray deposits has been investigated. Two different materials, NiAl and Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr, were sprayed at angles from 50 to 90 ° {{with respect to the}} substrate. The spray angle influenced the microstructure and {{the properties of}} the deposits. The porosity increased as the spray angle decreased, i. e. as the angle was shifted away from the perpendicular position. The surface roughness of the Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr deposit was not sensitive to the spray angle, whereas NiAl exhibited an increase as the spray angle decreased. Microhardness, tensile adhesion strength, and interfacial fracture toughness decreased with spray angle. The change of these properties with spray angle is attributed to (1) the morphology of the splats, (2) the change of the <b>local</b> <b>spray</b> angle, and (3) the change of momentum of particles impacting on the substrate or previously deposited particles.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of spray cooling technology is the prediction of local and average heat flux on the heater surface. It {{has been suggested that}} spray cooling heat transfer depends on the <b>local</b> <b>spray</b> mass flux. However, in this work it is hypothesized and demonstrated that local single-phase and boiling heat transfer can be predicted within ± 25 % of the measured values from the local normal pressure produced by the spray. In the single-phase study, hollow cone, full cone, and flat fan sprays operated at three standoff distances, five spray pressures, and two nozzle orientations were used to identify the relation between impingement pressure and heat transfer coefficient. PF- 5060, PAO- 2, and PSF- 3 were used as test fluids, resulting in Prandtl number variation between 12 - 76. A 7 × 7 mm 2 micro-heater array consisting of 96 platinum resistance heaters operated at constant temperature was used to measure the local heat flux. A separate test rig was used to make impingement pressure measurements for the same geometry and spray pressure. The heat flux data were then compared with the corresponding impingement pressure data to develop a pressure-based correlation for single-phase spray cooling heat transfer. Hollow cone and full cone PF- 5060 sprays at three subcooling levels were used for the two-phase heat transfer study. The conventional wisdom is that the temperature at which critical heat flux (CHF) is observed changes with the droplet impact velocity, droplet number density, and droplet size. However, the present measurements indicate that although the magnitude of CHF is strongly dependent on the spray characteristics, the temperature at which CHF occurs lies within a very narrow band (about ± 5 °C) for smooth flat surfaces. This was also observed from local measurements at various radial distances using hollow cone and full cone spray nozzles where the local mass flux varies dramatically. This observation along with liquid properties and subcooling were used to develop a correlation to predict local CHF for PF- 5060 sprays. The single-phase and CHF correlations were combined to predict <b>local</b> <b>spray</b> cooling curve within ± 25 % of the measured valued over the sprays impingement zones...|$|R

40|$|Grape vineyards, {{especially}} in regions of mixed cereal and field crop production {{have historically been}} exposed to auxin-type herbicides, presumably {{from a combination of}} <b>local</b> <b>spray</b> drift and regional off-target movement. The combined efforts among affected grape and cereal grain commodity groups, regulatory agencies, and land grant university research has significantly reduced the severity and number of reported auxin-type herbicide injuries over the past fifty years. These efforts have lead to the banning of dust and volatile ester formulations, restricting the timing of low volatile ester formulations, and prohibiting applications when physical drift is likely. Unfortunately, episodic vine injuries from off-target herbicide movement remain severe and occasionally cause economic losses to the grape industry. Recent WSU air and vine injury monitoring programs further underscore the chronic nature of regional off-target movement of this class of herbicides to vineyards throughout the Columbia River and Walla Walla valleys. The auxin-type herbicides will remain important agrochemical tools for economically managing broadleaf weeds cereal grains and field crops. To minimize future injury to non-target sensitive crops, all stakeholders must continue to work together.

Care is taken to establish accurate synchronisation between camera and injection system {{and because of the}} relatively large exposure time, an effective camera image time is calculated for every frame. Further emphasis is given to determining the actual start of fuel mass injection by comparing (for each injection) a predetermined, rail pressure dependent needle relaxation distance to the actual needle lift signal. The spatiotemporal evolution of the spray is found to reproduce well in general, but often sprays suffer from short-lived, small, laterally moving anomalies, which influence axial motion and the spray cone angle. High speed shadowgraphy allows this to be observed and taken into account. After an overview of methods found in the literature, an algorithm for geometrical analysis is presented, which is based on an extension of a combination of those methods. In this algorithm, a <b>local</b> <b>spray</b> angle i(x) is determined from lateral cross-sections at 80 % of the shadow level in order to encompass most of the spray without being too sensitive to background noise. The macroscopic cone angle cone is derived from the approximate constancy of i(x) over a relatively long axial distance. Spray penetration is obtained by lateral integration of the spray shadow. A procedure for accurate correlation of spray growth with time shows that the growth is proportional to tb with b = 0. 57 ± 0. 02 for a common rail pressure of 150 MPa and a gas density 33 kg/m 3 (N 2 at room temperature).

The measured data include time histories of the prescribed displacement, the acceleration, the resultant force, and the wave elevation at several locations away from the body. Both the deck dry condition and green-water_on-deck cases are studied. A range of oscillation frequencies and amplitudes are covered to investigate steep waves, <b>local</b> wavebreaking, and <b>spray</b> sheets. Video recordings were also taken in each run to provide qualitative photographs for breaking wave profiles and contact line dynamics...|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000397089300005 International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} a multiresolution tomographic algorithm to reconstruct drop-size distribution and liquid volume concentration within <b>local</b> regions of <b>sprays.</b> The reconstruction procedures allow {{the size of}} the local regions to be designed adaptively such that the reconstruction results can be obtained at multiple resolutions. The algorithm employs the strip integration together with laser diffraction measurements with overlapping beam sampling. The algorithm has been tested with both the synthetic and measured line-of-sight data of a solid-cone spray. The reconstructed results from this algorithm are in the form of local volume-weighted drop- size distributions which contain both qualitative and quantitative information of the drop-size distribution. The reconstruction results are comparable to those obtained by using the classical reconstruction techniquewith a smaller laser beam diameter. The comparison shows good agreement. Furthermore the proposed measurement technique consumed less calculation time and spent fewer working hours on measurement setup procedures...|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{audit of}} upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in 36 hospitals across two regions provided data from 14, 149 gastroscopies of which 1113 procedures were therapeutic and 13, 036 were diagnostic. Most patients received gastroscopy under intravenous sedation; midazolam was the preferred {{agent in the}} North West and diazepam was preferred in East Anglia. Mean doses of each agent used were 5. 7 mg and 13. 8 mg respectively, {{although there was a}} wide distribution of doses reported. Only half of the patients endoscoped had some form of intravenous access in situ and few were supplied with supplementary oxygen. The death rate from this study for diagnostic endoscopy was 1 in 2000 and the morbidity rate was 1 in 200; cardiorespiratory complications were the most prominent in this group and there was a strong relation between the lack of monitoring and use of high dose benzodiazepines and the occurrence of adverse outcomes. In particular there was a link between the use of <b>local</b> anaesthetic <b>sprays</b> and the development of pneumonia after gastroscopy (p < 0. 001). Twenty perforations occurred {{out of a total of}} 774 dilatations of which eight patients died (death rate 1 in 100). A number of units were found to have staffing problems, to be lacking in basic facilities, and to have poor or virtually non-existent recovery areas. In addition, a number of junior endoscopists were performing endoscopy unsupervised and with minimal training...|$|R
40|$|Two hundred {{patients}} were interviewed {{before and after}} elective bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy. Premedication consisted of pethidine together with either atropine or hyoscine. Anaesthetic drugs were restricted to thiopentone and suxamethonium. Eight patients (4 %) described some degree of awareness. No statistically significant correla-tion with awareness was demonstrated for the premedication, the sex, or {{the weight of the}} patients, but awareness was more common in the younger age group. Awareness could not be related {{to the size of the}} induction dose of thiopentone, the use of a "single shot " technique, or the use of incremental injections, duration of anaesthesia, dosage calculated in mg/kg/min, the use or not of <b>local</b> anaesthetic <b>spray,</b> or the status of the anaesthetist. Awareness during the apnoeic oxygenation technique is only a particular instance of the general problem of awareness during anaesthesia. Probably the most significant hazard is overhearing conversation. Whenever possible comments during the procedure about pathology and prognosis should be avoided. Awareness during general anaesthesia is not a new problem. In particular the use of the apnoeic oxy-genation technique with general anaesthesia for endoscopic procedures on the respiratory passages is known to be associated with an appreciable fre-quency of complaints of awareness. This complica-tion is well known but poorly documented. The purpose of the present study was to investi-gate the frequency of occurrence of awareness associ-ated with the apnoeic oxygenation technique in our hospital and to assess the value of hyoscine premedi-cation in preventing the awareness...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{description of}} the eddy structure that occurs in turbulent combustion processes {{can be obtained by}} the use of laser velocimetry, as shown in this work. The mean eddy length scales, eddy lifetimes, and turbulent diffusivity have been determined in a spray combustion flame for the first time. Velocity data was obtained at various locations within the flame, and standard correlation techniques were modified and then applied to reduce the data. In order to assess how the spray burns, the measured eddy lifetimes were compared with the relevant reaction times and drop lifetimes. Conditions that are conducive to group combustion of the droplets, rather than individual droplet combustion, were found to exist in the upstream region of the <b>spray.</b> <b>Local</b> measurements of the hydrocarbon concentration also support the conclusion that the majority of droplets undergo group combustion. However, the data indicate that some of the larger drops can survive the initial burning region and form a dilute spray downstream where conditions favor individual droplet combustion...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the attitude of patients about to undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy toward the use of an oral lidocaine spray which contained alcohol. Materials and Method: It is customary to offer patients about to undergo a gastroscopy intravenous sedation, an oral <b>local</b> anesthetic <b>spray</b> or a combination of both. However, the presence of alcohol within the oral spray is seldom discussed with patients. There are some religious groups, such as fundamentalist Christians and Muslims, who will only consider the use of alcohol in exceptional circumstances. There are also others who are reluctant to use it for a range of reasons. One hundred patients undergoing a diagnostic gastroscopy because of dyspeptic symptoms at the University Hospitals of Leicester were provided with an information sheet about sedation. Of the 100 patients asked {{to take part in the}} audit 25 were South Asian. Eleven of these patients were Muslim and 11 Hindu. Results: Fifteen patients declined to use the spray (13 Europeans and 2 South Asians). The reasons varied with only two doing so for religious reasons. One of the patients was a Muslim and the other a Christian. However, almost 90 % of people believed all patients should be told of the alcohol content of the oral spray so as to allow them to make an informed choice. Conclusion: All patients who are to undergo an endoscopy should be told of the alcohol content of any oral anesthetic spray, so that they can make an informed choice as to whether they wish to receive it...|$|R
