5|$|In 1984, Metro {{undertook}} {{two steps}} to secure {{completion of the}} Green Line. First, the transit agency hired former U.S. Secretary of Transportation William T. Coleman, Jr. in December 1983 to oversee negotiations with the various entities involved with the siting of the Green <b>Line</b> <b>route</b> and seek a resolution through the U.S. district court. On February 21, 1984, Prince George's County Executive Parris Glendening announced that construction of the Green Line in Prince George's must start by September 30, 1984, or he would begin vetoing Metro spending proposals. At the same time, Metro and Coleman opened negotiations to build the Green Line from the L'Enfant Plaza Station to Anacostia. Advocates of the Rosecroft route, however, warned that they would sue if Metro switched {{back to the original}} route.|$|E
5|$|Planning for Metro {{began with}} the Mass Transportation Survey in 1955 which {{attempted}} to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient {{to meet the needs}} of 1980. In 1959, the study's final report included two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown Washington. Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia, alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating a moratorium on freeway construction through July 1, 1962. The National Capital Transportation Agency's 1962 Transportation in the National Capital Region report anticipated much of the present Blue <b>Line</b> <b>route</b> in Virginia with the route following the railroad right-of-way inside Arlington and Alexandria to Springfield. It did not include a route in Prince George's County. The route continued in rapid transit plans until the formation of WMATA.|$|E
5|$|The CLR's next planned {{extension}} was westward to Ealing. In 1905, the Great Western Railway (GWR) {{had obtained}} parliamentary approval {{to construct the}} Ealing and Shepherd's Bush Railway (E), connecting its main <b>line</b> <b>route</b> at Ealing Broadway to the West London Railway (WLR) north of Shepherd's Bush. From Ealing, the new line was to curve north-east through still mostly rural North Acton, then run east for a short distance parallel with the GWR's High Wycombe line, before curving south-east. The line was then to run on an embankment south of Old Oak Common and Wormwood Scrubs before connecting to the WLR a short distance {{to the north of}} the CLR's depot.|$|E

The station is the 20th stop westbound on the Westside MAX, and the western terminus of the MAX Blue <b>Line</b> <b>route.</b> Opened in 1998, it {{is located in the}} same block as the Hillsboro Post Office and adjacent to the Washington County Courthouse and the Hillsboro Civic Center. The block is bounded by First and Adams streets on the east and west and Washington and Main streets on the south and north. The station is named in honor of Mark O. Hatfield, a former United States Senator from Oregon and light rail proponent.|$|E
5|$|The route {{crosses the}} Big Timber Creek into Camden County, {{running along the}} border of Runnemede and Gloucester Township. County Route 544 veers to the right onto Evesham Road, and Route 41 {{continues}} northeast on Clements Bridge Road into Runnemede. At the intersection with Route 168, Route 41 becomes county-maintained and runs concurrent with County Route 573. The two routes cross into Barrington, where they pass over the New Jersey Turnpike. Upon crossing a Conrail railroad <b>line,</b> <b>Route</b> 41 and County Route 573 run along the border of Barrington and Haddon Heights, with Barrington to the southeast and Haddon Heights to the northwest. The two routes pass under Interstate 295 before meeting U.S. Route 30 at a modified traffic circle.|$|E
5|$|In January 1978, a WMATA {{regional}} {{task force}} approved a Green <b>Line</b> <b>route</b> in Anacostia that followed Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue and then Wheeler Road down to the Beltway (with a new station added near St. Elizabeths Hospital). Nonetheless, the Prince George's County government demanded in May 1978 that WMATA chose the Suitland-Parkway-to-Rosecroft route instead, and WMATA agreed to the change. In August 1978, WMATA's Board of Directors recommended {{to the federal government}} and its partner state and local governments that the entire -long (160.9 kilometres) Metrorail system be fully built—a proposal that included immediate construction of the Archives, Waterfront, Navy Yard – Ballpark, and Anacostia stations. WMATA announced in November 1978 that it had secured funding to build the Green Line from Gallery Place to Waterfront and that construction was nearly complete on this portion of the line, but that funding did not exist to push the line from Waterfront to Anacostia. Nonetheless, Metro reiterated that it intended to complete the extension to Anacostia Station by late 1983.|$|E

5|$|The {{pre-existing}} {{portions of}} the Silver Line, which became the Orange and Blue Lines, opened on July 1, 1977 from Stadium-Armory to Rosslyn, on December 11, 1979 from Rosslyn to Ballston, November 22, 1980 from Stadium-Armory to Addison Road, June 7, 1986 from Ballston-MU through East Falls Church and December 18, 2004 from Addison Road to Largo Town Center. Unlike all prior segments of the Metrorail system, which were designed and constructed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), this line will be designed and constructed by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) and operated by WMATA. The {{first phase of the}} project is funded 43% by $900 million of federal funding, 28% by a special tax district on commercial property proximate to the Silver <b>Line</b> <b>route</b> and 28% by a $0.50 toll increase on the Dulles Toll Road. Funding for {{the second phase of the}} project will be shared by Loudoun County, Fairfax County, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the MWAA.|$|E
5|$|Funding {{problems}} delayed construction even further. In February 1982, President Ronald Reagan proposed cutting Metro construction funds by 21.4 {{percent to}} just $295 million a year. Planned Green Line construction constituted 40.5 percent of Metro's construction budget, and the cuts threatened {{to cancel the}} entire Green Line. To African American community leaders, the cuts were evidence that Metrorail was meant for suburban white commuters while inner city African Americans were relegated to taking Metrobus. Despite the funding troubles, Metro planned to seek contractors in March 1982 for a $60 million contract to tunnel under the Anacostia River, a $60 million contract to build the Anacostia Station, and a $100 million contract to build the Navy Yard Station. But on March 16, 1982, Judge Ramsey barred Metro from spending any money {{on the construction of}} the Rosecroft Raceway route for the southern half of the Green Line. Judge Ramsey held that Metro had decided to shift the Green <b>Line</b> <b>route</b> without properly advertising the public hearings, which the transit system would now be required to hold (delaying construction of the Green Line and Anacostia Station by at least a year). Although Metro had advertised the hearings, Judge Ramsey said, the advertisements contained the same wording flaws that had precipitated the Maryland lawsuit. Metro subsequently scheduled new hearings for June 1982.|$|E
